The former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , and other members of Bush ’s administration conspired to fire US attorneys for political reasons , hire lawyers for the Justice Department based mainly on partisan loyalty rather than skill or experience , and ( worst of all ) decided which prosecutions to take to trial based on helping Republicans win elections and defeating Democrats .
In other words , they made a partisan farce of the Justice department .
But now , the new Attorney General , Michael Mukasey has decided to not prosecute anyone for any of this .
His explanation ?
“ Not every wrong , or even every violation of the law , is a crime . ”
If that were n’t bad enough , he said that the guilty parties have already been punished by “ substantial negative publicity . ”
The next time a politician talks about the need for personal responsibility , just remember that they are talking about other people — such things do n’t apply to them .

Project details Skill 1 out of 5 Easy Digging and carrying timbers requires some strength , but assembling the parts is simple .
Cost $ 200 Estimated Time 4 hours
Age Range : 6 to 12 years
Kids are fascinated with digging and playing in dirt .
Which is why a sandbox is a perfect alternative to the backyard mud pit .
Self - contained , free of debris , and easy to dig up with the most plastic of toys , a sandbox can keep kids occupied for hours .
And as This Old House landscape contractor Roger Cook shows here , building one is as straightforward as stacking lumber in a square , fastening it together , and filling it with sand — a feat that can be accomplished in an afternoon .
DIY Sandbox in 9 Steps
Step 1 : Cut the Wood
The timbers that make up the walls of the sandbox will butt end - to - side at the corners .
So to determine how long the timbers have to be , subtract 3 ½ inches ( the true width of a 4x4 ) from the length you want each side to be .
Using a circular saw , cut the timbers to these dimensions .
You will need 3 pieces for each side of the box .
Step 2 : Lay out the sandbox perimeter
Arrange four timbers in an outline of the sandbox , butting each timber 's end against the next timber 's side .
Using a spade or square - edged shovel , mark the sandbox 's outline by cutting vertically through the turf both inside and outside the loose - laid timbers ' perimeter .
Step 3 : Dig out the center of the box
Using a spade , dig down 6 inches within the outline of the sandbox .
Then add a 4 - inch - wide and 1 - inch - deep layer of sand inside the perimeter of the hole .
Tip :
If the area you 've chosen for your sandbox is not level , see instructions here for digging a flat - bottomed hole .
Step 4 : Lay the base course of the sandbox frame
Position the first course of timbers on top of the sand .
Push a framing square into each corner and adjust the timbers until they are perfectly square .
Hold each corner in this square position by bracing it with a scrap piece of 2x4 screwed down with 3 - inch decking screws .
Using a sledge and a 4 - foot level , gently tap each timber down into the sand until it is level .
Step 5 : Position the second course
Remove the 2x4 braces at the corners .
Lay the next course of timbers on top of the base course , but arrange them so they overlap at the corners in the opposite direction from the first course .
This will create a lapped pattern .
Step 6 : Tie the courses together
Using a drill / driver fitted with a nut - driver bit , drive 6 - inch timber screws down through the top course and into the timber beneath every 3 feet around the perimeter .
Step 7 : Line the box with landscape fabric
Lay landscape fabric along the inside of the box , allowing it to cover the bottom and overlap the second course of timbers .
Make sure to push the fabric against all of the edges and into the corners .
Step 8 : Lay the third timber course
Lay the third course of timbers on top of the second , overlapping the corners again .
Fasten them to the second course with timber screws ( as before ) .
Trim the excess fabric hanging over the outside of the box .
Step 9 : Fill the box with sand
Fill the interior with natural sand and dig -in !
To prevent rain and animals from getting into the box , cover it with a tarp held down with Velcro tape .

On its face , the Chrysler rescue was a huge success .
Under Lee Iacocca , the company came out with the K - car line of smaller vehicles , like the Dodge Aries , as well as the original minivan .
By the mid-’80s , Chrysler had repaid the loans .
Mr. Iacocca appeared on the cover of Time magazine as “ Detroit ’s comeback kid , ” and his autobiography became a No. 1 best seller .
You can draw a clear line from the Chrysler bailout to the recent attempts to steady Wall Street .
Back then , Washington insisted on a few pounds of flesh , like a wage freeze for Chrysler workers , in exchange for aid .
Mr. Paulson has done something similar by insisting that shareholders of the Wall Street firms benefit little from any bailout .
In 1979 , the government structured the Chrysler deal so that taxpayers might earn a profit from it ( which they did ) .
This year , the Fed effectively purchased securities from Bear Stearns that it hopes to sell for a gain when the financial markets calm down .
While it ’s way too early to know if the strategy will succeed as well as it did three decades ago , it ’s certainly conceivable .
But if you take a moment to think through the full Chrysler story , you start to realize that it ’s setting a really low bar .
The Chrysler bailout may have saved the company , but it did nothing , after all , to stop Detroit ’s long , sad decline .
Barry Ritholtz  who runs an equity research firm in New York and writes The Big Picture , one of the best - read economics blogs  is going to publish a book soon making the case that the bailout actually helped cause the decline .
The book is called , “ Bailout Nation . ”
In it , Mr. Ritholtz sketches out an intriguing alternative history of Chrysler and Detroit .
If Chrysler had collapsed , he argues , vulture investors might have swooped in and reconstituted the company as a smaller automaker less tied to the failed strategies of Detroit ’s Big Three and their unions .
“ If Chrysler goes belly up , ” he says , “ it also might have forced some deep introspection at Ford and G.M. and might have changed their attitude toward fuel efficiency and manufacturing quality . ”
Some of the bailout ’s opponents  from free - market conservatives to Senator Gary Hart , then a rising Democrat  were making similar arguments three decades ago .
Instead , the bailout and import quotas fooled the automakers into thinking they could keep doing business as usual .
In 1980 , Detroit sold about 80 percent of all new vehicles in this country , according to Autodata .
Today , it sells just 45 percent .
MoneyNews is reporting Retail Property , Vacancies Q2 Worst in 30 Years .
U.S. store closings and cutbacks turned the second quarter into the worst for strip mall owners in 30 years , as budget - conscious consumers flocked to low - cost warehouse - style grocery centers , according to a report by real estate research firm Reis .
Strip malls , which are usually anchored by grocery or drug stores , saw average vacancies spike 0.5 percentage points to 8.2 percent , a level unseen since 1995 , according to the report released on Monday .
Vacancies at regional malls rose 0.4 percentage points to 6.3 percent , the highest level since the first quarter of 2002 , according to the preliminary results .
For the first time since 1980 , more space became available to rent at strip malls than was rented out -- about 3.2 million square feet more .
Part of the available space came in the form of 5.7 million square feet of new development that came on the market during the quarter .

Stephen DeWitt , who oversees H. P. ’s personal computer business in the Americas , said that starting next year the company ’s new computers would point users to a Web site where they can buy and download games , productivity software and other programs .
Revenue from the site will be split in some fashion among H. P. , a retailer like Best Buy and the makers of the software .
Mr. DeWitt said the change would cut how much software comes preloaded .
Mr. DeWitt said this was happening because consumers were demanding something different , but also because the technology was now in place to allow downloading of software on demand .
For now , he said , the benefits to consumers of the free software far outweigh whatever small slowdown it might cause .
And he said Best Buy ’s cleanup service was not pressuring H. P. to move to a new model .
“ There ’s no tension coming from Best Buy on this  none , ” he said .
But in Best Buy stores in Northern California , there is clear evidence of the different agendas of Best Buy and the computer makers .
The stores display two H. P. computers , identical except that one desktop is cluttered with software icons from eBay , Quicken , AOL , Yahoo and others , while the other is entirely cleaned up .
Best Buy workers use the display to promote the company ’s $ 30 “ optimization ” service .
Industry analysts said that the planned change in H. P. ’s approach could well reflect Best Buy ’s growing influence  and its ability to exact new concessions from computer makers .
They said Best Buy has benefited from two key changes : the declining fortunes of competing retailers like CompUSA and some large regional chains , and the addition to its shelves in the last year of computers made by Dell and Apple .
Bob Kaufman , a spokesman for Dell , said , “ This is an evolving story and Dell is evaluating how it can best deliver software to its customers . ”
Best Buy ’s offer to remove software began in 2006 .
But recently the toll its policies are taking has heightened considerably , analysts and industry executives say .
There are many fine tools to help you create a color theme for your offline or online projects .
Adobe ’s Kuler was a late arrival but is a very slick web application for creating and sharing color themes .
You can view other users creations , or drag and drop yourself your own theme .
You ’re able to save , publish and tag your themes , even export your themes as swatches for use in Creative Suite 2 applications ( such as Illustrator or Photoshop ) .
ColorSchemer Studio is available for Windows users who can use the Color Wheel , Color Harmonies , or even Photo Schemer ( which allows you to build unique color themes based on any picture , image or photograph ) for creating color themes .
ColorSchemer is currently priced at $ 49 , well worth the price .
COLOURlovers is a personal favorite of mine , a great design community to create and compare color palettes , and read color related articles and interviews .
Whilst these tools are useful at exploring color trends and creating themes , they do n’t help with deciding what is an appropriate color base for your project .
What color should you use if you ’re trying to design something ‘ mellow ’ , or perhaps ‘ romantic ’ .
I created Cymbolism to answer just this question .
According to Wikipedia :
Many color theorists throughout history have attempted to assign colors to particular human emotions .
They believed that seeing particular colors caused particular emotions .
Others even created tests they claimed would divulge the personality of the participant .
Cymbolism attempts to quantify the association between colors and words , making it simple for designers to choose the best colors for the desired emotional effect .
Website visitors cast their votes on word - to - color associations by selecting a specific color when they are provided with a word and its description .
These votes are saved , and over time , users opinions are quantified , providing designers with statistics on word - to - color associations .
These statistics can then be used in choosing colors for your color themes .
These are not hard and fast rules , if everyone used to the same color for their projects things would look pretty boring .
You often want to break the current trend , but how do you know you ’re going against a trend if you know what the trend is !
The website was only recently launched and I ’m still in the process of adding appropriate words that visitors can vote on , please feel free to suggest any you do n’t find in our database .
As more users vote on words the more useful the information will be , so please spread the word and get voting !
Online gambling , much like videogames , is one of those industries that just keeps growing bigger and better with every year .
As technology improves and various companies and online casinos compete for their audience ’s attention , we keep seeing new and better stuff trying to woo us every single month – and if predictions and announcements hold true , then that trend will be alive and well in 2018 !
Just check out this constantly updated list of new online casinos and check out all of the casinos that are set to officially launch within the current year !
It ’s pretty crazy to think of just how much stuff we ’ve got to look forward to , including some really wild slots !
In the Playtech corner of the casino universe , I think it ’s fair to say that we lost some and we won some .
Late last year , all of the developer ’s beloved Marvel slots suddenly went down ( in a move that we absolutely should ’ve anticipated , given the fact that Playtech ’s contract expired back in 2013 ) , which was a pretty bad blow .
On the plus side , all of them are expected to return in 2018 as the “ Age of Gods ” series , which reskins them to make them about conveniently public domain Greek gods and not licensed Marvel superheroes .
On the other hand , we ’ve also got Playtech ’s VERY licensed DC slots , some of which released last year to critical acclaim , while others , such as “ Suicide Squad ” and “ Batman V Superman ” expected to release sometime this year .
The release of the “ Suicide Squad ” will also mark one of the very few times in which an Academy Award - winning motion picture was adapted into a slot machine .
On NetEnt ’s side , they ’ve already got a ton of slots announced through March of this year .
Their collaboration with Universal to bring some classic monsters to life in slot form already gave us hits like “ The Invisible Man ” , and is bound to bring us an adaptation of “ Phantom of the Opera ” in just a few weeks !
But the slot that I ’m personally most excited for is set to release in March .
Its original title was “ Miami Pursuit ” , but has since been changed to “ Hotline ” .
It ’s really not hard to figure out that the slot will be based on the videogame “ Hotline Miami ” , which offers a brutal , yet stylistically brilliant romp throughout 80s Miami .
While I do n’t expect this to be a straight adaptation of the game , I definitely expect this to be the most purple slot of 2018 .
Alas , Microgaming comes dead - last on the hype - o- meter , since they ’ve only announced one slot so far – “ Lucky Little Gods ” , which is set to come out in early February , and honestly , does n’t look all that revolutionary .
While their recently released “ Highlander ” slot makes an implicit promise of great things to come , I ’m afraid that right now we just do n’t know that much of Microgaming ’s plans for the year .
Still , I ’m sure that by the time “ Lucky Little Gods ” releases we ’ll have a more comprehensive idea of what to expect from the developer , since they tend to release their schedules a bit later than their competitors .
Until then , we ’re going to have to remain content with using our imaginations .
Here ’s hoping they ’re able to live up to the hype !
And if they do n’t , well , there ’s always NetEnt ’s “ Hotline ” to keep us satisfied this year .
Snipes starred in films such as Blade , Passenger 57 and Demolition Man
Film star Wesley Snipes should spend three years in prison and be fined $ 5 m ( £ 2.5 m ) for tax evasion , US prosecutors have said .
The actor was found guilty in February of failing to submit tax returns , although he was cleared of more serious charges , including fraud .
Prosecutors have now recommended that he faced the maximum penalty for a " brazen defiance " of US tax laws .
The Blade star will be sentenced on 24 April .
He was not available to comment .
In court papers filed on Monday , US Attorney Robert O'Neill pressed for the maximum penalty because , he said , the case provided a " singular opportunity " to " deter tax crime nationwide " .
" For nearly a decade , Snipes has engaged in a campaign of criminal tax conduct , combining brazen defiance with insidious concealment , " a US Department of Justice statement said .
' Fraudulent harm '
" Snipes has escaped paying more than $ 15 m ( £ 7.6 m ) in income tax to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , and has pursued an intended fraudulent harm to the United States Treasury of more than $ 41 m ( £ 20.8 m ) . "
At his trial in January , lawyers for the film star admitted he had been " dead wrong " and should have to pay the money back .
But they denied any crime had been committed , saying Mr Snipes had been open with the government about what he was doing .
" Disagreement with the IRS is not fraud of the IRS , is not deception , " argued defence lawyer Robert Barnes .
The actor 's first role was in Goldie Hawn 's 1986 American football comedy Wildcats , and he later appeared in the video for Michael Jackson 's Bad , which was directed by Martin Scorsese .
He also appeared in hit films such as White Men Can't Jump , Passenger 57 and the Blade trilogy .

Researchers led by Brown geologist Alberto Saal analyzed lunar volcanic glasses , such these gathered by the Apollo 15 mission , and used a new analytic technique to detect water .
The discovery strongly suggests that water has been a part of the Moon since its early existence – and perhaps since it was first created .
Waterhas been found conclusively for the first time inside ancient moon samplesbrought back by Apollo astronauts .
The discovery may force scientists to rethinkthe lunar past and future , although uncertainty remains about how much waterexists and whether future explorers could extract it .
Thewater was found inside volcanic glass beads , which represent solidified magmafrom the early moon ?s interior .
The news swept through much of the scientificcommunity even before being detailed in the journal Nature this week .
? Thisreally appears to have changed the rules of the game , ? said Robin Canup , astrophysicist and director of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo. , who was not part of the team that made the discovery .
?
The assumptionhas been that the moon is dry .?
Revisinglunar history
Scientistshave long assumed the moon was dry because of its violent birth roughly 4.5 billion years ago .
The leading theory holds that a Mars - sized planet smashed into Earth and tore off moltenpieces that eventually formed into the moon .
Most scientiststhought that any water in the developing lunar body would have vaporized and beenlost to space .
? Ifthere was a lot of water in the early moon , then that is new for sure , ?
saidBen Bussey , a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University AppliedPhysics Laboratory who also was not involved in the new study .
?
People willhave to think about that when they think about how the moon evolved .?
Theearlier thinking about the moon ?s lack of water meant researchers struggled toeven get funding to search for counter - evidence .
? Ithought that if we were really lucky we would get to see it , ? said AlbertoSaal , a geochemist at Brown University and lead author on the Naturestudy .
?
Like everybody else , I was thinking our chances were low .?
Adelicate proposal
Saal ? sgroup examined lunar samples brought back from the Apollo missions of the 1960 sand 1970s .
The glass beads range in color from green to yellow - brown to red , depending on their elemental chemistry .
Suchbeads formed from droplets of molten lava that spewed from fire fountains reachingdown deep within the primitive lunar interior .
Saal ?s group measured the beads ' elemental makeup to ensure they came from lunar volcanic activity and not fromthe impact event that formed the moon .
Theresearchers also ruled out the chance that such beads could have becomecontaminated by outside forces such as hydrogen — an element of water — fromthe solar wind .
Othershad tried and failed earlier to find water in similar samples , but one of Saal ? scollaborators had developed improved detection methods using a technique calledsecondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) .
? Forthe past four decades , the limit for detecting water in lunar samples was about50 parts per million ( ppm ) at best , ? said Erik Hauri , geochemist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington , D.C. and co-author on the study .
?
Wedeveloped a way to detect as little as 5 ppm of water .?
Thegroup found up to 46 ppm of water within the glass beads .
Saal and hiscollaborators then used modeling to estimate how much water originally existedin the magma within the moon ?s interior , knowing some water would have escapedthe molten droplets as a gas on the surface .
Thatled to estimates that the glass beads may contain 745 ppm of water — strikingly similar to solidified lava thatcame up from the Earth ?s upper mantle through undersea vents .
However , Saal ? sgroup gives 260 ppm of water as the most certain figure for now .
Followthe water
Justfinding water at all could lead to a sea- change in how scientists view the earlymoon — either the moon held onto water from Earth during its violent creation , or else water gathered from elsewhere within 100 million years of the impactevent as the moon solidified .
Modelingdone on the Earth impact event suggests that our planet would have held ontomuch of its water , Canup explained .
But such models say little about how muchthe moon could have held onto , and other questions remain unanswered even fromthis latest study .
? Themajor uncertainty I see is whether they ?re sampling something that tells usabout the bulk composition of the moon , or whether they have sampled materialsproduced by a more limited water - rich part of the moon ?s interior , ?
Canup said .
Knowingwhether water is highly abundant or relatively scarce within the moon couldalso have implications for lunar exploration , but not for near - future missionssuch as NASA ?s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) and Lunar Crater Observationand Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) .
The latter mission is slated to crash two spacecraft into the moon ? s southpole in early 2009 , in an attempt to find evidence of water ice hidden in thelunar craters .
Anysurface water ice likely formed fromcomets and other external bodies crashing into the moon and releasing theirwater , Bussey said , although he acknowledged the chance that some water vapordrifted to the poles during the moon ?s early history .
Saal ? sgroup will attempt to clear up some of those questions as they examine samplesfrom more Apollo missions .
For now , their work stands as an example ofcontinuing to squeeze science out of an unexpected link between the past andfuture .
? Ithink it ?s exciting that you keep getting results out of the Apollo samples .?
Bussey said .

CDC Recommends Shingles Vaccine
People age 60 and older should be vaccinated against shingles , or herpes zoster , a condition often marked by debilitating chronic pain , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) recommended today .
CDC recommends a single dose of the zoster vaccine , Zostavax , for adults 60 years of age and older even if they have had a prior episode of shingles .
The new full recommendation replaces a provisional recommendation that the CDC made in 2006 , after the vaccine was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the CDCâ€™s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , a committee of immunization experts who advise CDC on immunization policy .
The recommendation was published in an early release electronic edition of CDCâ€™s Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report ( MMWR ) Recommendations and Reports .
The ACIP recommendation becomes CDC policy once it is published in the MMWR .
Researchers found that , overall , in those ages 60 and above the vaccine reduced the occurrence of shingles by about 50 percent .
For individuals ages 60 - 69 it reduced occurrence by 64 percent .
The most common side effects in people who received Zostavax were redness , pain and tenderness , swelling at the site of injection , itching and headache .
Over 95 percent of people are infected by the varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) , during their lifetime .
The virus causes the common childhood disease chickenpox and then becomes dormant within the nerves .
If it reactivates later in life , the result can be shingles .
Shingles is characterized by clusters of blisters , which develop on one side of the body in a band - like pattern and can cause severe pain that may last for weeks , months or years .
About one in three persons will develop shingles during their lifetimes , resulting in about one million cases of shingles per year .
Chickenpox ( also called varicella ) is usually mild , but it can be serious , especially in young infants and adults .
Children who have never had chickenpox should get two doses of chickenpox vaccine starting at 12 months of age .
The risk of contracting shingles increases with age starting at around 50 , and is highest in the elderly .
Half of people living to age 85 have had or will get shingles .
The risk of experiencing chronic pain also increases with age .
Shingles Facts
Anyone who has had chicken pox can get shingles .
That means 95 percent of adults are at risk .
Approximately one - third of the U.S. population will get shingles .
More than half of older adults do not understand the seriousness of shingles and its complications .
Among those who get shingles , more than one - third will develop serious complications .
The risk of complications rises after 60 years of age .
Appropriate and immediate treatment of herpes zoster can control acute symptoms and reduce the risk of longer term complications .
Starting anti-viral medication within 72 hours of the onset of shingles can reduce the pain and the length of time the outbreak lasts .

Osama bin Laden 's driver Salim Hamdan was convicted at Guantánamo Bay yesterday – in his second trial at the hands of the Bush administration .
Had his first in 2004 not been interrupted by a successful appeal to the Supreme Court , he would have been acquitted .
For what he has been found guilty of – providing material support to terrorism – was not then under the jurisdiction of the military tribunal that has sentenced him .
Such is justice under George W. Bush .
Such is the justice that awaits Omar Khadr and 80 others to be tried by the special military tribunals at Guantánamo .
More than the detainees , though , it is the Bush administration that 's on trial .
Thus the United States is on trial .
There , the verdict is already in : Guilty .
Guilty of torturing detainees .
Guilty of obtaining evidence from torture .
Guilty of introducing hearsay evidence in trials .
Guilty of hiding evidence from the detainees .
Guilty , therefore , of violating the most basic norms of the rule of law – and betraying American values .
It 's precisely because of all of the above that Bush concocted his kangaroo courts , avoiding both the civilian courts and the military courts martial , both of which would have ensured due process .
" It all stems from the administration 's decision to endorse torture , " says Jameel Jaffer , a Canadian who directs the American Civil Liberties Union 's national security project .
" These tribunals are the fruit of that poisonous tree .
" Once the decision was made to use torture , the administration needed a system of rules that would allow them to rely on evidence obtained from torture .
Thus these military commissions . "
But what happens in these trials is almost irrelevant .
The process is discredited .
It is seen as illegitimate by much of the world , including a majority of Canadians and an increasing number of Americans .
As for the Muslim world , where the war against terrorism counts the most , it will engender even more fury .
When Bush opened Guantánamo in 2002 to house the prisoners captured in Afghanistan and elsewhere , he declared them to be " unlawful enemy combatants . "
He stripped them of their Geneva Convention rights and also argued that they be denied habeas corpus , the old principle that a prisoner must be brought before a court to justify his detention .
In 2004 , the Supreme Court ruled that the detainees did have that right .
But Bush got the Republican - controlled Congress to pass the Detainee Treatment Act ( 2005 ) , stripping the detainees of habeas corpus .
In 2006 , the Supreme Court ruled that Bush did not have the authority to set aside the Geneva Conventions when he set up his 2002 military commissions .
But Congress granted him just such authority , passing the Military Commissions Act .
It essentially resurrected his military commission system , authorizing them to prosecute for terrorist crimes , including the provision on which Hamdan has now been convicted .
Bush has had two tracks going at Guantánamo : one for those charged with war crimes and another , through the Combatant Status Review Tribunals , for those who have n't been charged and may never be .

The latter was ostensibly an alternative to habeas corpus .
Except that it was n't .
The detainees could not have legal counsel .
They could not have access to evidence either .
The system was so rigged that a military member of one of the panel quit , saying the tribunals were a farce and , in some instances , fixed .
A study done by Seton Hall University School of Law – " No- hearing Hearings " – was instructive .
Of the 102 tribunal hearings it analyzed , only three led to the detainees being declared " no longer enemy combatant . "
( The Bush administration , averse to admitting a mistake , would not say that a person was never an enemy combatant . )
Even in those three cases , the Pentagon ordered a new tribunal and the detainee was duly deemed an enemy combatant .
In one , the detainee was found to be " no longer an enemy combatant " by two tribunals , so a third was convened and it found him to be an enemy combatant .
Meanwhile , another court challenge on behalf of the detainees was making its way to the Supreme Court .
In June , it ruled that Bush 's tribunals were not an adequate alternative to habeas corpus .
Yet the sham trials continue .
Jaffer : " The most absurd thing is that if , by some miracle , Hamdan had been found guilty on all counts , acquittal would n't have meant liberty .
He 'd have just been moved to a different cell .
The trial was essentially meaningless because the administration takes the position that it has the right to hold enemy combatants until the end of the war on terror , whether or not they have been convicted of crimes . "
All this is tragic .
Some of the defendants may have committed horrendous crimes .
Yet their sentences will carry little or no moral authority .
This would n't have been the case had the administration gone through ordinary courts or the courts martial system .
The American criminal justice system has been perfectly capable of dealing with complicated terrorism cases .
The perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were prosecuted in the courts .
In the post - 9/11 period , Richard Reid ( the shoe bomber ) , Zacarias Moussaoui ( 9/11 co-conspirator ) and Joe Padilla ( the dirty bomber ) were all prosecuted by the courts and are in jail .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Plans for the biggest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere received final California state approval on Friday , clearing the way for construction to start next year and for the plant to open north of San Diego in 2011 .
The California State Lands Commission , which unanimously approved the plant at a meeting in Los Angeles , was the last hurdle before construction can begin .
The $ 300 million plant will turn seawater from a lagoon off Carlsbad into 50 million gallons of drinking water daily , enough to supply about 110,000 households and about 10 percent of the needs of San Diego County , home to 3 million people .
Desalination is common in the Middle East , but large - scale plants are rare in the United States and Western Hemisphere .
There are about 22,000 desalination plants in 120 countries , which together produce about 3 billion gallons per day .
Carlsbad is the first of what is expected to be a wave of approvals for desalination plants in California , where about 20 plants are in various stages of planning .
“ This is a historic day for the state of California , ” said Peter MacLaggan , senior vice president for Poseidon Resources , the Connecticut - based company behind the Carlsbad plant .
Poseidon is also developing a plant of a similar size in Huntington Beach to the north .
Carlsbad will be twice the size of the current largest U.S. plant , on Tampa Bay in Florida .
California officials have set a goal for desalinated water production by 2030 equal to about 10 times the output of the Carlsbad plant .
California Department of Water Resources Director Lester Snow said this week the Carlsbad approval was “ essential . ”
“ Desalination will probably never be a major portion of the water supply , but it ’s going to be a critical part of a portfolio of a reliable supply , ” Snow said .
The Carlsbad plant will not be ready in time for next year , when there will likely be the biggest drought in state history unless lots of snow falls in the Sierra mountains this winter , he said .
California Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , who is a member of the lands commission , said the plant would make much - needed supply for the San Diego area and replace diminishing supply from the Colorado River and the mountains of Northern California .
The costs of turning salt water into drinking water were about two - and - a - half - times higher 10 years ago .
The lower cost and better technology makes the next wave of plants possible , said Scott Maloni , vice president of Poseidon .
The Carlsbad plant will be built by a unit of Spain ’s Acciona .
The Huntington Beach plant will be built by IDE Technologies , which is jointly owned by Israel Chemicals and Israeli conglomerate Delek Group .
A blood test currently used as the gold standard for monitoring people already under care for diabetes may have far wider use in identifying millions with undetected diabetes , a team led by a Johns Hopkins physician suggests .
The hemoglobin A1 c test ( HbA1 c ) , based on a blood sample , is widely used to keep tabs on how well confirmed diabetics keep their blood sugar , or glucose , in check by showing how much glucose red blood cells have been exposed to for the past 120 days , the average lifespan of these cells .
" The test is a measure of long - term glucose control , but doctors do n't typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease , " says Christopher Saudek , M.D. , professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Diabetes Center .
" There 's reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the U.S. who have diabetes but do n't know it , " he adds .
The current screening and diagnostic tests measure only the amount of sugar present at the moment that blood sample is taken .
Consequently , Saudek says , these tests are accurate only if patients fast for at least 10 hours before the test because glucose concentrations can vary greatly depending on a person 's recent meals .
Even then , explains Saudek , the tests miss a significant portion of people who have diabetes or are at high risk to develop the disease since glucose also varies depending on a person 's diet and exercise regimen for several days leading up to the blood draw .
" If a patient is scheduled for a physical , he or she may ' tune up ' by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results , causing doctors to miss the patient 's usual pattern of high blood sugar , " he says .
In a consensus statement published in the July Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism , Saudek and his colleagues conclude that the HbA1 c test should be used as a front - line method for identifying patients with diabetes , especially for those at high risk for the disease .
Since the test does not require fasting and is n't affected by short - term changes in diet and exercise , the HbA1 c test has significant advantages to current testing methods .
The consensus was reached by a group of diabetologists , pathologists and internists seeking to improve detection methods because of the serious consequences of untreated diabetes for patients and public health .
They met recently in Chicago with financial support from Metrika Inc. , a major manufacturer of diabetes testing equipment .
The panel deliberations and manuscript preparation were made independently of the sponsor , according to its members .
After reviewing relevant published studies and available tests , the national panel recommended that individuals who score at least 6 percent on an HbA1 c test may have or be at risk for diabetes and should be tracked with additional glucose or HbA1 c tests .
Those who score between 6.5 percent or above , if confirmed , should be considered to have diabetes .
" This is a first step towards changing medical practice , " notes Saudek , and " could greatly enhance how well we 're able to identify people with diabetes . "
Others who contributed to the consensus statement include William H. Herman of the University of Michigan School of Medicine , David B. Sacks of Brigham & Women 's Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Richard M. Bergenstal of the International Diabetes Center , David Edelman of Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center and Duke University , and Mayer B. Davidson of Charles R. Drew University .

The presidential campaign is getting nasty in its last 100 days .
Actually , that ’s not a surprise .
The campaigns always do .
They always have , going back to the days of the early Republic .
They probably always will .
It is a mistake to expect intelligent discussion of the issues in a political campaign .
Even if such a discussion took place , the press would probably ignore it as being too dull to bother with .
People like to say they do n’t approve of negative campaigning , but that ’s one of those cases where words and reality do n’t match .
American campaigns feature demagoguery , and there is a fairly well - thought - out reason for it .
Years ago , a manual for winning elections explained that modern campaigns are aimed at what is called the " apathetic middle . "
The theory is that there are a certain percentage of people who will vote Democrat no matter what and a certain percentage who will vote Republican no matter who is on the ticket .
Usually these hard - core partisans are not enough to constitute a majority .
Each candidate therefore strives to get enough of the apathetic voters to add to his partisan base and achieve a majority .
Since these people in the apathetic middle do n’t really care that much about voting or politics or the issues facing the country , the candidates resort to demagoguery , which in modern times is often a collection of promises : " I will win the war , reduce the price of gasoline , balance the budget , fix Social Security and Medicare , stop global warming and see that every American has a decent job . "
Couched negatively , " My opponent will lose the war , is responsible for high gasoline prices , will spend us into bankruptcy and will do nothing to fix Social Security or stop global warming . "
Well , at least these days our candidates do n’t have to fight duels .
Andrew Jackson ’s opponents conspired to get him into a duel with an expert marksman who had killed 20 or more opponents .
Fortunately , Jackson survived .
Alexander Hamilton was killed by Aaron Burr .
Both men were Revolutionary War heroes .
Terrible things were said about both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson during their campaigns .
So , comparatively speaking , Sen . John McCain ’s claim that Barack Obama would rather shoot hoops than visit wounded troops is rather mild , though false .
Another example candidates have to remember are the speeches of Brutus and Marc Antony in Shakespeare ’s " Julius Caesar . "
After Caesar ’s assassination , Brutus makes a factual , well - reasoned speech .
Antony demagogues the heck out of it , and the mob goes after Brutus .
As injurious to the commonweal as demagoguery is , reason has a difficult time competing against it .
American elections seem to be decided on the basis of emotions fueled by demagoguery , not reason .
Look at the last one .
George Bush , who spent the war safe in the Texas National Guard , convinced Americans that he would be a better commander in chief than John Kerry , who had earned medals for bravery in combat .
Kerry ’s anti-war rhetoric after he came home from Vietnam came back to haunt him .
It ’s quite clear that the Republican strategy for this election is to attack Obama as inexperienced , unpatriotic and possibly dangerous .
It might work , provided McCain does n’t go bonkers in public or ramble on about his grandchildren during the debates .
Obama may well play Brutus to the Republicans ’
Antony - like mud machine , proving once again that intellectual explanations can’t compete with snappy sound bites .
I disagree with much of what Obama believes , and I ’m afraid McCain might wake up grouchy one morning and start World War III .
Like everyone else , though , I ’m stuck with the choice our two worn - out , dysfunctional political parties have given us .
Ah , well , the Earth is still a beautiful place .
Let us all smell the roses while we may .
No matter who wins , there ’s not likely to be any great changes .

Sorry , But Your Soul Just Died
Tom Wolfe
From neuroscience to Nietzsche .
A sobering look at how man may perceive himself in the future , particularly as ideas about genetic predeterminism takes the place of dying Darwinism .
This article was first published in " Forbes ASAP " in 1996 .
Being a bit behind the curve , I had only just heard of the digital revolution last February when Louis Rossetto , cofounder of Wired magazine , wearing a shirt with no collar and his hair as long as Felix Mendelssohn's , looking every inch the young California visionary , gave a speech before the Cato Institute announcing the dawn of the twenty –first century 's digital civilization .
As his text , he chose the maverick Jesuit scientist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin , who fifty years ago prophesied that radio , television , and computers would create a " no�sphere , " an electronic membrane covering the earth and wiring all humanity together in a single nervous system .
Geographic locations , national boundaries , the old notions of markets and political processes — all would become irrelevant .
With the Internet spreading over the globe at an astonishing pace , said Rossetto , that marvelous modem–driven moment is almost at hand .
Could be .
But something tells me that within ten years , by 2006 , the entire digital universe is going to seem like pretty mundane stuff compared to a new technology that right now is but a mere glow radiating from a tiny number of American and Cuban ( yes , Cuban ) hospitals and laboratories .
It is called brain imaging , and anyone who cares to get up early and catch a truly blinding twenty –first–century dawn will want to keep an eye on it .
Brain imaging refers to techniques for watching the human brain as it functions , in real time .
The most advanced forms currently are three –dimensional electroencephalography using mathematical models ; the more familiar PET scan ( positron–emission tomography ) ; the new fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) , which shows brain blood –flow patterns , and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) , which measures biochemical changes in the brain ; and the even newer PET reporter gene / PET reporter probe , which is , in fact , so new that it still has that length of heavy lumber for a name .
Used so far only in animals and a few desperately sick children , the PET reporter gene / PET reporter probe pinpoints and follows the activity of specific genes .
On a scanner screen you can actually see the genes light up inside the brain .
By 1996 standards , these are sophisticated devices .
Ten years from now , however , they may seem primitive compared to the stunning new windows into the brain that will have been developed .
Brain imaging was invented for medical diagnosis .
But its far greater importance is that it may very well confirm , in ways too precise to be disputed , certain theories about " the mind , " " the self , " " the soul , " and " free will " that are already devoutly believed in by scholars in what is now the hottest field in the academic world , neuroscience .
Granted , all those skeptical quotation marks are enough to put anybody on the qui vive right away , but Ultimate Skepticism is part of the brilliance of the dawn I have promised .
Neuroscience , the science of the brain and the central nervous system , is on the threshold of a unified theory that will have an impact as powerful as that of Darwinism a hundred years ago .
Already there is a new Darwin , or perhaps I should say an updated Darwin , since no one ever believed more religiously in Darwin I than he does .
His name is Edward O. Wilson .
He teaches zoology at Harvard , and he is the author of two books of extraordinary influence , The Insect Societies and Sociobiology : The New Synthesis .
Not " A " new synthesis but " The " new synthesis ; in terms of his stature in neuroscience , it is not a mere boast .
Wilson has created and named the new field of sociobiology , and he has compressed its underlying premise into a single sentence .
Every human brain , he says , is born not as a blank tablet ( a tabula rasa ) waiting to be filled in by experience but as " an exposed negative waiting to be slipped into developer fluid . "
You can develop the negative well or you can develop it poorly , but either way you are going to get precious little that is not already imprinted on the film .
The print is the individual 's genetic history , over thousands of years of evolution , and there is not much anybody can do about it .
Furthermore , says Wilson , genetics determine not only things such as temperament , role preferences , emotional responses , and levels of aggression , but also many of our most revered moral choices , which are not choices at all in any free–will sense but tendencies imprinted in the hypothalamus and limbic regions of the brain , a concept expanded upon in 1993 in a much–talked –about book , The Moral Sense , by James Q. Wilson ( no kin to Edward O. ) .
The neuroscientific view of life
This , the neuroscientific view of life , has become the strategic high ground in the academic world , and the battle for it has already spread well beyond the scientific disciplines and , for that matter , out into the general public .
Both liberals and conservatives without a scientific bone in their bodies are busy trying to seize the terrain .
The gay rights movement , for example , has fastened onto a study published in July of 1993 by the highly respected Dean Hamer of the National Institutes of Health , announcing the discovery of " the gay gene . "
Obviously , if homosexuality is a genetically determined trait , like left –handedness or hazel eyes , then laws and sanctions against it are attempts to legislate against Nature .
Conservatives , meantime , have fastened upon studies indicating that men's and women 's brains are wired so differently , thanks to the long haul of evolution , that feminist attempts to open up traditionally male roles to women are the same thing : a doomed violation of Nature .
Wilson himself has wound up in deep water on this score ; or cold water , if one need edit .
In his personal life Wilson is a conventional liberal , PC , as the saying goes — he is , after all , a member of the Harvard faculty — concerned about environmental issues and all the usual things .
But he has said that " forcing similar role identities " on both men and women " flies in the face of thousands of years in which mammals demonstrated a strong tendency for sexual division of labor .
Since this division of labor is persistent from hunter–gatherer through agricultural and industrial societies , it suggests a genetic origin .
We do not know when this trait evolved in human evolution or how resistant it is to the continuing and justified pressures for human rights . "
" Resistant " was Darwin II , the neuroscientist , speaking .
" Justified " was the PC Harvard liberal .
He was not PC or liberal enough .
Feminist protesters invaded a conference where Wilson was appearing , dumped a pitcher of ice water , cubes and all , over his head , and began chanting , " You 're all wet !
You 're all wet ! "
The most prominent feminist in America , Gloria Steinem , went on television and , in an interview with John Stossel of ABC , insisted that studies of genetic differences between male and female nervous systems should cease forthwith .
But that turned out to be mild stuff in the current political panic over neuroscience .
In February of 1992 , Frederick K. Goodwin , a renowned psychiatrist , head of the federal Alcohol , Drug Abuse , and Mental Health Administration , and a certified yokel in the field of public relations , made the mistake of describing , at a public meeting in Washington , the National Institute of Mental Health 's ten–year–old Violence Initiative .
This was an experimental program whose hypothesis was that , as among monkeys in the jungle — Goodwin was noted for his monkey studies — much of the criminal mayhem in the United States was caused by a relatively few young males who were genetically predisposed to it ; who were hardwired for violent crime , in short .
Out in the jungle , among mankind 's closest animal relatives , the chimpanzees , it seemed that a handful of genetically twisted young males were the ones who committed practically all of the wanton murders of other males and the physical abuse of females .
What if the same were true among human beings ?
What if , in any given community , it turned out to be a handful of young males with toxic DNA who were pushing statistics for violent crime up to such high levels ?
The Violence Initiative envisioned identifying these individuals in childhood , somehow , some way , someday , and treating them therapeutically with drugs .
The notion that crime–ridden urban America was a " jungle , " said Goodwin , was perhaps more than just a tired old metaphor .
That did it .
That may have been the stupidest single word uttered by an American public official in the year 1992 .
The outcry was immediate .
Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative John Dingell of Michigan ( who , it became obvious later , suffered from hydrophobia when it came to science projects ) not only condemned Goodwin 's remarks as racist but also delivered their scientific verdict : Research among primates " is a preposterous basis " for analyzing anything as complex as " the crime and violence that plagues our country today . "
( This came as surprising news to NASA scientists who had first trained and sent a chimpanzee called Ham up on top of a Redstone rocket into suborbital space flight and then trained and sent another one , called Enos , which is Greek for " man , " up on an Atlas rocket and around the earth in orbital space flight and had thereby accurately and completely predicted the physical , psychological , and task–motor responses of the human astronauts , Alan Shepard and John Glenn , who repeated the chimpanzees ' flights and tasks months later . )
The Violence Initiative was compared to Nazi eugenic proposals for the extermination of undesirables .
Dingell 's Michigan colleague , Representative John Conyers , then chairman of the Government Operations Committee and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus , demanded Goodwin 's resignation — and got it two days later , whereupon the government , with the Department of Health and Human Services now doing the talking , denied that the Violence Initiative had ever existed .
It disappeared down the memory hole , to use Orwell 's term .
A conference of criminologists and other academics interested in the neuroscientific studies done so far for the Violence Initiative — a conference underwritten in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health — had been scheduled for May of 1993 at the University of Maryland .
Down went the conference , too ; the NIH drowned it like a kitten .
Last year , a University of Maryland legal scholar named David Wasserman tried to reassemble the troops on the QT , as it were , in a hall all but hidden from human purview in a hamlet called Queenstown in the foggy , boggy boondocks of Queen Annes County on Maryland 's Eastern Shore .
The NIH , proving it was a hard learner , quietly provided $ 133,000 for the event but only after Wasserman promised to fireproof the proceedings by also inviting scholars who rejected the notion of a possible genetic genesis of crime and scheduling a cold–shower session dwelling on the evils of the eugenics movement of the early twentieth century .
No use , boys !
An army of protesters found the poor cringing devils anyway and stormed into the auditorium chanting , " Maryland conference , you can't hide — we know you 're pushing genocide ! "
It took two hours for them to get bored enough to leave , and the conference ended in a complete muddle with the specially recruited fireproofing PC faction issuing a statement that said : " Scientists as well as historians and sociologists must not allow themselves to provide academic respectability for racist pseudoscience . "
Today , at the NIH , the term Violence Initiative is a synonym for taboo .
The present moment resembles that moment in the Middle Ages when the Catholic Church forbade the dissection of human bodies , for fear that what was discovered inside might cast doubt on the Christian doctrine that God created man in his own image .
Even more radio–active is the matter of intelligence , as measured by IQ tests .
Privately — not many care to speak out — the vast majority of neuroscientists believe the genetic component of an individual 's intelligence is remarkably high .
Your intelligence can be improved upon , by skilled and devoted mentors , or it can be held back by a poor upbringing — i.e. , the negative can be well developed or poorly developed — but your genes are what really make the difference .
The recent ruckus over Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein's The Bell Curve is probably just the beginning of the bitterness the subject is going to create .
Not long ago , according to two neuroscientists I interviewed , a firm called Neurometrics sought out investors and tried to market an amazing but simple invention known as the IQ Cap .
The idea was to provide a way of testing intelligence that would be free of " cultural bias , " one that would not force anyone to deal with words or concepts that might be familiar to people from one culture but not to people from another .
The IQ Cap recorded only brain waves ; and a computer , not a potentially biased human test–giver , analyzed the results .
It was based on the work of neuroscientists such as E. Roy John 1 , who is now one of the major pioneers of electroencephalographic brain imaging ; Duilio Giannitrapani , author of The Electrophysiology of Intellectual Functions ; and David Robinson , author of The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Personality Assessment : Toward a Biologically Based Theory of Intelligence and Cognition and many other monographs famous among neuroscientists .
I spoke to one researcher who had devised an IQ Cap himself by replicating an experiment described by Giannitrapani in The Electrophysiology of Intellectual Functions .
It was not a complicated process .
You attached sixteen electrodes to the scalp of the person you wanted to test .
You had to muss up his hair a little , but you did n't have to cut it , much less shave it .
Then you had him stare at a marker on a blank wall .
This particular researcher used a raspberry–red thumbtack .
Then you pushed a toggle switch .
In sixteen seconds the Cap 's computer box gave you an accurate prediction ( within one –half of a standard deviation ) of what the subject would score on all eleven subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale or , in the case of children , the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children — all from sixteen seconds ' worth of brain waves .
There was nothing culturally biased about the test whatsoever .
What could be cultural about staring at a thumbtack on a wall ?
The savings in time and money were breathtaking .
The conventional IQ test took two hours to complete ; and the overhead , in terms of paying test–givers , test–scorers , test–preparers , and the rent , was $ 100 an hour at the very least .
The IQ Cap required about fifteen minutes and sixteen seconds — it took about fifteen minutes to put the electrodes on the scalp — and about a tenth of a penny 's worth of electricity .
Neurometrics 's investors were rubbing their hands and licking their chops .
They were about to make a killing .
In fact — nobody wanted their damnable IQ Cap !
It was n't simply that no one believed you could derive IQ scores from brainwaves — it was that nobody wanted to believe it could be done .
Nobody wanted to believe that human brainpower is ... that hardwired .
Nobody wanted to learn in a flash that ... the genetic fix is in .
Nobody wanted to learn that he was ... a hardwired genetic mediocrity ... and that the best he could hope for in this Trough of Mortal Error was to live out his mediocre life as a stress–free dim bulb .
Barry Sterman of UCLA , chief scientist for a firm called Cognitive Neurometrics , who has devised his own brain –wave technology for market research and focus groups , regards brain–wave IQ testing as possible — but in the current atmosphere you " would n't have a Chinaman 's chance of getting a grant " to develop it .
Science is a court from which there is no appeal
Here we begin to sense the chill that emanates from the hottest field in the academic world .
The unspoken and largely unconscious premise of the wrangling over neuroscience 's strategic high ground is :
We now live in an age in which science is a court from which there is no appeal .
And the issue this time around , at the end of the twentieth century , is not the evolution of the species , which can seem a remote business , but the nature of our own precious inner selves .
The elders of the field , such as Wilson , are well aware of all this and are cautious , or cautious compared to the new generation .
Wilson still holds out the possibility — I think he doubts it , but he still holds out the possibility — that at some point in evolutionary history , culture began to influence the development of the human brain in ways that cannot be explained by strict Darwinian theory .
But the new generation of neuroscientists are not cautious for a second .
In private conversations , the bull sessions , as it were , that create the mental atmosphere of any hot new science — and I love talking to these people — they express an uncompromising determinism .
They start with the most famous statement in all of modern philosophy , Descartes 's " Cogito ergo sum , " " I think , therefore I am , " which they regard as the essence of " dualism , " the old–fashioned notion that the mind is something distinct from its mechanism , the brain and the body .
( I will get to the second most famous statement in a moment . )
This is also known as the " ghost in the machine " fallacy , the quaint belief that there is a ghostly " self " somewhere inside the brain that interprets and directs its operations .
Neuroscientists involved in three –dimensional electroencephalography will tell you that there is not even any one place in the brain where consciousness or self –consciousness ( Cogito ergo sum ) is located .
This is merely an illusion created by a medley of neurological systems acting in concert .
The young generation takes this yet one step further .
Since consciousness and thought are entirely physical products of your brain and nervous system — and since your brain arrived fully imprinted at birth — what makes you think you have free will ?
Where is it going to come from ?
What " ghost , " what " mind , " what " self , " what " soul , " what anything that will not be immediately grabbed by those scornful quotation marks , is going to bubble up your brain stem to give it to you ?
I have heard neuroscientists theorize that , given computers of sufficient power and sophistication , it would be possible to predict the course of any human being 's life moment by moment , including the fact that the poor devil was about to shake his head over the very idea .
I doubt that any Calvinist of the sixteenth century ever believed so completely in predestination as these , the hottest and most intensely rational young scientists in the United States at the end of the twentieth .
Since the late 1970s , in the Age of Wilson , college students have been heading into neuroscience in job lots .
The Society for Neuroscience was founded in 1970 with 1,100 members .
Today , one generation later , its membership exceeds 26,000 .
The Society 's latest convention , in San Diego , drew 23,052 souls , making it one of the biggest professional conventions in the country .
In the venerable field of academic philosophy , young faculty members are jumping ship in embarrassing numbers and shifting into neuroscience .
They are heading for the laboratories .
Why wrestle with Kant's God , Freedom , and Immortality when it is only a matter of time before neuroscience , probably through brain imaging , reveals the actual physical mechanism that sends these mental constructs , these illusions , synapsing up into the Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas of the brain ?
Which brings us to the second most famous statement in all of modern philosophy : Nietzsche 's " God is dead . "
The year was 1882 .
( The book was Die Fr�hliche Wissenschaft [ The Gay Science ] . )
Nietzsche said this was not a declaration of atheism , although he was in fact an atheist , but simply the news of an event .
He called the death of God a " tremendous event , " the greatest event of modern history .
The news was that educated people no longer believed in God , as a result of the rise of rationalism and scientific thought , including Darwinism , over the preceding 250 years .
But before you atheists run up your flags of triumph , he said , think of the implications .
" The story I have to tell , " wrote Nietzsche , " is the history of the next two centuries . "
He predicted ( in Ecce Homo ) that the twentieth century would be a century of " wars such as have never happened on earth , " wars catastrophic beyond all imagining .
And why ?
Because human beings would no longer have a god to turn to , to absolve them of their guilt ; but they would still be racked by guilt , since guilt is an impulse instilled in children when they are very young , before the age of reason .
As a result , people would loathe not only one another but themselves .
The blind and reassuring faith they formerly poured into their belief in God , said Nietzsche , they would now pour into a belief in barbaric nationalistic brotherhoods :
" If the doctrines ... of the lack of any cardinal distinction between man and animal , doctrines I consider true but deadly " — he says in an allusion to Darwinism in Untimely Meditations — " are hurled into the people for another generation ... then nobody should be surprised when ... brotherhoods with the aim of the robbery and exploitation of the non–brothers ... will appear in the arena of the future . "
Nietzsche 's view of guilt , incidentally , is also that of neuro–scientists a century later .
They regard guilt as one of those tendencies imprinted in the brain at birth .
In some people the genetic work is not complete , and they engage in criminal behavior without a twinge of remorse — thereby intriguing criminologists , who then want to create Violence Initiatives and hold conferences on the subject .
Nietzsche said that mankind would limp on through the twentieth century " on the mere pittance " of the old decaying God–based moral codes .
But then , in the twenty –first , would come a period more dreadful than the great wars , a time of " the total eclipse of all values " ( in The Will to Power ) .
This would also be a frantic period of " revaluation , " in which people would try to find new systems of values to replace the osteoporotic skeletons of the old .
But you will fail , he warned , because you cannot believe in moral codes without simultaneously believing in a god who points at you with his fearsome forefinger and says " Thou shalt " or " Thou shalt not . "
Why should we bother ourselves with a dire prediction that seems so far–fetched as " the total eclipse of all values " ?
Because of man 's track record , I should think .
After all , in Europe , in the peaceful decade of the 1880s , it must have seemed even more far–fetched to predict the world wars of the twentieth century and the barbaric brotherhoods of Nazism and Communism .
Ecce vates !
Ecce vates !
Behold the prophet !
How much more proof can one demand of a man 's powers of prediction ?
A hundred years ago those who worried about the death of God could console one another with the fact that they still had their own bright selves and their own inviolable souls for moral ballast and the marvels of modern science to chart the way .
But what if , as seems likely , the greatest marvel of modern science turns out to be brain imaging ?
And what if , ten years from now , brain imaging has proved , beyond any doubt , that not only Edward O. Wilson but also the young generation are , in fact , correct ?
The elders , such as Wilson himself and Daniel C. Dennett , the author of Darwin 's Dangerous Idea : Evolution and the Meanings of Life , and Richard Dawkins , author of The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker , insist that there is nothing to fear from the truth , from the ultimate extension of Darwin 's dangerous idea .
They present elegant arguments as to why neuroscience should in no way diminish the richness of life , the magic of art , or the righteousness of political causes , including , if one need edit , political correctness at Harvard or Tufts , where Dennett is Director of the Center for Cognitive Studies , or Oxford , where Dawkins is something called Professor of Public Understanding of Science .
( Dennett and Dawkins , every bit as much as Wilson , are earnestly , feverishly , politically correct . )
Despite their best efforts , however , neuroscience is not rippling out into the public on waves of scholarly reassurance .
But rippling out it is , rapidly .
The conclusion people out beyond the laboratory walls are drawing is :
The fix is in !
We 're all hardwired !
That , and : Do n't blame me !
I 'm wired wrong !
From nurture to nature
This sudden switch from a belief in Nurture , in the form of social conditioning , to Nature , in the form of genetics and brain physiology , is the great intellectual event , to borrow Nietzsche 's term , of the late twentieth century .
Up to now the two most influential ideas of the century have been Marxism and Freudianism .
Both were founded upon the premise that human beings and their " ideals " — Marx and Freud knew about quotation marks , too — are completely molded by their environment .
To Marx , the crucial environment was one 's social class ; " ideals " and " faiths " were notions foisted by the upper orders upon the lower as instruments of social control .
To Freud , the crucial environment was the Oedipal drama , the unconscious sexual plot that was played out in the family early in a child 's existence .
The " ideals " and " faiths " you prize so much are merely the parlor furniture you feature for receiving your guests , said Freud ; I will show you the cellar , the furnace , the pipes , the sexual steam that actually runs the house .
By the mid–1950s even anti–Marxists and anti–Freudians had come to assume the centrality of class domination and Oedipally conditioned sexual drives .
On top of this came Pavlov , with his " stimulus –response bonds , " and B. F. Skinner , with his " operant conditioning , " turning the supremacy of conditioning into something approaching a precise form of engineering .
So how did this brilliant intellectual fashion come to so screeching and ignominious an end ?
The demise of Freudianism can be summed up in a single word : lithium .
In 1949 an Australian psychiatrist , John Cade , gave five days of lithium therapy — for entirely the wrong reasons — to a fifty –one – year–old mental patient who was so manic–depressive , so hyperactive , unintelligible , and uncontrollable , he had been kept locked up in asylums for twenty years .
By the sixth day , thanks to the lithium buildup in his blood , he was a normal human being .
Three months later he was released and lived happily ever after in his own home .
This was a man who had been locked up and subjected to two decades of Freudian logorrhea to no avail whatsoever .
Over the next twenty years antidepressant and tranquilizing drugs completely replaced Freudian talk–talk as treatment for serious mental disturbances .
By the mid–1980s , neuroscientists looked upon Freudian psychiatry as a quaint relic based largely upon superstition ( such as dream analysis — dream analysis ! ) , like phrenology or mesmerism .
In fact , among neuroscientists , phrenology now has a higher reputation than Freudian psychiatry , since phrenology was in a certain crude way a precursor of electroencephalography .
Freudian psychiatrists are now regarded as old crocks with sham medical degrees , as ears with wire hairs sprouting out of them that people with more money than sense can hire to talk into .
Marxism was finished off even more suddenly — in a single year , 1973 — with the smuggling out of the Soviet Union and the publication in France of the first of the three volumes of Aleksandr Solzhenitsy n's The Gulag Archipelago .
Other writers , notably the British historian Robert Conquest , had already exposed the Soviet Union 's vast network of concentration camps , but their work was based largely on the testimony of refugees , and refugees were routinely discounted as biased and bitter observers .
Solzhenitsyn , on the other hand , was a Soviet citizen , still living on Soviet soil , a zek himself for eleven years , zek being Russian slang for concentration camp prisoner .
His credibility had been vouched for by none other than Nikita Khrushchev , who in 1962 had permitted the publication of Solzhenitsyn's novella of the gulag , One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , as a means of cutting down to size the daunting shadow of his predecessor Stalin .
" Yes , " Khrushchev had said in effect , " what this man Solzhenitsyn has to say is true .
Such were Stalin's crimes . "
Solzhenitsyn's brief fictional description of the Soviet slave labor system was damaging enough .
But The Gulag Archipelago , a two–thousand–page , densely detailed , nonfiction account of the Soviet Communist Party 's systematic extermination of its enemies , real and imagined , of its own countrymen , by the tens of millions through an enormous , methodical , bureaucratically controlled " human sewage disposal system , " as Solzhenitsyn called it —
The Gulag Archipelago was devastating .
After all , this was a century in which there was no longer any possible ideological detour around the concentration camp .
Among European intellectuals , even French intellectuals , Marxism collapsed as a spiritual force immediately .
Ironically , it survived longer in the United States before suffering a final , merciful coup de grace on November 9 , 1989 , with the breaching of the Berlin Wall , which signaled in an unmistakable fashion what a debacle the Soviets ' seventy – two–year field experiment in socialism had been .
( Marxism still hangs on , barely , acrobatically , in American universities in a Mannerist form known as Deconstruction , a literary doctrine that depicts language itself as an insidious tool used by The Powers That Be to deceive the proles and peasants . )
Freudianism and Marxism — and with them , the entire belief in social conditioning — were demolished so swiftly , so suddenly , that neuroscience has surged in , as if into an intellectual vacuum .
Nor do you have to be a scientist to detect the rush .
Anyone with a child in school knows the signs all too well .
I have children in school , and I am intrigued by the faith parents now invest — the craze began about 1990 — in psychologists who diagnose their children as suffering from a defect known as attention deficit disorder , or ADD .
Of course , I have no way of knowing whether this " disorder " is an actual , physical , neurological condition or not , but neither does anybody else in this early stage of neuroscience .
The symptoms of this supposed malady are always the same .
The child , or , rather , the boy — forty–nine out of fifty cases are boys — fidgets around in school , slides off his chair , does n't pay attention , distracts his classmates during class , and performs poorly .
In an earlier era he would have been pressured to pay attention , work harder , show some self –discipline .
To parents caught up in the new intellectual climate of the 1990s , that approach seems cruel , because my little boy 's problem is ... he's wired wrong !
The poor little tyke — the fix has been in since birth !
Invariably the parents complain , " All he wants to do is sit in front of the television set and watch cartoons and play Sega Genesis . "
For how long ?
" How long ?
For hours at a time . "
Hours at a time ; as even any young neuroscientist will tell you , that boy may have a problem , but it is not an attention deficit .
Nevertheless , all across America we have the spectacle of an entire generation of little boys , by the tens of thousands , being dosed up on ADD 's magic bullet of choice , Ritalin , the CIBA–Geneva Corporation 's brand name for the stimulant methylphenidate .
I first encountered Ritalin in 1966 when I was in San Francisco doing research for a book on the psychedelic or hippie movement .
A certain species of the genus hippie was known as the Speed Freak , and a certain strain of Speed Freak was known as the Ritalin Head .
The Ritalin Heads loved Ritalin .
You 'd see them in the throes of absolute Ritalin raptures ...
Not a wiggle , not a peep ... They would sit engrossed in anything at all ... a manhole cover , their own palm wrinkles ... indefinitely ... through shoulda–been mealtime after mealtime ... through raging insomnias ... Pure methyl–phenidate nirvana ... From 1990 to 1995 , CIBA–Geneva 's sales of Ritalin rose 600 percent ; and not because of the appetites of subsets of the species Speed Freak in San Francisco , either .
It was because an entire generation of American boys , from the best private schools of the Northeast to the worst sludge–trap public schools of Los Angeles and San Diego , was now strung out on methylphenidate , diligently doled out to them every day by their connection , the school nurse .
America is a wonderful country !
I mean it !
No honest writer would challenge that statement !
The human comedy never runs out of material !
It never lets you down !
Meantime , the notion of a self — a self who exercises self –discipline , postpones gratification , curbs the sexual appetite , stops short of aggression and criminal behavior — a self who can become more intelligent and lift itself to the very peaks of life by its own bootstraps through study , practice , perseverance , and refusal to give up in the face of great odds — this old–fashioned notion ( what 's a boot strap , for God 's sake ? ) of success through enterprise and true grit is already slipping away , slipping away ... slipping away ...
The peculiarly American faith in the power of the individual to transform himself from a helpless cypher into a giant among men , a faith that ran from Emerson ( " Self–Reliance " ) to Horatio Alger 's Luck and Pluck stories to Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People to Norman Vincent Peale 's The Power of Positive Thinking to Og Mandino 's The Greatest Salesman in the World — that faith is now as moribund as the god for whom Nietzsche wrote an obituary in 1882 .
It lives on today only in the decrepit form of the " motivational talk , " as lecture agents refer to it , given by retired football stars such as Fran Tarkenton to audiences of businessmen , most of them woulda–been athletes ( like the author of this article ) , about how life is like a football game .
" It 's late in the fourth period and you 're down by thirteen points and the Cowboys got you hemmed in on your own one –yard line and it's third and twenty –three .
Whaddaya do ?... "
Sorry , Fran , but it 's third and twenty –three and the genetic fix is in , and the new message is now being pumped out into the popular press and onto television at a stupefying rate .
Who are the pumps ?
They are a new breed who call themselves " evolutionary psychologists . "
You can be sure that twenty years ago the same people would have been calling themselves Freudian ; but today they are genetic determinists , and the press has a voracious appetite for whatever they come up with .
The most popular study currently — it is still being featured on television news shows , months later — is David Lykken and Auke Tellegen 's study at the University of Minnesota of two thousand twins that shows , according to these two evolutionary psychologists , that an individual 's happiness is largely genetic .
Some people are hardwired to be happy and some are not .
Success ( or failure ) in matters of love , money , reputation , or power is transient stuff ; you soon settle back down ( or up ) to the level of happiness you were born with genetically .
Three months ago Fortune devoted a long takeout , elaborately illustrated , of a study by evolutionary psychologists at Britain 's University of Saint Andrews showing that you judge the facial beauty or handsomeness of people you meet not by any social standards of the age you live in but by criteria hardwired in your brain from the moment you were born .
Or , to put it another way , beauty is not in the eye of the beholder but embedded in his genes .
In fact , today , in the year 1996 , barely three years before the end of the millennium , if your appetite for newspapers , magazines , and television is big enough , you will quickly get the impression that there is nothing in your life , including the fat content of your body , that is not genetically predetermined .
If I may mention just a few things the evolutionary psychologists have illuminated for me over the past two months :
The male of the human species is genetically hardwired to be polygamous , i.e. , unfaithful to his legal mate .
Any magazine –reading male gets the picture soon enough .
( Three million years of evolution made me do it ! )
Women lust after male celebrities , because they are genetically hardwired to sense that alpha males will take better care of their offspring .
( I 'm just a lifeguard in the gene pool , honey . )
Teenage girls are genetically hardwired to be promiscuous and are as helpless to stop themselves as dogs in the park .
( The school provides the condoms . )
Most murders are the result of genetically hardwired compulsions .
( Convicts can read , too , and they report to the prison psychiatrist : " Something came over me ... and then the knife went in . "
2 )
Where does that leave self –control ?
Where , indeed , if people believe this ghostly self does not even exist , and brain imaging proves it , once and for all ?
So far , neuroscientific theory is based largely on indirect evidence , from studies of animals or of how a normal brain changes when it is invaded ( by accidents , disease , radical surgery , or experimental needles ) .
Darwin II himself , Edward O. Wilson , has only limited direct knowledge of the human brain .
He is a zoologist , not a neurologist , and his theories are extrapolations from the exhaustive work he has done in his specialty , the study of insects .
The French surgeon Paul Broca discovered Broca 's area , one of the two speech centers of the left hemisphere of the brain , only after one of his patients suffered a stroke .
Even the PET scan and the PET reporter gene / PET reporter probe are technically medical invasions , since they require the injection of chemicals or viruses into the body .
But they offer glimpses of what the noninvasive imaging of the future will probably look like .
A neuroradiologist can read a list of topics out loud to a person being given a PET scan , topics pertaining to sports , music , business , history , whatever , and when he finally hits one the person is interested in , a particular area of the cerebral cortex actually lights up on the screen .
Eventually , as brain imaging is refined , the picture may become as clear and complete as those see–through exhibitions , at auto shows , of the inner workings of the internal combustion engine .
At that point it may become obvious to everyone that all we are looking at is a piece of machinery , an analog chemical computer , that processes information from the environment .
" All , " since you can look and look and you will not find any ghostly self inside , or any mind , or any soul .
Thereupon , in the year 2006 or 2026 , some new Nietzsche will step forward to announce : " The self is dead " — except that being prone to the poetic , like Nietzsche I , he will probably say : " The soul is dead . "
He will say that he is merely bringing the news , the news of the greatest event of the millennium : " The soul , that last refuge of values , is dead , because educated people no longer believe it exists . "
Unless the assurances of the Wilsons and the Dennetts and the Dawkinses also start rippling out , the lurid carnival that will ensue may make the phrase " the total eclipse of all values " seem tame .
The two most fascinating riddles of the 21st century
If I were a college student today , I do n't think I could resist going into neuroscience .
Here we have the two most fascinating riddles of the twenty –first century : the riddle of the human mind and the riddle of what happens to the human mind when it comes to know itself absolutely .
In any case , we live in an age in which it is impossible and pointless to avert your eyes from the truth .
Ironically , said Nietzsche , this unflinching eye for truth , this zest for skepticism , is the legacy of Christianity ( for complicated reasons that need n't detain us here ) .
Then he added one final and perhaps ultimate piece of irony in a fragmentary passage in a notebook shortly before he lost his mind ( to the late–nineteenth–century 's great venereal scourge , syphilis ) .
He predicted that eventually modern science would turn its juggernaut of skepticism upon itself , question the validity of its own foundations , tear them apart , and self –destruct .
I thought about that in the summer of 1994 when a group of mathematicians and computer scientists held a conference at the Santa Fe Institute on " Limits to Scientific Knowledge . "
The consensus was that since the human mind is , after all , an entirely physical apparatus , a form of computer , the product of a particular genetic history , it is finite in its capabilities .
Being finite , hardwired , it will probably never have the power to comprehend human existence in any complete way .
It would be as if a group of dogs were to call a conference to try to understand The Dog .
They could try as hard as they wanted , but they would n't get very far .
Dogs can communicate only about forty notions , all of them primitive , and they can't record anything .
The project would be doomed from the start .
The human brain is far superior to the dog's , but it is limited nonetheless .
So any hope of human beings arriving at some final , complete , self –enclosed theory of human existence is doomed , too .
This , science 's Ultimate Skepticism , has been spreading ever since then .
Over the past two years even Darwinism , a sacred tenet among American scientists for the past seventy years , has been beset by ... doubts .
Scientists — not religiosi—notably the mathematician David Berlinski ( " The Deniable Darwin , " Commentary , June 1996 ) and the biochemist Michael Behe ( Darwin 's Black Box , 1996 ) , have begun attacking Darwinism as a mere theory , not a scientific discovery , a theory woefully unsupported by fossil evidence and featuring , at the core of its logic , sheer mush .
( Dennett and Dawkins , for whom Darwin is the Only Begotten , the Messiah , are already screaming .
They 're beside themselves , utterly apoplectic .
Wilson , the giant , keeping his cool , has remained above the battle . )
By 1990 the physicist Petr Beckmann of the University of Colorado had already begun going after Einstein .
He greatly admired Einstein for his famous equation of matter and energy , E=mc2 , but called his theory of relativity mostly absurd and grotesquely untestable .
Beckmann died in 1993 .
His Fool Killer 's cudgel has been taken up by Howard Hayden of the University of Connecticut , who has many admirers among the upcoming generation of Ultimately Skeptical young physicists .
The scorn the new breed heaps upon quantum mechanics ( " has no real–world applications " ... " depends entirely on fairies sprinkling goofball equations in your eyes " ) , Unified Field Theory ( " Nobel worm bait " ) , and the Big Bang Theory ( " creationism for nerds " ) has become withering .
If only Nietzsche were alive !
He would have relished every minute of it !
Recently I happened to be talking to a prominent California geologist , and she told me : " When I first went into geology , we all thought that in science you create a solid layer of findings , through experiment and careful investigation , and then you add a second layer , like a second layer of bricks , all very carefully , and so on .
Occasionally some adventurous scientist stacks the bricks up in towers , and these towers turn out to be insubstantial and they get torn down , and you proceed again with the careful layers .
But we now realize that the very first layers are n't even resting on solid ground .
They are balanced on bubbles , on concepts that are full of air , and those bubbles are being burst today , one after the other . "
I suddenly had a picture of the entire astonishing edifice collapsing and modern man plunging headlong back into the primordial ooze .
He 's floundering , sloshing about , gulping for air , frantically treading ooze , when he feels something huge and smooth swim beneath him and boost him up , like some almighty dolphin .
He can't see it , but he 's much impressed .
He names it God .

The mainstream media has been co-opted by the government to such an extraordinary extent over the past seven years , and appear to be concealing the facts of so many state sponsored arguments , they should be called ' the Governments ' Media ' .
ABC News prepared a TV special in the Fall of 2001 about the anonymous ongoing anthrax attacks taking place at that time .
Blindly reporting the Bush / Cheney administration 's official line that the attacks were from Iraq .
In that context , in retrospect now , ABC News appears especially complicit in reporting administration generated lies as facts .
The credibility of mainstream media , in general , and the integrity of the self - image of the American people are the issues at stake , not merely ABCs ' corporate hubris .
It is a news organizations ' patriotic duty to inform the U.S. populace if their sources are lying .
The facts will be judged by the passage of time .
Today there is massive public doubt concerning the veracity and honesty of both a media and a government awash in a tsunami of obvious self - contradictory disinformation .
Dishonesty has been the modus operandi of the Bush / Cheney administration , et al. , from the first day of their election .
Amounting to end - to - end lies revealed by nothing less than their own conflicted facts supported by nothing other than smug arrogance .
Their hands caught repeatedly in the cookie jar are soiled beyond any possible cleansing .
Dirtied by this offence , so too now by apparent collusion , is ABC .
' Facts ' , so - called , but clearly nothing but grossly misrepresented leaks and outright misinformation , are the order of the day .
This continuous stream of lies glaringly obvious to the entire world if not to ourselves , demands a special prosecutor 's attention and a thorough investigation of ABC -- and other media outlets as well , ( are you listening Fox News ? ) -- their sources , and their complicity with the prime movers in the Bush / Cheney administration .
The content of the ' news ' presented during the anthrax attacks , ( unfortunately not limited to this case ) , is nothing but propagandistic insemination by a rapist government and the force feeding of lies to a commercially sponsored , integrity starved , enfeebled media .
What a horrible legacy to leave for our country .
The continuing pretense of this faux news ultimately will bring nothing but dishonor to all involved -- you and I are included here .
Should we question authority ?
Hah !
How dare we -- We The People -- even consider the possibility that our ' journalists ' , our media , could be held in - place by extortion or , worse , bribed by our own government .
How dare we question !
How dare YOU , commercially driven media , dismiss our inquiries !
Big media , you have allowed your own victimization .
Shall I enumerate your castration one - by - one , YOUR Yellow Journalism , YOUR sell out ... whoa , that would be more than a pair , THAT would be legion !
Remember that archaic contract you signed onto , the one where being a citizen of THIS country entitled you to certain rights ?
You know the one : the Constitution ... our birthright .
Do you now instead of legitimacy prefer to be known as the governments ' bastard child ?
ABC come clean , for yourselves , for us .
Make the honorable decision willingly , professionally , regarding the sources for the anthrax story of 2001 .
If you cannot muster the courage now , events over time will .
Be afraid , be very afraid .

Advertisement The US House of Representatives has voted down a $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) plan aimed at bailing out Wall Street .
The rescue plan , a result of tense talks between the government and lawmakers , was rejected by 228 to 205 votes in the House of Representatives .
About two - thirds of Republican lawmakers refused to back the rescue package , as well as 95 Democrats .
Wall Street shares plunged at the news ; the benchmark index saw its biggest daily points fall ever , down 770 .
A White House spokesman said that President George W Bush was " very disappointed " by the vote 's result .

Mr Bush later met Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to discuss the way forward , and was also scheduled to hold talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Speaking later on the White House lawn , Mr Paulson said the government 's plan to address the crisis facing the US financial sector was much too important to be allowed to fail .
US regulators would use " all the tools available " to help the US economy , but their powers were " insufficient " , he warned .
He added that he would be working with congressional leaders to get something done " as quickly as possible " .
Monday 's vote followed a day of turmoil in the financial sector .
Wachovia , the fourth - largest US bank , was bought by larger rival Citigroup in a rescue deal backed by US authorities
Benelux banking giant Fortis was partially nationalised by the Dutch , Belgian and Luxembourg governments to ensure its survival
The UK government announced it was nationalising the Bradford & Bingley bank
Global shares fell sharply - France 's key index lost 5 % , Germany 's main market dropped 4 % while US shares plunged after the vote result was announced .
' Global contagion '
As news of the vote came through , traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange stood dumbfounded .
Analysts say that without a bail - out plan , the banks will be left to handle all their own bad mortgage debt as best they can and more of them will be in danger of going bust .
Why did the bail - out bill fail ?
Q&A : US $ 700 bn bail - out plan Dow Jones plummets " There 's a monster amount of fear out there , " said Joe Saluzzi , a trading manager .
" This is global contagion .
It 's no longer just the United States , " he told Reuters news agency .
Mr Bush had argued that the bail - out plan was a " bold " one which he was confident would restore strength and confidence to the US economy .
But after a several hours of impassioned debate , the bill 's opponents - the majority of whom were from the Republican Party - got their way .
They had raised concerns about both the content of the plan and the speed with which they were being asked to pass it .
Some agreement on issues such as oversight , greater protection for taxpayers and curbs on executive bonuses had been reached in fraught weekend talks .
These concessions , however , ultimately failed to persuade enough lawmakers that the plan was in the best interests of the nation .
Blame game
The no vote plunged the world of Washington politics into turmoil , reports the BBC's Kevin Connolly from the US capital .

So grave are the consequences of this decision , our correspondent says , that the speaker of the house paused for several long minutes after the vote was taken before declaring it official .
" The legislation has failed , the crisis has not gone away , " said Nancy Pelosi , the house 's Democratic speaker .
She said that 60 % of Democrats had supported the bill , and urged both sides to try again to find a resolution .
" We must work in a bipartisan way in order to have another bite at the apple in terms of some legislation , " she said .
Republican leaders , meanwhile , criticised a scathing speech by Ms Pelosi about the Bush administration 's economic policies for injecting partisanship into the issue and scuttling the vote .
Republican house leader John Boehner said : " We could have gotten there today had it not been for the partisan speech that the speaker gave on the floor of the House " .
The speaker 's words , he said , " poisoned our conference , caused a number of members that we thought we could get , to go south " .
Call for calm Republican presidential hopeful John McCain accused Democrats of infusing the debate with an unhelpful partisan approach .
" Now is not the time to fix the blame , it 's time to fix the problem , " he added .
He urged members of Congress to go back to the drawing board " immediately " and work out a new deal .
His Democratic rival Barack Obama countered that it was an outrage that ordinary people were being asked to clean up Wall Street 's mess .
HAVE YOUR SAY I am glad the bailout bill failed .
I work five days a week , save cash and pay my bills .
I did not want to pay for Corporate America 's greed Lisa , Baltimore " If I am president I will review the entire plan on the day I take office to make sure that it is working to save our economy and ( that ) you get your money back , " he said .
He added that he expected Congress to pass a bail - out bill in some form .
Lawmakers from both parties have called for further talks on new bail - out legislation .
Frantic steps will now be taken to get some kind of amended version of the bill through Congress , our correspondent says .
But , he adds , this vote would have shaken the confidence of the financial world and the ability of America 's leaders to come up with convincing answers at a moment of crisis .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was disappointed by the vote 's failure , adding that he was doing everything he could to protect the British economy .

What are these ?
Andrei Illarionov , a liberal economist and former policy advisor to the Russian president , has released his conclusions on the war in Georgia .
The conflict , he argues , was a “ brilliant provocation carefully planned and successfully carried out by the Russian leadership . ”
However , the Russian leadership did not achieve its main goals– removing Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili from power and changing Georgia ’s political regime .
In Illarionov ’s opinion , Georgia ’s NATO aspirations have only been heightened .
By leading forces into the territory of a foreign government , Russia has been internationally recognized as an aggressor , according to the economist .
Georgia , on the other hand , became an internationally recognized victim .
Illarionov believes that Russia has become completely isolated in its foreign policy , as only Cuba supported Russia ’s Georgian campaign .
“ The G8 has , in effect , become the G7 , ” Illarionov asserts .

The Second Georgian War : Preliminary Conclusions
Andrei Illarionov
Yezhednevny Zhurnal
August 13 , 2008 .

1 . The war against Georgia was a brilliant provocation carefully planned and successfully carried out by the Russian leadership .
The campaign was practically identical to the plan carried out in another theatre at another time — [ Chechen warlord Shamil ]
Basaev ’s attack into Dagestan and the beginning of the second Chechen war in 1999 .
2 . In the new situation that has taken shape following the war , Georgians may find a legitimate reason to recognise Georgia ’s de facto loss of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
3 . The military losses of Georgia are greater than those of Russia .
At the same time , however , the financial , foreign policy , and moral losses of Russia are much more significant than those of Georgia .
4 . The Russian leadership did not achieve its main goal — the ouster of [ Georgian President ] Mikheil Saakashvili , change of the political regime in Georgia , and Georgia ’s rejection of membership in NATO .
Rather , the opposite has happened .
5 . The international community regards Russia as the aggressor that brought its forces into the territory of another member state of the United Nations .
The international community regards Georgia as the victim of aggression .
6. Russia has found itself in almost total isolation in foreign policy terms .
Only Cuba supported Russia ’s intervention in Georgia .
Neither Iran , nor Venezuela or Uzbekistan , not even Belarus said a word in Russia ’s support .
7 . The G8 has , in effect , become the G7 .
The series of foreign policy defeats of the Russian leadership , beginning with the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003 and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 , and including the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008 , was now followed by yet another fiasco .
8 . The Russian leadership succeeded in something that the rest of the world did not ( want to ) believe :
The resurgence of fear of the “ Russian bear ” .
This fear and — be it temporary — sense of powerlessness is something that the world will not forget for a long time .
9 . Russians with no access to sources for news other than the official , found themselves in total isolation in terms of information .
The degree of manipulation of public opinion , and the speed with which the society was brought to mass hysteria , are clear evidence of the regime ’s “ achievements , ” and pose an undeniable and unprecedented danger to the Russian society .
10 .
The institutional catastrophe , about which I have had to speak about many times before , is happening before our very own eyes .
Its main — albeit not the only — victim will be the Russian people .
11 . The war helped reveal the true faces of some so - called liberals and democrats , who previously had condemned the “ imperial syndrome , ” but when it manifested itself , quickly caved in to the regime , calling for an attack on Tbilisi and for the reinforcement of Russia ’s defence and law enforcement agencies .
12 . The only political institution , members of which were capable of formulating differing opinions regarding the war ( including those , with whom I do not agree in principle ) and discussing them , was the National Assembly .
In effect , the National Assembly proved — in a moment of crisis — that it is better able than any other institution to function as a proto- parliament .
13 .
The war confirmed once more the validity of the most important principles of conduct of morally conscious Russian citizens in relation to the present regime :
– do not believe ,
– do not fear ,
– do not beg ,
– do not cooperate .
NYT columnist : GOP exploited race for decades David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Claims that Republican presidential nominee John McCain was not playing on white voters ' fears of black men seducing white women in his " celeb " advertisement are hard to swallow coming from a party that has exploited racial tensions for decades , says a New York Times ' columnist .
Bob Herbert , the most prominent African American voice on the paper 's op - ed page , authored a Saturday column outlining his objections to the GOP 's race - based attacks against Democratic nominee Barack Obama .
He expanded on his thesis Monday morning in an interview with MSNBC's Joe Scarborough .
" You tell me why those two phallic symbols are placed there , Pow !
Right at the beginning of that ad , " Herbert said , referring to images of Berlin 's victory column , where Obama spoke last month , and what appears to be the Washington Monument juxtaposed with clips of Hilton and Spears .
Perhaps not coincidentally , both celebrities ' sultry images contributed to their fame .
Hilton became a household name after the " leak " of her amateur sex tape , and Spears ' late - 90s stardom arose from her sexually charged dance moves .
Both also have repeatedly greeted paparazzi while wearing short skirts and no underwear , Herbert noted in his column .
Herbert traced McCain 's reliance on a racist dog whistle to his very first general election ad , where the GOP senator portrayed himself as the " American president Americans have been waiting for , " as if there was any question about which country he was running to lead .
" What was the subtext of that comment ? ...
My contention is that the subtext is that Barack Obama is the other , " Herbert said .
" And you just have this whole thing playing out in the context of a Republican party that has used and exploited the race issue for political gain for decades now . "

Please allow me to introduce myself I 'm a man of wealth and taste .
Well not really , I usually just eat inexpensive fried cheese snacks .
Hello .
I 'm Russ and I will be bringing you humor in the form of a Comedy Goldmine on a regular basis .
I was attracted to the role because the job title contains two things I love ( comedy , gold ) and one thing which was pretty cool in Bad Boys 2 ( mines ) .
Sleep is an interesting phenomenon .
Well not really , I just wanted to sound sophisticated and intelligent like Michel Gondry , Oscar Wilde or Carl Weathers in that Adam Sandler movie which was about golf but not REALLY about golf .
Even if it 's not interesting , at least sleep can be funny , according to the Something Awful forum goons .
If you 've ever been woken up by the insane babblings of a family member , friend or someone you are keeping prisoner against their will , you will know there is a lot of comedy to be found in these situations !
The bizzarely named ol ^____^lo got us underway with this first tale , and what followed was an avalanche of snooze - related laughs !
One night I woke up as my boyfriend was shifting position in his sleep .
As he flopped over , he said loud and clear , " Yeah ... you can see .
You can see my squid !
You can see up close ! "
My boyfriend screamed out " FUCK YOU TALIBAN ! " the other night .
Scared the crap out of me .
From my ex-girlfriend : " Fuck .
FUCK YOU ALASKA ! "
Me : What the Christ ?
" Get the pipe away from me .
It is cold and metal "
Said by a high school friend at an all girls sleepover .
You do the math .
While crashing on a friends couch recently it was claimed that I sat up in my sleep and declared " These are n't FRESH coconuts ! "
Though it 's likely I was n't talking in my sleep and instead I was just being a silly drunk ( I was quite plastered at the time ) .
" Yes , I fucked a duck . "
My husband talks in his sleep all the time , and sometimes he says the most fucked up things .
" I 'll rip off your head and shit down your neck . "
" I 'm going to FUCK YOUR ASS ! " ( I spent the rest of the night sleeping with my back firmly against the wall )
" I want a hard shell whooping terrior .
Whoopwhoopwhoopwhoop ! "
" You smell like happy " As he snuggled me from behind .
" I do n't give a fuck what you think because what you think fuck stink "
There are many others but I can't remember the rest off the top of my head .
He 's either incredibly scary , adorable , or ridiculously retarded .
At least I 'm entertained when I have trouble sleeping .
A good friend and fellow goon once Beat Boxed and started singing Metric - Combat Baby in his sleep .
My ex fiancé once sat up quickly and punch me in the arm .
We also had an entire conversation about our relationship in which we discussed ways to resolve to all of the problems we were having , commencing in make - up sex .
And he was apparently asleep for the entire thing .
Occasionally he'd also tell me he'd taken out the trash , did n't have to go to work that day , or would clean up the kitchen later .
Remembering none of it and inevitably getting in trouble with work or waking up in a panic .
I only wish I could remember all the final fantasy and World of Warcraft references he used to make while asleep .
My favorite by far , though , is : " It 's a SNAKE ! KILL IT ! " followed by chasing an imaginary snake around his room with hairspray .
This was after watching the badger video a little too much the day before .
From a former roommate :
" I'm the nuclear fallout for tonight , so I 'll have to do , now eat your cake and let 's get going " .
My friend goes on tangents when he is falling asleep .
Yes , falling asleep .
He is not asleep , but he goes into these incredibly detailed one - way conversations as he is lulling to dreamland .
And he does n't know he does it .
It seems to get worse when he 's been drunk , as he was when I first noticed it .
Myself and about six others were all trying to get an hour of sleep before we began the arduous task of destroying all evidence that the previous night took place .
And he begins ...
" Yeah , now you got it .
Oh , this will work fine ... no , it is n't like that .
Well , I wish .
Damn it , Skip , you 're doing it wrong .
No , let me !
See , the ropes , we tie 'em up there and throw those big ass steering wheels on there .
Yeah , but forget the magnets .
We tried that and it only worked on cats .
I 'll be back , gotta take Jesus to the races "
That is all I remember , as I was keen on getting sleep ... We recorded his little " chat " as he did n't believe he said the above one .
If only I knew what he and Skip were building ... it sounds like it will work !
As microbes in the soil break down fallen plant matter , a diet " balanced " in nutrients appears to help control soil fertility and the normal release of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
When plants drop their leaves , stems and twigs , this organic matter slowly becomes part of the soil as a result of decomposition , which is facilitated by bacteria and other microbes .
This process adds plant nutrients to the soil and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
Duke University scientists found the proportion of nitrogen to carbon in this organic matter determines how much nitrogen becomes available to plants in the soil and how much carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere .
Their study also yielded a universal mathematical formula that can predict the decomposition process anywhere in the world .
The results of the Duke analysis were published Aug. 1 in the journal Science .
" For the first time , we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere , from the Arctic Circle to tropical rain forests , " said first author Stefano Manzoni , a Ph.D. candidate in civil and environmental engineering who works in the laboratory of senior scientist Amilcare Porporato , associate professor of civil engineering in Duke 's Pratt School of Engineering .
" This provides a mathematical way of describing a critical natural process . "
During decomposition , microbes digest fallen organic matter from plants and slowly break it down .
Two of the important byproducts of this process are mineral nitrogen and carbon dioxide .
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for both plants and microbes , and once it becomes mineralized , it becomes available for plants to use .

Carbon -- the most abundant element in plants and organic matter -- is released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide , one of many of the so - called greenhouse gases implicated in global warning .
This carbon dioxide release is known as respiration .
" One of the key findings of this study is that microbes can adapt and do fairly well in a nutrient - poor environment , " Porporato said .
" When their diet is lacking in nitrogen , microbes tend to react by releasing more carbon dioxide into the air and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil .
So plants can get the much - needed mineralized nitrogen earlier in the decomposition process from the fallen organic matter . "
However , he pointed out , the earlier availability of mineral nitrogen for plant use comes at a risk : nitrogen in this form in the soil becomes more vulnerable to rain , which can wash it away or leach it deeper into the soil .
This would be especially true if the rainfall events are particularly heavy , as has been predicted in some climate - change models .
Maintaining enough soil nitrogen is important in both native ecosystems and in farms and orchards , the scientists said .
" Nitrogen is the element that most limits plant growth around the world , " said co-author Rob Jackson , Duke professor of biology and environmental sciences .
" Our work should help predict how much nitrogen becomes available when organic matter is added to the soil , either naturally or through added mulches and manures . "
For the analysis , Manzoni assembled a database of more than 2,800 samples of decomposing plant matter from locations around the world in a wide spectrum of climates .
As he studied decomposition across these sites , he found similar patterns of nitrogen release and respiration no matter what the climate was like .
" A diet rich in carbon causes microbes to release more carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide as they strive to maintain the healthy balance between nitrogen and carbon in their diet , " Manzoni said .
" For this reason , if more carbon is added to the soil in the form of plant residues , the microbes would then just pump out more carbon in response . "
The research team plans to use the same approach to better understand the roles of other nutrients in the decomposition cycle .
The research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation .
John Trofymow of the Canadian Forest Service was also a member of the team .
Much of the data used in the current analysis came from the Long - Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment ( LIDET ) , a partnership of the U.S Forest Service , Oregon State University and the U.S. Department of Forest Science , as well as the Canadian Intersite Decomposition Experiment ( CIDET ) .

Parrot Talk More than Just Squawking
Human children can make these logical leaps by at least age four .

Parrot speech is commonly regarded as the brainless squawking of a feathered voice recorder .
But studies over the past 30 years continually show that parrots engage in much more than mere mimicry .
Parrots are capable of logical leaps and can solve certain linguistic processing tasks as deftly as 4 - 6 year - old children .
Parrots appear to grasp concepts like " same " and " different , " " bigger " and " smaller " , " none " and numbers .
They understand zero Perhaps most interestingly , they can combine labels and phrases in novel ways .
A January 2007 study in Language Sciences suggests using patterns of parrot speech learning to develop artificial speech skills in robots .
Elephants Do Forget , but They 're Not Dumb
Even newborn elephants are still some of the animal world 's heftiest creatures .
This baby Asian elephant , named Baylor , was born weighing 348 pounds ( 158 kilograms ) in May 2010 at the Houston Zoo.
Mom Shanti endured a pregnancy lasting almost 23 months .
About two hours after birth the calf was able to stand on his own .

Elephants have the largest brain — nearly 11 pounds on average — of any mammal that ever walked the earth .
Do they use that gray matter to the fullest ?
Intelligence is hard to quantify in humans or animals , but the encephalization quotient ( EQ ) , a ratio of an animal 's observed brain size to the expected brain size given the animal 's mass , correlates well with an ability to navigate novel challenges and obstacles .
The average elephant EQ is 1.88 .
( Humans range from 7.33 to 7.69 , chimpanzees average 2.45 , pigs 0.27 . )
Intelligence and memory are thought to go hand in hand , suggesting that elephant memories , while not infallible , are quite good .
Giraffes Compensate for Height with Unique Blood Flow
The nubs that top the giraffe 's head , which are just bone projects covered in skin and hair , are called ossicones .

The stately giraffe , whose head sits some 16 feet up atop an unlikely pedestal , adapted his long neck to compete for foliage with other grazers .
The long necks of giraffes date back to ancestors that lived 16 million years ago , according to a study reported October 7 , 2015 in the journal Royal Society Open Science .
While the advantage of reach is obvious , some difficulties arise at such a height .
The heart must pump twice as hard as a cow's to get blood up to the brain , and a complex blood vessel system is needed to ensure that blood does n't rush to the head when bent over .
Six feet below the heart , the skin of the legs must then be extremely tight to prevent blood from pooling at the hooves .
Many Fish Swap Sex Organs

With so many land creatures to wonder at , it 's easy to forget that some of the weirdest activities take place deep in the ocean .
The strange practice of hermaphroditism is more common among species of fish than within any other group of vertebrates .
Some fish change sex in response to hormonal cycle or environmental changes .
Others simultaneously possess both male and female sex organs .
Scrawny male molly fish flaunt their bisexuality to improve their mating odds , according to research reported in the journal Biology Letters .
Baby Chicks and Brotherhood
The jury is still out over whether the chicken or egg came first .
But turns out dinosaurs were laying bird - like eggs long before chickens roamed Earth .

It 's a mistake to think of evolution as producing selfish animals concerned only with their own survival .
Altruism abounds in cases where a helping hand will encourage the survival of genetic material similar to one 's own .
Baby chicks practice this " kin selection " by making a special chirp while feeding .
This call announces the food find to nearby chicks , who are probably close relations and so share many of the chick 's genes .
The key to natural selection is n't survival of the fittest animal .
It 's survival of the fittest genetic material , and so brotherly behavior that favors close relations will thrive .
Chimps are also known to be selfless on occasion .
Mole - Rats are n't Blind

With their puny eyes and underground lifestyle , African mole - rats have long been considered the Mr. Magoos of rodents , detecting little light and , it has been suggested , using their eyes more for sensing changes in air currents than for actual vision .
But findings of the past few years have shown that African mole - rats have a keen , if limited , sense of sight .
And they do n't like what they see , according to a report in the November 2006 Animal Behaviour .
Light may suggest that a predator has broken into a tunnel , which could explain why subterranean diggers developed sight in the first place .

For Beavers , Days Get Longer in Winter

Beavers become near shut - ins during winter , living off of previously stored food or the deposits of fat in their distinctive tails .
A beaver conserves energy by avoiding the cold outdoors , opting instead to remain in dark lodgings inside their pile of wood and mud .
As a result these rodents , which normally emerge at sunset and turn in at sunrise , have no light cues to entrain their sleep cycle .
The beaver 's biological sense of time shifts , and she develops a " free running circadian rhythm " of 29 - hour days .
Such a shift in human circadian rhythm would mess with a human 's ability to sleep and function .
Birds Use Landmarks to Navigate Long Journeys

We humans have detailed maps , GPS navigation systems and even Siri to guide us wherever we 'd like to go .
Birds , smart as they are , have n't learned to use any of this technology .
Yet pigeons can fly thousands of miles to find the same roosting spot with no navigational difficulties .
Some species of birds , like the Arctic tern , make a 25,000 mile round - trip journey every year .
Many species use built - in ferromagnets to detect their orientation with respect to the Earth 's magnetic field .
A November 2006 study published in Animal Behaviour suggests that pigeons also use familiar landmarks on the ground below to help find their way home .
Still , much about bird navigation remains a mystery , according to this 2014 this perspective piece by University of Oxford researcher Tim Guilford .
Whale Milk Not On Low - Fat Diets
Two members of “ the best studied social unit of sperm whales in the world , ” Mother “ Fingers ” and her baby “ Thumb , ” swim together off the coast of Dominica .

Nursing a newborn is no small feat for the whale , whose calf emerges , after 10 to 12 months in the womb , about a third the mother 's length ( that 's a 30 - foot baby for the Blue whale ) .
The mother squirts milk into the newborn 's mouth using muscles around the mammary gland while the baby holds tight to a nipple ( yes , whales have them ) .
At nearly 50 percent fat , whale milk has around 10 times the fat content of human milk , which helps calves achieve some serious growth spurts — as much as 200 pounds per day .
It should be no surprise that whale moms then quickly teach their young where to eat on their own .
Crocodiles Swallow Stones for Swimming

The stomach of a crocodile is a rocky place to be , for more than one reason .
To begin with , a croc 's digestive system encounters everything from turtles , fish and birds to giraffes , buffalo , lions and even ( when defending territory ) other crocodiles .
In addition to that bellyful - o'- ecosystem , rocks show up too .
The reptiles swallow large stones that stay permanently in their bellies .
It 's been suggested these are used for ballast in diving .
Since you made it all the way , here are some bonus crocodile facts :
The largest croc ever found was 20.24 feet ( 6.17 m ) long .
These reptiles are cold - blooded , so in winter they hibernate .
A croc can lay up to 60 eggs at a time !

Lately I ’ve been developing a website .
One issue that I ’ll probably need to address in the near future is “ persistent predicates ” .
By “ persistent predicates ” I mean the problem of treating predicates as data .
Consider the following situation : you are developing some big rss reader / aggregator and you want to allow users to specify handling rules .
How would you keep these rules in memory , and how would you keep them on disk ?
Obviously , this problem was solved before .
Just consider email filters , or even packet filters in ethereal .
One way of approaching the problem is implementing simple predicate templates :
“ % field contains %s ” where field is subject , or body , etc .
Once that is accomplished , you can specify that a “ filter ” is some combination ( for example logical and , or logical or ) of multiple predicates .
To store this , we ’ll have an actual predicate table ( or pickle ) with their data , and a one - to - many mapping of filters to predicates .
Another option is allowing just some very simple predicates , and a filter will just “ point ” to ( have an id / name of ) the required predicate , and the required data .
In this option , all data is stored with the filter .
A more complicated solution is to implement some logical serialize - able lanugage ( such as the expression trees I used for diStorm or PyKoan ) .
Using this language , the predicates can be very dynamic , and be combined and manipulated programmatically .
This solution might be overkill for many projects though .
An interesting issue regarding handling of predicates , is their application to constraint solving .
However , this is an issue for a future post .
Suffice it to say , that when writing PyKoan I ’m using a constraint solver .
Since I ’m representing predicates with expression trees , the ability to analyze and manipulate predicates is very handy .
Besides looking at existing solutions , I ’m very curious to hear other peoples ’ opinions .
Feel free to write about your preferred solution in the comments .

SO THE FEDS NAILED you for insider trading .
Or maybe you lied to a grand jury to cover for your boss .
Either way , you ’re about to trade your tailored suit for an orange jumpsuit , and you ’re freaked .
Your trepidation is the livelihood of prison consultants , who , for a fee , will help prepare you for a stint in the pokey .
We asked a few of them to share their tips for surviving hard time .
Leggo your ego :
Be humble .
New prisoners will “ lock eyes with the wrong person and have problems , ” says Steven Oberfest , an ex-bouncer and personal trainer who wo n’t say what he did time for .
“ This is not Fifth Avenue and their penthouse anymore .
They ’re just a number . ”
Hard knocks :
Never enter someone ’s cell without permission , says Steve Scholl , a former management consultant who now goes by the moniker Dr. Prison .
“ It ’s about respect .
People get killed over that . ”
Presumed innocent :
Do n’t go asking what someone is in for , advises Oberfest .
Ask what he ’s accused of .
Ethnic cleansing :
Do n’t mix with prisoners of other races , Dr. Prison warns .
“ Things we do n’t even consider a problem between races here are a very extreme focus inside .
If there ’s a fight , every race needs to depend on their own race to protect them . ”
Sleeping dogs : “ Miserable people want to be miserable … treat them with extreme caution , ” advises Robert McDorman , a former Texas car dealer who did 26 months for federal bank fraud .
The best defense : Just in case , Oberfest says you must learn to “ drop someone incredibly fast . ”
Unwanted interest : Says Oberfest , “ If you bum a smoke and the guy with the cigarettes says , ‘ Sure , it ’s a twofer , ’ you should know a twofer means , ‘ I give you one for two , so now you owe me . ' ”
Alone time : Oberfest advises high - profile clients such as politicians to request solitary confinement , or even feign mental illness to get into the psych ward .
“ If you ’re segregated , you ’re going to have a much easier time . ”

This is a question that has been bouncing round in my head , probably for years .
Maybe I 've been visiting too many libertarian blogs .
But then again , maybe there 's something in it .
We 'll see .
A couple of things prompted me to write all this down .
Firstly a line in Jan Morris 's recent article about civil liberties on Comment is Free and secondly an article on gun control by an American campaigner called Dave Kopel .
Morris first .
Even the middle classes , once the very backbone of robust individualism , are not immune to the contagion .
They all think twice about expressing their views in case they say something that is politically incorrect .
She might as well have been speaking about me , because the idea that gun control might be behind our loss of civil liberties is deeply , deeply politically incorrect .
It 's an idea which is likely to get one labelled as a " nutter " .
A couple of years ago , I could n't have imagined holding this kind of belief .
But perhaps things are changing , now the civil liberties debate is in full flow , and maybe it 's time to try the idea out for size .
We 'll see .
Morris goes on the predict our eventual decline into submissiveness and eventually into totalitarianism .
A few more generations of nagging and surveillance and we shall have forgotten what true freedom is .
Young people will have foregone the excitements of risk , academics will temper all thought with caution , and the great public will accept without demur all restrictions and requirements of the state .
Ours will be a people moulded to docility , perfect fodder for ideologues .
And you can see it happening all around you as the surveillance state grows , and freedoms that we once took for granted are legislated into the history books .
It really is time to make a stand .
And what about Dave Kopel ?
Kopel is a libertarian writer and researcher ; he was formerly professor of law at New York University and the [ Update : an assistant ] attorney general for the state of Colorado .
Clearly then , he is a man of some intellectual stature .
However he is also a prominent supporter of the right of the American public to carry firearms and his stand on this issue would surely lead a majority of people in this country to categorise him as a " gun-nut " .
I 'm sure I am doing myself no favours by mentioning his ideas on this side of the Atlantic , but as I said , perhaps people might now be ready to consider a different view .
We 'll see .
Some weeks back , I came across an article Kopel co-wrote with another lawyer called All The Way Down The Slippery Slope : Gun prohibition in England and some lessons for civil liberties in America ( link ) .
Like Jan Morris , Kopel also sees Britain ceasing to care about civil liberties - he describes how a people can lose what he calls their " rights - conciousness " .
He then tries to explain this in terms of the history of gun control in the UK .
After tracing the history of gun ownership from its nineteenth century apogee to full prohibition today , Kopel sets out the effects of the ban on civil liberties in Part IX of the essay .
Although his view is that gun prohibition in Britain was not behind the loss of civil liberty , he doesn think that it played an important part :
[ A]ll civil liberties in Great Britain have suffered a perilous decline from their previous heights .
The nation that once had the best civil liberties record in Western Europe now has one of the worst .
The evisceration of the right to arms has not , of course , been the primary cause of the decline , although , as this Essay will discuss later , it has played a not inconsiderable role .
More generally , the decline of all British civil liberties appears to stem from some of the same conditions that have afflicted the British right to arms .
This section of the essay is worth reading just to feel the sense of incomprehension that Kopel has as he reels off the list of restrictions on their liberty that the British have allowed their rulers to inflict on them .
While Kopel makes a strong case against what is currently being called the salami slicing of civil liberties , his thesis that gun control has n't been a primary cause is starting to seem to me to be wrong , at least for some of the civil liberties problems we face .
Take CCTV .
Our city streets are , by common consent , violent , dirty unpleasant places for the most part .
Only young strong men are likely to feel safe in many parts of the country , and then only if they are in a gang .
As Justin Webb 's recent article on violence in America made clear , American streets just are n't like this .
Why is it then that so many Americans - and foreigners who come here - feel that the place is so , well , safe ?
A British man I met in Colorado recently told me he used to live in Kent but he moved to the American state of New Jersey and will not go home because it is , as he put it , " a gentler environment for bringing the kids up . "
This is New Jersey .
Home of the Sopranos .
Brits arriving in New York , hoping to avoid being slaughtered on day one of their shopping mission to Manhattan are , by day two , beginning to wonder what all the fuss was about .
By day three they have had had the scales lifted from their eyes .
I have met incredulous British tourists who have been shocked to the core by the peacefulness of the place , the lack of the violent undercurrent so ubiquitous in British cities , even British market towns .
" It seems so nice here , " they quaver .
Well , it is ! [...]
Ten or 20 years ago , it was a different story , but things have changed .
And this is Manhattan .
Wait till you get to London Texas , or Glasgow Montana , or Oxford Mississippi or Virgin Utah , for that matter , where every household is required by local ordinance to possess a gun .
Folks will have guns in all of these places and if you break into their homes they will probably kill you .
They will occasionally kill each other in anger or by mistake , but you never feel as unsafe as you can feel in south London .
It is a paradox .
Along with the guns there is a tranquillity and civility about American life of which most British people can only dream .
Webb is clearly surprised by this , but he deserves praise for telling it as it is .
To Americans it 's probably less of a shock .
The science fiction writer Robert A Heinlein was pointing out the connection between civility and arms as far back as 1942 , when one of his characters opined that " an armed society is a polite society " .
And when you think about it , the paradox that Webb sees is only on the surface .
As soon as you realise that noone in their right mind would get aggressive with or be rude to someone carrying a gun , it all becomes painfully obvious .
So in America , an armed people has retained old - fashioned manners and old - fashioned civil liberties .
This is the common law approach to public order that we used to have here .
Civil society was responsible for law and order , and every member of the public was required ( that 's required , not advised ) to intervene if they saw a crime being committed .
Perhaps partly because of that requirement people were able to carry arms for their defence .
An article from the Telegraph from a few years back tells the story of a group of Latvian anarchists who attempted a wages robbery in Tottenham .
Their intended victims fought back and they were forced to flee , pursued across London by a posse of doughty citizens , both armed and unarmed , who eventually apprehended them .
( The police had lost the key to their gun cupboard , and were unable to assist ) .
This is how it used to be .
However it simply does n't happen like this any more .
In the twentieth century we took an entirely different approach to firearms , with the freedom to go armed being steadily eroded by means of successive small legislative and administrative steps - what is now called " salami slicing " .
First there was licencing and registration , and then tighter and tighter restrictions on who could have a gun , followed by tighter and tighter restrictions on what guns they could have , and how many , and how they had to store them .
Eventually the populace was entirely disarmed , and now society can only fall back on the police for its defence .
The first thing to notice about this process is that it has reduced the number of law enforcement officers on the streets to a tiny fraction of what it was .
In the nineteenth century , as we 've seen , every adult was responsible for upholding the law and preventing crime .
Now we are , quite correctly , advised to leave all this to the police - obviously they are now the only ones with the wherewithal to come out alive from a brush with the criminal classes .
With such a devastating loss of policing manpower , there is now a fleetingly small chance of a law enforcement officer being on hand when a crime is committed .
This in turn has meant that the former state of affairs , where the law could intervene as a crime was committed or soon afterwards , has become impossible to pursue with conviction any longer .
There is simply not the manpower to do so .
With a horrible inevitability , the state has had to try to convince criminals not to commit crimes in ways other than presenting them with a risk of being caught in the act .
The traditional way of doing this was of course to make the punishments severe enough to discourage people , but with much of the middle classes persuaded that long prison sentences were illiberal , this approach too has suffered .
Capital and corporal punishment have likewise fallen by the wayside , and because of the same erroneous presumption that such punishments were irreconcilable with liberalism .
As a result , the state has had to resort to methods used in places where the state does n't have the confidence of the people .
It has taken on all the powers of surveillance that we would associate with a police state - CCTV , DNA database , warrantless searches , fingerprinting children , ID cards , in a desperate bid to convince criminals that the risk of being caught is so high as to make the effort pointless .
But with prison sentences handed out so sparingly , and so regularly cut short by parole boards , the criminal classes are simply not convinced that the risks outweigh the rewards .
They know where the CCTV cameras are and the crime wave simply shifts to somewhere less overlooked .
Looked at this way the root cause of the wave of authoritarian legislation which threatens to swamp us is not authoritarianism so much as " woolly liberalism " .
We wo n't punish criminals adequately , so we get more criminals .
We wo n't allow the law - abiding to uphold the law , so our streets get swamped with CCTV .
Witnesses can't defend themselves guns , so we have to allow anonymous evidence in court .
Women can't defend themselves from rapists , so they should n't go out alone .
The opinionated can't defend themselves from retribution , so better to legislate them into silence .
We find ourselves between the horns of a dilemma .
The idea of rearming the populace is greeted by most " right - thinking " members of the middle classes as evidence of a kind of madness , an idea to get you cast out from polite society .
" We do n't want to end up like America " , they will say , as they check the locks on their doors and windows , and test the burglar alarm one more time .
But the alternative is to continue our increasingly precipitous slide down the slippery slope that ends up with the UK resembling North Korea .
America or North Korea .
You decide .
Just when John McCain was trying to show the world -- well , at least the part that will vote come November -- that he 's a take - charge kind of guy , yet another one of his advisors is getting smacked around for his lobbying work .
The reports have been cropping up in several places , and you can absorb the details there , but from a campaign standpoint this looks to be part of a migraine that just wo n't end .
McCain has been persistently bedeviled by staff hires counter to his efforts to push the image of himself as a maverick reformer .
The issue this time is advisor Randy Scheunemann and his business partner , who apparently lobbied McCain or his staff dozens of times on behalf of -- and getting paid by -- Georgia .
As the Associated Press summed it up : " On April 17 , a month and a half after Scheunemann stopped working for Georgia , his partner signed a $ 200,000 agreement with the Georgian government .
The deal added to an arrangement that brought in more than $ 800,000 to the two - man firm from 2004 to mid-2007 .
For the duration of the campaign , Scheunemann is taking a leave of absence from the firm . "
McCain , of course , has warned Russia that its actions in Georgia could cost it " the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world , " and has called for the deployment of international peacekeepers in the region .
His staunch defense of Georgia -- regardless of how the showdown came about -- raises questions about the possible conflict of interest of Scheunemann , one of McCain 's top foreign policy advisors .
You 'll remember McCain 's own concerns about perceptions of conflicts for the lobbyists on his staff led to an very public internal purge in May .
Apparently , McCain missed one .

And here we have Fermat 's Last Post - it .
I 've talked about Fermat 's Last Theorem before , so al I need to do here is provide the appropriate link .
Looking at this again , I had no idea if Pierre de Fermat was even married , and thus might need to buy flowers for Mrs Fermat .
( I suppose the flowers could have been for his mother , but I prefer the thought that he was writing it in this list for his wife , if he had one ) .
I thought Wikipedia would provide the answer , but alas its article on Fermat is ( as of this writing ) utterly silent about the topic of whether he was married or not .
Which seems an odd oversight for an article about such a prominent person - if the facts are known .
A quick bit of searching found several articles , each of which contains a subset of details about Fermat 's private life .
Putting it all together , it seems that on the date 1 June , 1631 , at the age of 23 , Fermat married one Louise de Long , who was a fourth cousin of his mother Claire de Fermat ( née de Long ) , making her Fermat 's fourth cousin once removed .
Louise was 15 years old at the time of the marriage , turning 16 a month later .
The couple had eight children , five of whom survived to adulthood : two sons , Clément - Samuel and Jean , and three daughters , Claire , Catherine , and Louise .
According to one genealogy site , Louise ( Fermat 's wife , not the daughter of the same name ) lived until at least 1690 , outliving Fermat ( who dies in 1665 ) by at least 25 years .
Now , if anyone would like to do the research and tell me if Mr and Mrs Fermat in fact owned a cat , I would be most grateful .
Obama to accept nomination before 75 K - strong crowd Nick Juliano
Published : Monday July 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Convention speech to be held at Denver 's INVESCO Field at Mile High Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama will formally accept his party 's nomination before a crowd of 75,000 people at Denver 's football stadium , breaking the mold of party conventions that traditionally have included only party delegates and activists .
The Democratic National Convention Committee announced the venue change Monday , confirming days of speculation that Obama would move the convention 's closing events to INVESCO Field at Mile High , where the Denver Broncos play .
The rest of the convention will be at the Pepsi Center ; both venues are in downtown Denver .
" The Democratic Party is nominating a true change candidate this August , and it is only fitting that we make some big changes in how we put on the Convention , " said Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean said in a news release .
" Senator Obama 's candidacy has generated an enormous amount of excitement and interest , not only in the Democratic Party but also in the 2008 Convention .
By bringing the last night of the Convention out to the people , we will be able to showcase Barack Obama 's positive , people - centered vision for our country in a big way . "
The Democratic National Convention will be held August 25 to 28 .
Speeches and events for the first three days will be open only to credentialed Democratic delegates , volunteers , reporters and other invited guests .
A special block of " Community " credentials will be reserved for Colorado residents for Thursday night 's program at INVESCO Field , convention organizers said .
Details about how to sign up and receive a " Community Credential " for the last night of the Convention will be released in the coming weeks .
" This change in the Convention program will allow thousands of first - time participants a chance to take part , " said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , a convention co-chair .
" I can't think of a better Convention finale for our nominee who has made reaching out to voters a hallmark of his campaign . "
Across species , a common symptom of advanced age is loss of brain function .
Aging negatively affects a broad range of neural activity , including learning ( reflected in long - term potentiation ) , control of motor function , and memory .
Would n’t it be nice if we could slow that process down , or halt it altogether ?
A group at Kyushu University has managed to do just that .
By introducing a transgene encoding a human mitochondrial transcription factor into mice , Hayashi et al. have been able to delay the onset of age - related neurological decline , as measured in a number of different assays :
Reverse of Age - Dependent Memory Impairment and Mitochondrial DNA Damage in Microglia by an Overexpression of Human Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A in Mice Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is highly susceptible to injury induced by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
During aging , mutations of mtDNA accumulate to induce dysfunction of the respiratory chain , resulting in the enhanced ROS production .
Therefore , age - dependent memory impairment may result from oxidative stress derived from the respiratory chain .
Mitochondrial transcription factor A ( TFAM ) is now known to have roles not only in the replication of mtDNA but also its maintenance .
We herein report that an overexpression of TFAM in HeLa cells significantly inhibited rotenone - induced mitochondrial ROS generation and the subsequent NF - κB ( nuclear factor - κB ) nuclear translocation .
Furthermore , TFAM transgenic ( TG ) mice exhibited a prominent amelioration of an age - dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and a decline in the activities of complexes I and IV in the brain .
In the aged TG mice , deficits of the motor learning memory , the working memory , and the hippocampal long - term potentiation ( LTP ) were also significantly improved .
The expression level of interleukin - 1 β ( IL - 1 β ) and mtDNA damages , which were predominantly found in microglia , significantly decreased in the aged TG mice .
…
Together , an overexpression of TFAM is therefore considered to ameliorate age - dependent impairment of the brain functions through the prevention of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in microglia .
Note that the title is a little bit misleading — they did n’t “ reverse ” the age - related decline so much as prevent it ( unless I ’m misunderstanding something ; from what I could tell , the transgene was expressed from birth rather than turned on late in life ) .
The molecular details are still a mystery .
The HeLa data suggest that transgene - expressing cells produce less reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in response to electron transport poisons such as rotenone , but this could occur by a number of mechanisms : TFAM overexpression could result in boosted antioxidant defenses , or even simply an increase in the levels of electron transport proteins ( with higher levels of these proteins in the mitochondria , it would take higher doses of a given poison to cause the sorts of malfunctions that lead to ROS production ) .
Mechanism aside , the result still provides strong support for the idea that cellular oxidation — and in particular , mitochondrial damage — are important causative factors in the age - related decline in neurological function .
These transgenic animals , which show decreases in particular types of oxidative damage as well as significant delays in the deterioration of a wide variety of important brain functions , could help us identify the specific sorts of oxidative lesions that are the most important targets for intervention .
This stunning aircraft - that looks straight out of a science - fiction movie in which the Nazis won WWII - is the Boeing SkyHook JHL - 40 .
A heavy - lift rotorcraft designed to lift 40 tons , it can transport its cargo across 200 miles without refueling in adverse environments like the Arctic .
According to Boeing , it will be able to reach where no other kind of transport can go , at a fraction of the cost , with less environmental impact , and without danger to the crew .
Seeing it carrying massive tree trunks makes the JHL - 40 look even more impressive :

As you can see , the eight - engine aircraft has four vertical rotors to lift its neutrally buoyant body , plus four directional propellers under each rotor to direct it .
Boeing says that it will be very popular in the energy , mining , and logging industries .
Their pitch to environmentalists is that the JHL - 40 has a very reduced carbon footprint , and it does n't require to disturb remote lands with roads or other destructive transport methods ( that way , the aforementioned industries will be able to properly disturb remote lands only by mining and logging , as it should be . ) [ Boeing ]
The obesity epidemic has led to increased scientific interest in how the brain controls human feeding behavior .
Why do we get hungry ?
What biological mechanisms tell us what to eat and when to stop eating ?
It ’s long been assumed that two neurobiological mechanisms largely govern food intake : one that controls the need to eat and one that controls the desire to eat .
The hypothalamus in the brain regulates the homeostatic control of food intake by receiving , coordinating and responding to metabolic cues and signals from the digestive system .
By integrating these metabolic signals , the hypothalamus tells us when we need to eat to maintain a body weight “ set point , ” much like a thermostat set on a specific temperature .
It is clear , however , that higher brain centers that control the desire to eat also substantially influence our food consumption .
The dopamine reward system is one such brain center .
( When you covet a bowl of chocolate ice cream after dinner , a food that you do n’t need to eat for hunger but want to eat , it is your dopamine reward system that gets excited . )
In many situations , this desire to eat can override the need to eat , leading people to consume tasty foods even when they ’re not hungry .
Our inability to forego these rewarding aspects of food intake override long - term homeostatic control , contributing to obesity .
Eating for Reward vs. Survival
Although the hypothalamus will direct intake based on the metabolic value of the food — when you ’re very hungry , you seek out food with lots of calories — it remains to be determined whether the dopamine reward system can also sense a food ’s energy content .
In other words , does the dopamine system care about calories , or is it just concerned with taste and pleasure ?
Neuroscientist Ivan de Araujo and colleagues at Duke University ( de Araujo is now at the John Pierce Laboratory , a research institute affiliated with Yale University ) explored this question by using a line of mice genetically engineered to lack a functional receptor essential for detecting the taste of sweetness .
In these mice , any change in reward behavior cannot be due to food palatability or the sensation of sweetness .
If these mice prefer sweetness , thus , it is because sweeter foods have more calories , implying that there is something inherently rewarding about the consumption of calories .
In the first set of behavioral experiments , the authors showed that the genetically altered mice were completely insensitive to the “ sweet ” rewarding properties of sucrose ( table sugar ) and showed no preference for sucrose compared with water .
In contrast , control mice without the genetic mutation strongly preferred the sucrose solution .
The scientists then exposed the different strains of mice to a “ conditioning protocol ” in which the rodents received alternating access to water or sucrose for six days .
During these conditioning sessions , the genetically altered mice were able to associate the sweet solutions with caloric load post - ingestion , as the sugar water has more calories than plain water .
Interestingly , both strains of mice now consumed significantly more sucrose .
Although the genetically altered mice could n’t taste the sweetness , they learned to prefer the sweeter water .
This finding suggests that mice without functional sweet taste receptors were able to detect the reinforcing caloric properties of sucrose in the absence of sweet taste receptors .
There seems to be something inherently pleasurable about ingesting food that contains calories .
As a critical control , the experiments were then repeated with sucralose ( a.k.a. Splenda ) , an artificial sweetener that tastes sweet but contains no calories .
Although normal mice consumed more sucralose than water during the conditioning period — they still preferred the sweet taste — the genetically altered mice did not .
Sweetness as Reward
These results indicate that sensing metabolic value can influence feeding behavior .
It remained to be determined whether the dopamine reward system , known to respond to sweet taste , was also involved in calorie monitoring , however .
To address this important question , the authors showed that calorie load increases dopamine levels in an area of the brain called the nucleus accumbens independent of taste in genetically altered mice using a technique known as in vivo microdialysis .
Although both sucrose and sucralose increased dopamine above baseline in normal mice , genetically altered mice only showed an increase in dopamine with real sugar , indicating that caloric load ( and not the taste of sweetness ) was triggering their dopamine reward system .
Even though these results undoubtedly show that calorie load affects the brain dopamine reward system independent of taste in the genetically altered mice , normal mice show no greater dopamine release for sucrose compared with sucralose .
This discovery suggests that the presence of calories does not add more reinforcing power to the reward than taste alone .
Future studies are needed to clarify whether this calorie load component can affect obesity independent of the taste of food .
One important caveat must be mentioned ; all experiments involved food and water deprivation .
Thus , the observed activation of the dopamine reward system by calorie load in this paper may be affected by the food - restricted state of the mice .
This study raises many intriguing future questions .
How is calorie load sensed by the dopamine reward system ?
Do certain sugars ( for instance , fructose ) affect the dopamine reward system in different ways ?
Does the same phenomenon occur when calories come from different food types ?
For example , do calories from fat have a stronger affect ?
All of these questions are important to understand the underlying causes of human obesity .
Understanding the rewarding properties of certain foods will help us to design effective ways to restrict the desire to eat once the need to eat is fulfilled .
This study also adds to the growing body of information showing that metabolic cues are not solely the domain of the hypothalamus and that much more crosstalk occurs between metabolic cues and higher brain centers involved with the desire to eat than previously believed .
Thus , categorizing food intake as hedonic versus homeostatic may not only be redundant but misleading .
When it comes to eating , need and desire are n’t so separate after all .

The ugly scourge of ivory poaching has reappeared in Africa — at levels higher than the epic slaughters of 1989 .
Worse , the 7.4 percent annual death rate of 20 years ago was based on a population that numbered more than 1 million .
Today the total African elephant population is less than 470,000 .
Twenty years ago widespread media coverage of 70,000 elephants killed a year led to an international trade ban .
That resulted in strong enforcement efforts , which halted nearly all poaching immediately .
But Western aid was withdrawn four years after the ban and poaching gradually increased to the current disastrous rates .
Without anyone really noticing .
Except elephants .
Now a new study in the August Conservation Biology contends that most remaining large elephant groups will be extinct by 2020 unless renewed public pressure results in enforcement of the existing laws .
The good news : DNA evidence gathered from recent major ivory seizures shows conclusively that the ivory is not coming from all over Africa but from specific herds .
Consequently , authorities could beef up enforcement in those areas and make an immediate dent in the problem .
The illegal trade is being carried out mostly by large crime syndicates .
It ’s driven by growing markets in China and Japan , where ivory is in demand for carvings and signature stamps called hankos .
Good people of Asia , could you get over this fetish from the dark ages ?
No hanko is worth even one elephant .

Toddler ' starved to death by religious cult because he would n't say amen '
A toddler whose remains were found inside a suitcase was starved to death by religious cult members - including his mother - because he refused to say ' amen ' after meals , police said today .
Ria Ramkissoon and three other members of the group have been charged with the first - degree murder of her son Javon Thompson , whose body was found in April .
U.S. police and the family of Ramkissoon say that the group , based in Baltimore and called 1 Mind Ministries , is a cult .
Members of the religious group , based in Baltimore , above , are alleged to have dumped the child 's body in a suitcase
Javon 's food was stopped in December 2006 - when he was about 15 months old - partly because he refused to say ' amen ' after dinner , investigators were told by two children who had been taken away from the cult by Philadelphia police .
Members viewed Javon as ' a demon ' , the children said .
No medical care was sought for the toddler when he stopped breathing , and he died in his mother 's arms , according to court records of police interviews with the two children and another informant .
The anonymous informant told police that cult member Queen Antoinette then left the boy 's body in a room for more than a week , claiming ' God was going to raise Javon from the dead , ' court documents show .
Afterwards , Antoinette burned the clothing and mattress and placed his body in a green suitcase , which she would periodically open and spray with disinfectant to mask the stench , police say .
The group members allegedly left Baltimore early last year for Philadelphia , stowing the green suitcase and other luggage in a shed belonging to a man they had befriended .
Officers found the suitcase , containing the remains of a small child , in April after a tip - off .
They are now waiting for DNA tests to confirm the boy 's identity .
Ramkissoon , 21 , was awaiting a bail review today while being held in custody in a psychiatric ward .
The three other people charged over Javon 's death - Antoinette , 40 , also known as Toni Ellsberry or Toni Sloan ; Marcus Cobbs , 21 ; and Trevia Williams , who turns 21 on Tuesday - are already in custody .
They were arrested in May in New York on warrants charging them with failure to appear in court after a scuffle with police in a child custody dispute .
A fifth alleged cult member , Steven Bynum , has also been charged with first - degree murder but remains at large , police say .
He is believed to be in New York .
Ramkissoon 's family said she should not be held responsible for her son's death .
' She had no control over that situation at all , ' said her stepfather Craig Newton .
Her mother Seeta Khadan - Newton says Ramkissoon was not behind the decision to stop feeding the boy .
' My daughter was a victim , just like my grandson , ' Ms Khadan - Newton said .
' Somebody made that decision to not feed that child , and my daughter had to follow instructions . '
According to court documents , Ramkissoon joined 1 Mind Ministries after Javon was born .
Ms Khadan - Newton last saw her in April 2006 ; she later sued for custody of her grandson , writing in a letter to a judge that ' the cult leaders ' were preventing her from contacting her daughter .
Samba Team Releases Samba 3.2
The Samba Team is proud to announce the release of Samba 3.2 , a major new release of the award - winning Free Software file and print server suite for Microsoft Windows clients .
The Evolution of the Samba Platform
Samba 3.2 builds upon the success of Samba 3.0 by modernizing and enhancing the code whilst still retaining compatibility with all existing Samba installations .
Samba is the leading technology choice for Windows file serving on UNIX platforms and in embedded Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) solutions .
Samba is used by vendors selling NAS solutions ranging from high end clustered business - critical systems , to low end consumer devices , and everything in between .
Clustered File Server Support
Samba 3.2 , in conjunction with the ctdb libraries and a back - end distributed file system such as Sun 's Lustre , IBM 's GPFS or Red Hat 's GFS , can provide a fully clustered file server solution .
Every node is able to simultaneously serve an identical , consistent view of the exported file system .
Not just a simple " fail - over " high availability solution , Samba 3.2 with ctdb provides a scalable clustered file server solution with full Windows file sharing semantics .
Samba and ctdb are already being shipped in production file serving products to some of the most demanding customers in the world in fields such as animation and video production .
Easier Configuration
Samba 3.2 introduces a ' registry ' based configuration system .
This allows vendors embedding Samba in an appliance to more easily manage Samba configuration via the supplied commands or library functions without having to write scripts to modify a text file .
Improved Integration with Microsoft Windows
Samba 3.2 has been designed and tested to integrate with the latest Microsoft Windows clients and servers , such as Windows Vista service pack 1 , and Windows server 2008 .
Encrypted Network Transport
An innovation created by the Samba Team , Samba 3.2 has extended the CIFS / SMB protocol to allow transport encryption .
File system shares may now be marked as " encrypted " and all access to these shares is now encrypted over the network .
Standard GSSAPI encryption techniques are used to safeguard the data .
This extension to the CIFS / SMB protocol is open and available for other vendors to adopt without requiring patent licenses or other restrictions .
Reduced Memory Requirements
The memory footprint of Samba has been reduced by the use of the Samba developed " talloc " library , in order to allow greater use of Samba in embedded devices with limited memory requirements .
All restrictions on file name lengths have been removed .
IPv6 Support
The networking functions have been re-written to ensure Samba 3.2 is fully IP v6 compliant .
Customers may now use Samba in an IPv6 - only network , and it has been tested to work with Microsoft Windows ( R ) IPv6 implementations as well as UNIX ( R ) IP v6 implementations .
New Library Code
Samba 3.2 begins the migration of Samba from a monolithic application to a more modular architecture comprised of library functions which can be used to control and configure the Samba environment .
The new libnetapi library to control domain membership is one of the first examples of this new approach .
New Release Manager
Samba 3.2 marks the debut of Karolin Seeger as our new release manager , funded full time to work on Samba releases by SerNet GmbH .
The Samba Team is happy to welcome Karolin as a Team member , and we hope that Karolin will be driving our release process for many years to come .
Now Licensed Under the GNU GPLv3
The Samba Team has adopted the Version 3 of the GNU General Public License for the 3.2 and later releases .
The GPLv3 is the updated version of the GPLv2 license under which Samba is currently distributed .
It has been updated to improve compatibility with other licenses and to make it easier to adopt internationally , and is an improved version of the license to better suit the needs of Free Software in the 21st Century .
The original announcement is available on - line at
http://news.samba.org/announcements/samba_gplv3/
Getting Samba 3.2
Samba 3.2 is available now from the Samba Web site and all worldwide mirrors .

Nobel laureate Aleksander Solzhenitsyn accuses U.S. , NATO of encircling Russia
Nobel laureate and former Soviet dissident Aleksander Solzhenitsyn in a newspaper interview accused the United States and NATO of seeking to encircle Russia , and praised President Vladimir Putin for working to restore a strong state .
Nobel laureate Aleksander Solzhenitsyn accuses U.S. , NATO of encircling Russia
In a rare interview , the reclusive 87 - year - old author , who rose to prominence for his accounts of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin 's repression and labor camps , told the liberal weekly Moscow News that NATO 's ultimate aim was the loss of Russia 's sovereignty , according to a full text of the interview posted on its Web site edition Thursday .
" Though it is clear that present - day Russia poses no threat to it , NATO is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of Europe and surrounding Russia from the south , " Solzhenitsyn was quoted as saying .
" This involves open material and ideological support for ' color revolutions ' and the paraxodical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia , " he reportedly said , adding that there was " little substantial difference " between the actions of the U.S. and NATO .
" All this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle Russia and deprive it of its sovereignty , " Solzhenitsyn was quoted as saying .
Russia was furious at what it saw as Western encroachment on its home turf after a series of peaceful revolutions brought opposition leaders to power in the former Soviet republics Georgia , Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan .
Solzhenitsyn lashed out at the pro-Western government in Ukraine for its drive to obtain NATO membership , and said Russia would " never betray in any way the multimillion Russian population in Ukraine and renounce our unity with it , " according to report .
The author , known for his conservative Slavic views , accused former reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev of capitulating to the West , and Russia 's first post - Communist president , Boris Yeltsin , of pursuing the same policy as well as presiding over the massive theft of state resources and a descent into chaos .
But he said in the interview with Moscow News that Putin , a former KGB career intelligence officer who was elected in 2000 , was making efforts to restore Russia 's shattered statehood .
" Foreign policy , considering our current situation and possibilities , is being conducted sensibly and ever more forward - thinking , " Solzhenitsyn said .
" But owing to the heavy burden left by his predecessors , an awful , awful lot in Russia has yet to be lifted up from decline .
The overall state of people 's lives remains hard and chaotic , " he said .
Solzhenitsyn spent a decade in a labor camp and documented life in the camps in his best - known works , " One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich " and the " Gulag Archipelago " trilogy .
He won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1970 and was expelled from the Soviet Union four years later .
He lived in the U.S. state of Vermont until his 1994 return to Russia , three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
His profile as a moral arbiter and a literary star have declined since he returned and began criticizing the corruption and poverty of post - Soviet Russia .
He has kept a lower profile in recent years , giving few interviews and issuing few public statements , reports AP .

The passing of Pink Floyd ’s Richard Wright still remains a painful subject at Listening Post .

And eerie , considering that Pink Floyd ’s mind - blowing " Echoes , " written by all of the band members long before petty divisions tore them apart , was a perfect soundtrack to Clarke and Kubrick ’s 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
Pink Floyd ’s seminal Meddle was the first release in what was to be the band ’s storied run at the record books , and " Echoes " commanded the entire second half of the album .
It is an epic without peer in rock , which hordes of resourceful fans would eventually mash in near - perfect synchronization with 2001 ‘s storied finale " Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite . "
The phenomenon boasts its own fan site
and Wikipedia mention .
And while the band never came out and declared " Echoes " an intentional soundtrack to Clarke and Kubrick ’s film , Nicholas Schaffner ’s biography Saucerful of Secrets : A Pink Floyd Odyssey did little to beat down the rumors of a direct connection .
" Roger Waters , yet to balk at the sci - fi association , went so far as to say his ‘ greatest regret ’ was that they did n’t do the score for 2001 : A Space Odyssey , " the book explains , " parts of which , particularly in the long , mind - blowing hallucinatory sequence near the end , nonetheless sound remarkably Floydian . "
In honor of Wright ’s memory and compositional accomplishments , and thanks to the glorious wonder of YouTube , I present the synchronization here for your viewing pleasure .
It ’s hard to watch these clips without thinking of Wright ’s passing on Monday .
Here ’s hoping he ’s a happy space baby manning the synths at the Great Gig in the Sky .

Most holidaymakers come home feeling refreshed and with some happy snaps to remember their trip by .
But what Alan Evans unwittingly brought back with him after two weeks in Gambia with his wife Karen was more like something from a horror movie - and left him under the surgeon 's knife .
Days after he returned , on closer inspection of what he thought were six mosquito bites on his leg , he was terrified to see something wriggling under the surface of his skin .
And - look away now if you 're squeamish - it turned out to be maggots .
Scroll down for more ...
The bug hunter : Alan Evans looked at his bites under a magnifying glass ... and saw something moving under his skin
Yesterday Mr Evans , 50 , a petrol delivery driver , of Yatton , near Bristol , said : ' I started to feel really weak , as though something was sapping all the energy out of me .
' Then it felt like someone was stabbing me in the leg with a dagger .
' I was sure I could see something move under my skin and when I poked it , it went back down .
At one point it looked like a crab 's claw and I was petrified I had baby crabs growing inside me .
It was terrifying .'
His doctor at first diagnosed a course of antibiotics to treat what he thought was a tropical infection .
It was only when Mr Evans , frustrated that the irritation had not cleared up , bought a magnifying glass to examine the bites that he realised the skin- crawling truth that something was inside him .
He was referred to hospital , where it was established he had been infected by bot fly , which lays its eggs under the skin and feasts on live human cells .
Scroll down for more ...
What lies beneath :
The botfly larvae in all their gory glory
Under a local anaesthetic , four live maggots were cut out and sent to a lab for testing .
The other two maggots , already dead , were dressed with petroleum jelly and Mr Evans managed to squeeze their bodies out himself the following day .
He said : ' When I went to the doctors I got them to look at my leg through the magnifying glass for about ten minutes until they saw movement as well .
' When they got them out , it was really horrible to see them , but I was a relief at the same time that they were finally out of me .
' They think it was the bot fly .
I was told there was a 1 in 15 million chance of getting this . '
Mrs Evans , 47 , was bitten many times by mosquitos during the trip , but Mr Evans was only bitten on the last night .
He was later diagnosed with the rare disease myiasis , which is caused by parasitic larvae - more commonly called maggots - feasting on live cells of animals or humans and leaving painful boil - like sores .
Scroll down for more ...
Unwanted souvenir :
The bites he received in Gambia caused agonising , stinging pains in Mr Evans 's leg
A mosquito will carry the bot fly eggs , and when it bites the skin , will drop the eggs and they burrow under the skin 's surface .
They stay just below the surface to breathe , and the most common treatment is to cut off their air supply with vaseline - so they will crawl out .
Untreated , they can burrow too far down and need to be cut out before they develop into flies .
Contracting the condition is highly unlikely , and the only reported cases are from tropical areas , mainly Africa and South America .
Dr Ron Behrens of the London Hospital of Tropical Diseases sees two or three myiasis patients per month at his clinic , all of whom have returned from tropical areas .
He said : ' It can occur in anyone .
A mosquito drops the bot fly 's eggs onto the skin .
The bot fly does n't come into contact with the person , the mosquito does it , as a third party .
' The pupae then burrow under the skin - often the scalp , legs or groin area - and feed off it , but stay close to the surface so they can breathe .
' Flies can also lay their eggs on clothing hanging out to dry , so we recommend ironing it beforehand , if you 're staying in a tropical area .
' They would have been growing bigger under this man 's skin , which makes it very painful .
After a couple of weeks they develop into flies , and are moving around - which is very unpleasant .
But luckily it can be successfully treated . '
Mr and Mrs Evans were planning to return to Gambia later in the year but have been advised not to return in case Mr Evans contracts an infection .
My view of Mr. Gore ’s passionate engagement with some of the biggest issues of our time is that he is offering us the kind of vision and sense of urgency that has been so lacking in the presidential campaigns .
But the tendency in a society that is skeptical , if not phobic , about anything progressive has been to dismiss his large ideas and wise counsel , as George H. W. Bush once did by deriding him as “ ozone man . ”
The naysayers will tell you that once again Al Gore is dreaming , that the costs of his visionary energy challenge are too high , the technological obstacles too tough , the timeline too short and the political lift much too heavy .
But that ’s the thing about visionaries .
They do n’t imagine what ’s easy .
They imagine the benefits to be reaped once all the obstacles are overcome .
Mr. Gore will tell you about the wind blowing through the corridor that stretches from Mexico to Canada , through the Plains states , and the tremendous amounts of electricity that would come from capturing the energy of that wind  enough to light up cities and towns from coast to coast .
“ We need to make a big , massive , one - off investment to transform our energy infrastructure from one that relies on a dirty , expensive fuel to fuel that is free , ” said Mr. Gore .
“ The sun and the wind and geothermal are not going to run out , and we do n’t have to export them from the Persian Gulf , and they are not increasing in price .
Image Bob Herbert
“ And since the only factor that controls the price is the efficiency and innovation that goes into the equipment that transforms it into electricity , once you start getting the scales that we ’re anticipating , those systems come down in cost . ”
The Icare motorcycle concept is a cross between something from Tron and " a kind of Porsche or Aston Martin for the two - wheeled world , " according to France - based Enzyme Design , the minds behind the concept .
It 's intended to have a six - cylinder 1.8 liter Honda engine , which is more than what you 'd find in some compact cars .
Will it ever go into production ?
No word , but Enyzme 's earlier L'atomo concept did , so future bikers will have some hope .

Galapagos Photography Tips
Peter Norvig , 2019
Are you a photographer considering a trip to Galapagos and wondering what it will be like ?
This page is for you ; I 've been three times and am sharing my experiences here .
I 've taken photos like the ones in the ( clickable ) thumbnails below , or see my gallery ( or the slideshow version ) .
The Routine
You live aboard a ship .
A typical day :
Time Event 5:30 breakfast on ship 6:00 - 10:00 a shore landing for animal / landscape viewing 10:30 - 11:30 snorkeling or panga ride or kayaking 12:30 lunch , then a break ; ship may travel to nearby destination 14:00 - 18:00 another shore landing ( and maybe snorkling ) 18:30 dinner aboard ship , followed by a presentation by the naturalist or photographer 24:00 ship starts cruising to the next island
There are naturalist tours and photographic tours .
If you 're on this page , you 're probably a serious photographer , but even if you are not , I still recommend the photographic tour .
First , because you just see more on a photographic tour .
The photographer will have you out on the island at 6:00 AM to catch the first attractive morning light ; the naturalist will assume you would prefer to sleep later , and thus spend less time on shore with the animals .
Once on land , the naturalist guide wants to keep things moving , while a photographer guide slows things down , allowing you to spend more time at each site .
And second , because our photographer guide , Tui de Roy , was fantastic !
Tui ( pictured at right with a tour member ) arrived in Galapagos at the age of two when her parents decided to homestead there ; she has spent most of her life exploring , playing , understanding , and photographing the islands .
Her multiple books establish her as the premier Galapagos photographer .
It 's like taking a tour of Yosemite with Ansel Adams .
We were on the 16 - passenger Tip Top IV .
I would avoid the large 100 - passenger cruise ships .
Here 's our ship and a panga ( aka zodiac boat ) used to transport us to shore :
The Route
Ships in Galapagos are assigned a 14 day strictly regimented island - by - island route by the Galapagos National Parks Service .
Tour providers can package this as one two - week tour , two one - week tours , or whatever .
Here is our two - week route with Galapagos Travel .
What will you see , and where ?

What Photo Equipment to Bring ?
Here 's what I brought on each trip .
I used Canon gear , but if you have a similar setup ( camera , long lens , and wide lens ) from Nikon , Sony , Fuji , Olympus , or Panasonic then do n't worry , you 'll do fine .
Equipment 2008 Trip 2014 Trip 2019 Trip Camera : Canon 5D Canon 6D Canon R Wide lens : 17 - 40 mm f/4 16-35 mm f/4 16-35 mm f/4 Long lens : 100-400 mm I Tamron 150-600 mm 100-400 mm II Underwater : Canon G9 Sony RX 100 GoPro Backup Camera : Canon G9 Canon 7D Canon 7D II , Pixel 3 phone Shared lenses : 24-105 mm 24-70mm
70-300 mm L 70-200 mm f/2.8
400 mm f/
4
For the 2014 trip , each day I would carry one long lens ( 150 -600 more often than 70-300 ) and one wide ( 16 - 35 more often than 24 - 70 ) .
On the 2019 trip some days I would have the 100 - 400 mm II and my wife would have the 70 - 200 mm , other days we would swap .
Some days I also carried the 400 mm f / 4 .
The 16 - 35 mm was my only wide lens ( except for my cell phone ) .
I never carried two cameras at a time with lenses attached ; I felt that would be cumbersome with all the scrambling over rocks .
I generally kept the long lens on the camera ( just in case there was some action in the distance I wanted to quickly capture ) and when it was time for a wide angle shot I would change lenses , get the shot (s ) , then change back .
I was very glad to have backup equipment ( shared between me and my wife ) back in the cabin for variety 's sake , and in case anything broke ( even though nothing did ) .
What Focal Lengths Did I Shoot ?
Below are charts of the focal lengths of all the shots that I considered the best from each trip , broken out by lens .
For each trip there are two charts , one for actual focal length as recorded in the EXIF data , and one for 35 mm - equivalent focal length after cropping .
By that I mean , if the focal length on the lens is set at 200 mm , but I crop the photo down to half the size in both vertical and horizontal directions , then the equivalent focal length is 400 mm .
This tells me what focal length I wanted to have when I was getting the shot , not what lens I happened to have in hand .
In the charts below , each mark corresponds to one of my best shots : the x-axis position gives the focal length , and the color gives the lens , as defined in the legend .
For example , the 14 blue dash - marks in the lower left corner of the first chart ( 2008 ) correspond to shots taken with the 17 - 40 mm lens ; 9 of them are at 17 mm , and then 5 at longer focal lengths .
There are just 3 orange marks for the 24 - 105 mm lens ( the backup that I used just one day ) , and 57 green marks for the workhorse 100 - 400 mm lens ; we see that many of the shots are right at the 400 mm long end of the lens .
In the next chart , we see that many of these 400 mm shots have been cropped to longer focal equivalents ; some past 800 mm .
A similar pattern holds for the 2014 and 2019 trips : whether my zoom goes to 300 , 400 , or 600 mm , there are many times when I want to go longer .
In the final two charts , all the shots for all lenses over all trips have been combined .
For me , covering the 24-300 mm range would not have been enough ( whether with a single superzoom or with two lenses , 24 - 70 mm and 70-300 mm ) .
6 % of my best shots were wider than 24 mm , and fully 50 % were longer than 300 mm .
Lens Selection : Long Lens
The animals in Galapagos are famously tame ; you can walk right up to them .
Indeed , at times you have to be careful not to step on them .
So why do you need a long lens ?
Well , as Thom Hogan points out , " It 's not a matter of not being able to get close to the animals .
Instead , it 's a matter of getting close to the animals when they 're doing something you want to capture . "
Since you 're not allowed to go off the trail , and since the interesting action might be farther away and fleeting , you need a long lens to capture it .
Also , if you want a nice portrait of an animal you 'll want a long focal length to eliminate distracting elements ( brush , sky , other animals , tourists ) , and a wide aperture to blur out the background .
On the other hand , you will be walking around for hours , so you want something that is not too big and heavy to carry .
The following table compares four choices for the Canon system ( other brands have similar offerings ) .
I give the lens , its maximum aperture ( f ) , minimum focus distance ( MFD ) , DxO Mark overall image quality score ( which is suggestive , not definitive ) , retail price , weight , and appropriateness for use in Galapagos ( in my opinion ) :
Lens f MFD DxO Price Weight Comments Canon 100-400 mm II f/5.6 3 ft 26 $ 2,100 1.6 kg ( 3.5 lb )
The best overall option in the Canon system .
Canon 70-300 L f/5.6 4 ft 25 $ 1,300 1.0 kg ( 2.3 lbs )
High image quality , light weight , may not be long enough .
Tamron 150- 600 mm f/6.3 8 ft 19 $ 1,100 2.0 kg ( 4.3 lbs )
Good but not perfect image quality , longer range , heavier .
Canon 70 - 200 mm f/2.8 II f/2.8 4 ft 33 $ 1,900 1.5 kg ( 3.3 lbs ) Only 200 mm ( or 280 mm with a 1.4x TC ) ; great in that range .
All of these lens are very good .
If you have any one of these ( or the equivalent in another camera system ) , do n't worry , you have all the tools for a successful photographic trip to Galapagos .
Do n't obsess over lens reviews : I never once said to myself " I wish I had a lens that was one point sharper on the DxO benchmark . "
But when I was carrying the 70 -200 mm I sometimes said " I wish I could reach to 400 mm or longer . "
In more detail :
Canon 100-400 mm
II
I think this is the best overall long lens option for Galapagos ( in the Canon system ) .
Light enough to easily handhold , great focal range , excellent image quality except for a slight tendency towards fiddly backgrounds , as is expected for an f /5.6 lens .
Samples :
( In photos throughout this page , you can hover to see the shooting data , and click through for a bigger version . )
Canon 70-300 mm L IS : In 2014 I carried the small and lightweight 70 - 300 mm when I knew subjects would be close and large ( like sea lions ) or when I wanted to be more agile ( like when we were in a crowded panga trying to track diving pelicans ) .
Samples :
Tamron 150-600 mm : In 2014 I carried this when I knew subjects would be small or far away .
This lens gets mixed reviews ; I think the real issue is that focusing at 600 mm without solid support is inherently difficult — much more difficult than at 300 mm .
This lens is heavy , but I had no problem at all carrying it from a shoulder sling strap and hand - holding it all day .
As the focal length chart above shows , I certainly took good advantage of the 600 mm range on this lens .
However , I still think the 100 - 400 mm is a better overall choice , because it ( a ) is smaller and lighter , ( b ) has better image quality in the 100 - 400 mm range , and ( c ) paired with a good camera , it produces images that can stand cropping to the equivalent of a 600 mm range .
( Note : Tamron updated this lens in 2016 , Sigma has two similar lenses , Nikon has a 200 - 500 mm , Sony has a 200 - 600 mm , and Canon has preannounced a 100 - 500 mm . )
Samples :
Canon 70 - 200 mm f/2.8 II : A fantastic portrait lens ; the only f/2.8 lens among the options ; has the capability to blur the background better than the f /5.6 lenses .

Mind the Gap ?
What about the gap between your wide and long lens ?
If you have the 17 - 40 mm and 70 - 300 mm , then the 40 - 70 mm gap is not worth covering with another lens ; just take a few steps forward or back .
If you have the 16 - 35 mm and 150 - 600 mm then you might want something in the 35 - 150 mm gap ( perhaps a 24 - 105 mm or 70 - 200 mm lens , or a 85 mm prime , or a quality compact or mirrorless camera ) .
Lens Selection : Wide Angle
The 17 - 40 mm and the 16 - 35 mm both did fine .
More important than the slight differences between lenses is the types of shots you can get with whatever lenses you have .
You 'll see an interesting animal or landscape ; how should you record it ?
Here are some options .
Shots : Open Landscape
We can show the expanse of the landscape at a 16 mm or 17 mm focal length .
( A 24 - 70 mm zoom would have cut off 1/3 of these shots . )
Shots : Landscape with Foreground Element
Capture the landscape in the background , and feature some flora , fauna , or mineral in the very near foreground :
You are not allowed to stick a camera right in an animal 's face .
( National Park rules say everyone is supposed to keep a 2 meter radius away from animals , except for those of us from the United States , who , in another example of US imperialism , are only required to keep 1.83 meters away .
The signs call this " six feet . " )
However , you are allowed to sit in place and wait for a curious animal to approach :
You can sometimes get a humorous effect with the right juxtaposition of foreground and background — forced perspective makes the juvenile frigate bird look like a giant , and the fuzzy white frigate bird chick looks goofy from any angle , but this one accentuates it :
Or you can just show that the animals are in an environment that includes people in close proximity :
Shots : Landscape with Many Elements
Some shots show what it is like to be there ; there are animals in the shot , but they are not featured .
Shots : Eye Level
Most animals in the Galapagos are small ( ok , not the whale shark ) ; they look better if you get down to eye level .
This can be done with either a wide angle lens ( shoot the marine iguana with camera perched on the sand ; crawl on your belly or use live view to compose the image on the LCD ; so much the easier if you have a fold - out LCD ) or a long lens ( adopt a sitting position 30 feet from the tortoise and you will still be at eye level ) .
Shots : Portraits
Using a longer lens you can isolate an animal , with a blurred background serving as a colorful backdrop — just enough to show that this is in the wild , not in a studio .
Shots : Details
You do n't need to show a portrait of the whole animal .
Galapagos has several species with eponymous body parts , and other interesting details .
Shots : Behavior
Sometimes you catch the decisive moment , like the Noddy landing on the pelican 's head to hunt for the small fish that the pelican stirs up , or these two young sea lions playing .
Shots : Birds in Flight
Capturing birds in flight requires decent equipment , good technique , and lots of practice .
Use continuous autofocus , with multiple autofocus assist points ( zone focus ) .
Start with large , slow - moving birds like pelicans and frigate birds .
It is easier to focus on a bird against a blank sky than against a busy background , but try to include some interesting background , if only some clouds .
Next try smaller , faster , but still smooth flying birds like the swallowtail gull or albatross .
I 've used a shutter speed of 1/2000 sec to freeze the motion .
Also work on more interesting backgrounds .
A real challenge : the small , fast , darting Tropic Bird ( this one flew so close that I clipped a wing ) , and the Galapagos Shearwater , here shown banking frantically with its tail - feathers as it skirts the edge of the cliff :
Also challenging is getting the exact moment when a diving bird hits the water .
Boobies may need a shutter speed of 1/4000 second .
Put the focus points on the bird as it cruises , then fire a continuous burst of shots as it dives , trying to keep the focus point on the bird .
You may be used to panning on a constantly - moving subject ( like a running person or animal ) , but the hard part here is that the bird is accelerating — because of gravity , and with the boobies , there is extra acceleration because they actively fly downward .
It can be hard to keep your camera framed on the bird .
The pelicans were diving at about 20 to 30 ft/sec .
They are about 4 feet long , so if your camera shoots 10 frames / sec and if you can hold focus , you 'll be guaranteed to get one shot of the bird just above the water and the next splashing .
If your camera only does 5 frames / sec you 'll need some luck .
Boobies are smaller and faster , and depending on how high up they start their dive , can reach 30 to 80 feet per second , so even at 10 frames / sec , you might miss the key moment .
Below are four examples that combined good luck with not making any big mistakes ; I wo n't show the many , many shots that were too early , too late , out of focus , or mis-framed :
This is a great example of the advantage of the photographic tour : in 2008 , the naturalist told us that it would be difficult to get a good picture of a diving bird , so we did n't spend much time even trying .
Tui de Roy knew that all the photographers wanted to try , so she spent a lot of time getting us in just the right location to give us the best chance .
Shots : Lighting
You 're on the equator : much of the time the sun will be overhead .
Try to avoid stark shadows ( except for effect as in below bottom right ) .
Look for subjects in shade , or under cloudy skies .
Another advantage of the photographic tour is that you spend more time ashore near sunrise and sunset , when the light is more interesting .
Do consider side or back lighting , which can either be used to highlight edges and shine through , as with the cactus and the pelican 's pouch , or for a silhouette , as with the three iguana pictures , or for shadows as with the humans :
Bokeh : The Good , The Bad , and the Fiddly
I said that the 100 - 400 mm lens covers a great focal range .
But it does have a weakness : a limited ability to blur the background .
That 's not really a criticism of this particular lens ; it holds for other f/5.6 lenses as well .
They just can't do as well as an f /2.8 lens at getting a nice smooth background .
Consider the following two shots :
On the left , the 100 - 400 mm f/5.6 lens produces a very sharp image of the iguana , contrasting nicely with the rock behind the head .
But the background has various sticks that are not well - blurred ; they produce a busy , unpleasing disruption .
On the right , the 70 - 200 mm f/2.8 lens produces a much smoother , more pleasing blur in the background .
The quality of the blur is called bokeh .
The background on the right is nicer in part because of the inherent properties of the lens , and in part because the background is farther away and consists of roundish rocks , not straight sticks .
It is also possible to blur the foreground , although this technique should be used with care lest the foreground become a distraction .
Below left I have used the trick of getting down low and using a rock in the foreground very near the camera to create a wash of grey in front of the iguana .
Below right I use a similar approach with a wash caused by vegetation very close to the camera ; the vegetation on the left edge of the frame is closer to the frigate bird subject , and thus is not blurred .
Besides blurred backgrounds and foregrounds , another aspect of bokeh is specular highlights from reflections off of water or shiny material .
Below left we see the backlit sun reflecting off the ocean ; this adds interest to a photo that would be dull without the highlights .
Below right we see reflections off of sparkly bits of sand and minerals in the rocks , making it look like a horde of dragon 's gold ( both photos are better viewed at larger size ; click on them ) .
Below is Markus Fromherz 's photo of the making of this iguana shot ; I 'm the one sitting with the greyish backpack ; I 'm composing on the fold - out screen , getting my lens close to the rock and sand in front of it .
Rachel to my right does n't have a fold - out screen , so she is lying on the ground .
Cell phone photos
Cell phones in 2019 come with quite capable cameras ; that was n't true in 2008 or 2014 .
They wo n't give you a telephoto image with a blurred background , but if you want a 28 mm equivalent focal length with everything sharp , they can do the job .
And it can be more convenient to quickly pull out a cell phone than to change lenses .
Lens Selection : Supertelephoto ?
Many pros ( e.g. Tui de Roy , Frans Lanting , Tim Laman , and Art Morris ) have used heavy , expensive supertelephoto lenses in Galapagos .
But even though he sometimes carries one , Tim Laman advises that for you and me , " a good setup would be ... a 24-105 mm , and ... a 100-400 f5.6 . "
( I agree but would substitite a 16 - 35 mm for the 24 -105 mm . )
Andy Williams says supertelephotos " are way too heavy and difficult to handle and use on the Islands in Galapagos . "
Up until 2014 Tui de Roy lugged her Nikon 200 - 400 mm f/ 4 on a tripod because she was not satisfied with the quality of Nikon 's original 80 - 400 mm lens .
But once she got the much - improved 80 - 400 version II , she ditched the tripod and heavy lens , saving about 8 pounds and a lot of trouble .
For the record , here are three choices in the supertelephoto category , compared to three telephoto lens discussed previously :
We see that the supertelephotos cost 5 or 10 times as much , weigh around twice as much , are a stop or two faster , and have image quality that is maybe 15 % better .
If you own a supertelephoto lens , you presumably know exactly what you 're doing and you do n't need any of my advice .
But if you are considering something to rent for the trip , I would still recommend the 100 - 400 mm II , which is easier to handle , covers a wider range , and has image quality that is nearly as good .
But judge for yourself : would you be comfortable shooting like Art Morris ( below left ) or Tim Laman ( below right ) , knowing that your pack would be 15 pounds heavier and your wallet $ 12,000 lighter ?
( Note : Art has been know to carry the 200 - 400 mm , the 400 mm DO , the 500 mm , the 600 mm , and even the 10 pound 800 mm in Galapagos .
He can make great photos with just about any lens that is big and white and has an affiliate link . )
For me ( in Galapagos ) I only want a lens I can comfortably hand - hold , so the only supertelephoto I would consider is the 400 mm f/4 , which I did bring in 2019 .
It can nicely blur the background : check out the sand around the mockingbird below left ; a much better performance than the f /5.6 lens used for the mockingbird below right :
The 400 f/ 4 only weighs one pound more than the 100 - 400 mm , so the issue is not so much the weight of the lens itself , rather that with it I also carry a teleconverter , my wide lens ( 16 - 35 mm ) , and because the 400 mm is not a zoom , I need something in between , like the 70 - 200 mm .
That means I need a hefty backpack to carry everything , rather than just a belt pouch for one spare lens .
So I ended up taking the 400 mm lens only on days when I knew it would be especially useful .
( One thing that discouraged me from using it more often is that on the first day I got a persistent spot of dust on my sensor ; from then on I tried to minimize the number of times I changed lenses , and so preferred zooms over a prime . )
Specialty Lenses
The only three key things you need to cover are wide , long , and wet , but there are some exotic options to consider :
Ultrawide : Tui de Roy used a fisheye lens to good effect , as did my friends Rachel and Stephen , as well as Galapagos expert Frank Sulloway .
You can also get a rectilinear lens as wide as 11 mm , or you can stitch multiple shots into a panoramic photo ( either in - camera or in - phone or with external software ) .

360 degree : a 360 degree camera like the Ricoh Theta puts together two 180 degree fisheye lenses to capture everything ( still or video ) ; software lets you explore in virtual reality .

Macro : I would not bother bringing a dedicated macro lens to Galapagos .
I would make good use of something like the Canon 100 - 400 mm II lens , which can zoom in close enough to fill the frame with a subject only 4.5 inches across ( whereas similar competing lenses can get no closer than about a 7 inch field of view , and a true macro lens gets all the way down to a 1.5 inch field of view ) .

Microscopic :
On our 2019 trip , Steve Mandel and Heike Schmitz took samples of ocean water in different locations and recorded the microscopic life as part of an oceans diversity research project .
Below is a panoramic made with Lightroom photo merge , a near - macro of a bee from the 100 - 400 mm lens , and some diatoms in the microscope ( courtesy of Steve Mandel ) :
Camera Selection
This is easy : if you already have a recent interchangeable lens camera ( DSLR or mirrorless , full - frame , crop or micro - 4/3 , any manufacturer ) you 'll be fine .
Do n't worry about it .
( OK , I admit a higher - end camera does give you a slight advantage for fast - moving birds in flight , but that 's the only circumstance on Galapagos where your camera might limit you . )
Below are four setups : a full - frame Canon DSLR with 100 - 400 mm lens ( similar to what I used ) ; a full - frame Sony mirrorless with 100 - 400 mm lens ( similar to what my friend Steve Mandel used in 2019 and let me borrow a few times — I found little difference between the Sony and Canon systems ) ; a micro -4/3 camera ( whose sensor is about 1/4 frame ) with a 100 - 400 mm equivalent lens ; and , for comparison , a non-interchangeable - lens bridge camera ( the Sony RX10 , whose sensor is about 1/7 frame ) with a 24 -600 mm equivalent zoom .
You can also see a comparison of smaller , less expensive APS -C options .
Let 's face it , if you 've read this far through this techno - geeky page , you 're probably not the kind of person to trust your photos to a bridge camera .
But if you ( or other people in your party ) are , take a look at this trip report from Point & Shoot Nature Photographer and see if results like the tropic bird picture below left , taken by Steven Ingraham with a Sony RX10 , are satisfactory .
If you do n't look too close , there 's not all that much difference between bridge and full - frame :
But with the bridge camera , that 's about all the detail you get ( at least from this particular shot ) , whereas the full - frame camera has a lot more detail when you zoom in :
Underwater Camera Selection
Once or twice a day you will have a snorkeling opportunity .
You will see many fish , playful sea lions , sea turtles , sharks , and probably penguins and marine iguanas in the water .
People on our trip had different approaches .
Some chose to enjoy the experience without bothering with pictures ; some brought a GoPro ( great for video ) ; some brought a waterproof camera ; some had an underwater housing .
I have two suggestions for underwater : first , shoot mostly video , not stills .
Video is more forgiving of bubbles or particles in the water and of slightly blurred subjects .
Second , the most important thing for good underwater pictures is not the choice of camera , but the ability to dive down 5 to 15 feet , get your camera at the level of your subject , and stay there long enough to frame and take your shot or movie .
So do n't spend time comparing underwater camera options ; spend it practicing holding your breath and moving under water .
You typically wear a wetsuit in Galapagos which makes you buoyant , so ask your tour operator ahead of time to stock a weight belt for you , to make you more neutrally buoyant .
Bring your own wetsuit or arrange ahead of time to rent one .

Sunscreen and hat : do n't forget .
Our guide says the number one source of injuries in Galapagos is not any dangerous animal , not the sharp lava rocks , but rather the sun .

Backpack :
There are three different venues in which you need to think about how to carry your gear : ( 1 ) through airports , where you 'll want to carry - on everything in a big photo backpack or roller bag ; ( 2 ) on the island , where there are many options that work : a small backpack or sling bag , a belt system or fanny pack , a photo vest , a shoulder sling or harness ; and ( 3 ) while getting in and out of boats .
Landings are either wet — the boat lands on a beach and you step into calf - high water or dry — you step off the panga onto rocks which are usually wet and slippery , but not actually submerged .
Either way , I recommend having a waterproof backpack or dry sack — do n't try to carry your uncovered camera in and out of the panga .
( And in the rainy season , February to April , bring a camera rain cover . )

Memory : Bring enough memory cards , and a laptop with enough storage space on internal or external drives .
Store at least two copies of your pictures , and keep them in separate places .
For reference , I shot about 600 pictures a day , and immediately deleted 2/3 of them back in the cabin .
( I realize that some people have a policy of never deleting anything , and that pictures - per - day can vary from 20 to 2000 .
Plan according to your needs . )

Three Times ?
Seriously ?
Ads for Galapagos trips frequently mention trip of a lifetime , so if I 've been three times , am I a cat working on nine lives ?
No .
In 2008 , my wife and I thought it would be an interesting destination , and so did my daughter Juliet and my brother and sister in law .
We all had a great tour led by Etienne and Elizabeth De Backer .
Subsequently , we heard from photographer friends that the best way to visit Galapagos is with Tui de Roy .
We gave this advice to our friends Rachel and Stephen who were considering a trip , and somewhere along the way a plan emerged that we would all go together .
Tui and Martin Loyola led the tour .
By 2019 , other friends had heard about how great our previous trip was , and before we knew it , we had filled an entire 15 passenger boat with friends who wanted to go .
How could we miss out on getting the gang together for one more trip ?
This time Tui was joined by Andres Cadena as the naturalist guide ; he was the best of the bunch .
All three trips were through Galapagos Travel .

Imagine a world without trust , where personal interactions exist at face value and veiled intentions go unnoticed .
New research suggests that people with borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) see the world in this way .
People with BPD typically have trouble controlling urges and keeping friends , and the syndrome hits women disproportionately .
When sufferers of BPD – which is responsible for up to a fifth of all psychiatric inpatients – play a two - person economic game that depends on cooperation , they play as if they are blind to subtle signs of distrust from a player without the condition .
The finding , supported by brain scans showing reduced activity in an area of the brain cued to social norms , could give psychiatrists a better diagnostic tool and a brain area to target with therapy or drugs when treating BDP , says project leader Read Montague , a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston .

Trust test
The game is simple .
Two players , an “ investor ” and a “ trustee ” , sit in different rooms where they can’t interact , except through the computer game .
The investor lends up to $ 20 to the trustee , who triples the investment and then decides how much to give back .
So an outlay of $ 20 would return $ 60 .
If the trustee returned $ 40 – a $ 20 windfall for each player – an investor might continue her generosity .
If , however , the trustee skimps , repaying only $ 20 and keeping the rest , future investments may fall in value .
In healthy people and those with BPD , skimping on repayments inevitably happens toward the end of a game .
“ It ’s not a matter of whether cooperation breaks down , but when , ” Montague says .
To counter such plummeting investments , healthy trustees learned to coax the cooperation of their partners with excessive returns – say giving back $ 14 on a $ 5 investment .
As a result of the good will , the next four investments stayed high , Montague and colleague Brooks King - Casas found .
But trustees with BPD did not pick up on this strategy , and as a result their late game returns stayed low .
Diagnostic tool
A functional - MRI brain scanner helped explain the different outcomes .
When normal trustees received an excessively low investment – a sign of mistrust – a region of the brain called the insula went into action , compared to its activity during higher , more trusting offers .
The insula responds to internal body signals , such as pain , heart rate and temperature , but new research has hinted at role for the walnut - sized structure in detecting social norms and fairness .
When you have deviations in fairness the insula revs into action , Montague says .
Not so among 55 BPD trustees .
Their insulae did not discriminate between trusting ( high ) and untrusting ( low ) investments .
Because the brains of BPD trustees responded just like normal trustees when divvying up a stingy investment , Montague theorises that people with the disorder do n’t pick up on social cues for mistrust .
“ In other words : ‘ I do n’t understand your gesture toward me ’ , ” he says .
Peter Bossaerts , a neuroeconomist at Caltech in Pasadena , says that since the games are scored and have a predicted outcome , they may help diagnose mental illnesses .
“ This could really revolutionise the way people think about and treat psychiatric illnesses , ” he says .

Bad news should wake up Obama , experts say

It 's not panic time - yet - but some Democrats watching Barack Obama say his campaign should have gotten a wake - up call this week , not only from his appearance with John McCain at the Saddleback Church but from a major poll suggesting he no longer leads his GOP opponent .
At the Saddleback forum with Pastor Rick Warren on Saturday in Orange County , the Republican presidential candidate delivered on - the - money messages and answers so effective they were " scary to me , " said George Lakoff , a renowned author and UC Berkeley linguistics professor who has studied how the human brain absorbs and processes messages .
Lakoff , whose work has helped shaped numerous Democratic candidates ' campaigns , said that " right through the motivational campaign theme , they were doing everything right . "
By contrast , Obama was " overconfident ... and certainly not prepared " before the evangelical audience with definitive answers to clearly explain to voters his world view , values and vision , Lakoff said .
Lakoff is n't alone in his assessment that Obama needs to step up his game , hone his message and sharpen his contrasts with McCain as he heads into the final sprint after next week 's Democratic National Convention in Denver .
A national poll released Wednesday by Reuters / Zogby showed McCain beating Obama 46 to 41 percent , an advantage that also shows that voters now see McCain as stronger on economic issues .
The latest poll erased the strong seven - point advantage held by the Democrat just last month .
Other polls had the race statistically tied .
Moreover , some recent polls indicate that some red states that Democrats had hoped they could flip to blue - like Indiana and Virginia - are tacking back slightly to McCain .
The latest polls show that even with gas prices rising precipitously under a Republican administration , the candidates are unusually close on whom Americans trust to deal with the issue .
Sharper message needed
Some Democrats - Lakoff included - say it 's clear Obama needs to sharpen his message and get tougher on beating back attacks from McCain 's campaign , which has suggested that Obama is elitist and even unpatriotic .
" John McCain is jujitsuing Obama 's strengths , " said one leading California - based Democratic strategist , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his work with a nationally known party figure .
The strategist said many Democrats witnessed their candidate 's performance at the Saddleback forum with " a feeling of vague nausea " because " the stature gap ( between Obama and McCain ) widened dramatically in the mind of any viewer who watched . "
Lakoff , a progressive academic often cited for his views on the importance of " framing the debate " in politics , said the discussion at the Lake Forest evangelical church provided an unusually clear window into the two candidates ' strengths , including how effective they are heading into upcoming debates and the final sprint of the presidential race .
Two examples from Saddleback that Lakoff and others said underscore Obama 's troubles :
-- McCain - asked his reason for running for president - confidently outlined a strong message of " country first , " urging service to America .
That idea , dominant in McCain 's message and the theme of the GOP convention , showed that McCain Republicans have " figured out the formula " of effective campaign communication - and brilliantly melded ideas touted by both Presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy .
-- Obama , in contrast , delivered a far more nuanced plea for empathy and building bridges across party lines instead of a more direct answer - telling voters what those values would mean specifically " to your children , your future , your environment , " said Lakoff .
With just days until the Democrats head into their convention , the tough assessment by Lakoff , author of " The Political Mind : Why You Can't Understand 21st - Century American Politics with an 18th - Century Brain , " might spark some panic among Democrats .
Even some Republicans agree that the forum should be a dose of very tough medicine for Obama .
" The nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts , " said Sacramento - based GOP strategist Patrick Dorinson , who also saw the Saddleback forum as a seminal moment .
" Obama felt he was sitting with Dr. Phil , and he was trying not to offend anybody .
McCain seemed to understand he was running for president ... his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate . "
" The primaries are preseason ; you can make mistakes .
But now we 're into the first game that really counts , " Dorinson said .
" Obama 's folks are reading their own press clippings too much - and they 've got to understand they 're in a dogfight . "
Time to revamp
Barbara O'Connor , professor of political communication at Sacramento State University , agrees with Lakoff that " Obama 's message of change needs to be revamped . "
" Change toward what end ? " she asks .
" The party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories .
Democrats tend to mush around and do n't give people slogans like ' Morning in America , ' " which Reagan used to evoke a feeling of hope and promise in the country .
But she takes issue with some of Lakoff 's tougher assessments of Obama 's performance at Saddleback , a forum before evangelical voters that from the start constituted a challenge for Obama .
" When you talk about religion and faith - based values , you have to be nuanced .
... I thought he was really earnest , trying to explain who he was to an audience that largely disagreed with him .
These were n't his guys . "
( NaturalNews ) Ecologists warn that the most destructive form of fishing is becoming more prevalent , with potentially disastrous consequences for ocean life .
" Industrial fisheries are now going thousands of miles , thousands of feet deep and catching things that live hundreds of years in the least protected place on Earth , " said Elliott Norse , president of Marine Conservation Biology Institute .
" They are roving bandits using state of the art technologies to plunder .
"
In the practice of deep sea trawling , fishing boats drag massive , mile - deep nets across the ocean floor far from shore , snatching up anything in their path .
Once a rare practice , deep sea trawling has increased in popularity as coastal fisheries are depleted and the demand for seafood continues to rise .
" All fisheries are gradually turning into deep - sea fisheries because they have fished themselves out of the shallow waters , " says Robert Steneck , a marine ecologist at the University of Maine .
" The solution is not going into the deep sea , but better managing the shallow waters , where fish live fast and die young but where the ecosystems have greater potential for resilience .
" Because the open sea is not claimed as the territory of any nation , few regulations on deep - sea trawling exist .
Yet the deep sea is home to more biodiversity than any other ecosystem on Earth , with the possible exception of the tropical rainforests .
A profusion of species found nowhere else make their homes among the canyons , ridges and mountains of the ocean bottom .
Yet these unique geological features are flattened when a 15 - ton trawler net collides with them , destroying the habitat of even the fish that escape capture .
Deep sea species tend to be long - lived and slow - growing , meaning that they are particularly vulnerable to over - fishing .
Stocks of the orange roughy , for example , were depleted by 75 percent within 20 years of when New Zealand began fishing for them .
According to Rashid Sumaila of the University of British Columbia , fishing nations need to eliminate the massive subsidies that make the practice possible .
" It 's important to nip these subsidies in the bud before more interests get barnacled around them , " Sumaila said .
" Eliminating them would render these fleets economically unviable . "

Researchers Claim " Green " Catalysts Can Clean Up Toxic Pollutants
August 19th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon have discovered environmentally - friendly molecule catalysts that can be used to clean up a variety of toxic substances including waste water and fuel .
The catalysts , known as Tetra - Amido Macrocyclic Ligands ( TAMLs ) , could replace current industrial practices used in cleaning up environmental hazards .
TAMLs are made up of common elements of biochemistry — carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , and oxygen around a reactive core .
They are usable at very low temperatures and form strong chemical bonds .
According to Carnegie Mellon professor and catalyst inventor Terry Collins , TAMLs are extremely effective in degrading estrogenic compounds , cleaning up waste water from textile manufacturing , treating pulp and paper processing byproducts , reducing fuel pollutants and even decontaminating anthrax .
Collins also believes that TAMLs could have a future in eradicating a variety of water - borne infectious microbes that cause death and disability .

Do you have an emergency fund of at least three months worth of expenses saved up should an unexpected medical expense , a job layoff , or a natural disaster happen ?
Most Americans do not , and it ’s going to hurt them when Murphy decides to move in your spare bedroom .
When an emergency happens and you do n’t have some sort of financial padding , you ’re going to incur one of the most insidious types of debt , and that ’s debt you incur just so that you can survive .
Let ’s say that you do n’t have a lot of money savings , and the job market ’s not doing to well , and you get laid off .
How are you going to pay for things ?
You have to eat , pay your mortgage , keep the utilities going , where ’s that money going to come from ?
Chances are you ’ll end up borrowing it , whether it be from a friend , a family member , or a local bank .
You will begin to say things such as “ I can pay it off when I get paid again ” , “ Is debt really that bad ? ” , “ it ’s okay , it ’s only a temporary thing . ”
We justify this type of debt because we ’re in a real hard spot during life which is not easy to get out by any means even for bios magazine .
Here ’s the problem with survival debt .
You ’re borrowing money at the point when you can least afford to do so .
“ I ’ve just lost a job , so I ’ll incur all sorts of debt and finance my life ! ”
That does n’t sound like the best idea .
Do n’t accept the fact that you have to incur survival debt .
Survival debt will only give you a cushion that you do n’t want .
If you did n’t have the option of borrowing money , chances are you ’d work day and night until you had a job , even if it was just a temporary job delivering pizzas and throwing papers until you got a job in your field again .
Taking survival debt off the table as an answer will motivate you like nothing else .
It ’s said in the bible that “ The man who does not work does not eat ! ” , and when this happens to you , that statement will become very true !
You ’ll work like crazy to get a new job , which is what you should be doing !
Just take survival debt off the table .
It ’s appealing and looks like the easy answer , but in the long run it ’s only going to be bad for you financially .
Work hard to find a new job , if you ’re starving , it ’s okay to make a visit to the local food pantry , that ’s what it ’s there for .
Do n’t borrow money at the time you can least afford to do so .
I 've had the G - shot ... and YES , YES , YES , my sex life has never been better
Satisfied : Caroline Cushworth says her sex life is now unbelievable
Three months ago , Caroline Cushworth sat her partner Christopher down and asked him a simple question .
If , she said , I could be guaranteed an orgasm every time we had sex , what would be your reaction ?
Not that surprisingly , her partner Christopher , 27 , a plasterer , replied that he'd be delighted .
' So I told him I wanted to have a brand - new treatment which would enable me to do just that - and also make my orgasms much more intense than normal , ' says Caroline .
' His jaw literally hit the floor and he said , " Sounds good to me . "
' And so a fortnight ago , Caroline became the first British woman to have the ' G - shot ' , also known as the ' orgasm jab ' - an £ 800 non-surgical treatment that enhances a woman 's sexual experience by boosting the G - spot , the ultra - sensitive area of tissue that can hold the key to happy love - making .
Rather like lip - plumping jabs , the treatment involves injecting collagen straight into the G - spot .
This not only enhances its sensitivity , but increases the width of the area to the size of a 10 pence piece .
It also raises the G - spot a quarter of an inch in height , making it much easier to find .
And , as Caroline can testify , the results are tremendous .
' I have quite literally never experienced anything quite like it , ' she says .
' I had constant multiple orgasms which went on for hours .
' That first time , the whole thing was so intense I was actually a bit scared .
I was so overcome , but thankfully the intensity is something I 've got used to .
I still have multiple orgasms every time I have sex , but they no longer leave me flat on my back . '
Although Caroline , a 41 - year - old business developer from Leeds who has no children , says she 's always enjoyed a healthy sex life , it was n't until a few years ago that she first discovered her G - spot .
The area is named after Dr Ernest Grafenberg , who first described it in a 1950 article in the International Journal of Sexology , and while many women say it 's a highly sensitive , erotic area that provides hours of pleasure , others seem unable to locate it at all .
Caroline , until recently , fell into the latter of the two camps , and even questioned its existence .
She says : ' I personally thought anyone who said they climaxed through intercourse alone was lying .
And I did n't really believe in the G - spot .
' But a few years ago , my partner at the time said he wanted to find it .
We actually set aside an entire afternoon and spent hours searching for my G - spot . '
' Finding the damned thing in the first place was no easy feat and was n't exactly the most erotic of experiences , but we got there in the end .
I still think that women who claim they can find their G - spot during a one - night stand are lying .
Once we 'd found my G - spot , my sex life did improve , but I still did n't orgasm every time we had sex .
Hitting the spot : Meg Ryan in the famous When Harry Met Sally orgasm scene
' To be honest , even when you know where it is , the G - spot can still be incredibly elusive .
I found it very frustrating .'
Caroline heard about the arrival of the G - shot in the UK from America a year ago , where the procedure has been available for some years .
She discovered that Professor P. K.W. Dartey , of the UK Laser Vaginal Rejuvenation Centre in London 's Harley Street , was the UK's only cosmetic gynaecologist approved to administer the shot .
' I was reading these flyers which detailed the G - shot , ' says Caroline .
' I immediately thought I had to get it done .
' I attended a consultation , where Professor Dartey explained that injecting collagen into my normal , pea-sized G - spot would enlarge it for up to four months .
The results would mean longer , more intense orgasms .
' He showed me a diagram of exactly where the G - spot is - between 5.8 to 6.2 cm from the pubic bone .
It all sounded pretty straightforward .
' The procedure itself was a bit nerve - racking , though .
I was petrified beforehand .
' At one point , Professor Dartey was trying to locate my G - spot with one hand while holding an 8 cm needle filled with collagen in the other .
' I lay on my back thinking : " Oh God , what am I doing here ? "
It did n't hurt and Professor Dartey was very professional about it , but I can't say I was n't embarrassed .
' Five minutes later though , I was up and dressed , and to my surprise feeling vaguely aroused , but I think that was more because of the anticipation of the sex that I 'd have later . '
Caroline was told she had to wait four hours before having sex , and so spent the afternoon shopping .
' When we did have sex I 'm happy to report it was just unbelievable - and it's been the same every time since . '
Caroline is so happy with the results that she 's already booked in to have a top - up treatment in four months ' time and says she 'll carry on having the jab indefinitely .
' I 'll treat it in the same way as I do getting my hair cut or my highlights done , ' she says .
' Christopher and I always had a healthy sex life , but now it 's better than ever . '
The G - shot costs £ 800 .

Many scientists have expressed the belief that if they only had a chance to explain the facts , they could convince intelligent educated people ( at least ) of the validity of a neo -Darwinian approach to understanding life .
As the following email exchange suggests , this conventional assumption is wrong .
Not all people - even intelligent ones - have minds that operate according to the same principles of rationality .
The following email conversation took place between me and a reader of an article called " Life 2.0 " that I published in Newsweek International about synthetic life .
The reader - a young earth creationist - was only upset by what I wrote in the very first paragraph of a rather long article .
The email exchange that followed is instructive to those of us who want to convince our fellow citizens of the legitimacy of modern science and its implications for understanding life and the universe as a whole .
The reader has training in engineering and math ( which comes out in his remarks ) , so he should have the ability to understand my responses to his arguments against evolution and an old universe .
But he bobs and weaves , changing arguments from one post to the next , to support his firm belief in " the accuracy of the Bible . "
I have had other email exchanges with other educated creationists ( usually engineers ) , and not once has any one of them budged in any way .
Unfortunately for American competitiveness , it will be very very difficult to change the insidious culture of creationist thought in America 's heartland , unless we overhaul the country 's educational system with a national scientific curriculum .

Dr. Silver ,
I recently read your article “ Life 2.0 ” as published on the Newsweek section of MSNBC.com .
I found the article intriguing and have been following the advances in genetics with some interest .
The immense potential for both breakthrough and disaster interest me greatly , as does the immense public interest in the pursuit of such accomplishments like cures for cancer , elimination of genetic malfunctions , and advancement of food products such as crops and farm animals .
I appreciate your dedication to this cutting edge field of science and your obviously immense knowledge of it ; however , I was disappointed in how your article began .
Frankly , I had trouble motivating myself to complete it , given the staunch presupposition of the first paragraph .
I am not attempting to argue the existence of God or the theory of evolution .
What I am concerned about is the integrity of the statements you made .
I have no way of proving or disproving any of the research , accomplishments , or potential of the genetic research you wrote about .
However , statements such as those made in the first paragraph force me to question your reliability .
You make three assumptions in the first paragraph that you pass off as fact :
1. Life on Earth began as a single cell
3 . What conclusive evidence is there that the Earth is at least 3.6 billion years old ?
2 . Where is the transient state fossil evidence that connects all living things to a single ancestor ?
My point here is not to prove your statements false , although as you can probably discern I disagree with them .
I would simply like facts to back up your statements .
I do n’t mind you making them if they are bounded by the disclaimer of ‘ theory . ’
However , you write them as scientific fact , and without proper evidence they are nothing more them journalistic and scientific irresponsibility .
Thank you in advance for your attention to my email .
I trust that you will address my concerns with the same thoroughness as you addressed the fascinating subject of genetics in your article .
Thank you ,
Josh Pepper

Dear Josh ,
If a God created the universe 10,000 or so years ago , we would only be able to see stars that were closer than 10,000 light years away from us .
The light from farther stars ( traveling at the speed of light ) would not have had a chance to reach us yet .
And yet , our telescopes can see stars and galaxies containing billions of stars that are millions or billions of light years away .
Furthermore , if the universe is just 10,000 years old , vast numbers of new stars should appear in the sky every night as their light reaches us for the first time -- but this is not what happens .
Give me a logical scientific explanation for these astronomical observations and I 'll answer your questions .
Professor Silver

Dr. Silver ,
Thank you for your response .
If a conclusive answer on this subject from me is needed for you to continue this discussion , then I suppose I will not get my questions answered .
However , I will offer you an incomplete answer and hope for the best .
Your point is well - taken and is a worthy subject of concern to anyone that believes in a young Earth / universe .
However , the conclusions regarding the distance of stars hinge on two presuppositions :
1 . Time is constant at any observable distance .
The former is difficult to disprove , as many observations over many years and many distances has yielded pretty consistent results .
I ’ve read of theories on universe curvature and c-decay that do n’t really conclude anything tangible in the way of a good theory .
The appeal of such a theory follows a similar path as theories on the decay rate of carbon , the central assumption of radioactive dating .
If the decay rate of carbon is not conclusively known over the millions of years of time it is applied , then the dates cannot be accurate .
Similarly , if the value of c is not constant over large spans of time , then distances to objects in deep space cannot be accurate .
However , the latter is a more plausible fallacy based on Einstein ’s theory of general relativity .
As you are certainly aware , time can be affected by the influence of a strong gravitational field .
This has been proven on Earth and has been observed in space as well .
If time is not a constant over a billion light years , then how can we be sure of the measurement ?
Time dilation is a real , observable event , and its effect on the observation of deep space objects is worth considering .
I am a believer in God , as was Einstein .
I am also a believer in a young Earth , though I will concede that it is possible that the Earth and the universe could be much older than the typical Creationist dates them .
However , the existence of God does not hinge on the age of the Earth or the age of the universe , and as I stated before I am not attempting to debate the existence of God .
I am also not trying to debate the age of the universe .
All I would like to know is how you can state with the certainty at which you stated in your article that at some approximate point in the earth ’s existence that a single organic cell was created from inorganic material and spontaneously reproduced into the vastly complex design in which we live today .
Thank you ,
Josh Pepper

Dear Josh ,
Thank you for your note .
I should point out first that the God imagined by Albert Einstein , Thomas Jefferson , and many other Enlightenment intellectuals is one that created the universe but has since taken a completely hands - off approach .
The assumption made by most deists ( as people with this belief are called ) is that the universe was created in such a way that life would be bound to emerge through natural processes ( what we now understand to be natural selection ) .
Beyond this point of agreement , deist viewpoints diverge immensely .
But if we stick to the basic idea , science can provide NO support either for or against a deistic view of the universe since it is one in which everything has abided by the laws of nature since the Big Bang .
On the contrary , science can speak to the question of the age of the universe , the earth , and life on earth .
Numerous independent scientific investigations from physics , chemistry , and molecular biology all point to , and are all consistent with , a view of a universe that emerged from a Big Bang about 15 billion years ago , with an earth that coalesced and cooled down about four billion years ago , and a single source of life that evolved -- starting over 3 billion years ago -- into all the life forms that exist on earth today .
Modern evolutionary biology is focused almost entirely on molecular studies of changes in DNA sequence , and mathematical analyses of selective forces and changes in allele frequency .
I have published over thirty papers on evolution and I never once looked at a fossil ( or a whole animal for that matter ) .
It 's the conservation and divergence of digital DNA sequences that provides the most powerful evidence for our current understanding of natural selection and evolution .
If you think that every species is separate and distinct , then how would you think about a hypothetical hybrid between human and chimp ( which would almost certainly be viable ) - is it human or chimp ?
What about a being with 75 % human DNA , or 90 % human DNA , or just 25 % human DNA .
Where would you draw the line .
I am interested in your response .
If you are interested in learning more about these thought experiments , take a look at my recent book Challenging Nature .
Science can never proof anything absolutely .
But with science alone , there is no reason to even postulate the young Earth / universe claim .
The claim is based entirely on a belief in the literal accuracy of the Bible .
Indeed , the claim has never been made in any modern non-Christian culture ( such as those in Asia ) .
You are certainly free to hold such a belief , but I hope you understand that your belief is based on Biblical revelation and not science .
Best regards ,
Lee

Dr. Silver ,
I appreciate your willingness to discuss these ideas with me .
I am pleased to know that you cannot definitively dismiss the existence of God , as many scientists claim to be able to do .
His role in our creation and daily lives is a much deeper subject and is a topic for another day .
However , the topic of the Big Bang is a nice segue into our discussion .
The basic question I posed in my first email still stands :
How can an organic cell be created from inorganic matter ?
If there was a “ first cell ” , as your Life 2.0 article suggested , then this cell had to either have existed prior to the Big Bang and have been carried throughout the process of planet formation and cooling you describe , or would have had to converted from an inorganic substance to a living cell .
I assume , though , that you do n’t believe in the former .
So , the question of inorganic - to - organic still remains .
To my knowledge , no transformation of this kind has ever been observed in nature .
Another question that still stands from my original email is the date of the start of life .
You quote these dates of 15 b and 4b years of the various events that shaped life as we know it today .
How are these dates determined ?
Is it based on some kind of “ molecular clock ” study ?
I assume so , since your research does not focus on fossils .
As for speciation , I can buy into the concept of a change in species over time .
That has been observed in the restructuring of DNA to create a new species .
However , the problem arises in the genetics of a species .
As you are obviously well aware , one species cannot breed with another species .
Dogs breed dogs , pigs breed pigs , and humans breed humans .
Once a DNA sequence has restructured , that new species is its own kind , and cannot breed with the parent species .
Also , there is not an observed adding of information … simply a restructuring , which is an important detail .
To my knowledge , there is not evidence in nature of a hybrid between a human and a chimp .
How can such a hybrid be hypothetically viable ?
Has a human successfully bred with a chimp ?
The concept of using DNA sequencing to argue evolution is admittedly an intriguing concept .
We humans do have some commonality in DNA sequence with every other living thing .
We even share some similarity with bacteria , such as yeast .
How , though , do you make the step from common properties or sequences to common ancestor ?
In order to argue a common ancestor , you must be able to demonstrate either the adding of genetic information over time or the existence of a standard DNA .
I do n’t think either can be proven , though .
Mutations , as I understand them , involve a degradation of genetic structure and never provide any beneficial changes to life .
If we shared an ancestor with a bird , for instance , you would either need to prove that we have in our DNA the information necessary to grow feathers or that the genetic information in birds to grow feathers was added at some point in history .
You can argue commonality all you want , but I do n’t believe you can argue links .
If anything , I believe the commonality of design argues for a common designer , not a common ancestor .
I acknowledge Einstein did not believe in the God of the Bible .
However , I do appreciate his views on religion and science .
I particularly like this quote :
---" Science without religion is lame , religion without science is blind ... a legitimate conflict between science and religion cannot exist . "
Thanks again for your willingness to indulge my curiosity and answer my questions .
I look forward to your response .
Josh

Dear Josh ,
Before probing these questions further , it is important to clear up some misunderstandings expressed in your last letter .
(1) With modern technology , scientists can easily convert inorganic molecules into organic molecules ( this is called organic synthesis ) .
Organic molecules are defined as compounds containing multiple carbon - carbon bonds .
I can create systems of organic molecules that are even self - replicating to a certain extent , and within a few years , it will be possible for machines to be programmed to create self - maintaining and self - replicating cells from scratch .
(2) You state :
As you are obviously well aware , one species cannot breed with another species .
Dogs breed dogs , pigs breed pigs , and humans breed humans .
Once a DNA sequence has restructured , that new species is its own kind , and cannot breed with the parent species .
This is incorrect -- related species can breed together .
The most well - known example is of donkeys and horses creating mules .
But in fact , cows were created by breeding together two species , domestic sheep were created by mixing together three species , and the llama comes from two species in different genera .
( See my book for more details . )
In plants , quite distant hybridizations can be made , and they are responsible for all the major crops in the world today .
Chimps and humans share 97 % of their DNA in common and exhibit only a single chromosomal change .
In fact , chimps and humans have all the same genes -- only their expression is different .
More distant animal species can easily breed together , therefore , it is quite likely that chimps and humans could form hybrids .
Out of curiosity , do you consider Neanderthals to be members of the human species ?
Their DNA has been sequenced and it is about 0.5 % different from ours .
Each human being is about 0.1 % different in DNA sequence from each other .
Where would you draw the line between different species .
(3) You state :
Once a DNA sequence has restructured , that new species is its own kind , and cannot breed with the parent species .
Also , there is not an observed adding of information … simply a restructuring , which is an important detail .
and
In order to argue a common ancestor , you must be able to demonstrate either the adding of genetic information over time or the existence of a standard DNA .
I do n’t think either can be proven , though .
Mutations , as I understand them , involve a degradation of genetic structure and never provide any beneficial changes to life .
I am very curious to know where you got this information from .
It is rather outdated ( from before the discovery of DNA structure in 1953 ) .
Single base mutations are simply changes in the DNA sequence , for example from ACGAAT to ACTAAT .
This not a " degradation . "
Most random mutations are not advantageous to the organism , but some are .
Furthermore , we can select mutations to create new varieties of crops .
Corn , for example , was bred out of an inedible weed .
That 's a good example of artificial selection .
Second , it is easy to explain how NEW genetic information can be added to a genome .
This is one common mechanism : during replication a gene gets duplicated so there are now two copies instead of one on each chromosome .
One copy continues to carry out the same function , but the second is free to evolve -- if it picks up a new useful function , it will be selected for survival .
This process of duplication and divergence has occurred over and over again , over millions of generations , expanding the size of the genome from 100 to 1,000 - fold , and increasing the complexity of the organisms that the genome codes for .
Molecular biologists have constructed a very detailed map of when and where each gene duplication occurred .
Take a look at a modern book on genetics ( such as mine ) and you 'll gain a much better understanding of this .
Does this have any impact on your thoughts .
Best regards ,
Lee Silver

Dr. Silver ,
It seems as if we are developing quite a number of sub - discussions .
I ’ll attempt to address all of them …forgive me if I miss a thought in which you were interested .
I understand that organic synthesis is possible .
The trouble I have is that it is in a lab environment .
Is there an example of this phenomenon in nature , outside of the realm of human initiation ?
The subject of human initiation brings up the subject of genetic engineering , the method by which , as you justifiably point out , many of today ’s farm animals and crops are created .
The possibility of many of these mutations or hybrids is obvious , as they have been demonstrated in practice .
However , science has been able to take hybridization to a point not observed in nature .
Mules , for example , are most often sterile when created in nature … a natural cross - breeding that is obviously not ideal for carrying on a species .
As I understand it , most cross-breeds or hybrids are human- initiated and often require additional human interaction to carry on the breed .
I misspoke previously about the breeding across a species .
What I was shooting for was that two dogs are not going to produce a cat , or a pig and a parrot are not going to produce a flying pig .
I understand these are drastic changes , but you must concede that something of a drastic change must occur at some point to develop such distinct differences as mammals , reptiles , fish , and birds .
I know you have not studied fossils , but there have been no fossils discovered that prove any transitional states between , for example , a lizard and a bird .
There may be some similarities in DNA , but similarity does not prove connection .
You mention the difference between chimps and humans being very small .
Yes , I understand that chimps have one more chromosome than humans .
However , there are significant differences within the “ common ” chromosomes .
Where did your 97 % come from ?
Are you looking at substitutions only , or are you also looking at insertions / deletions ?
Did this number come from a full study of the entire genome ?
Could n’t you argue that any difference at all could be due to a unique creation , not a process of evolution ?
I can buy that Neanderthal is of the same common human ancestor as modern humans .
That is easily supported by the Bible and is also easily concluded through science .
However , how can you trust that the DNA of an unearthed Neanderthal is complete and correct ?
Does n’t DNA have a “ shelf life ? ”
Could that 0.5 % actually be much smaller if you account for some DNA degradation ?
Admittedly , I am over my head when trying to discuss gene replication .
One obvious standout in your statement , though , is that a copied gene “ is free to evolve . ”
As I understand it , a gene is coded to perform a particular function .
Is there a known mechanism where a gene can reprogram itself to perform a different function , such as fur turning to hair or gills turning to lungs ?
I can buy the concept of a duplicated gene in a genome , but I am skeptical of the reprogramming of a gene .
Can you elaborate ?
Is there a current example in nature of an animal receiving a reprogrammed gene and developing a new function ?
Thanks ,
Josh

Dear Josh ,
We 've had a good conversation , but it does n't make sense to proceed further unless you are willing to take standard university courses in genetics , molecular biology , and developmental biology ( on top of prerequisites in chemistry , physics , and discrete mathematics ) .
There is an enormous conceptual framework and experimental foundation for our modern view of the universe - including organic life - that can't be explained in an email message or two .
But it would only be useful to begin to learn the foundational science if you started with a mind that was open to the possibility that your current views might be wrong .
I would be happy to send you a copy of my genetics textbook for free ( normal price is $ 139 ) , if you would like -- just tell me where to send it .
{ I have no idea how old your are or what your educational background is , but I admire your willingness to participate in this discussion .}
For my own edification , I would like to know the source of two claims that you raised in a previous message .
First is the idea that mutations necessarily cause " genetic degradation . "
Second is the idea that new genetic information can't emerge or be added into an existing genome .
If these claims were true , then evolution would not be able to occur .
( Conversely , if both claims are false , then mathematical analysis can show that evolution almost certainly MUST occur within biological organisms of the kind that exist on earth . )
Although neither claim is accurate , I 've heard them used in arguments made by many other people who oppose the idea of biological evolution .
If you could provide me with citations for primary sources , I would be very appreciative .
Best regards ,
Lee Silver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Silver ,
I appreciate your time in discussing these subjects with me .
I understand you are a busy man , and it says a lot about you that you would take time with a random person to answer some pretty involved questions .
My background is in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics , but I have a curiosity about a number of subjects .
I would very much appreciate a copy of your textbook .
That is a very generous gesture , and I would be honored to accept it .
I am more than willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong about many things .
I am generally very open - minded about the world .
However , I will not be swayed in my belief in God or the accuracy of the Bible – having those doubts would defeat the purpose of faith .
However , I firmly believe science and religion can exist in harmony with each other .
The Bible is not explicit on the age of the universe , so that is a subject I am open to explore .
However , the Bible is explicit in its claim that man was uniquely created ; therefore , I can not buy in to a macroevolutionary world .
I do feel it is important , though , to understand all sides of a subject and be able to come to an educated conclusion .
Hence , my curiosity and determination to understand your world .
I do hold to the fact that you have not provided me with a proof of connectivity between genomes that shows a large - scale evolutionary progression over time .
You also have not provided proof of events you have observed in a lab setting demonstrated in nature , without human interaction .
I hope further study on my part will clear up many of those questions .
Admittedly , I cannot quickly grab citations for the two claims I made that you are curious about .
One gathers nuggets of information from various sources over the course of time , and this is one of those cases where I cannot recall the research paper or book where I got that information .
I will continue to look and will be glad to provide your references when I can run them down .
Again , thank you very much for your time .
Your knowledgeable , respectful writing is a testament to both you and to Princeton .
I look forward to receiving your book and reading it .
Thanks ,
Josh
MAYNE ISLAND , B.C.–RCMP have solved part of the mystery of the severed feet after matching one pair with a missing Vancouver man , but a new twist emerged this weekend with the disclosure that a footless body was found 16 months ago in Washington state .
Five feet , all in running shoes , have washed up on B.C. shorelines since last August .
Sgt. Pierre Lemaitre said yesterday DNA samples confirm two of those feet belonged to a man from the Greater Vancouver area .
His family , who asked for privacy over the weekend so they could inform other relatives , had submitted the samples to the B.C. Coroner 's Service .
The man was apparently depressed , family members told RCMP .
" At this point , the major crime investigators feel that this is not as a result of foul play , " Lemaitre said .
The RCMP will release more information about the man tomorrow , he said .
The other feet belong to two men and one woman , according to DNA samples , police say .
But in an unusual turn , RCMP and the coroner 's office are now awaiting FBI data on a body found with no feet just south of B.C. in the San Juan Islands of Washington state .
Coroner Randall Gaylord said yesterday that a hiker on the remote shores of Orcas Island found human remains on the shore in March of last year .
The nearly intact skeleton belonged to a man at least 30 years old and 5 - foot - 9 .
Missing were the right arm and hand , the left hand and both feet .
Tidal currents in the area have deposited human remains from the Vancouver area on the San Juan Islands before .
Gaylord , coroner for the past 14 years , recalled investigating one such case in the 1990s .
The nearly intact body of a Vancouver mechanic , still wearing his blue coveralls , who had jumped off a bridge in the Fraser River , floated all the way to the islands .
Gaylord said the body found in 2007 on the San Juans ' Orcas Island was sent to the FBI crime lab to see if dental records could provide a match .
He did n't think to check with the B.C. coroner and RCMP until a week ago , when Canadian police released pictures of the shoes that had washed ashore .
" It 's possible this is just a coincidence , " said Gaylord .
" Once our DNA profile is done , we can meet with them and compare results . "
Gaylord said a black Merrell athletic shoe was found near the skeleton , but no one knows whether it belonged with the human remains .
A red and white argyle sock with the brand name of London department store Harrods was inside the shoe .
DNA results have also confirmed none of the feet washed ashore in British Columbia match the four missing victims of a 2005 Quadra Island plane crash .
Early this month , investigators told relatives of two of the victims , Arnie Feast and Fabian Bedard , the DNA was not a match .
This week , relatives of brothers Doug and Trevor Decock were also informed that the remains in the shoes were not a match .

Ruby版作るために部分的に訳してたので、せっかくだから完成させました。Protocol Buffersのバイナリエンコーディング詳細です。この情報が必要な人はあんまりいないとおもいますが、よろしければどうぞ。
http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/encoding.html
エンコーディン グ
このドキュメントはプロトコルバッファメッセージのバイナリ・ワイヤ形式について説明しています。アプリケーションでプロトコルバッファを使用するだけであれば気にする必要はありませんが、プロトコルバッファの様々なフォーマットがエンコードされたメッセージのサイズにどう影響するかを理解することは非常に役に立つでしょう。
簡単なメッセージ 次のとても簡単なメッセージ定義があるとしましょう : message Test1 { required int32 a = 1 ; } アプリケーション でTest1メッセージを作成し、aに150を設定します。それからメッセージをシリアライズして出力ストリームに流します。エンコードされたメッセージを見たとすると、次の3バイトが目に入るでしょう : 08 96 01 とりあえず、とても小さくて数字だけなのは分かりました − で、この意味は？それはこの先をみてください...
Base 128 可変長整数 単純なプロトコルバッファエンコーディングを理解するには、まず最初に可変長整数を理解する必要があります。可変長整数は1以上のバイトを使って整数をシリアライズする方法で、小さな数ほど少ないバイト数で済みます。
最終バイトを除いた可変長整数に含まれるバイトそれぞれには最上位ビット( most significant bit : msb)がセットされ、まだ続きのバイトがあることが分かります。それぞれのバイトの下位7ビットはare used to store the two 's complement representation of the number in groups of 7 bits , least significant group first .
では、ここでは例として数値の1を考えます。これは一バイトなので最上位ビットはセットされません。
0000 0001 さらに130を見てみます。これはもう少し複雑です。
1000 0010 0000 0001 これ が130であるとどうして分かるのでしょうか？まずそれぞれのバイトの最上位ビットは単に数値が最後まで到達したかどうかを示すだけなので除きます(見て分かるように、可変長変数がもう一バイト続いているので最初のバイトがセットされています ) : 1000 0010 0000 0001 → 000 0010 000 0001 次に、先に書いたとおり、可変長整数は数値を最下位ビットを先に保存するので7ビットを一グループとして順番を入れ替えます。その後、それらを結合して最終的な値を得ます : 000 0010 000 0001 → 000 0001 ++ 000 0010 → 10000010 → 128 + 2 = 130
メッセージ構造 ご存知のとおり、プロトコルバッファメッセージは一連のキー-値ペアです。バイナリバージョンのメッセージはキーとして単にフィールドの番号を使います。それぞれの名前と宣言された型はメッセージ型定義(つまり.protoファイル)を参照してでコードの最後に決定されます。
メッセージがエンコードされるとキーと値は一つのバイト列にまとめられます。メッセージがデコードされるときはパーサは理解できないフィールドをスキップしなければいけません。そうすれば、メッセージに新しいフィールドが付け加えられたとしても、そのことを知らない古いプログラムを妨げずに済みます。そのために、物理フォーマットでのメッセージそれぞれのペアにおける" キー" は次の二つの値からなります : .protoファイルに書かれているフィールド番号と、続く値の長さを得るのに必要な情報だけを含むワイヤタイプ
使用可能なワイヤタイプは以下の通りです : タイプ 意味 対象 0 可変長整数 int32 , int64 , int32 , int64 , uint32 , uint64 , sint32 , sint64 , bool , enum 1 64ビット fixed64 , sfixed64 , double 2 length - delimited string , bytes , embedded messages 3 グループ開始 groups ( deprecated ) 4 グループ終了 groups ( deprecated ) 5 32ビット fixed32 , sfixed32 , float ストリームされるメッセージのキーは ( field_number << 3 ) | wire_type という値を持つ可変長整数です。つまり、この数の最後の3ビットにワイヤタイプが収められています。
もう一度簡単な例を見てみましょう。ストリームの最初の数が常に可変長整数のキーであることはお分かりだと思います。ここではその数は08、つまり( 最上位を除くと)次のようになります : 000 1000 最後の3ビットからワイヤタイプ(0)を取り出して、右に3ビットシフトするとフィールド番号(1)が得られます。これでタグが1で続く値は可変長整数であることが分かりました。先のセクションで理解した可変長引数のデコード方法を使えば、次のバイトに格納されている値が150だと分かります。 96 01 = 1001 0110 0000 0001 → 000 0001 ++ 001 0110 ( 最上位ビットを除いたあと7ビットごとに並びを逆にする ) → 10010110 → 2 + 4 + 16 + 128 = 150
値の型についてさらに 符号付整数 これまでのセクションから分かるように、ワイヤタイプ0に関連付けられているプロトコルバッファータイプは全て可変長引数にエンコードされます。しかし符号付整数型(sint32とsint64 ) と" 標準的な " 整数型( int32とint64 ) には負の値をエンコードする際、重要な違いがあります。もし負数にint32やint64を使ったら、それらは巨大な符号無し整数を効率的に扱うためのものなので、結果の可変長整数は常に10バイト長くなります。符号付の型を使えば、結果の可変長整数にはもっとずっと効率的なZigZagエンコーディングが使用されます。
ZigZagエンコーディングは符号付整数を符号無しの整数にマップして、絶対値が小さな数(例えば-1)は小さな可変長引数にエンコードされます。正数と負数を" zig-zag"に行ったり来たりして、次の表のように-1は1にエンコードされ、1は2に、-2は3に、と続きます。
符号付オリジナル エンコードされた値 0 0 -1 1 1 2 - 2 3 2147483647 4294967294 -2147483648 4294967295 つまりsint32ではnをエンコードするのに
( n << 1 ) ^ ( n >> 31 ) が使用され、64ビット版では ( n << 1 ) ^ ( n >> 63 ) が使用されます。 後半のシフト部分 −( n >> 31 ) の部分 − は算術シフトであることに注意してください。つまり、シフトの結果は( nが正のときは )
全て0または( nが負のときは ) 全て1になります。 sint32やsint64がパースされると、値は元の符号付の値にデコードされます。
可変長整数以外の数 可変長整数以外の数値型は簡単です。ワイヤタイプ1のdoubleとfloatであればパーサはデータ長が64ビット固定だと期待でき、ワイヤタイプ5のfloatとfixed32のときも同様に32ビットだと期待できます。いずれの場合も値はリトルエンディアンバイトオーダーで格納されます。 文字列 ワイヤタイプ2(length-delimited )は、値部が可変長整数のデータ長の後にその長さのデータバイトが続くと言う意味です。 message Test2 { required string b = 2 ; } bの値 を" testing " にすると次のようになります : 12 07 < span style= " color :#ff0000 " >74 65 73 74 69 6e 67</ span > 赤い部分がUTF8 の" testing " です。ここではキーは0x12→tag=2 , type=2になります。値の中にある長さを示す可変長整数は7で、lo and behold 、7バイトの文字列が後に続くことが分かります。
組み込みメッセージ これは例に出てきた 型Test1が組み込まれたメッセージの定義です : message Test3 { required Test1 c = 3 ; } エンコードされた形は以下です : 1a 03 < span style= " color : #FF0000 ; " >08 96 01</span >
後半の3バイトは最初の例と全く同じ(08 96 01)であることが見てとれると思います。さらにその前には数値の3があります
− 組み込みメッセージは文字 列( wire type=2)と全く同じように処理されます。
PARIS–They adore him from a distance .
And now Europeans are about to get a look at Barack Obama , in person and up close .
Though the precise timetable is still being developed , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee appears poised to test his burgeoning international cachet with a tour of European capitals that is expected to extend to precision stops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Do n't be surprised if you see Obama on the 4th of July in Baghdad or Kabul , with stops in London and Paris on the way back and possibly more cities as well , " a Paris - based source familiar with the efforts of his advance team told the Toronto Star .
Three French government officials confirmed the anticipated arrival of Obama in separate interviews with the Star , even as President Nicolas Sarkozy saw off George W. Bush on the weekend on his last state visit to Paris .
The contrast between Obama and the sitting American president could not be greater than today , as Bush spent his swan - song swing through Europe in a state of muted apology , telling the Times of London he now regrets the combative phraseology – " Bring 'em on , " " Mission accomplished " – he used to frame the early days of his project to remake Iraq .
Public opinion in Europe appears already to have consigned Bush to history 's periphery with equal parts relish and relief .
It looks today to Obama with a sense of awe and wonder every bit as intense as the rock - star receptions he draws stateside .
The story by numbers is 52 per cent favouring Obama compared to 15 per cent for presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain , according to respondents to a recent five - country survey of Britain , France , Italy , Germany and Russia .
The poll , conducted for the Daily Telegraph , shows the French falling more profoundly for Obama , by a margin of 65 - 8 .
Nowhere is that adulation more apparent than Paris , where " L'effet Obama " – the Obama Effect – is the stuff of animated conversation .
" Obama rings our bells because he is a black man .
And also because he was among the first to speak out against the war in Iraq , " said Jean - Louis Beltrand , a Paris bookseller .
" It raises my spirits just to know an Obama is possible in America today .
It makes me see the United States in a much more familiar light . "
Paris officials downplay the notion Obama 's stay will include any major public appearances .
Though one projected he would easily draw vast hordes along the Champs Élysées – " Maybe not as many as the Pope , but huge I am sure " – Obama 's tour is aimed clearly at demonstrating to the U.S. electorate his potentially galvanizing effect on sometimes wayward allies .
" It is a French fact that we love `good '
Americans and we love to hate `bad ' Americans , " said Zaki Laidi , a senior research fellow at Sciences Po , the Paris - based political studies school .
" But it is also true that this honeymoon of better relations with the United States never lasts .
It never has in the past .
So there is no reason to assume it will this time , even with Obama as president . "
Indeed , a similar note of caution is sounded throughout the French diplomatic corps , where those familiar with the realpolitik of the trans -Atlantic relations doubt Obama will butter anyone 's baguette with charisma alone .
" Once you go beyond the welcome image and style of Obama , we are not anticipating dramatic changes in the relationship with America , " one highly placed official told the Star on background .
" We have already seen a warming of relations in the final phase of George Bush , a change in Washington 's tone toward greater multilateralism .
And the same constraints Bush faces on the key issues – climate change , soaring energy prices , the faltering economy – will still be there .
America 's fundamental interests will still be there as before . "
A spokesperson at Obama 's campaign headquarters in Washington did not respond to repeated requests for comment on his pending travels .
One of the questions left unanswered was whether the campaign is wary of overselling the international Obamamania to Americans , thereby scaring away swing voters uncomfortable with the world telling them how to vote .
A senior Paris - based diplomat suggested that embedded in that question is yet another reason for Obama 's extraordinary global appeal .
" You look at the mistakes the U.S. made in Iraq and how they compounded it with the failed attempt to tell the Middle East countries they all would become democracies .
When the backlash came , it was n't just American democracy that suffered the black eye .
It was all democracies , including France , " the diplomat said .

" And now , topping it all , comes this moment of redemption where America provides us all with this profound lesson in democracy through these amazing primaries – and in the end , putting forward a black man who opposed the very war that started all these problems in the first place .
Incredible . "
French historian Jacques Le Goff , who has written extensively on the glacial pace of reforms that have made Europe what it is today , cannot help but wonder at the sheer fact of Obama 's political ascendance .
You sense more than a little envy in his voice when he says , simply , " Bravo for American democracy .
" I admit I am surprised , " said Le Goff .
" The United States is very lucky on this fundamental point of progress and change .
" The Bush presidency was a disaster in every sense .
But look at them now . "
Though plans are not yet in place , diplomats in Paris also anticipate a McCain journey to Europe .
While the Republican generates little excitement here , many analysts expect a shift after November 's election , regardless of who wins .
" It does n't matter who the next American president is because France is not pro-Democratic or pro-Republican – France is anti-Bush , " said Batélémy Courmont of the Paris - based l'Institut de relations internationales et stratégiques .
" Once Bush is gone , it will completely change the partnership with the Americans for the better .
People will view it as the end of the pre-emptive , unilateral American world view that made the broader public incredibly uncomfortable . "
Either way , Europe will be watching the final showdown in American politics as a spectator sport second only to soccer .
" We are fascinated to find out what Americans really want – a father figure to guide them or a prodigal son to take them somewhere else , " said a senior French official .
" The father figure is usually what American democracy produces and that is certainly what John McCain represents .
" But with Obama , there is a feeling of new possibilities opening . "

the bathroom door was half - open , so i thought no one was using it , and i catch my gf standing legs spread on either side of the toilet -- DROPPING TURDS ! wtf !?
right as she 's squeezing off a real long and heavy one , she says : " INCOMING ! " and makes bomb - dropping noises .
" captain !
we 're under attack !
we 've been hit !
fire in the hole ! " then she looks up at me , sort of sheepish and blushes and quickly assumes the " normal " position .
" just a little game i sometimes play when i'm bored , " she says as she starts to wipe herself .
my jaw is still on the floor and i'm speechless .
" whatever ..... " i mumble as i head for the door .
as you can imagine , this has totally changed the way i look at my gf .
before i thought she was a cute , funny , sexy and sometimes shy babe .
now i see this whole other side of her , i get hard whenever i see a toilet , or a world war two battle scene in a movie , or a pile of dogshit on the sidewalk .has this ever happened to anyone else ?
just wondering ....
I just installed the lastest nightly build of Firefox v3.1a2 pre , because I was very curious to see how an application I 've been working on ( which is very JavaScript intensive ) would work with Mozilla 's new TraceMonkey ( JavaScript JIT ) engine .
I 'm extremely impressed by the performance of the JIT .
The application I 'm working has a lot of dependencies on JS behaviors that are initialized on page load .
I 've spent a lot of time to minimize the the impact of this code on page load , but there can be a good 250 - 1250 ms delay ( depending on PC hardware , the configuration of the page , etc. ) before every element on the page is completely usable .
So while there is a delay , I 've designed things so that it should be pretty transparent to the user because they see the page immediately and by the time they 'd actually go to do anything on the page , everything should be initialized .
While just testing the page under the latest nightly Firefox 3.1 build , this page is blazingly fast .
It 's so fast , I generally can't even see the initialization occur .
I 'm very impressed and I think things will only get better .
The addition of JavaScript JIT compilers is just a natural progression and I think it 'll be the way we see all browsers head .
The dependence on JavaScript in web design is greater than ever and with good reason — it allows us to build better web - based applications .
However , with the greater dependence on the usage of JavaScript , it can be a really battle at times to tweak performance out of an application .
It looks like TraceMonkey is making great strides in handling this problem natively in the browser .
I definitely recommend reading John Resig 's blog post on TraceMonkey .
It contains a lot of technical detail as well as a brief overview on how it all works .
More than 680,000 people set a quit date last year A controversial pill is boosting the success of smokers in England in kicking the habit , NHS figures suggest .
One in seven people trying to quit are using Champix , according to the first figures published since the stop smoking drug was licensed in 2006 .
And NHS Information Centre data showed 63 % of people were successful last year at the four - week mark compared to half using nicotine replacement therapy .
Champix has come under scrutiny over reports it causes suicidal feelings .
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says it is " closely " monitoring the drug after almost 3,000 reports of adverse reactions .
This shows that the investments that we are making in helping smokers to quit are having a positive impact
Ann Keen , health minister
So far there have been more than 200 reports of suicidal thoughts in patients taking Champix .
And more than 350 reports of depression , although these have mainly involved patients who had an underlying psychiatric illness .
The drug is unusual as it both stimulates and blocks specific nicotinic receptors in the brain .
By stimulating the receptor it is thought to mimic the effects of nicotine to reduce cravings .
At the same time , it partially blocks the receptor preventing nicotine from binding to it , resulting in a weaker response in people who give in to temptation and have a cigarette .
Trials suggested around 44 % of smokers give up after taking the drug twice a day for 12 weeks , compared with 18 % of those given a placebo and 30 % of those taking another major anti-smoking drug , bupropion .
Smoking ban
The latest figures show that in 2007 - 8 - the first year since the smoking ban was introduced - there was a 13 % increase to 680,000 in the number of people setting a quit date .
There was also a 10 % rise to 350,800 in the number of people who had stuck to their attempts to quit after four weeks .
NHS Stop Smoking Services spent almost £ 61 million in the past year on helping people to quit - nearly £ 10 million higher than the year before .
Health minister Ann Keen said she was delighted with the increase in people successfully quitting smoking .
" I 'd like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all those who have made such positive efforts to kick the habit - very well done .
" This shows that the investments that we are making in helping smokers to quit are having a positive impact . "

What are these ?
September 27 , 2008 4:00 PM | Simon Carless
[ In this opinion piece , semi-pseudonymous Game Developer magazine columnist Matthew Wasteland takes a look at gaming 's place in the creative canon , looking at what critics miss within gaming , and what everyone needs to understand about games as an artform . ]
Most people in the video game industry , and many people who write about them for a living , hope for games to be taken seriously as art or literature .
It ’s just around the corner , we believe — the day the establishment flings open the door to us and lets us in , apologetic tears streaming from their eyes .
“ We misjudged you , ” they ’ll cry , “ Just like we initially misjudged movies , jazz , and prose poetry . ”
Games are a brand new medium , we console ourselves , and these hidebound fogeys just need time to understand it .
The conventional wisdom is that we ’re nearly there — that everyone on our side is just being a little too uncreative , or that the software tools are just a bit lacking , and that our wildest dreams are possible with just a little more cleverness in our game designs and some new technological developments .
“ Design challenges ” at industry conferences exhort professionals to stretch their brains by sketching out an idea based around something perceived to be an unconventional subject matter ( for games , anyway ) ; Moby Dick , for example .
We may not have much cachet , people may shrink away when we explain what we do at non-industry social gatherings , but hey !
Just the other day we were talking about ideas for games based on Moby Dick !
How could that not be serious and important ?
We all believe in the future of the games ( I think this is why we are here , right ? ) , and while my Magical Wasteland weblog has become known for its skeptical tack , I want to point out I have nothing but respect for those who are courageously trying to expand our thinking about games .
I am questioning things because I want them to get better .
If there are significant limits to what games ( as we know them now ) can do , we need to understand those limits so we can overcome them .
Critics of older media often dismiss video games without fully explaining why ; this is an attempt to do it in their stead .
Some Possible Approaches
Firstly , we have our “ traditional ” adaptations .
Given that we wanted to maintain at least some semblance to the original work , we have a couple familiar options for Moby Dick : The Video Game ( there are also ways to combine both approaches to varying degrees , but for the sake of the exercise I will talk about them as separates ) .
The first approach would be to keep the sequence of major events —
Captain
Ahab ’s first encounter with the title character , his desire for revenge , his madness , and subsequent death — and attempt to insert gameplay sequences around those fixed points .
The player therefore could have fun sailing the Pequod and catching whales at some point between Ahab ’s first and second encounters with the whale .
Success at these parts of the game would allow him to proceed further in the story .
But no matter how much freedom the player was given to navigate the ocean in his own self - directed way , ultimately , the predetermined story of Captain Ahab ’s obsession wins out , and at the end of the game , Moby Dick destroys the Pequod no matter what happened in the intervening time .
Most large - budget titles made today take this route ( the average consumer does not seem to mind it at all ) , but many game designers and commentators find themselves dissatisfied with it .
It means the player ’s agency in the game world is only an illusion .
No matter what the player does , or how well he plays , the white whale will kill Captain Ahab in a short cinematic scene after the gameplay is over .
That ’s the story that ’s been set up for the player to experience , and he travels along that path like a tourist on a Disneyland ride .
However much choice the player seems to have in between these story checkpoints , the overall path of the game is geometrically equivalent to those of film or theater or books .
We choose to ignore the fundamental quality that makes games different and so compelling — their interactivity .
The other approach is to “ open up ” Moby Dick , to allow the player real , significant choices in the course of events and their outcomes .
In this configuration , an especially skillful player might be so good at the game that he does indeed catch and kill Moby Dick , triumphantly achieving Captain Ahab ’s revenge — and along with it , destroying the whole point of Melville ’s story .
Allowing such an alternate ending robs the work of its power ; the story of Moby Dick is engaging precisely because Captain Ahab cannot find extra lives , rewind time or load an old save for a second chance , and the story of his obsession and undoing is fixed over time , a static sculpture in four dimensions .
The issue of these changeable outcomes is what the critic Roger Ebert infamously identified as the central problem with games - as - art , and despite the emotional flurries and dismissive grumblings from the gaming community , it is actually a good point without a clear answer .
If Melville had so much as allowed for any possibility at all where Captain Ahab “ wins , ” no matter how remote , the work ’s message and its interpretation of the world completely changes .
Instead of destiny and fate , we would now speak of probability and chance .
Work hard enough , get lucky enough , and anything is possible .
The problems of these two approaches show why , despite our high hopes and our big money , it sometimes feels like all we have to showcase for our vaunted new storytelling medium is either something that is basically a film or a book conflated with pockets of gameplay , or a cheesy Choose Your Own Adventure affair where no single story can really be granted sole authorial intent .
This puts us in a strange bind : we ’re either imitative of , and beholden to , the arts that preceded us ( “ if you want a good story , why not read a book ? ” ) , or we are unmoored in a postmodern haze , trying to argue that a quantum superposition of many possible outcomes is just as artful as a linear story ( “ this painting is a work of art and self - expression — but it does n’t matter if that part is red or blue or green ” ) .
Neither of these options is fully satisfying .
On ' Systems As Art '
Then , we have what I will call “ systems - as-art ” .
An example of systems - as - art in its simplest and unvarnished form is Rod Humble ’s experiment , The Marriage , wherein a couple of floating squares ( one blue , one pink ) drift around a field but must meet certain different conditions in order to prevent the “ game ” ( that is , the marriage ) from ending .
Playing it is an exercise in attempting to sustain equilibrium in the face of change , something we understand to be the author ’s interpretation of what being in a marriage feels like .
Humble argues that a set of rules by itself can communicate meaning and achieve the status of art .
By the same logic , if The Marriage is a work of art about marriage , then chess is a work of art about conflict and war , Monopoly might be a work of art about capitalism , even the sport of basketball could potentially be a work of art about , say , agility and endurance .
Jonathan Blow , the creator of Braid , goes even farther , suggesting that the creation of internally consistent rule systems is a superior method to writing for the conveyance of philosophy ( although in the same interview , he also mentions that nobody has yet fully understood the meaning of his game ) .
The Marriage is almost completely devoid of context .
The system of its rules exist and operate with the barest of any qualities that might attach the player to what is going on .
The two squares change position grow or shink in size , and become opaque or transparent .
The player may understand ( by dint of the game ’s title ) on some level that one of the boxes is meant to represent the husband , and the other box is the wife , and he may try to keep them together .
But it ’s also likely that he will see the colored , geometric shapes and not feel much of anything .
What brings us to care about a colored square in a video game world ?
One of the moments of emotional resonance in Portal is the incineration ( by the player ’s own hand ) of the coyly named and designed Weighted Companion Cube .
One could argue that the Companion Cube is just as nonrepresentational as the boxes in The Marriage , but context is the key .
It is the only cube of its kind ( it has hearts on it , as opposed to the numerous nondescript cubes strewn throughout the game ) .
The level in which the Companion Cube appears is impossible to solve without it .
The player ’s nemesis , tormentor , and unreliable narrator has specifically advised the player not to become attached to it .
Finally , this villain suggests that the Companion Cube cannot speak , but if it could , it would politely ask the player to destroy it .
This is very clever : at that moment , the player ca n’t help but to imagine the Companion Cube speaking .
What would it say ?
“ Please do n’t incinerate me , ” probably .
We feel sorry we have to destroy the Companion Cube to progress in the game .
Despite ourselves , we hope we will see it again somehow .
Why would you care about a simple box in a video game ?
Portal , I think , offers a better answer .
Our experience of the Companion Cube sequence draws us in , it interests us .
The Marriage does n’t do that , and that is its fundamental weakness : it is not particularly fun or engaging , except by virtue of the fact that it is one of the first and few deliberate explorations of systems - as - art .
Humble comes close to acknowledging this , saying that “ The Marriage is intended to be art , ” and “ meant to be enjoyable but not entertaining in the traditional sense most games are . ”
Distancing the work from the “ entertainment ” of popular games is fine , but even the most artsy , obscure and difficult works must connect with an audience somehow .
I am not sure a system of rules by itself is the best method to achieve that .
If rules are art , could not one just as easily publish a rulebook , and leave it at that ?
None of this is to say that a system of rules cannot be of artful construction .
I have no doubt that , if we wished it and worked for it , we could at some point have departments at forward - thinking arts colleges devoted to the creation of not -very - representational rule systems as art .
This might make some of us feel better about ourselves — that there is a recognized , serious side to our medium .
But I ca n’t help but think something like that would be a Pyrrhic victory , with “ art games ” sharing space in an airless pantheon next to twelve - tone music or hypertext novellas while the rest of the world goes on listening to primordial melodies and timeworn stories reinvented in the style of the day .
Conclusion
It has become a recognized cliché in these kinds of conversations to ask , “ have games had their Citizen Kane yet ? ”
It ’s not as if the moment Citizen Kane was released , everyone suddenly decided that the medium of film was serious and important and the next great art form .
But I think there ’s a reason we have been speaking in terms of Citizen Kane and not , for example , Un Chien Andalou .
While both are important milestones in the history of the medium , Citizen Kane is accessible and easy to like .
It synthesized much of what was known about filmmaking up to that point into a coherent whole .
It married technical innovations with a good story .
It showed that a film could be high and low , art and spectacle , serious and entertaining all at once .
A medium that can deliver all of that in one package is a great medium indeed .
For many adults today , retaining a set of pearly whites helps boost your confidence in every occasion .
But did you know of the many types of food and drinks that can stain your teeth and knockback on your confidence ?
Let ’s find out what these notorious foods are and how you can keep your teeth white …

Millionaires and Hollywood stars visiting Italy have been put on notice that they no longer own the beach after a group of celebrities led by Flavio Briatore , co-owner of QPR football club , were pelted with wet sand and showered with water as they tried to land dinghies on a crowded Sardinian beach .
Already victims of shrinking spending power and sky - rocketing rates for renting deckchairs , Italians have descended on their beaches this August in a surly mood , and the sight of the Briatore - led flotilla as it carved a swath through alarmed swimmers was enough to spark a near riot on Friday at the packed Capriccioli beach .
The Italian newspaper La Stampa seized on the episode as the start of a fightback against celebrities flaunting their wealth on the country 's top beaches , stating : " From north to south , the rebellion against those who show off their money and power is growing . "
The authorities also appear to be clamping down .
Last week , Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta -Jones came ashore from their yacht at the Italian resort of Santa Margherita Ligure , the same spot where locals were kept awake in June by thumping music from Wayne Rooney 's rented yacht .
After failing to notify the coastguard of the names of all the members of the landing group , the captain of Douglas 's yacht was fined £ 1,600 under immigration and anti-terrorism legislation .
Hostilities erupted in Sardinia when Briatore , the manager of the Renault formula one team , came ashore from a yacht to inaugurate his new restaurant , which opened on Friday just behind the beach and is close to his opulent disco Billionaire , a bastion of the super - rich .
Briatore and his new bride , the TV showgirl Elisabetta Gregoraci , were met with grumbling from sunbathers as they hopped off the first dinghy , rising to whistles and shouts when the Italian newsreader Emilio Fede climbed off the second , while " terrorised children wailed between the waves " , reported La Stampa .
Yelling " Shame !
Louts !
Go home ! " , a mob formed to greet the third dinghy , attempting to push it back out to sea , as mothers filled their children 's buckets with water to sling at the passengers and wet sand bombs were hurled .
The episode marked a tough homecoming for Briatore , who has enjoyed an extended honeymoon since his star - studded Rome wedding in June .
" We are nice people and we get rewarded like this , " Corriere della Sera quoted Briatore as saying after he returned to the beach to find out why his guests were being drenched .
" I will close down everything , " he warned .
" I pay taxes , this is my right . "
With his new restaurant designed as a lunch stop for passing mega- yachts , Briatore may be wondering how Arab princes and Russian oligarchs will react to lobbed sand .
But a Billionaire spokesman hinted that all may be in hand : " This year we are opening the restaurant , but from next year we will manage the beach as well . "
See what Sandi
Thom could look like in 30 years if she used sunbeds three times a week
Enlarge Image
An image showing singer Sandi Thom with deep - set wrinkles and discoloured , saggy skin is being used to warn young people about the dangers of sunbeds .
Cancer Research UK used ageing technology to show how the 27 - year - old Scot might look with severe skin damage , as well as natural aging .
The charity said it wanted a shocking image to make youngsters think .
The Sunbed Association said there was no link between the responsible use of sunbeds and overexposure to UV rays .
Thom , from Aberdeen , who admitted using sunbeds up to three times a week while at university in Liverpool , said : " The thought of looking like this when I 'm 57 is terrifying .
" Having seen these images , I can honestly say I am never going to use a sunbed again .
While young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now , in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
Caroline Cerny
Cancer Research UK
" You can so easily get brown from a bottle these days , there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds .
" I hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed . "
The images were created by using a recent picture of Thom , and taking into account her lifestyle , images of her parents , and her typical UV exposure .
One image indicated how she could look in 30 years with skin damage that could be caused by overexposure to UV rays .
In contrast , another image suggested how she might look at 57 with natural age progression , and 70 % fewer wrinkles .
UV exposure Caroline Cerny , of Cancer Research UK , said August was a busy period for sunbed use in the UK , with people keen to keep their holiday suntan .
" While young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now , in the long - term they are doing serious damage to their looks , " she said .
She added that using a sunbed before the age of 35 increased the risk of skin cancer by up to 75 % .
Kathy Banks , CEO for The Sunbed Association said there was no link between the responsible use of sunbeds and overexposure to UV rays .
" Sandi
Thom only used sunbeds three times a week , which we would not regard as causing overexposure to UV rays , " she said .
" Sunbed users are very aware of the risks associated with UV overexposure , and most have less than 20 sunbed sessions a year .
" The greatest source of UV exposure is from the sun - not from sunbeds . "

What are these ?
When the Pentagon ordered a Navy ship to shoot down a crippled U.S. spy satellite last February , it claimed the operation was necessary to prevent a harmful fuel from being dispersed in the atmosphere .
At the time , critics charged that the Bush administration was using the toxic fuel as an excuse to demonstrate missile - defense and antisatellite capabilities .
Now , there is new evidence that the critics were very likely right .
Astrophysicist Yousaf Butt obtained U.S. government documents showing that NASA 's own analysis concluded that the satellite 's fuel tank was expected to burn up completely during re-entry — even though NASA probably overestimated the tank 's chances of survival .
" Despite its optimistic oversimplifications , the released study indicates that the tank would certainly have demised high up in the atmosphere , " Butt , a staff scientist at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , writes in an article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists .
Up to now , U.S. officials had refused to release any of the prelaunch analyses regarding the fuel tank , claiming they contained sensitive information .
Beyond the stated concern about the toxic fuel , U.S. officials also were probably trying to prevent any fragments of the highly classified National Reconnaissance Agency imagery satellite from falling into the hands of U.S. adversaries .
There were some additional inconsistencies surrounding government officials ' accounts of the operation .
In the days before the launch , several U.S. officials warned that bad weather could delay the mission .

HARTFORD , CT - After pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union , H&R Block has agreed to give $ 100 coupons or free TaxCut software to all gay couples who incurred additional costs because they were barred from using the company 's online tax service , TaxCut Online .
The coupons can be applied towards the costs of future tax preparation expenses with the company for the 2008 tax season .
The company has also agreed to direct future tax filers with civil unions to a free online support specialist to help couples complete their taxes .
" We 're pleased that H&R Block has decided to do right by gay couples throughout the country , " said Rebecca Shore , a staff attorney with the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project .
" Saying you 've been civilly united will never be the same as saying you 're married , but at least gay couples will no longer face the prospect of paying more to prepare their taxes . "
The ACLU sent a demand letter to H&R Block on March 25 , 2008 , demanding that it stop penalizing gay couples with civil unions who were barred from filing their taxes through the company 's online tax preparation service .
The ACLU sent the letter on behalf of Jason Smith and Settimio Pisu , a Connecticut couple who attempted to use the company 's online service but were told through the website that " We Don't Support Connecticut Civil Union Returns . "
Connecticut law makes it illegal to discriminate based on civil union status .
" No one enjoys doing their taxes .
But it 's especially annoying when you 're reminded in a not - too - subtle - way that your relationship is considered inferior , " said Smith .
" We 're glad H&R Block came through in the end . "
Andrew Schneider , Executive Director of the ACLU of Connecticut , added , " While this story has a happy ending , these kinds of problems will continue for gay couples as long as the state insists on barring gay people from marriage . "
The $ 100 coupon is available at www.taxcut.com/tax_tips/aclu.html
A copy of the letter from H&R Block announcing its decision to provide rebates and online support and other information about the matter is available at www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/34632res20080325.html

Attention Leos , Virgos , Scorpios and other zodiac - focused readers : Still using horoscopes to predict your future ?
Scientists are working on other , perhaps less - open - to - interpretation , ways .
Just this month alone :
* Researchers at four cancer centers , including the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center , figured out that analyzing a specific panel of genes can predict survival rates among lung cancer patients .
The research , which could aid in treatment decisions , appeared in Nature Medicine .
* Scottish researchers devised a formula to predict emergency room admissions for people age 40 and older .
Those more likely to be admitted were older men and those who had previous admissions and who had been prescribed a variety of drugs .
The research was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
* And the good folks at UT Southwestern Medical Center and UT Dallas used studies of kidney stone rates across geographic regions , plus models of global warming , to predict an increase in the nation 's kidney stones , an additional 1.6 million to 2.2 million cases to be exact .
The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Of course , such predictions do n't have the romance of , say : " This is your year to embrace the unknown and fall in love with uncertainty " -- today 's prediction for those born July 30 .
( Let me know , birthday boys and girls , if this does indeed prove to be the case .
And whether " fresh feelings are born in your heart in September . "
Here 's the rest of today 's horoscopes . )
But if I had lung cancer , I know which predictive possibilities I 'd prefer .

Many of these as seen on tv items are currently airing and are hot sellers .
Long before the mortgage crisis began rocking Main Street and Wall Street , a top FBI official made a chilling , if little - noticed , prediction :
The booming mortgage business , fueled by low interest rates and soaring home values , was starting to attract shady operators and billions in losses were possible .
“ It has the potential to be an epidemic , ” Chris Swecker , the FBI official in charge of criminal investigations , told reporters in September 2004 .
But , he added reassuringly , the FBI was on the case .
“ We think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the S&L ; crisis , ” he said .
Today , the damage from the global mortgage meltdown has more than matched that of the savings - and - loan bailouts of the 1980s and early 1990s .
By some estimates , it has made that costly debacle look like chump change .
But it ’s also clear that the FBI failed to avert a problem it had accurately forecast .
Banks and brokerages have written down more than $ 300 billion of mortgage - backed securities and other risky investments in the last year or so as homeowner defaults leaped and weakness in the real estate market spread .
Advertisement
In California alone , lenders have foreclosed on $ 100 billion worth of homes over the last two years and are foreclosing at a rate of 1,300 houses every business day , according to a recent report from ForeclosureRadar.com .
Most observers have declared the mess a gross failure of regulation .
To be sure , in the run-up to the crisis , market - oriented federal regulators bragged about their hands - off treatment of banks and other savings institutions and their executives .
But it was n’t just regulators who were looking the other way .
The FBI and its parent agency , the Justice Department , are supposed to act as the cops on the beat for potentially illegal activities by bankers and others .
But they were focused on national security and other priorities , and paid scant attention to white - collar crimes that may have contributed to the lending and securities debacle .
Now that the problems are out in the open , the government ’s response strikes some veteran regulators as too little , too late .
Swecker , who retired from the FBI in 2006 , declined to comment for this article .

But sources familiar with the FBI budget process , who were not authorized to speak publicly about the growing fraud problem , say that he and other FBI criminal investigators sought additional assistance to take on the mortgage scoundrels .
They ended up with fewer resources , rather than more .
In 2007 , the number of agents pursuing mortgage fraud shrank to around 100 .
By comparison , the FBI had about 1,000 agents deployed on banking fraud during the S&L ; bust of the 1980s and ‘ 90s , said Anthony Adamski , who oversaw financial crime investigations for the FBI at the time .
The FBI says it now has about 200 agents working on mortgage fraud , but critics say the agency might have averted much of the problem had it heeded its own warning .

“ The FBI correctly diagnosed that mortgage fraud was epidemic , but it did not come close to meeting its announced goal , ” said William K. Black , who was a federal regulator during the S&L ; crisis and now teaches economics and law at the University of Missouri - Kansas City .
“ It used everyday procedures and woefully inadequate resources to deal with an epidemic , ” he said .
“ The approach was certain to bring symbolic prosecutions and strategic defeat . ”
The mortgage debacle has laid bare a system marked by dubious practices at every stage of the process .
Lenders often made loans to borrowers who had limited ability to repay them but little desire to pass up the dream of homeownership .
Many loans lacked basic documentation , such as information about borrowers ’ incomes .
Still , mortgage companies could hardly sell them fast enough , packaging the loans as investment securities and peddling them to eager buyers on Wall Street .

The FBI defends its handling of the crisis , with officials contending that as home prices were rising several years ago , the trouble brewing in the mortgage market -- and the potential crimes behind it -- was not immediately apparent .
Officials said they began approaching mortgage companies and others in an attempt to raise awareness about the growing fraud problem .
But the lenders had little incentive to cooperate because they were continuing to make money .
Black says that in many cases , they were part of the fraud .
“ Nobody wanted to listen , ” Sharon Ormsby , the chief of the FBI ’s financial crimes section , said in an interview .
“ We were dealing with the issue as best we could back then . ”
Over the last three years , the FBI and other agencies have brought dozens of mortgage - fraud cases .
The bureau has rooted out foreclosure rescue schemes in which homeowners are tricked into signing over the deeds to their homes to operators who buried the properties even deeper in debt .
Agents have disrupted cases of identity theft in which criminals open -- and exhaust -- home equity lines of credit and leave homeowners stuck with the bill .

Many of the cases have been relatively small , however , with about half the investigations involving losses of less than $ 1 million -- the size of two or three loans .
But the tepid response also reflects a broad realignment of law - enforcement priorities at the Justice Department in which mortgage fraud and other white - collar crimes have been subordinated to other Bush administration priorities .
That has reflected , in part , the ramp - up in national security and terrorism investigations after the Sept. 11 attacks .
But the administration has also put more support behind efforts against illegal immigration and child pornography .
In a way , the mortgage debacle could not have come onto the FBI radar screen at a worse time .
Just as Swecker was making his doomsday forecast , the FBI , under pressure from Congress and the White House , was creating a crime - fighting brain drain , transferring hundreds of agents from its criminal investigations unit into its anti-terrorism program .
About 2,500 agents doing criminal work -- 20 % or so of the entire force -- were affected .

Even as the number of new white - collar cases started declining , the Justice Department did pursue some high - profile corporate prosecutions , such as those arising from the collapse of Enron Corp .
But some former prosecutors question the administration ’s current commitment to pursuing complex , high - stakes cases .
“ I think most sitting U.S. attorneys now staring at the subprime crisis find scant resources available to pursue sophisticated financial crimes , ” said John C. Hueston , a Los Angeles lawyer who was a lead federal prosecutor in the trials of Enron executives Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling .
Absent a major shift in priorities and resources , he said , it is likely that the Justice Department and the FBI will continue on their current path of focusing on simple cases “ that do n’t go to the heart of the problem . ”
The FBI says it has 21 open investigations into possible large - scale fraud related to the subprime meltdown .
The Times reported last month that a federal grand jury in Los Angeles had subpoenaed records from three large California lenders : Countrywide Financial Corp. ( now part of Bank of America Corp. ) , New Century Financial Corp. and IndyMac Federal Bank .

Among other possible targets , the FBI has said , are investment firms that sold billions in securities backed by shaky subprime mortgages and credit rating agencies that gave high marks to the now - worthless securities and failed to protect investors .
But it may be hard to jump - start such probes .
Trying to prove that a major mortgage company intended to defraud buyers of its securities , for example , could take years of digging into records and testimony .
Moreover , some of those involved may have special legal protection : Credit rating firms have in other cases successfully asserted that their opinions about the values of securities are protected by the 1st Amendment .
“ I am happy to have investigations going on , but these investigations should have taken place years ago , ” said Blair A. Nicholas , a San Diego lawyer representing investors who lost money in the collapse of several subprime mortgage lenders .
“ They seem to always get involved after the horse has left the barn .
It is always cleaning up the mess rather than being proactive . ”

Could the crisis have been averted , or at least mitigated , if the FBI had intervened more forcefully ?
“ Until there is a catastrophic loss , there is no incentive to investigate criminal conduct , ” said Cynthia Monaco , a former federal prosecutor in New York .
“ Nor are there people coming forward with evidence ” such as angry investors or whistle - blowing corporate employees , she said .
Even now , Monaco added , it is far from clear whether the damage -- suffered by investors and homeowners alike -- was the product of clear - cut fraud .
Ormsby says the FBI is more actively working with other federal investigative agencies in the hope they will pick up the slack .
The Secret Service , for example , in a departure from its traditional missions of protecting presidents and heads of state and investigating counterfeiting , has assigned more than 100 agents to examine mortgage fraud , said spokesman Edwin Donovan .

The Justice Department is also starting to mobilize .
The department offered what it described as a “ basic seminar ” on mortgage fraud cases to about 100 prosecutors last week at its national training academy in South Carolina .

Enlarge By Dennis Drenner for USA TODAY TSA Officer Derrick Ward screen passengers at Baltimore / Washington International airport in Maryland .
The Transportation Security Administration will stop tracking people without ID in a database because they do not automatically represent a security threat .
GETTING A SECOND LOOK GETTING A SECOND LOOK
The TSA has kept records of air travelers who : Violate security rules , such as bringing weapons to checkpoints
Act suspiciously and are questioned by police Forget identification at a checkpoint Source : Transportation Security Administration WASHINGTON 
The Transportation Security Administration has collected records on thousands of passengers who went to airport checkpoints without identification , adding them to a database of people who violated security laws or were questioned for suspicious behavior .
The TSA began storing the information in late June , tracking many people who said they had forgotten their driver 's license or passport at home .
The database has 16,500 records of such people and is open to law enforcement agencies , according to the TSA .
Asked about the program , TSA chief Kip Hawley told USA TODAY in an interview Tuesday that the information helps track potential terrorists who may be " probing the system " by trying to get though checkpoints at various airports .
Later Tuesday , Hawley called the newspaper to say the agency is changing its policy effective today and will stop keeping records of people who do n't have ID if a screener can determine their identity .
Hawley said he had been considering the change for a month .
The names of people who did not have identification will soon be expunged , he said .
Civil liberties advocates have been fearful that the database includes passengers who have done nothing wrong yet may face extra scrutiny at airports or questioning by authorities investigating possible terrorism .
" This information comes back to haunt people , " said Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union .
The TSA has been expanding an electronic database that started a couple of years ago to keep track of people who violated security regulations , most often by bringing a dangerous item to a checkpoint .
The agency then began adding names of people who were questioned by police but not necessarily charged after an airport screener saw them acting suspiciously .
In those cases , the TSA can keep records for 15 years of someone 's name , address , Social Security number , nationality , race and physical features , as well as identifying information about a traveling companion , according to a report by the Homeland Security Department privacy office .
Hawley said the database will still be used but it will not contain people 's names who forgot their identification .
Such a database helps the TSA spot patterns of activity that may indicate terrorist planning and refer people to the FBI for possible questioning .
" It 's just like if a police officer chats to somebody .
It 's part of the investigative process , " Hawley said .
Travelers without ID were added in June after the TSA barred them from airplanes .
The agency wanted to identify all passengers to check them against watch lists .
Previously , passengers without ID could board airplanes after facing additional searches .
Hawley said the TSA will stop tracking people without ID because they do not automatically represent a security threat .
The TSA will still keep records of people who go to checkpoints without ID and then give a false name to screeners .

Although surveys show the presidential race could be a squeaker , Barack Obama is winning women 51 to 39 percent , according to a poll conducted for EMILY 's List .
The group , which supports Democratic , pro-choice women candidates and is behind Obama in ' 08 , found that Obama leads among women voters of all age groups , but his advantage is narrowest among baby boomers .
Female voters have trended Democratic in their choice for the White House in recent elections , although John Kerry won them by a mere 3 percentage points in 2004 .
That 's down from Al Gore 's 11 - point margin in 2000 and Bill Clinton 's whopping 16 - point margin in 1996 .
The 1980s were another story , particularly during Ronald Reagan 's re-election bid in 1984 , when he attracted female voters by a 12 - point margin .
Today 's women not only favor Obama , but his supporters were more likely than McCain 's to indicate they 've made up their minds in the contest , according to the poll , which is full of revealing data on women 's views , values , and generational trends .
It looked at four age groups of registered voters :
Generation Y : These 18 - to - 27 - year - old women — sometimes dubbed the " Millennials " — are successors to the legendary Generation X . They prefer Obama over John McCain more than any other age group .
Sixty - two percent want Obama in the White House , compared with 32 percent for McCain .
Most of these youngest voters picked President Clinton as their top political hero , while 1 in 8 named Obama .
These women are Facebook junkies .
They 're green .
And they 're not immune from economic anxiety .
More than older women , they 're worried about finding a good - paying job .
When asked if this was a good time to be just starting off in this country , this group , born between 1981 and 1990 , were nearly evenly divided .
They also stand out from the other age groups for their more favorable view of the growing acceptance of gays , lesbians , and same - sex unions : 53 percent favorable , 28 percent unfavorable , and 18 percent neutral .
Likewise they 're more apt to be positive about America 's increasing racial diversity : 46 percent were favorable , 40 percent neutral , and 14 percent unfavorable .
Generation X : Many of these 28 - to - 43 - year - old women are mothers of young children .
The support for Obama in this age bracket sinks dramatically , leaving him with a single - digit advantage .
Forty - nine percent are for Obama and 41 percent for McCain .
Born between 1965 and 1980 , these women most often herald Reagan as their political hero .
Three quarters of the overall group are married and nearly as many ( 73 percent ) have kids under age of 18 .
Gen X'ers are more apt to prefer a presidential candidate who touts safety and security ( 40 percent ) over hope and optimism ( 33 percent ) .
The group divides on the increasing acceptance of homosexuals and same - sex unions ( 41 percent unfavorable , 40 percent favorable , and 19 percent neutral ) .
Baby Boomers :
These 44 - to - 62 - year - old women are diverse .
Younger boomers are working and raising families while older ones are in retirement or approaching it .
They give Obama the slimmest margin over McCain : 49 to 43 percent .
The age group split evenly four years ago for President George W. Bush and Democratic nominee John Kerry , 49 percent a piece .
Born between 1946 and 1964 , these women have a positive take on America becoming more racially diverse , but not as much as younger women .
They have a marginally negative view of the growing acceptance of homosexuals and same - sex unions , with 41 percent unfavorable and 34 percent favorable .
They 're also more apt than any other age cohort to say sexism remains a problem for women : 79 percent agree .
Their top political hero : President John F. Kennedy .
Seniors :
These 63 - and - older women favor Obama 49 percent to 38 percent .
They 're driven by a range of social and economic trends .
Not surprisingly , they 're more focused on Social Security and Medicare as voting issues .
Those concerns nearly rival other pocketbook issues ( the cost of healthcare , gas , and food ) as top voting concerns .
One in five of those born in 1945 or earlier sees the increasing access to the Internet in U.S. homes as a negative .
Roughly the same proportion views increasing racial diversity as a negative .
Socially , they are more conservative .
Forty - nine percent call the acceptance of homosexuals and same - sex marriage unfavorable .
Only 26 percent call it favorable .
They too look to JFK as a political hero .
Setting aside the age of respondents , McCain leads narrowly among white women ( 46 percent to Obama 's 44 percent ) and significantly among evangelicals ( 58 percent to 33 percent ) .
Obama had the biggest margins among African - American women ( 91 percent to McCain's 3 percent ) and among female college graduates with postgraduate study ( 64 percent to 29 percent ) .
On the issues , " pocketbook " concerns trump all others .
Forty - three percent of women name the cost of living , healthcare , gas , and food as top concerns .
Thirty - two percent identified foreign policy and national security issues and 28 percent cited energy policies .

I mean literally lost its brakes ….. lost them so bad that they come flying off ?

A new scientific review of the most current research shows the link between eating oatmeal and cholesterol reduction to be stronger than when the FDA initially approved the health claim ’s appearance on food labels in 1997 .
Dr. James W. Anderson , professor of medicine and clinical nutrition at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine , co-authors “ The Oatmeal - Cholesterol Connection : 10 Years Later ” in the January / February 2008 issue of the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine . .
Anderson presents a contemporary analysis to determine if newer studies are consistent with the original conclusion reached by the FDA .
His report says studies conducted during the past 15 years have , without exception , shown :
total cholesterol levels are lowered through oat consumption ;
low - density lipoprotein ( LDL , the “ bad ” cholesterol ) is reduced without adverse effects on high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL , the “ good ” cholesterol ) , or triglyceride concentrations .
“ Whole - grain products like oatmeal are among some of the best foods one can eat to improve cholesterol levels , in addition to other lifestyle choices , ” Anderson said .
“ Lifestyle choices , such as diet , should be the first line of therapy for most patients with moderate cholesterol risk given the expense , safety concerns , and intolerance related to cholesterol lowering drugs . ”
More recent data indicate that whole - grain oats , as part of a lifestyle management program , may confer health benefits that extend beyond total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol reduction , Anderson said .
Recent studies suggest eating oatmeal may :
Reduce the risk for elevated blood pressure , Type 2 diabetes , and weight gain
Reduce LDL cholesterol during weight - loss
Provide favorable changes in the physical characteristics of LDL cholesterol particles , making them less susceptible to oxidation ( oxidation is thought to lead to hardening of the arteries . )
Supply unique compounds that may lead to reducing early hardening of the arteries
“ Since the 80’s , oatmeal has been scientifically recognized for its heart health benefits , and the latest research shows this evidence endures the test of time and should be embraced as a lifestyle option for the millions of Americans at - risk for heart disease , ” said Anderson .

McCain moments ago :
“ Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process .
Now is not the time to fix the blame , it ’s time to fix the problem . ”
Catch that – it would be inappropriate to start casting blame now , says McCain , in the next sentence after he blames Obama .
But considering how erratic McCain has been lately , it ’s perhaps understandable , although frightening , that he now ca n’t even remember what he ’s just said .

In another sign of the media 's sheepish acceptance of the Barack Obama " elitist " story line , the New York Times on Tuesday described the Illinois Senator as " tagged as elitist . "
But just as disturbing as the Republicans ' apparent success in establishing the " out of touch " narrative as a fixture in campaign coverage is John McCain 's seeming inoculation from it .
After all , John McCain is n't merely fabulously well off , courtesy of his wife Cindy 's $ 100 million beer distribution fortune .
At almost every turn , the Republican presidential nominee has shown almost a total ignorance of – or yawning disinterest in – the real lives of American voters .
From the growing financial hardships of the economic slowdown and the foreclosure crisis to the disintegrating American health care system and the dangers U.S. troops face on the streets on Baghdad , it is John McCain who is truly " out of touch . "
Yet voters and pundits alike agree that the supposed maverick is treated with kid gloves by the press , an elitist masquerading as a man of the people .
Here , then , are John McCain 's Top 10 " Out - of - Touch " Moments :
1. Economic downturn is " psychological . "
Having on multiple occasions admitted his limited understanding of the economy , Senator McCain instead turned armchair psychologist to diagnose the U.S economic slowdown .
In April , McCain told Fox News ' Neil Cavuto that " a lot of our problems today , as you know , are psychological . "
Apparently , four months of job losses , oil at $ 120 a barrel , record gas prices at the pump , 47 million uninsured and a devastating home foreclosure crisis are merely figments of Americans ' imaginations .
2. " Great progress economically " during the Bush years .
If Americans ' financial woes are all in their heads , John McCain 's assessment of George W. Bush 's economic leadership is pure hallucination .
Asked by Bloomberg 's Peter Cook on April 17 if Americans would say they are better off today " than before George Bush took office more than seven years ago , " McCain replied :
" I think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created , et cetera , et cetera , you could make an argument that there 's been great progress economically over that period of time . "
Mugged by reality , McCain 's firm response to the classic Ronald Reagan question ( " are you better off now ? " ) lasted exactly 24 hours .
The next day on April 18 , the so - called maverick acknowledged Americans are " hurting badly " and concluded , " Americans are not better off than they were eight years ago . "
3. eBay is the answer for poverty and recession .
During his so - called " Forgotten Places " tour last month , John McCain offered the people of the economically devastated regions in Martin County , Kentucky and Youngstown , Ohio a path out of financial desperation : eBay .
" Today , for example , " McCain said , " 1.3 million people in the world make a living off eBay , most of those are in the United State of America . "
If that sounds like something McCain 's national campaign co-chair and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman might say , it 's because she did .
In March , she told Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes , " We have about - around the world , about 1.3 million people make most , if not all , of their living selling on eBay . "
( It should come as no surprise that President Bush , too , extolled the virtues of Americans ' economic futures as sellers on eBay . )
4. " Tear down " New Orleans ?
McCain kicked off his tour in New Orleans , where he lambasted George W. Bush 's handling of the Katrina disaster .
( As it turns out , McCain 's criticism was choreographed with the White House as part of a coordinated effort to create the facade of distance between McCain and President Bush . )
There , McCain would not commit to the future of the city 's devastated 9th ward :
" That 's why we need to go back to have a conversation about what to do about it .
Rebuild it ?
Tear it down ?
Ya know , whatever it is . "
Just three days later , McCain claimed selective amnesia about his New Orleans comments , saying , " I do n’t remember ever saying it . "
Perhaps John McCain remembers celebrating his 69th birthday with President Bush on August 29 , 2005 , just as Hurricane Katrina slammed ashore .
5 . Irresponsible , undeserving homeowners .
In his widely panned March 25th address on the economy , John McCain essentially blamed American homeowners teetering on the brink of foreclosure for their plight , insisting " any assistance must be temporary and must not reward people who were irresponsible at the expense of those who were n't . "
Facing a backlash , McCain just two weeks later on April 11 rolled out new proposals , claiming his " priority number one is to keep well meaning , deserving home owners who are facing foreclosure in their homes . "
As the New York Times concluded :
In both tone and substance , Mr. McCain 's remarks were something of a departure from a speech the senator delivered last month in California in which he warned that " it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , whether they are big banks or small borrowers . "
6 . Work a second job , skip a vacation .
In that same March 25 , 2008 speech , the Republican nominee made it clear that selling Barbie dolls or Hummel figurines on eBay is n't John McCain 's only prescription for Americans facing economic difficulties .
The other ?
Just work harder .
McCain encouraged Americans to emulate the 51 million homeowners " doing what is necessary -- working a second job , skipping a vacation , and managing their budgets -- to make their payments on time . "
7. " Protect the privacy " of Cindy McCain 's tax returns .
Asking cash - strapped , over - worked Americans to labor harder is easy to say for John McCain .
After all , his beer heiress second wife Cindy has a fortune estimated at $ 100 million , more than enough to provide the candidate with private jets and still fund the McCain 's 8 homes and the charitable contributions funneled to the elite private schools attended by their children .
But asking John McCain to release his wife 's tax return is another matter .
His campaign claims , " Cindy McCain will not release her tax returns to protect the privacy of her four children ; details of their wealth are included in her filing . "
Of course , in 2004 , then RNC chairman and current Bush counselor Ed Gillespie insisted that the content of Theresa Heinz Kerry 's tax filings was " a legitimate question . "
By a whopping 64 % to 22 % margin , Americans believe that John McCain should make public his wife 's tax information .
8. Opposed to SCHIP expansion , McCain speaks at children 's hospital .
Last October , John McCain joined George W. Bush in opposing the expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( S - CHIP ) , calling Bush 's veto a " right call by the president . "
Of course , that did n't stop McCain from rolling out his health care proposals last week at Miami Children 's Hospital , a Florida medical institution which last fall publicly supported the S - CHIP expansion he opposed .
In a further irony , while McCain decried " new mandates and government regulation , " 9 year - old Jake Bernard who was spotlighted at the event received treatment for his cleft palate thanks to a statute passed by the state of Florida .
So much for McCain 's pledge to " work to eliminate the worries over the availability and cost of health care . "
9. Baghdad safer than some American neighborhoods .
John McCain 's is n't merely out of touch when it comes to Americans ' real lives at home .
He is consistently nonchalant about the dangers – and casualties – U.S. troops face in Iraq .
Wearing a bulletproof vest and guarded by " 100 American soldiers , with three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships overhead , " McCain on April Fool 's Day 2007 briefly toured a Baghdad market to demonstrate that the American people were " not getting the full picture . "
McCain recently claimed that there " are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhoods , today . "
In a press conference after his Baghdad tour , McCain told a reporter that his visit to the market today was proof that you could indeed " walk freely " in some areas of Baghdad .
In March 2008 , Senator McCain returned to a tried and untrue Republican talking point : Iraq is no more dangerous than most major American cities .
McCain announced , " There 's problems in America with safe neighborhoods as we well know . "
In this case , at least , even McCain realized his statement was nonsensical on its face and sounded the retreat .
" I 'm not making that comparison , because it 's much more deadly in Iraq obviously , " he said , adding , " But it 's kind of the same theory . "
Apparently , McCain 's theory applies whether the United States maintains a permanent military presence in Iraq for 100 , 1000 or even a million years .
10 . " I 'm not running on the Bush presidency . "
On April 1 , 2008 , John McCain offered Americans another April Fool 's joke , proclaiming " I 'm not running on the Bush presidency . "
McCain might want to check his campaign 's position papers .
After all , in his eternal quest for the Republican nomination , McCain has adopted virtually the entire Bush agenda , often reversing long held positions and compromising supposed core principles .
From Iraq , tax cuts for the wealthy , broken promises on the deficit to opposition to SCHIP , tax credits for health care , overturning Roe v. Wade and a right - wing Supreme Court , John McCain represents a third Bush term .
It 's no wonder Mr. Straight Talk said in February :
" I would be proud to have President Bush campaign with me and support me in any way that he feels is appropriate .
And I would appreciate it . "
So would we .
The lush , muddy wetlands of the Tana river delta , teeming with birds and home to hippos and crocodiles , lions and elephants , are more than 4,000 miles from Britain .
But this patchwork of savannah and mangrove swamp on the east coast of Africa is the latest victim of the British thirst for biofuels .
To meet the worldwide demand and the regulation that , from next week , petrol and diesel sold in Britain must be mixed with bioethanol or biodiesel as part of a drive to cut the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels , the Mumias Sugar Company in Kenya is planning to plant 20,000 hectares of the Tana delta to grow sugar cane for biofuels and food .
The £ 165 m project , including an ethanol refinery and food - processing plant , promises to create thousands of jobs in an area dominated by traditional cattle herding , small - scale rice and subsistence farming .
But environmental campaigners claim that the scheme would destroy the wetlands - home to 345 species of birds , including the threatened Basra reed warbler , the Tana river cisticola , and 22 species of waterbirds such as slender - billed gulls and Caspian terns , which are so numerous there they are considered ' internationally important ' to the global populations .
Globally the boom in this and other projects is causing growing concern about environmental damage and the part played by biofuels in pushing up food prices .
The UN Secretary - General , Ban Ki-moon , has called for a comprehensive review of the policy on biofuels as the crisis in world food prices threatens to trigger global instability .
Last week former Labour Environment Minister Elliot Morley called for the government to delay the new biofuel requirement until ' comprehensive certification and assessment schemes are put in place ' , echoing criticism by the Environment Department 's chief scientific adviser , Professor Robert Watson .
The chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Dr Rajendra Pachauri , has also spoken out against the risk of biofuels , especially of growing corn for ethanol in the US .
In the Tana delta , the two main worries are that monoculture planting would replace a large area of rich and diverse habitat , including unusual but unprotected Borassus palm savannah , and that irrigation for the new plants would use up to one third of the available water , claims the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , which has taken the unusual step of protesting directly to the Kenyan government .
Local campaigners say that Kenya 's National Environment Management Authority is expected to approve the scheme .
Mumias is also only one of a handful of schemes proposed in the delta , including commercial rice - growing and cattle breeding .
If approved , large areas would become ' ecological deserts ' , destroying wintering grounds for birds and the bugs they feed on , and dams would divert water essential to wildlife and cattle herders during the dry season , warned Paul Matiku , executive director of campaign group Nature Kenya .
Matiku is also worried about water diversion causing soil erosion , pollution harming fish stocks and damage to the nascent tourism industry .
' This development would be a national disaster , wreaking havoc with the area 's ecosystem and spelling the end for wildlife across much of the delta . '
The plans submitted by Mumias suggest about half the crop could be used for food and half for biofuel , primarily to sell in Kenya .
But high prices for biofuels overseas could force Mumias to sell to European and US buyers , said Paul Buckley , of the RSPB .
British consumers should be protected by 200 pages of regulations governing the sustainability of biofuels ; however , critics claim that indirectly British demand will suck in supplies from other markets , which would then be forced to turn to new suppliers like Mumias .
Farmers are also clearing new land for displaced food crops .
British regulations also rely , for the first two years at least , on embarrassing retailers by forcing them to publish details of where they buy their biofuel , but there is no punishment for buying from sources that cause damage to habitats , soil or water .
' It would appear to be the biofuel rage which has convinced them they can make an economic go of this , ' said Buckley .
However , the Renewable Energy Association said that not all biofuels were equally harmful .
Those planted on land cleared of ' carbon sinks ' such as forests were ' clearly bad ' , and some biofuels , like US ethanol from corn , had little , if any , carbon savings , said Paul Thompson , the association 's biofuel analyst .
But biofuel made from wheat , and local projects , such as British Sugar 's scheme to make bioethanol from sugar beet in Norfolk , were beneficial , he said .
Supporters were also excited about the prospect of future biofuels from waste and algae .
Strict rules about which biofuels were considered ' sustainable ' should also ensure that companies like BP and Shell bought only from reputable sources , said Thompson .
The Department for Transport said : ' Biofuels have the potential to help reduce the impact of transport on the environment , but we have always been clear about the need to ensure that they are sustainable ...
In addition , we recently announced a study into the wider impacts of biofuel . '
Justice Department probe finds patter in U.S. attorney firings
With Wall Street 's fate hanging in the balance , and with Sarah Palin 's incoherence sparking interest in Thursday 's vice presidential debate , it was easy to overlook another major story Monday that got less attention than it deserved .
The Justice Department released a nearly 400 - page report with this jaw - dropping bottom line : " Our investigation found significant evidence that political partisan considerations were an important factor in the removal of several ... U.S. attorneys . "
Remember the controversy over the sudden dismissals of nine U.S. attorneys ?
Remember the allegation that the Bush administration had sullied the long - held principle that justice should be administered in an impartial , nonpartisan way ?
Remember the questions about what then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales knew and when he knew it ?
Remember Kyle Sampson , the Gonzales aide who played a key role in the firings ?
Remember Monica Goodling , the White House liaison who went so far as to ask prospective JusticeDepartment appointees to wax eloquent about why they wanted to " serve " President Bush ?
The Justice Department conducted as thorough an investigation as it could , and concluded that there was evidence of White House political meddling in " at least three of the removals . "
The joint probe by the department 's Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility recommended further investigation to determine " whether the totality of the evidence demonstrates that any criminal offense was committed . "
The investigators reported being stonewalled by the White House , saying they were unable to look at all the evidence " because of the refusal by certain key witnesses to be interviewed by us , as well as by the White House 's decision not to provide internal White House documents to us . "
In other words , as far as the team of investigators could determine from the limited evidence they were allowed to uncover , what we suspected and feared seems to have been true .
The Bush administration seems to have removed at least three federal prosecutors - who are supposed to be evenhanded and apolitical in the way they do their jobs - for partisan political reasons .
The report says " it appears " that Missouri U.S. attorney Todd Graves " was told to resign because of a political dispute among Missouri politicians , not because of an objective assessment of his performance . "
Specifically the dispute was between Republican Sen. Christopher S. " Kit " Bond and his brother , a Republican congressman .
Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins " was not removed for any performance reasons , " the report says .
" Rather , the evidence shows that the main reason for Cummins ' removal was to provide a position for former White House official Tim Griffin . "
The most egregious case , according to the report , was that of New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias .
The evidence showed that Iglesias was removed because of complaints from Republican Sen .
Pete Domenici and other GOP officials and party activists who believed he was not being aggressive enough in pursuing certain voter fraud and public corruption cases - by happenstance , cases against Democrats .
Gonzales and his deputies never looked into Iglesias ' handling of those cases , and never even asked him about them .
They just fired him .
The investigators wanted to ask White House political czar Karl Rove , White House counsel Harriet Miers , Goodling , Domenici and Domenici 's chief of staff about any role they played in Iglesias ' dismissal .
All refused to be interviewed .
In releasing the report , Attorney General Michael Mukasey announced that he had ordered a new investigation to " pursue this case wherever the facts and the law require , " including possible criminal charges .
By most accounts , Mukasey has taken pains to cleanse the Justice Department of the partisan taint that Gonzales left behind .
Whatever ultimately comes of this disgraceful episode , however , we already know enough to put it in context .
The people who have been running our government for the past eight years have nothing but contempt for government .
They believe only in politics and ideology , in that order .
First , win elections by any means necessary .
Second , once in a position to act in the public good , govern with the ideological conviction that government is either irrelevant or harmful to the public interest .
You can draw a straight line between firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons and turning a blind eye to the ruinous excesses of Wall Street .
What 's impartial justice against the possibility of gaining political advantage ?
Why shackle the hallowed free market with government oversight ?
And , if you want to draw the line a little farther , who cares if the prospective vice president appears to know nothing about anything ?

In the event that you are sufficiently lucky to have a solid pool introduced in your patio , you have the ideal area for a midsummer party , regardless of whether it is toward the evening or the night .
Numerous individuals relate pool parties with young people or little kids , yet they can be the same amount of good times for adults also , if pulled off effectively , making it an advanced as opposed to adolescent issue .
Solid pools come in different shapes and sizes , and they can be set anyplace in your home , regardless of whether it is your lawn , or you have an indoor establishment , a pool includes a touch of tastefulness and fun which gives diversion to you and your whole family .
To set up an effective adult pool party , you would need to find a way to guarantee that it is each piece the marvelous and tasteful experience that you envisioned and that it does n’t resemble a young person ’s party .
Adorn !
An adult ’s party does not require streamers or inflatables to look merry .
You would simply need to make a couple of changes in accordance with ensure that you are arranged , for example , cutting the grass , trimming the supports and holding garden development in line so your yard would look perfect and clean .
You can include some happy tropical blossoms that supplement the shading plan of your garden , and include designs that look tropical , as cut coconut bowls and scattered ocean shells .
Do guarantee that there are a lot of spots for your visitors to sit , toss in some bean packs or garden seats on the off chance that you are missing different sorts of seats .
You can set up a couple of tiki burns in the zone to give an intriguing vibe to your party , set up with fake palms to give a really tropical feel .
Exercises !
Arranging out exercises for adults is dependably a troublesome assignment .
While kids are content with playing Marco Polo , you would require something extraordinary to engage adults .
Plan out unstructured exercises , which give your visitors a lot of time to mingle and have a fabulous time .
In the event that you have a whirlpool in addition to your solid pool , that would furnish your visitors with adequate stimulation .
You can likewise sort out fun , inane challenges , for example , failed attempt at diving ideas as fun types of amusement .
Music !
Music is basic , as without it any party is pronounced dead .
The secret to prevent the music from turning into the point of convergence of consideration is to keep it light and out of sight with the goal that discussion is supported .
You can pre-make a playlist , or surrender it over to one of your musically slanted companions to play DJ .
You can likewise simply tune into a radio channel that you know everyone appreciates .
Liquor and Safety !
Albeit solid pools are more secure than over the ground pools , regardless you have to guarantee the wellbeing of your visitors particularly if there is liquor included .
Keep a drink check , and individuals who have expended more liquor than exhorted ought to be avoided the pool .
Correspondingly , glass jugs and sharp things ought to be avoided the pool or some individual slips and cuts themselves .
All that is extremely required now is a portion of the swimming pool accomplices to make the photo finish .
At the point when an excursion heaven is appeared in movement blurbs what is normally delineated is a showering delight propped up on a lavish pool lounger seat with an umbrella drink in one hand , floating calmly over the highest point of a Caribbean blue swimming pool .
All that a lawn swimming pool is missing is the pool lounger seat .
It is positively justified regardless of the speculation to equip the pool with extremely quality pool lounger seats and some superb pool floats and pontoons for the children .
The swimming pool is a place for the entire family to get together and appreciate some great quality time playing together .
The adult pool floats simply add to the pleasure .
The assortment of adult pool floats and lounger seats is a lot unique in relation to years back .
The present pool lounger seats are completely movable for sitting , leaning back or extending totally .
They are the Lazyboy of the swimming pool .
They additionally arrive in an extraordinary choice of hues with the goal that each individual from the family unit can pick their own one of a kind .
The adult pool floats of today are additionally ready to overlay up and store away for the months that they are not being used .
Never again is it important to invest hours drawing air into the pool pontoons just to get them to a usable condition .
Basically unfurl them when it ’s opportunity and they are right away prepared for utilize .
Additionally furnished with strong steel outlines they are steady and solid .
They are made to keep going quite a while .
For kids there are delicate collapsing seats that are made with a similar steel outline as the bigger leaning back pool lounger seats .
These will give moment soundness to those that may have a little trouble getting on and off them .
Most pool floats and seats come outfitted with container holders for some unwinding time floating along the highest point of the pool with a reviving drink appropriate by the side .
Here ’s a really cool pool party .. in Ibiza where else right ?

A number of physical therapy programs have begun using the Nintendo Wii gaming system as part of treatments to help people recover from strokes and other central nervous system injuries .
One institution using the game system is the Dodd Hall Rehabilitation Hospital , a part of the Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus .
The idea there came from Robbie Winget , who saw a news report about the console 's use in a rehabilitation hospital in Canada .
" I thought it was cool that you used your body to control the movement , " Winget said .
Unlike traditional game consoles , which are controlled by levers and buttons on hand - held devices , the Wii is controlled by a remote that is able to sense its position relative to a sensor .
This allows the console to be controlled with three - dimensional movement and large - body gestures .
Dodd Hall purchased a Wii , and now patients who are recovering from strokes , spinal injuries or brain trauma use the Wii approximately 30 minutes a day , two to three days a week .
This comprises only a part of the required three hours of therapy per day for each patient at Dodd Hall .
Winget says that the Wii helps physical therapy patients improve their balance , coordination , upper and lower body strength , and general stamina .
Patients use the Wii not just to play games , but also to look up news or other information through an Internet connection .
This latter activity helps patients maintain and improve their mental functioning .
Franklin Perry , a 51 - year - old stroke patient , uses the Wii to play bowling or boxing games that require full - body movement .
He uses the Wii to build coordination and strength in his right side , which was immobilized by his stroke .
" I 'm just now getting some movement back , " he said .
According to Winget , the Wii cannot replace conventional physical therapy entirely .
" It 's one more way to meet specific goals associated with therapy , " he said .
I am all in favor of further work at the intersection of sociology and emerging work in biology , cognitive science and neuroscience .
There is surely much to be learned .
But , let ’s face it , this seems needlessly limiting .
Particle physics has been in the doldrums a bit lately , so they could do with some interdisciplinary reinvigoration .
Also , their research budgets remain quite large .
Below we see a picture of the emerging Standard Model of sociophysics , with which you will no doubt be quite familiar .

Teachers in one part of the US state of Texas are to be allowed to carry concealed firearms when the new school term opens this month .
The school superintendent in Harrold district said the move was intended to protect staff and pupils should there be any gun attacks on its sole campus .
Teachers would have to undertake crisis management training first , the superintendent , David Thweatt , said .
In recent years the US has seen a number of fatal school shootings .
Trustees had approved the policy and parents had not objected , Mr Thweatt said .
" When the federal government started making schools gun- free zones , that 's when all of these shootings started , " he wrote on the Fort Worth Star - Telegram 's web site .
Mr Thweatt said he believed the school 's proximity to a large , busy motorway could make it a target .
" If something were to happen here , I 'd much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is OK because we were able to protect them , " Mr Thweatt said .
Texas outlaws the presence of firearms at schools unless individual institutions allow them .

I do n't know about you , but I 'm a little worried that McCain might stroke out before November .
He 's definitely having a much harder time keeping his infamous temper in check .
In fact , yesterday at his appearance in Columbus , Ohio , McCain completely snubbed a Wall Street Journal reporter ( watch Lindsey Graham 's face as he does it -- hilarious ! ) .
Today , in Denver , you could sense McCain 's rage was just bubbling under the surface .
( The Colorado Independent liveblogged the event ) I get the distinct impression that he 's no longer got his heart in it .
It must irk him that Obama drew more than 200K yesterday and according to the press , only 500 showed up to see him in Denver - - the smattering of applause sounds more like 50 -- and even with those diehards , there was dead silence during much of his attacks on Obama .
Like every speech of McCain 's lately , his confusing verb tenses claim that we have won and will win , have succeeded and will succeed and yet he 's still able to predict " defeat " from Barack Obama 's position , despite all this winning and success .
It 's a stunning psychic ability for McSame as he then says that the troops will come home during " the next president 's first term . "
Is n't that what Obama promised as well ?
McSame actually told Wolf Blitzer that he thought Obama 's 16 months was a pretty good timetable .
Confused yet ?
As Logan points out , McCain says that when he brings the troops home , they 're staying home .
What does he plan on doing in Afghanistan ?
Those permanent bases in Iraq ?
Is this yet another flip - flop ?
Even Joe Klein , who has always taken his status as a Beltway Bubble Villager so seriously , is finding McCain unhinged :
This is the ninth presidential campaign I 've covered .
I can't remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate .
It smacks of desperation .
It renews questions about whether McCain has the right temperament for the presidency .
How sad .[..]
The reality is that neither Barack Obama nor Nouri al - Maliki nor most anybody else believes that the Iraq war can be " lost " at this point .
The reality is that no matter who is elected President , we are looking at a residual U.S. force of 30 - 50,000 by 2011 ( a year ahead of the previous schedule ) .
The reality is that McCain should be proud that he helped salvage a disastrous situation by pushing the counterinsurgency plan .
It 's something to run on .
But , at this point , McCain must sense that it 's not a winning hand .
Obama , the poker player , has drawn to an inside straight : the Iraqis favor his plan over McCain 's long - term bases .
That must be galling .
But it 's no excuse to pop off the way McCain did .
It was , shockingly , unpresidential .
I went to Iraq many times , and heard all the phony explanations about how we were winning .
I knew we were failing .
And I told that to an administration that did n't want to hear it .
Violence in Iraq fell to such low levels for such a long time that Sen .
Obama , detecting the success that he never believed possible , falsely claimed that he 'd always predicted it .
There have been almost no sectarian killings in Baghdad for more than 13 weeks .
American casualties are at the lowest levels recorded in this war .
The Iraqi Army is stronger and fighting harder .
The Iraqi government has met most of the benchmarks for political progress we demanded of them .
And the nation 's largest Sunni party recently rejoined the government .
In Iraq , we are no longer on the doorstep of defeat but on the road to victory .
Sen .
Obama said just this week that even knowing what he knows today that he would still - still would have opposed the surge .
In retrospect , given the opportunity to choose between failure and success , he chose failure .
I cannot conceive a Commander - in - Chief making that choice .
My friends , a new hope is rising in Iraq today .
Across the country , Iraqis are preparing for upcoming provincial elections and security has improved enough to permit the Iraqi government to begin seriously providing services and opportunities to the Iraqi people .
This progress is encouraging but it is reversible .
If we heed those who have always counseled defeat , when they now argue to risk our fragile gains and withdraw from Iraq , according to a politically expedient timetable , rather than the advice from the commanders who so brilliantly led this stunning turnaround in our situation in Iraq .
I said the surge has succeeded and it has .
That 's why the additional surge brigades are almost all home .
I said we can win , and we will .
I 'm confident we will be able to reduce our forces in Iraq next year and our forces will be out of regular combat operations and dramatically reduced in number during the term of the next President of the United States .
I do n't know .... I think you know who I 'm referring to .
We fought the worst battles , survived the toughest threats and the hardest part of this war is behind us .
But it 's not over yet .
And we 've come too far , we 've sacrificed too much , to risk everything we 've gained and all we could yet gain because the politics of the hour make defeat the more convenient position .
Because of the choice we made and all the surge has accomplished , the time will soon come , when our troops can come home .
But we face another choice today : we can withdraw when we have secured the peace and the gains we have sacrificed so much to achieve or save or we can follow Sen .
Obama 's unconditional withdrawal and risk losing the peace , even if that results in spreading violence and a third Iraqi war .
Sen .
Obama has suggested he would consider sending troops back if that happened .
When I bring them home in victory and with honor , they are staying home .
Syrian President Bashad Assad 's top aide and advisor was assassinated over the weekend .
Damascus tried to prevent publication of the news .
Syrian President Bashar Assad 's top aide and adviser , General Mohammed Suleiman , was assassinated on Friday , according to Arab news sources .
Suleiman , who was also Syria 's liaison officer to the Hizbullah terrorist organization in Lebanon , was shot and killed by an unidentified sniper in the Syrian port city of Tartous .
Syrian authorities tried unsuccessfully to prevent publication of the news .
The country 's Albawaba newspaper , which reported the incident , speculated that Israel might have been behind the killing .
Both Albawaba and the London - based Al - Hayat newspaper raised the issue of last February 's assassination of Hizbullah second - in - command Imad Mughniyeh , who died in a car bombing in Damascus .
Syria blamed Israel for the killing , but Jerusalem denied any involvement .

A multinational group of investigators has discovered that people suffering from schizophrenia are far more likely to carry rare chromosomal structural changes of all types , particularly those that have the potential to alter gene function .
In addition , the study uncovered two new specific genomic areas that , when altered , significantly increase the risk of developing the disease .
The report from the International Schizophrenia Consortium , the largest and most complete such study to date , is being published online today by the journal Nature .
Schizophrenia is a common , chronic and often devastating brain disorder characterized by delusions and hallucinations .
It affects approximately 1 person in 100 at some point in their lives and usually strikes in late adolescence or early adulthood .
Despite the availability of effective treatments , the course of the illness is usually chronic , and response often limited , leading to prolonged disability and personal suffering .
Family history , which signifies genetic inheritance , is the strongest risk factor for schizophrenia , but until now little has been known about the specific genes or chromosome regions involved .
" This surprising excess of many types of chromosomal changes in schizophrenia patients provides us with rich clues to follow up in future research , " says Pamela Sklar , MD , PhD , of the Department of Psychiatry and Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , a Senior Associate Member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and corresponding author of the Nature paper .
" This work opens up an entirely new way to think about schizophrenia and eventually will suggest new avenues for researching effective therapies for the sake of patients and families suffering from this terrible disorder . "
Formed in 2006 , the International Schizophrenia Consortium is led by senior researchers from 11 institutes in Europe and the USA ( see complete list below ) .
The research team was coordinated by Sklar , who is also Director of Genetics at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute , which provided the major funding and research resources for the current work .
Equally crucial to the success of the project was the willingness of consortium groups to pool DNA resources that have taken them years to collect , totaling 3,391 individuals with schizophrenia and 3,181 related individuals without the disorder .
The investigators used new genomic technologies and novel analytical techniques developed at the Broad Institute and at MGH to screen these samples for structural variants in the genome , sites where a portion of a chromosome is missing or duplicated .
This unprecedented scale of cooperation allowed the analysis of enough data to identify schizophrenia - specific genome alterations – including the newly identified sites on chromosomes 1 and 15 and an area on chromosome 22 observed in earlier studies – as well as a subtle general increase in structural genomic variants in schizophrenia patients compared with controls .
A second study also being published in Nature today confirms the association of those three genomic sites with increased risk for developing the disease .
" The Consortium should be recognized for taking the important first step towards unearthing the full underlying genomic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders , " says Edward Scolnick , MD , Director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute .
" Only by doing such a large study could we have uncovered these stunning findings to such a high degree of confidence , thus setting the stage for an even more complete understanding of the full genomic contributions to disease .
This study could only have been done with the open collaboration of many individuals and institutions dedicated to understanding – and treating – this terrifying disease . "
Thomas Insel , MD , director of the National Institute for Mental Health , which partially funded the study , adds , " By implicating two previously unknown sites , this study triples the number of genomic areas definitely linked to schizophrenia .
It also confirms in a large sample that unraveling the secrets of rare structural genetic variation may hold promise for improved diagnosis , treatment and prevention of such neurodevelopmental disorders . "
Lead analyst Shaun Purcell , PhD , of the MGH Department of Psychiatry and Center for Human Genetic Research and an Associate Member of the Broad Institute at the Stanley Center , emphasizes that " the specific way a small overall increase in this kind of genetic variation translates into schizophrenia for a given patient is not yet known , especially given the common occurrence of these structural genomic variations in everyone . "
Professor Michael O'Donovan , FRCPsych , PhD , of Cardiff University in Wales , notes , " The findings are impressive and hugely important leaps towards understanding the origins of schizophrenia .
But since only a small amount of the genetic risk for schizophrenia has been accounted for , they are not ready to be applied to genetic testing , an area that has seen fierce controversy as a number of biotech companies have begun offering genetic tests for psychiatric disorders .

Reports of ' total panic ' as oil price plunges
The oil price was plummeting today , registering its biggest falls in four years and down below $ 90 a barrel — less than a week after it crashed back through $ 100 a barrel .
Plummeting :
The price of oil suffered its worst fall in four years
Trading in the global commodity markets was frantic overnight , with traders in the Far East talking of ' total panic ' .
With the price of oil crashing overnight , Brent Crude opened in London today at as low as $ 89.80 before stepping back marginally to trade at $ 90.24 , a fall of $ 4 from its close last night .
The price of US oil on the Nymex exchange also plummeted , falling $ 3.57 to $ 92.14 .
The latest falls — the crash since the start of this week represents the worst two - day performance for oil since 2004 — means the price of oil has now come back nearly 40 % since the peak of more than $ 147 a barrel in early July .
The plunge in the price of oil comes on the back of fears for the state of the US economy , the world 's largest , which is in a serious downturn and now in the throes of financial crisis .
' Prices were too high because we 're looking at a recession — we 're looking at dropping demand , ' said Peter Beutel of US energy consultants Cameron Hanover .
' Oil is not a safe haven . '
The fall in the price of oil is being seen as more remarkable as it comes against a backdrop of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico , the main US producing area , and indications from the Opec cartel of major oil producers that it will slow output to force the price up .
The oil price had surged through last year to this summer on soaring demand in Asia and especially China in the run up to the Olympic Games .
Industry figures , however , are now suggesting demand falling over the next year on the back of recession among major Western economies and falling demand from China .
Many believe the oil price had also been talked up by speculators and the current slump in price followed their exit from the market .
Pass223.com
I recently worked on Pass223.com , a simple site that urges the Senate to pass a piece of legislation that requires the Senate to adhere to the same electronic financial disclosure rules in place for representatives and presidential candidates .
Pass223.com is similar to that of hundreds of related action sites : choose a legislator , call them , report results , repeat .
I wrote the code , our esteemed creative director Kerry did the bulk of the design , and various others here at Sunlight helped to refine the concept and wording of the site and call script .
It was a bit surprising seeing how positive the feedback has been for such a simple site .
A number of people have been pointing to Pass223 as an example of how this type of thing should be done .
Most of that credit goes to the team that worked together to revise the awesomely straightforward script .
The other question that has come up is what content management system ( CMS ) Pass223 was done on and what legislative database it was built on top of .
This made me think about the other reason Pass223 was able to come together the way that it did , the tools used behind the scene .
When all you have is a hammer …
It seems , especially in the nonprofit world where developers are sparse , that content management systems like Drupal are considered the solution to every problem that arises .
Because Content Management Systems can not possibly do everything that organizations want they are left with two options : attempt to mangle the CMS to do things it was never intended to do , or alternatively not get what they actually want .
Because of the difficulty in dealing with the massive codebases of most CMSs , they often find themselves accepting both results .
A great deal of time is therefore sunk into a project and in the end things still do n’t work quite how they were planned .
The supposed benefit of a CMS is the speed of deployment and ease of use , but as Jeremy ’s recent post about LetOurCongress Tweet mentioned , we are able to rapidly create sites without the use of a CMS .
And in reality , struggling to fit an innovative project or idea into the rigid structure of a CMS is not easy nor fast .
A better use of the time and money spent maintaining and modifying complex CMS installations would be to spend that time learning and deploying sites in a framework such as Django “ ) or Ruby on Rails .
Perfectionists with Deadlines
Django in particular was created to solve this problem .
Working with a bloated CMS forces you to make a decision between getting what you want and getting something fast , and more often than not you wind up with neither .
It is because of this that a team originally working at the Lawrence Journal - World newspaper built Django to meet their needs as “ perfectionists with deadlines . ”
Frameworks like Django provide all of the pieces of commonly used functionality , user registration , Object - Relational mappers to avoid dealing with the database directly , caching , and a ton more .
All of these pieces are given to you without any mandate that they must all be used , they are simply building blocks from which your particular project can choose to use or not .
A large site such as EarmarkWatch may need complex user profiles , whereas it is possible to eschew all of the unneeded modules and build something as quick and simple as Pass223.com .
Ultimately , unless some CMS already provides exactly what you want , it is far easier to build a project from reusable components within a framework than to attempting to teach an old CMS a new trick .
One of the reasons that Pass223.com seems to impress people used to looking at the typical contact - your - legislator forms is because we had the flexibility to build what we wanted .

A long time ago , I asked about systems for form validation that are n’t “ model - based ” .
By “ model - based validation ” , I mean that the rules for whether a certain sort of input is acceptable are declared in ( or attached to ) a domain model that the form is operating on .
This is the way that ActiveRecord ( Rails ) and Magritte ( Seaside ) work .
I do n’t like the whole approach , for reasons I discussed in my earlier post .
It breaks down when you want to edit an object in stages , and you end up managing lots of UI - related things down in the model code .
But forms are boring and validation can be tedious , which is why frameworks like these have been built in the first place .
What I really wanted was a set of simple helpers that made this work easier — a “ less is more ” approach to the problem .
That did n’t exist ( at least in Seaside ) , so I built my own .
It ’s called “ Mold ” , and it ’s available both on SqueakSource and in the Cincom Public Repository .
The name is a play on words : it ’s a synonym for “ form ” , but it makes most normal people think of green fuzzy fungae .
Design Principles
In building Mold , I had several specific goals :
No new components .
I did n’t want to have to remember to add anything to #children just because I was using this framework .
Keep track of what the user types , even if it ’s not valid , to allow for easy correction of mistakes .
“ r56 ” might not parse to a valid integer , but it ’s better to let the user delete the “ r ” than force it to “ 0 ” and complain at him .
Emit real objects , not just strings .
If I ’m asking the user to enter a date or a time , I want a Date or Time object when all is said and done .
Use block - based validation criteria to keep things flexible .
Error messages should allow blocks to be used too , so that your can put dynamic behavior in there too .
Correlate errors closely to the problematic fields .
It ’s more helpful to show an error message right next to the field than to show it at the top of the page .
Strip leading and trailing whitespace , and convert empty strings to nil .
Semantically , an empty string almost always means “ nothing ” and is rarely worth keeping around .
Callback or dictionary - like access to valid data .
Sometimes you want to grab bits of data out of the form by name , but most of the time it ’s nice to have the form dump valid results right into your model in one step .
Do n’t require all - or - nothing use .
I might want to use the helpers to build part of the form , but handle other parts myself .
It should be possible to completely customize the look of each form without sacrificing the benefits of the framework .
The Basics
To use a mold , you typically instantiate and hold a Mold in an instance variable of your component .
For a simple form with no underlying model , you might build the mold when the component is initialized .
initialize super initialize .
self buildMold
For editors with a model under the hood , it makes sense to build the mold when the model is passed in :
account : anAccount account := anAccount . self buildMold
The mold itself has a canvas - like API for declaring a form ’s inputs and validation conditions .
buildMold mold := Mold new . ( mold string Field ) label : ' Username : ' ; on : #username of : account ; beRequired .
( mold password Field ) label : ' Password : ' ; on : # password of : account ; beRequired .
In this simple form , we only ask for 2 things , and we hook them directly to accessor methods on the model using #on : of : .
This works just like it does in a regular Seaside form , and behind the scenes it simply creates a callback block .
You can also create a custom callback block yourself .
When it comes time to render your form , you have to hand the `html` canvas to the mold , and then it gives you lots of handy shortcuts .
Basic use will look something like this :
renderContentOn : html html form : [ mold canvas : html . mold paragraphs .
( html submitButton ) callback : [ self save ] ; value : ' Save ' ]
This usage tells the mold to render those fields as HTML paragraphs , like so :
The labels are real HTML < label > tags , and each group is a single paragraph ( < p > < label for= ” … ” > Username :</ label >< br />< input … /></p>)
We could have also used #tableRows :
renderContentOn : html html form : [ mold canvas : html .
html table : [ mold tableRows .
html tableRow : [ html tableData ; tableData : [ ( html submitButton ) callback : [ self save ] ; value : ' Save ' ] ] ] ]
It ’s more work to build the framework around the table , but the end result looks like this :
These are the only two “ canned ” looks for an entire mold , but it ’s also possible to take the reins yourself and ask Mold to render single components for a completely custom look .
More on that below .
The final step in using this mold is hooking up the #save callback .
Let ’s assume you ’re using the super cool SandstoneDb framework to save your models :
save mold is Valid if False : [ ^self ] .
account save : [ mold save ] .
self answer
That ’s all there is to it .
The mold can tell you whether its inputs were valid , and if not , it will display error messages on subsequent renders .
If it is valid , telling it to save will fire all of its callbacks , thereby applying the changes to the underlying model .
The way I use Glorp , the save method looks nearly identical , but you have to register your model object in a unit of work .
Using the mold ’s save actions to apply your changes inside the unit of work keeps Glorp ’s deep dark change - tracking voodoo working .
save mold is Valid if False : [ ^self ] .
self database inUnitOfWorkDo : [ : db | db register : account .
mold save ] .

Let ’s look at what interactions with the mold look like .
We declared that both fields should be required , so if you do n’t type anything ( and just click “ save ” ) you ’ll see error messages by each field :
This form is a little bland , and it ’s spacing is awkward because Mold uses unordered lists inside those table cells .
Let ’s apply some simple CSS :
style ^' label .
required { font - weight : bold ; } label .
required : after { content : " * " ; color : red ; } .error { background - color : #ecc ; } .errors { color : red ; margin : 0 ; } '
That looks better — we call attention to the required fields , error messages are shown in red , and fields with errors have a reddish background too .
Let ’s make the username field a little wider .
We ’ll do this by adding a #customize : block in the mold declaration :
buildMold mold := Mold new . ( mold string Field ) label : ' Username : ' ; on : #username of : account ; customize : [ : tag | tag size : 40 ] ; beRequired .
( mold password Field ) label : ' Password : ' ; on : # password of : account ; beRequired .
Now the next time we build one of these components ( remember , we built the mold when the component was initialized , so it wo n’t automatically be rebuilt just from a browser refresh ) , our form will look like this :
More Conditions and Inter - Relationships
Let ’s modify the field a little further .
If we require usernames have to be at least 3 characters long and passwords to have a digit in them , we need some more conditions on these fields .
We should also make the user type the password twice to guard against typos .
buildMold | passwordField confirmPasswordField | mold := Mold new . ( mold string Field ) label : ' Username : ' ; on : #username of : account ; customize : [ : tag | tag size : 40 ] ; beRequired ; addCondition : [ : input | input size >= 3 ] labeled : ' Usernames must be at least 3 characters long ' .
( password Field := mold password Field ) label : ' Password : ' ; on : # password of : account ; beRequired ; addCondition : [ : input | input matches Regex : '.*\d.*'] labeled : ' Please make sure your password has at least one number in it '.
( confirmPassword Field := mold password Field ) label : ' Confirm Password : ' ; beRequired .
passwordField addCondition : [ : input | input = confirmPasswordField input ] labeled : ' Passwords did not match ' .
confirmPasswordField addCondition : [ : input | input = password Field input ] labeled : ' Passwords did not match ' .
There ’s a bit more going on here , but it ’s all pretty straightforward to use .
A few things to note :
We ’ve added conditions on required fields , so these wo n’t be evaluated unless some input is actually given .
If these fields were optional , we ’d have to check `input` to make sure it was n’t nil before asking it for its size .
The fields can refer to each other , even out of order .
We did n’t technically have to put conditions on both fields , but it makes the error messages look nicer if we do .
There is no callback on the confirmation field .
It simply exists for use by the main password field .
When referring to the other fields , we asked them for their #input .
This is the string the user typed ( having been trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace and converted to nil if it was empty ) .
We could have also asked for its #value , but the value is only valid when the field is valid ( incidentally , fields also understand # isValid ) .
The resulting form looks like this :
One “ Gotcha ” Under the hood , the out - of - order field processing is done with a hidden input with a low - priority callback .
This is hooked up when the mold ’s canvas is set ( mold canvas : html ) .
The callback does n’t fire until all of the other input ’s callbacks are processed , but it fires before the action callback from the button .
That means that you must set the mold ’s canvas inside the form : [ ] block .
Failure to do so will mean that your validations never get run , and the mold will always answer `true` when sent #isValid .
There might be a cleaner way to do this , but I have n’t found it yet .
Advanced Moldiness
Mold fields can also be given a symbol for a key , which lets you refer to them directly .
This makes custom rendering possible , with messages like : mold paragraph : # confirmPassword .
mold widget : #username mold errors : # someOtherField
When you use #on : of : to hook up a callback , the key for the widget is automatically assigned to the selector you passed as the first argument .
You can also set the key directly using #key : , and a subsequent send of #on : of : will not clobber it .
Error messages can also be blocks , which means that you can put the user ’s input into the error message : ( mold string Field ) key : #username ; addCondition : [ : input | ( Account find : [ : each | each username = input ] ) notNil ] labeled : [ : input | ' The username " ' , input , ' " is already taken ' ] .
There ’s also no reason why you ca n’t add two or more molds to a component — say , one for basic settings and one for advanced settings that are n’t shown unless the user clicks “ more choices ” .
Adding fields is a matter of adding a new protocol on Mold and optionally a new Field subclass .
I say “ optionally ” because some fields can be built as specialized versions of existing fields , like a string field with a default validation rule .
The emailField is currently implemented this way .
In Summary
I know not everyone believes that model - based validation is a problem .
But if all you ’re looking for is a simple way to build a custom form , you might find Mold helpful .
We ’ve been using it internally for nearly a year , so I figured it was time to touch it up and share it .
Mold makes no requirements of your components or your model objects .
It does n’t use any metadata ; it allows you to choose how you want each form rendered ; and it does n’t require you to use it to build the entire form .
It ’s just a helper , and it gets out of your way when you do n’t need it .
Just do n’t leave it alone in a cool dark place for too long , or it might start to grow on you . :)
United States Abandoning Capitalism for Socialism
Over the past few decades , the United States has steadily evolved from a nation of ‘ producers ' to one of ‘ consumers ' .
The change has been celebrated by politicians and economists as proof of America 's arrival at the top of the global economic food chain .
In reality , the development has depleted the nation of its hard - earned wealth , and has led us to the brink of ruin .
But rather than encouraging a return of America 's productive energy , our government is responding to the growing economic crisis by simply trying to boost consumerism at all costs .
Their strategy involves socializing losses among all citizens so that the depletion can't be easily discerned .
Now that the nation has chosen socialism as its economic salvation , it is worthwhile to examine some historic precedents .
They are not encouraging .
Europe , the former Soviet block and much of Africa and Asia , show vividly that socialism curbs individual freedom and enterprise , and leads inevitably toward economic decline .
America was blessed both with abundant natural resources and individual freedom , the backbone of enterprise .
The combination rendered American productivity the envy of the world .
Based on the strength of our industry and productivity , the American Treasury became the world 's largest .
Why would America swap a history of successful capitalism for a murky future of socialism ?
The Answer is politics .
When the vast majority of the country 's private sector working population is employed in the service sector , then votes tip in favor of consumerism .
This is happening in America .
Consumer spending now accounts for 72 percent of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , and is viewed as the engine of our continued prosperity .
Over the past decade , when recession threatened to curtail spending , the government pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy .
This led to two massive liquidity - driven booms ; first in technology , then in housing .
During these booms , greed knew few bounds and leverage became a way of life .
But when the merry - go - round stalled , politicians did not , and will not , allow the normally corrective mechanism of a recession to operate .
It is trying to take the pain out of capitalism , while leaving only the pleasure .
This is impossible .
In the current attempt at a market correction , the government has decided that our bloated financial companies are “ too big to fail ” .
As a result , the government has lent billions of taxpayers ' dollars to bail out Wall Street and the mortgage industry .
Some investment banks were given privileged access to the ‘ Fed Window ' to borrow unlimited amounts of money , secured by ‘ junk ' securities and at the lowest ( negative ) interest rates , well below the level of inflation .
In addition , the shares of the larger financial companies were also given special ‘ short - selling ' trading protections .
It is important to note that these protections were not given to other industries , and were not even extended to the entire financial industry .
Those receiving the public largesse are precisely the large institutions most responsible for the mess .
It was the financial and corporate fat cats who made the private profits gleaned from massive , irresponsible lending and borrowing .
Yet , when it comes to rescue , the ordinary citizen pays .
Declining corporate earnings , increased government intervention and higher taxes are tell - tale symptoms of socialism .
They can now be expected in America , bringing downward pressure on U.S. government paper and equities .
Recession in America will likely reverberate around the world , bringing worldwide strain to economies and equities .
Let us hope that the rest of the world will not follow America 's example and head down the road toward socialism .
Economies adopting a free market approach are likely to far outperform those embracing the discarded doctrines of financial failure .

Dear Author ;
This is not socialism this is monopolistic capitalism , your free enterprise capitalism had been died so long ago .
Please read paul sweezy
Tom
11 Feb 09 , 14:02 Agree , sort of
It is monopolistic capitalism ...
But you DO realize , monopolistic capitalism , where the monopoly is the government itself ... IS socialism .
Communism is capitalism , where the government is the only business .
But nothing works ... socialism or capitalism , no one can predict in this consumer society , what will or wont sell and why .
You can guess at the weather , but you can never truely predict something that complex .

Um WRONG !
Switzerland , Norway , France , Denmark , etc are all countries BOUNDING with economic prosperity and high standards of living .
If you use bad examples of COMMUNISM ( WTF ? ) and socialism to represent all socialists institutions of course they will look ugly .
The soviets were not socialists they were COMMUNISTS !

We have to STOP SOCIALISM \COMMUNISM now , before it is too late .
It has gone too far already and people have no clue what the country is in for .
They just think Obama is black and he is cool .
They have no idea what it is to live in a socialist communist society where the gov tells you what to do , say , eat , think , and talk about .
Just like Obama does not want people to disagree with him .
His staff & media labels people racist , angry mobs , and worse when they disagree .
THIS IS SO WRONG and everyone is just going along with it .
When they start rationing your food and taking away your homes and big cars then you will protest and it will be too late .

19 Oct 09 , 22:03 Democratic Party - Democratic Reform Party
As Democrats of the Democratic Party , we join together in seeking reform within the Democratic Party .
Many Democrats already know their elected representatives within the Democratic Party are no longer following in the time - honored footsteps laid down by the founding fathers of our great Nation .
More importantly , we as democrats see our elected representatives within the Democratic Party abandoning the values and principles as set forth within the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States .
At the very least , many of our elected representatives within the Democratic Party are no longer abiding to the sole reason the Democratic - Republican Party was founded by Thomas Jefferson - " Strong state governments with a weaker federal government . "
This is only the beginning of our problems as Democrats , for many of our elected representatives within the Democratic Party have clearly set their own agendas over the members of the Democratic Party , our Nation , and the American people .
Overall , many of them no longer think of themselves as being our elected representatives , and now refer to themselves as leaders in the true form of tyrants .
Most Democrats already know their pleas are only being answered by repeated insult and injury by their elected representatives within the Democratic Party .
Despite this , we as Democrats can restore control of the Democratic Party back to the party members .
All we need to do is cut off donations to the local , state , and national headquarters of the Democratic Party , and to make sure the donations are made directly to worthy and honorable Democratic Party candidates .
So spread the message to everyone of our fellow Democrats , for the Democrat members are taking back control of the Democratic Party .
Also , please do n't forget to contact and request the Unions and other outside contributors to follow our lead as patriotic Americans .
Thank you !

Official data are starting to reveal what close observers have suspected for some time .
Layoffs are increasing .
Unemployment is on the rise .
It now stands at a four - year high of 5.7 percent , which is not high by historical standards , but it stings when you consider that the rate dipped below 4 percent in the late 1990s .
What worries people is the trend line .
This is the seventh straight month of reported job declines .
Job instability is the number one factor that leads to public panic .
It is more pressing than stock - price declines , general price increases , and a host of other bad trends , because it hits people in the most direct way by threatening to end the flow of money that puts bread on the table .
Do n't blame the employers .
They are faced with making cutbacks wherever possible .
They have to worry about surviving in the downturn .
It is not only labor costs that must be cut .
Cutbacks must occur in every area .
In the past , we 've seen policy intervention designed to do exactly the opposite of what needs to be done .
The most typical is an expansion of unemployment benefits , and both parties have already agreed to this regrettable step .
Such benefits amount to telling a lie to people , that they can continue to hold out for higher wages when the most important step workers can make is to lower their offering prices for labor on the market .
But , you say , it is unrealistic to expect people to devalue their work by lowering their wage expectations .
If so , there is another way to go about the same thing : lower the costs of hiring on the market .
The costs of employment to the employer go way beyond the wages and salaries they pay .
Among them are payroll taxes , of which the employer must absorb half , at least in an accounting sense .
Once you add Social Security with Medicare with unemployment with workmen 's comp , the employer ends up paying about 10 % of labor costs in taxes .
The laborer also pays 6.2 percent .
But these accounting divisions are purely formal .
In an economic sense , the laborer ultimately pays the full tax .
But the point is that there is no choice about this .
If someone is hired , there must be a tax premium built into the cost of hiring this person , and this is before the worker has added any value at all to the work of the enterprise in question .
The payroll tax is a tax on employment because it is a forced price increase in the wage that everyone hopes to gain .
If we eliminated this , we would see the costs of hiring plummet , and the benefit would be experienced directly and immediately by the worker .
The worker would not have to lower wage and salary expectations .
Instead of paying the government , the worker would be able to add that money to his or her own remunerative calculus .
Another tax on employment comes in the form of mandatory provisions of health insurance for firms of a certain size and employment of a certain time .
With the costs of health care having risen beyond belief , this is a serious impediment to hiring .
Employees tend to think of health insurance as a free benefit or even a right , but this is an illusion .
The money paid comes out of the paycheck .
Almost all employees would be better off arranging for their own private medical insurance or taking the risk upon themselves .
The new demand for individual provision would make the market for health insurance more competitive and bring down prices .
It would also increase the incentive of people to take better care of themselves , since the perception of " free " health care creates a moral hazard .
Another great step would be to eliminate the minimum wage .
What this would do is decontrol the prices of labor in general .
It would permit workers the freedom to offer their services at any rate privately negotiated between the employee and the employer .
The minimum wage merely puts a floor on wages that reduces their flexibility on the market .
It acts like any price control : in this case , it creates a surplus of labor services that go unpurchased .
It outlaws some jobs .
There are other costs of hiring that are very high but ultimately incalculable .
Discrimination law has gone from being a relatively clear ( though ultimately wrongheaded ) rule against racial and sexual discrimination to become a legal minefield that just boggles the mind .
Once you consider the entire panoply of restricted " grounds " of discriminating , every single employee becomes a walking lawsuit .
The risks to hiring anyone are huge .
It is no longer possible to imagine hiring full - time employees without feeling as if you are likely to be stuck with these people no matter how they perform and no matter what turn economic conditions take .
On the margin , this makes employers far more risk averse to hiring anyone , especially in risky times .
If regulators , bureaucrats , judges , and juries would back off here , we would see a great increase in employee mobility and new willingness on the part of every firm to take on new employees .
Now , the problem immediately presents itself .
What will the poor government do if it is denied all this revenue ?
What will become of workers ' rights if government ceases to protect victimized workers from nasty employers ?
Well , here is the problem .
The choice right now is not between a high - paying job with lots of benefits and a low - paying job with no benefits .
The choice for many is coming down to having a job or not having one .
As for government revenue to sustain transfer programs , I say tough : let the public sector suffer for a change .
A dramatic initiative to lower the costs of hiring could end up having great effects .
It could wean us from the World War II–era mistake of pushing the costs of health care onto employers .
It could force a desperately needed reform of Medicare and Social Security .
It would shift the locus of control over employment contracts from government to those affected most directly by those contracts : namely , the individual workers and the firms for which they work .
Of course what you read here is roughly the opposite of current policy trends , which are to increase rather than reduce the costs of hiring .
This is how government ends up taking a bad situation and making it worse , which is what it has done consistently throughout history .
This wo n't change until the public makes its demands known to the elites .
The best anti-recession slogan right now would be : Lower Labor Costs Now !
Report : Ohio science teacher burned cross on kids ' arms RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 20 , 2008

An outside investigation has found that an Ohio public school teacher taught creationism in his science class and used a device to burn the image of a cross on students ' arms .
One family filed a federal lawsuit against Mount Vernon Middle School teacher John Freshwater and the school district last week , saying their child was left with a burn mark for three or four weeks .
The report also says Freshwater was insubordinate in failing to remove a Bible and other religious materials from his classroom .
The findings released Thursday by consulting firm H.R. On Call Inc. were to be discussed Friday at a school board meeting .
" Eighth - graders who were taught by John Freshwater frequently had to be re-taught in high school what they were supposed to have learned in Freshwaters class , according to outside investigators hired by the district , " Alayna DeMartini reports for The Columbus Dispatch .
" For 11 years , other teachers in the school district and people in the community complained about Freshwater preaching his Christian beliefs in class and slamming scientific theories , a school administrator told investigators . "
Further excepts from Columbus Dispatch article : #
The report confirms that Freshwater burned crosses onto students  arms , using an electrostatic device , in December .
Freshwater told investigators the marks were Xs , not crosses .
But all of the students interviewed in the investigation reported being branded with crosses .
The investigation report includes a photo of one students arm with a long vertical line and a short horizontal line running through it .
The family of one student who was burned filed a federal lawsuit last week against Freshwater and the district , saying the students civil rights were violated .
Today , the familys attorney , Jessica Philemond , said it was unfortunate that the school district didnt do anything sooner to stop Freshwater .
 These concerns had been going on for at least 11 years and the school had not done anything ,  she said .
A teacher who worked in Freshwaters classroom last year also reported to investigators that Freshwater told his class that homosexuality is a sin .

THE Southdale shopping centre in Minnesota has an atrium , a food court , fountains and acres of parking .
Its shops include a Dairy Queen , a Victoria 's Secret and a purveyor of comic T - shirts .
It may not seem like a landmark , as important to architectural history as the Louvre or New York 's Woolworth Building .
But it is .
“ Ohmigod ! ” chimes a group of teenage girls , on learning that they are standing in the world 's first true shopping mall .
“ That is the coolest thing anybody has said to us all day . ”
In the past half century Southdale and its many imitators have transformed shopping habits , urban economies and teenage speech .
America now has some 1,100 enclosed shopping malls , according to the International Council of Shopping Centres .
Clones have appeared from Chennai to Martinique .
Yet the mall 's story is far from triumphal .
Invented by a European socialist who hated cars and came to deride his own creation , it has a murky future .
While malls continue to multiply outside America , they are gradually dying in the country that pioneered them .
Southdale 's creator arrived in America as a refugee from Nazi- occupied Vienna .
Victor Gruen was a Jewish bohemian who began to design shops for fellow immigrants in New York after failing in cabaret theatre .
His work was admired partly for its uncluttered , modernist look , which seemed revolutionary in 1930s America .
But Gruen 's secret was the way he used arcades and eye - level display cases to lure customers into stores almost against their will .
As a critic complained , his shops were like mousetraps .
A few years later the same would be said of his shopping malls .
By the 1940s department stores were already moving to the suburbs .
Some had begun to build adjacent strips of shops , which they filled with boutiques in an attempt to re-create urban shopping districts .
In 1947 a shopping centre opened in Los Angeles featuring two department stores , a cluster of small shops and a large car park .
It was , in effect , an outdoor shopping mall .
Fine for balmy southern California , perhaps , but not for Minnesota 's harsh climate .
Commissioned to build a shopping centre at Southdale in 1956 , Gruen threw a roof over the structure and installed an air - conditioning system to keep the temperature at 75 °F ( 24°C ) — which a contemporary press release called “ Eternal Spring ” .
The mall was born .
Gruen got an extraordinary number of things right first time .
He built a sloping road around the perimeter of the mall , so that half of the shoppers entered on the ground floor and half on the first floor — something that became a standard feature of malls .
Southdale 's balconies were low , so that shoppers could see the shops on the floor above or below them .
The car park had animal signs to help shoppers remember the way back to their vehicles .
It was as though Orville and Wilbur Wright had not just discovered powered flight but had built a plane with tray tables and a duty - free service .
Oddly , this most suburban American invention was supposed to evoke a European city centre .
Hence Southdale 's density and its atrium , where shoppers were expected to sit and debate over cups of coffee , just as they do in the Piazza San Marco or the Place Dauphine .
Gruen exiled cars , which he thought noisy and anti-social , to the outside of his mall .
Most contemporary critics thought Gruen had succeeded in bringing urbanity to the suburbs .
Southdale was “ more like downtown than downtown itself ” , claimed the Architectural Record .
Another asserted , in a rare example of journalistic hyperbole that turned out to be absolutely right , that the indoor shopping mall was henceforth “ part of the American way ” .
As Jeffrey Hardwick explains in his excellent biography , Gruen did not believe his creation would take business away from downtown shopping districts .
He saw it as an adjunct to them .
If indoor shopping centres harmed any businesses , Gruen dearly hoped it would be the fast - food stands and tacky strip malls that were sprouting like weeds along main roads .
Southdale 's first tenants shared this sanguine view .
When it opened it was filled not with national chains but with second branches of downtown merchants .
By the 1970s malls were proliferating .
Gruen toured America promoting his invention .
Malls began to open in Europe too — where , Gruen was presumably surprised to learn , they were seen as quintessentially American .
At home , two developments speeded their growth .
The first was a change in the tax code which allowed investors to write down a large proportion of a new building 's cost as a loss .
That made malls much more profitable .
The second was a widespread property - tax revolt that deprived local governments of their most reliable source of income .
Desperate , they tried to lure businesses that they could milk for taxes .
They were particularly keen on shopping malls .
Tribes of the mall
By the early 1980s indoor shopping centres were woven tightly into American culture .
New cuisines ( the term is perhaps too grand ) emerged in them , thanks to chains like Cinnabon and Panda Express , which did not exist outside malls .
They began to swell to the point of absurdity .
Canada 's West Edmonton Mall , which opened in 1982 , has an ice - skating rink , a pool with sea-lions and an indoor bungee jump .
The Mall of America , in Minnesota , has three rollercoasters and more than 500 shops arranged in “ streets ” designed to appeal to different age groups .
Every morning it opens early to accommodate a group of “ mall walkers ” who trudge around its 0.57 - mile perimeter for exercise .
Artists and urban anthropologists began to note the appearance of mall - based tribes .
Most celebrated — and lampooned — were the Valley girls who congregated in California 's Glendale Galleria .
Frank Zappa 's then - teenage daughter , Moon Unit , wrote a hit song that captured their argot ( “ ohmigod ! ” , “ no biggie ” , “ grody to the max ” , “ total space cadet ” ) and praised the Galleria for having “ like , all these , like , really great shoe stores ” .
Mall - oriented films followed , spreading the Valley girls ' culture like spores in the wind .
Just as the onward march of malls began to seem unstoppable , though , things began to go wrong .
In just a few years they turned from temples of consumption to receptacles for social problems .
The changing attitude to shopping malls can be seen in two films , both of which , appropriately , are to cinema what Panda Express is to the Chinese culinary tradition .
George Romero's “ Dawn of the Dead ” , released in 1978 , is ostensibly a story about a group of people struggling to survive in a world taken over by flesh - eating zombies .
But it is also a commentary on the lurid appeal of shopping malls , which were then multiplying quickly .
That becomes clear a third of the way through the film , when the humans must decide where to take refuge .
They rule out the cities , which are thick with monsters .
Yet they need food , water and fuel , which are hard to find in the wilderness .
They decide to head for a suburban shopping mall .

Southdale in its gleaming heyday
There are a few zombies at the mall when the refugees arrive , staggering about aimlessly in a fashion familiar to Christmas shoppers .
As one character explains , the monsters seem to have been drawn there by instinct : the mall was clearly an important place in their lives .
Most of the humans are similarly intoxicated by the variety of goods on display .
That worries the film 's heroine , Fran .
“ I 'm afraid , ” she says .
“ You 're hypnotised by this place , all of you .
It 's all so bright and neatly wrapped that you do n't see that it can be a prison . ”
Nonsense , replies her boyfriend : “ We got everything we need right here ! ”
The rest of the film bears out the horror - movie dictum that nervous young women are always right .
In 1995 a much gloomier vision of the shopping mall appeared .
If “ Dawn of the Dead ” suggested malls were monstrously appealing , Kevin Smith's “ Mallrats ” depicted them simply as magnets for dysfunctional youth .
The film chronicles the mundane adventures of four young men who come to a New Jersey mall to hang out , complain about their girlfriends and annoy security guards .
The shopkeepers loathe them because , as the manager of Fashionable Male , a clothes shop , puts it , they lack a “ shopping agenda ” .
Indeed , they lack much of an agenda at all .
In Mr Smith 's mall everybody is a kind of zombie .
As the film 's tagline explained : “ They 're not there to work .
They 're not there to shop .
They 're just there . ”
So many shopping malls have died or are dying that a new hobby has appeared : amateur shopping - mall history
By the 1990s malls were in trouble .
Having bred too quickly , they began to cannibalise each other .
( Turn left out of Southdale 's car park and the first building you pass is another shopping mall . )
Discount shops , factory - outlet stores and category killers like Toys “ R ” Us ate into their profits .
As middle - aged shoppers began to disappear , the teenagers who had inhabited malls from the beginning became more noticeable , which only made things worse .
In 1998 Good Housekeeping ran a story entitled “ Danger at the Mall ” .
Indoor shopping malls are now so out of favour that not one will be built in America before 2009 at the earliest , according to the International Council of Shopping Centres .
One reason for the malls ' problems is that the suburbs have changed .
When the Southdale shopping centre opened on the outskirts of Minneapolis , the suburbs were almost entirely white and middle - class .
Whites were fleeing a wave of new arrivals from the South ( the black population of Minneapolis rose by 155 % between 1940 and 1960 ) .
Although Gruen could not bear to admit it , his invention appealed to those who wanted downtown 's shops without its purported dangers .
These days , in Minneapolis as in much of America , the ethnic drift is in the opposite direction .
The suburbs are becoming much more racially mixed while the cities fill up with hip , affluent whites .
As a result , suburban malls no longer provide a refuge from diversity .
So many malls have died or are dying that a new hobby has appeared : amateur shopping - mall history .
Like many esoteric pursuits , this has been facilitated by the internet .
Websites such as Deadmalls.com and Labelscar.com collect pictures of weedy car parks and empty food courts and try to explain how once - thriving shopping centres began to spiral downward .
Some of the recollections are faintly ironic or gloating .
Yet the strongest note is anguish .
Implausibly , these online histories reveal the deep emotional connections that people can establish with malls .
One of the most touching is a website devoted to Lakehurst mall near Chicago , which was demolished in 2004 .
Prodded by a local journalist , women and a few men write in with memories of back - to - school shopping trips , ear piercings , first jobs at Cinnabon and Orange Julius , early dates and even marriage proposals .
Many are bereft at the mall 's demolition , as though suffering the death of a pet .
“ You do n't realise how much you miss something until it is gone , ” writes one .
Others are almost apologetic : “ If only we knew what we had , we would never have strayed to other malls . ”
As shopping malls decline , they sometimes come to resemble the civic centres that Gruen intended them to be .
Attracted by cheap rents , community groups and police stations move in .
On a trip to one of Gruen 's creations , the now - desolate Carousel Mall in San Bernardino , your correspondent encountered a group of middle - aged Mexicans studying for the American citizenship test .
Not all malls have suffered from competition and the suburbs ' transformation .
Some have prospered by appealing to growing ethnic - minority groups .
American malls are courting middle - class Latinos by adding butchers ' shops and , in some cases , by decking themselves out to resemble Mexican villages .
La Gran Plaza , in the Texas town of Fort Worth , lays on mariachi and reggaeton acts and is building a rodeo .
Other malls changed their clientele without adjusting their look .
Brent Cross shopping centre , one of Britain 's earliest malls , now contains shops staffed by second - and third - generation Asians selling to new arrivals from eastern Europe .
The mall goes downtown
Yet without white , middle - aged women few British or American shopping centres could survive .
One bold attempt to lure them back can be seen at the corner of Third Street and Fairfax Boulevard in Los Angeles .
The Grove shopping centre , which opened in 2002 , performs all the functions of a mall without looking at all like one .
Like Southdale , it has fountains , flowers , piped music and a good selection of underwear .
But the Grove is open to the elements , the plants are real and , rather than vaguely evoking a town centre , it is actually done up to look like one .
Or rather ( this being Los Angeles ) a fantasy amalgam of several town centres .
Among the Grove 's 40 or so buildings are a Caribbean house with shutters and a wooden balcony , an Art Deco cinema and a grand Beaux Arts building that houses a branch of the clothes shop Abercrombie & Fitch .
Its fountains are choreographed to songs by Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis junior .
Every few minutes a tram trundles through the shopping centre .
The tram 's driver rings his bell almost constantly , because the other thing that distinguishes the Grove from an old - fashioned mall is that it is nearly always packed .
The Grove was built by Rick Caruso ( below ) , a dapper man who owns eight shopping centres in southern California and has three more under way .
His next project , a 16 - acre development with a large public square , apartments and lots more fountains , will open in 2008 next to the Glendale Galleria .
He also plans to build an open - air shopping centre by a race track in the city of Arcadia , where the weary will be transported from shop to shop in a horse - drawn carriage .
It is a sign of the popularity of his developments , as well as the bleak future of conventional malls , that the owners of nearby shopping centres are fighting hard to stop him .

Rick Caruso and his “ lifestyle centre ”
Mr Caruso does n't think he builds malls .
The industry term is “ lifestyle centres ” ; he calls his creations simply “ streets ” .
Nor can he claim to have invented the outdoor shopping centre .
Before Gruen 's revolutionary designs , all shopping centres were open to the sky .
But Mr Caruso has brought the open - air mall to a pitch of ersatz perfection .
It is partly thanks to him , and particularly the Grove , that every new shopping centre built in America next year will be roofless ( and several traditional shopping malls will tear off their roofs ) .
Open - air centres will appear not just in temperate places like southern California but also in muggy Houston and frigid Massachusetts .
The mix - and - match appearance of the “ lifestyle centres ” is thought to be key to their appeal .
Mr Caruso and his designers visit cities as diverse as Savannah and Capri to measure buildings and try to capture their appeal .
Architectural styles are jumbled together with the aim of creating a festive , holiday atmosphere which people go to hang out in and end up spending money .
“ After all , ” says Mr Caruso , “ you buy things when you 're on holiday that you would n't buy otherwise . ”
But Mr Caruso also claims , more boldly , that his creations are more “ real ” and authentic than conventional shopping centres .
It is an odd claim for a man whose signature style is a mish - mash of two continents ' and several centuries ' worth of architectural traditions .
But , like Gruen half a century ago , Mr Caruso has a bold vision for his developments .
Indeed , his vision is rather similar to Gruen's .
Like the Austrian émigré , Mr Caruso believes that people are naturally gregarious , and that America has failed to provide them with places that meet their social needs .
Like Gruen , he claims to be trying to create not just profitable shopping places but also more perfect city centres .
There is one crucial difference .
Gruen wanted to improve upon the American city centre by modernising and Europeanising it .
Mr Caruso , by contrast , looks to the past .
He has tried to re-create a kind of prelapsarian downtown where there is no crime or homelessness .
His romantic evocations of city centres are possible only because people have forgotten what downtowns used to be like .
And they have forgotten , of course , largely because of the suburban shopping malls that Gruen built .
It was necessary to kill the American city centre before bringing it back to life .
The ' Treasury boys ' on the call made it clear that " the tranching is a mere formality , and the Treasury boys as much as said so .
They could take the $ 700 billion max as soon as the bill has passed . "
That was always obvious .
And they admitted that " the exec comp provisions sound like a joke , They DO NOT affect existing contracts , they affect only contracts entered into during the two years of the authority of this program and then affect only golden parachutes . "
Both of these provisions were ' concessions ' sought by Democrats .
Of course , no one could have predicted this bill 's ' concessions ' to Democrats were farcical .
No one at all .
What 's perplexing is why the Democratic activist class is not as outraged as the country about this measure , and I include us on the internet .
It 's worth noting that the blogosphere is very much split on this measure .
Here 's Nate Silver :
Having said all of the above , the schadenfreude of certain liberals on this issue is absolutely obnoxious .
A lot of people are going to be hurt by this , and not just those in the investor class .
I tend to see this more as a failure of our democracy than a reaffirmation of it .
The congressmen who are retiring this year -- and who therefore can perhaps be described as the most neutral arbiters of the public good -- voted overwhelmingly for this measure .
Why would retiring Congressmen who do not have to face the voters but might have to face Wall Street recruiters be neutral arbiters of the public good ?
Why is it bad that candidates in tight elections voted against this bill for political reasons ?
Is n't that how we decide stuff ?
I 've had the TV on all day and it is a pervasive message that partisanship sunk this and is therefore the root of all evil .
I just do n't get this attitude .
This bill was unpopular and hated because the people proposing it do not have the faith of the public to write honest laws or carry them out .
That is the problem , not partisanship or an excess of democracy .
The belief that democratic pressures augur against the public interest is widespread , from Silver to this recommended diary by dansac .
This is a political crisis , which is why the public is angrily rejecting laws based on Republican demands for a bailout and Democratic concessions which everyone involved at the time knew were a total farce .
UPDATE : Here 's Pete Stark , progressive caucus member .
" We now face a choice .
President Bush tells us we must inject $ 700 billion into this market to avoid a total meltdown .
He and Secretary Paulson say it is the only answer .
Many economists – who do n't have a financial stake in Wall Street or an 8 - year record of bad decisions – tell us it is n't the only choice .
An option would be to assist homeowners with their mortgage payments .
By making sure these mortgages remain viable , the market should stabilize .
" The bill before us today is basically the same three - page Wall Street give away first put forth by President Bush .
The fig leaf adjustments are not enough to outweigh the fact that no one knows if this bill is what 's needed .
I 'm not willing to make a $ 700 billion gamble that President Bush is right after 8 years of seeing all that he 's done wrong . "
Stark always puts the public interest first .
That 's what being progressive means .
After building 18 robots , here are some of the things I have learned the hard way .
Separate Power Supplies
If you have the space , you will save yourself a lot of trouble if you use separate power supplies for the microcontroller and its circuits and the motors .
The fluctuating voltage and electrical noise that the motors produce can wreak havoc with the microcontroller and sensor inputs to produce very inconsistent responses in your robot .
Trouble Shooting
I find it best to first build the complete circuit of the robot on a breadboard .
Components rarely fail or are defective .
If your design is valid , and the circuit does not work , it is almost always a mistake in your wiring .
For information on how to do fast circuit prototyping , see here : http://www.inklesspress.com/fast_circuits.htm
I then mount all the motors and sensors on the robot body and program the microcontroller to control them .
Only after everything is working well , do I try and make a permanent soldered version of the circuit .
I then test this while it is still separate from the robot body .
If that works , I then mount it permanently onto the robot .
If it stops working , it is often the fault of noise problems .
Noise Problems
One of the biggest problems I have encountered is electrical noise that renders a circuit useless .
This is often caused by the electrical or magnetic noise that can emanate from DC motors .
This noise can overwhelm the sensor inputs and even the microcontroller .
To solve this , you can make sure the motors and the wires to them , are not close to any input lines going to your microcontroller .
Pic 7 shows
Sparky , R - 12 , a robot I made that uses a basic Stamp 2 as the microcontroller .
I first tested it with the main circuit board away from the robot and after doing the basic programming , everything worked fine .
When I mounted it right above the motors , it went crazy and was totally inconsistent .
I tried adding a grounded copper clad board between the motors and circuit but that made no difference .
I eventually had to physically raise the circuit 3/4 " ( see blue arrows ) before the robot would work again .
Another common source of devastating noise in small robots can be pulsating signals .
If you send PWM signals to servos or motors , the wires can act like antennas and send signals that can confuse your input lines .
To avoid this , keep microcontroller input and output wires separated as much as possible .
Also keep wires carrying power to motors away from input lines .
Magnet Wire
The problem of wire thickness in very small circuits can be solved by using 30 - 36 gauge magnet wire .
I 've used 36 gauge wire for some projects , but found it so wispy , it was hard to strip and use .
A good compromise is 30 gauge magnet wire .
Regular magnet wire can be used , but I prefer the heat strippable magnet wire .
This wire has a coating that can be stripped by merely soldering it with enough heat to melt the insulation .
It takes up to 10 seconds to strip the coating while soldering .
For some delicate components such as soldering to LEDs or ICs , this can be a damaging heat .
The best compromise for me , is to use this heat strippable magnet wire , but strip it somewhat first .
I first take a sharp knife and slide it across the magnet wire to peal off the coating and then rotate the wire around until it is stripped fairly well around its diameter .
Then I solder the stripped wire end until it is well tinned .
Then , you can solder it quickly to any delicate component with less chance of heat damage .
Thin Solder
When components are very close together , it can be difficult to solder them without blobbing over and shorting nearby pads and wires .
The best solution is to use a small tipped adjustable heat soldering iron ( 1/32 " ) and the thinnest solder you can find .
Standard solder is usually .032 " in diameter which works fine for most things .
Using thinner .015 " diameter solder allows you to easily control the amount of solder on the joint .
If you use the least amount of solder necessary , it not only takes up the smallest volume , but it also allows you to solder a joint as quickly as possible .
This reduces the chance of overheating and damaging delicate components like ICs and surface mount LEDs .
Surface Mount Components
Surface mount components are the ultimate in miniaturization .
To use SOIC sized ICs I usually use thin solder and magnet wire .
To see a fairly easy way to make SOIC breakout boards or circuits see here :
http://www.inklesspress.com/robot_surface_mount.htm
Gluing on Components Instead of Soldering
Some surface mount components can also be directly glued onto circuit boards .
You can make your own conductive glue and use it to glue on LEDs and ICs .
See : https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Conductive-Glue-and-Glue-a-Circuit/
While this works , it can be somewhat difficult because capillary action tends to wick the conductive glue under the surface mount LEDs and other components and short them .
Gluing On Components Using Non-Conductive Glue
I have been recently experimenting with gluing on components onto copper circuits boards and conductive fabrics using glue that does not conduct .
See Pic 8 for a picture of a 12 volt light bar ( unlit and lit ) using surface mount LEDs that were glued on with non-conductive glue .
I discovered that if you put a thin film of clear nail polish on the copper traces and then physically clamp on the LED and let it dry for 24 hours , you will be left with a good mechanical joint that is electrically conductive .
The nail polish glue effectively shrinks and clamps the led contacts to the copper traces forming a good mechanical connection .
It must be clamped for the full 24 hours .
After that , you can test it for conductivity .
If it lights up , you can then add the second layer of glue .
For the second layer I use a clear contact cement such as Welders or Goop .
This thicker glue surrounds the components and also shrinks as it dries to securely insure a good solid connection to the copper traces .
Wait 24 hours for it to dry before testing again .
Being dubious about how long it would last , I left the blue LED light bar in Pic 8 on for seven days and nights .
The resistance of the circuit actually decreased over time .
Months later , the bar still fully lights with no evidence of increased resistance .
Using this method , I have successfully glued very small surface mount LEDs -- 0805 -- size and larger onto copper clad perfboard .
This technique shows some promise in making really small circuits , LED displays and robots .
If you had been to the arcade during the early ninties , and lived in the US ( or the PAL Regions ) , you would ’ve seen these two screens during the attract mode for many arcade games .
Ever wanted to know what they were about ?
No ?
Well I ’ll tell you .
Winners Do n’t Use Drugs
In 1989 the first initiative was set up , as part of the FBI ’s “ Just Say No ” campaign , which was designed to stop children and young people from taking part in drug , alcohol , recreational sex , violence , and other fun things that grown ups do .
The “ Winners Do n’t Use Drugs ” motto and campaign was established by William S. Sessions , the director of the FBI between 1987 and 1993 .
A law was passed , in agreement between the FBI and the American Amusement Machine Association ( AAMA ) which decreed that all arcade games imported into the US carried this warning .
It was mainly used in arcade games , though appeared in a number of pinball games .
The image could be seen in the attract mode of arcade games everywhere from 1989 until 2000 , effectively the death of the amusement arcade era .
William S. Sessions , the guy who ’s picture appears to the right of this text , actually is a bit of a legend in Japan .
If games got shipped to the US from Japan and back again , the Japanese and their great grasp of Engrish usually thought it said “ Williams Sessions ” , after the famous pinball manufacturer .
Recycle It , Do n’t Trash It !
In 1992 , the USEPA ( United States Enivornmental Protection Agency ) started it ’s “ War on Pollution ” effort , an overall tackle on everything and anything to do with pollution .
A number of subsidary campaigns were launched ( the “ Energy Star ” being the most famous , the logo is seen on PC bootups to this day ) , and one of them was called “ Trashing it is completely uncool ” .
A law was passed in 1992 – in agreeance between the USEPA and the AAMA stating that any arcade game imported into the US would have to have a screen which advertises this campaign .
This campaign lasted from 1992 until 2000 .
The chap who ’s name appeared – William K. Reilly , the Administrator of the USEPA – still had his name on the screen long after he left the USEPA in 1992 ( Unlike William S. Sessions ) .
And his official portrait is to the right .
Why In The UK ?
You may be asking “ I live in the UK , why the bloody hell did I see them ? ” .
Well , it was a time saving measure .
Often , with the release of games , instead of recieving games from Japan converted into English , we recieved games from the US , already converted to English .
Hence why they often had American spelling , and also why they had these screens .
Worrying Picture
I found it a worrying generalisation when I started my research for this piece .
Basically , the FBI and the USEPA thought that arcade hounds were druggies and people who did n’t recycle , two of the most evil types of people there are – fact .
I wonder how many people actually saw them and stopped taking drugs , or started recycling .
Did you ?
Hey everyone , just wanted to pop in with an update as to the status of the earbud winders , since we ’ve gotten a few inquiries .
We ’ve been busy sending them out , but we had quite a large number of preorders , so we ’ve been doing a lot of catching up .
Between the time that we recieved them , we were out of town for a number of days , and this weekend , my sister had her baby ( I ’m totally an uncle .
My neice Ava will kick all your niece ’s asses . :) ) and we went to Sacramento to visit them , so it ’s been nuts .
Rest assured , those of you who preordered them will be recieving them very shortly .

The nut is hard with a powdery fruit and the pulp can make jam
It 's being billed as king of the superfruits - the baobab fruit has just been given EU approval to be used in smoothies and cereal bars .
But what does it taste like ?
The Magazine 's Tom Geoghegan got hold of one .
With its velvet skin , the baobab feels like a coconut in the flush of youth - minus the long hairs .
And inside its flesh is crammed full of vitamin C , calcium and antioxidants - it packs a nutrition punch that makes so - called " super - fruits " like pomegranates and cranberries green with envy .
The taste is something of a disappointment after the tactile pleasure of the skin that encases it .
The white , powdery fruit looks like sherbet and in parts of Africa is mixed with water and made into a drink , has an alien texture that seems rather tasteless .
But baobab - pronounced bay - oh - bab - jam , which is made from the pulp , is more appetising .
It looks like dark honey .
The taste is tart - akin to lemon curd - and the texture gritty like a tangy pear .
BAOBAB NUTRITION
More than 10 times the antioxidant level of oranges
And six times more vitamin C More than twice the calcium level of milk Soluble fibre in fruit pulp has pre-biotic qualities and stimulates good bacteria in gut High in potassium , important for brain , nerve and muscle function
And phosphorus , which helps bones Approval this week by the EU means that within months the baobab will be available in the UK for the first time .
It wo n't be seen on supermarket shelves as a furry nut , because it cannot be easily taken home and eaten .
Not only is the skin very hard - it feels as if it could withstand a whack from a meat cleaver - but the fruit inside is a dry and sticky powder .
So baobab is better suited as an ingredient .
It is most likely to be added to smoothies and cereal bars as food manufacturers target the health - conscious shoppers .
Super food " The main market that we see it for in the immediate future is the healthy snacks and drinks market , " says Cyril Lombard of Phytotrade Africa , which has campaigned for EU approval .
Demand for baobab in Europe can help poor African communities " Cereal bars and smoothies are a particular target because they are the big products among healthy foods .
" And because of the nutritional properties of baobab , we think they are ideal markets for it .
In time though , you could find baobab on the shelves in a wide range of different products such as baked goods and jams . "
It 's rare for calcium to be found in large quantities in fruit and vegetables , he says , and even kale does not have this amount .
Hence its popularity in parts of Africa among pregnant and breastfeeding women .
" Super - food is a term that many people frown upon so we would hesitate to use it .
But it 's a fruit with extraordinarily high levels of the key nutrients . "
If demand in Europe takes off , it will benefit some of the poorest people in Africa , says Mr Lombard .
People without land or money to plant seeds can pick baobab in the wild and sell to producers .
Mythical tree
The adansonia digitata , which is the only baobab species in Africa , provides many forms of nourishment , says Paul Smith , head of the millennium seed bank at Kew Gardens , where one baobab tree has been grown under glass .
WHERE IT GROWS Southern , central , western and north - eastern Africa , on savannah National tree of Madagascar , where there are seven species Western Australia , where one tree was used to imprison Aborigines
The fruit is mixed with water and drunk as lemonade , the seeds are roasted and made into coffee , the leaves can be made into spinach and the children suck the seeds .
The baobab tree is iconic and wrapped in mythology , he says , but the tree is not as old as previously thought .
" Livingstone , who famously carved his name on a number of trees , said it was likely that these trees were grown at the time of the Great Flood , 4,000 years ago .
" But science suggests that they are not as old as that .
One with a diameter of 14.4 m was carbon - dated to about 1,000 years old .
That is still old , about the age of some oaks in Great Windsor Park . "
The fruit is not easily edible
The tree bark is very unusual in that it regenerates itself .
In Zambia , some baobab trees continue to grow with spears through their trunks .
The Ngoni people believed the enemy Bisa tribe could turn themselves into baobabs , so speared some of the trees .
The bark is stewed to wash newborn babies to give them strength , but some people in Zambia believe eating baobab attracts crocodiles and therefore fisherman may avoid it .
The trunk is hollow and stores water , and is often home to bats and snakes , and even humans .
A district commissioner in Zambia once set up his office inside , and a tree still standing in Western Australia was used to imprison Aboriginal convicts in the 1890s .
Below is a selection of your comments .
The world 's biggest baobab is in South Africa at 42.5 m in circumference and reportedly 3,500 years old .
An amazing tree with many uses , from clothes to bags .
This could really help African communities in baobab areas , if they are given the opportunity .
Vince Mehers , South Africa Amazing to see the " Baobab " fruit make the headlines in the UK .
When I was just a kid in Primary School in Southern Africa , we 'd love a nibble of " muhuyu " and we 'd even try " blagging " our mates that we actually eating chalk !
I 'd love to try some again , in its original form though and not as an ingredient .
Suhael Darsot , Bolton , UK I used to eat it when I lived in Zimbabwe in the 80s .
It was nothing special .
Tangy and powdery .
It was certainly low down on the list of fruits .
Guava and paw - paw were much sweeter and succulent and in demand by Zimbabweans .
Andrew Spencer , Valencia , Spain
This fruit is probably perfect for those who prepare it in the traditional ways , in Africa .
When it appears in this country , you can almost guarantee it will be laden with sugar , chemical preservatives , and a hefty mark - up on very little actual fruit - content .
Phil Easton , South Wales , UK
This sounds very good for Africans and the health of Europeans .
However , one hopes some large organisation does not take possession of the trees or that the poorer Africans are not prevented form earning a living by picking the baobabs .
Also , it would be morally wrong if picking and sending fruit to the Western markets denied Africans their current access to this important part of their diet .
Safeguards should be put in place to protect these people .
Vanessa Cato , St Albans , UK Anyone who has read the novel Roots will remember this fruit is mentioned many times in the first chapters detailing Kunte Kintas childhood in Africa .
Andrea Best
The Baobab fruit is indeed very edible , it is full of goodness and tastes wonderfully tangy .
My children grew up sucking these instead of unhealthy sweets and love them , as do I .
It is used to make Cream of Tartar .
Alison Collins , Gaborone
Here is another way to eat Malambe ( as they are called in Malawi ) .
Crack the casing open by banging the ' lambe ' against a hard surface ... normally a hard floor does it !
out comes the numerous powder coated seeds .
Suck on powder - coated seeds , and enjoy the mild sweet and sour taste .
After you have sucked the seeds clean , crack the small seeds open .
Teeth can do the job , but you risk losing some - teeth I mean .
I would advise crashing them with a heavy enough stone , if you are live in the western developed countries , try a hammer .
Once you have cracked the seeds open , inside there is a soft nutty - tasting core .
Eat that as well .
Be warned : eating too much of the white powder makes your teeth numb .
God 's way of telling you to consume in moderation / or leave some for others !
When in season , that 's a delicacy I used to indulge in during break - time in primary school .
Thandi , Glasgow I 've eaten baobab fruits in Madagascar .
A very bizarre texture , it 's true , but quite a nice flavour .
And the seeds are fun to grow too ( they germinate into weird little deciduous seedlings that look almost as odd as the adult tree ) .

What are these ?
S3 is Great
Amazon S3 is a pretty cool way to store data online , for just 15 cents a GB / month .
The bandwidth 's pretty expensive at 10 c per GB up , and 17 c per GB down but still viable depending on what you 're planning on doing with it .
They also have a really slick API to get files to and from the server .
One in particular allows clients to directly upload files to your storage space from their machines via HTTP post ( so via the browser , Flash , etc . )
This is great since your server does n't have to proxy them to S3 .
But wait !
If you have to authenticate into the service with a secret key on the client side , then you 're basically giving away your key .
No good .
But this is not the case , and their solution is really well implemented .
To do this , you essentially sign an policy that specifies what can be uploaded -- maximum file size , key name , etc .
The policy is in a standard format , you base64 encode the policy and send it with a HMAC - SHA - 1 hash encrypted with your secret key and encoded using base64 .
Perl is Great
Athleon 's written in Perl , which I 've been extremely happy with on this project .
The code below is to encode a policy , generate the SHA - 1 hash , and base64 encode it .
It uses the MIME : : Base64 and Digest : : HMAC_SHA1 modules , and looks like this .
my $ key = ' my_secret_key_from_amazon ' ; utf8::encode ( $acl ) ;
my $ base64 = encode_base64 ( $acl ) ; $ base64 =~ s/
//igs ; # Perl adds newlines
my $hmac = Digest :: HMAC_SHA1 -> new ( $key ) ; $ hmac ->add ( $ base64 ) ; #encrypt
my $ signature = $ hmac ->b64digest ( ) ; # generate signature
S3 + Perl is Almost Great
Quick and easy , right ?
Alas , though .
This code does n't work .
What gives ?
I did n't see any documentation anywhere that says this , but looking inside some modules on CPAN , everyone 's adding a ' = ' to the end of the signature .
So I . '= ' on the end of the signature , and everything works great .
Maybe it has something to do with a spec I do n't know about .
Or maybe its something obvious that I missed .
If anyone knows why , I 'd appreciate a comment .
Still though , Amazon did a good job with AWS , and its been an absolute pleasure working with the S3 API so far .
Just a random technical post ...
Claim : Photographs show ducklings that survived a 10 - foot jump from an office building in downtown Spokane .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , July 2008 ]
Something really amazing happened in Downtown Spokane this week and I had to share the story with you .
Some of you may know that my brother , Joel , is a loan officer at Sterling Bank .
He works downtown in a second story office building , overlooking busy Riverside Avenue .
Several weeks ago he watched a mother duck choose the cement awning outside his window as the uncanny place to build a nest above the sidewalk .
The mallard laid nine eggs in a nest in the corner of the planter that is perched over 10 feet in the air .
She dutifully kept the eggs warm for weeks and Monday afternoon all of her nine ducklings hatched .
Joel worried all night how the mamma duck was going to get those babies safely off their perch in a busy , downtown , urban environment to take to water , which typically happens in the first 48 hours of a duck hatching .
Tuesday morning , Joel came to work and watched the mother duck encourage her babies to the edge of the perch with the intent to show them how to jump off !
The mother flew down below and started quacking to her babies above .
In his disbelief Joel watched as the
first fuzzy newborn toddled to the edge and astonishingly leapt into thin air , crashing onto the cement below .
My brother could n’t watch how this might play out .
He dashed out of his office and ran down the stairs the sidewalk where the first obedient duckling was stuporing near its mother from the near fatal fall .
Joel looked up .
The second duckling was getting ready to jump !
He quickly dodged under the awning while the mother duck quacked at him and the babies above .
As the second one took the plunge , Joel jumped forward and caught it with his bare hands before it hit the cement .
Safe and sound , he set it by the mamma and the other stunned sibling , still recovering from its painful leap .
One by one the babies continued to jump to join their anxious family below .
Each time Joel hid under the
awning just to reach out in the nick of time as the duckling made its free fall .
The downtown sidewalk came
to a standstill .
Time after time , Joel was able to catch the remaining 7 and set them by their approving mother .
At this point Joel realized the duck family had only made part of its dangerous journey .
They had 2 full blocks to walk across traffic , crosswalks , curbs , and pedestrians to get to the closest open water , the Spokane River .
The onlooking office secretaries then joined in , and hurriedly brought an empty copy paper box to collect the babies .
They carefully corralled them , with the mother ’s approval , and loaded them up into the white cardboard container .
Joel held the box low enough for the mom to see her brood .
He then slowly navigated through the downtown streets toward the Spokane River , as the mother waddled behind and kept her babies in sight .
As they reached the river , the mother took over and passed him , jumping into the river and quacking loudly .
At the water ’s edge , the Sterling Bank office staff then tipped the box and helped shepherd the babies toward the water and to their mother after their adventurous ride .
All nine darling ducklings safely made it into the water and paddled up snugly to mamma duck .
Joel said the mom swam in circles , looking back toward the beaming bank workers , and proudly quacking as if to say , ‘ See , we did it !
Thanks for all the help !
Thankfully , one of the secretaries had a digital camera and was able to capture most of it ( except the actual mid-air catching ) in a series of attached photographs .
Please join me in celebrating my brother —
The Downtown Duck Hero !
[ Ed. note :
Yes , we ’re aware that the captions to the pictures displayed above reference nine ducklings , even though ten are plainly visible in some photographs . ]
Variations : A March 2009 variant shifted the setting of this piece from Spokane to San Antonio ;
the duckling savior to “ Michael R ” ( said to be an accounting clerk instead of a loan officer ) ; and the bank to “ Frost Bank . ”
Also , instead of just “ onlooking secretaries ” helping corral the ducklings , the variant reported that “ several San Antonio Police Officers ” helped get the ducklings into the box to be carried to the river .
Origins : Mallard ducks frequently make their nests at ground level , but for whatever reason a female Mallard in downtown Spokane , Washington , chose a cement awning ten feet up an office building for her nesting site .
She laid her clutch of eggs just outside the window of Joel Armstrong , a senior loan officer at Sterling Savings Bank , and he arrived at work one day in May 2008 to find the ducklings hatched and the mother standing on the edge of the awning .
As Armstrong watched , mama duck then flew down to the sidewalk below , and her ducklings started lining up on the ledge to jump down onto the hard concrete below to join her .
Joel Armstrong described what happened next for Spokane television station KREM :
“ The first duckling goes to the edge and … smack .
Just hits the sidewalk , ” he said .
“ The first duckling goes to the edge and … smack .
Just hits the sidewalk , ” he said .
Horrified , Armstrong darted out of his office and to the sidewalk below .
The duckling laid motionless for about 10 seconds before regaining its senses .
The next thing Armstrong knew , all the ducklings had instinctively lined up on the ledge ready to follow the first one ’s lead .
Now lined up a like a centerfielder , Armstrong proceeded to shag ducks like falling baseballs from the sky with his bare hands .
“ In one instance two jumped at the same time , ” he said .
Armstrong caught both .
“ I truly think the entire time the mother duck could sense I was trying to help , ” he said .
“ She just stood there and allowed me to catch them . ”
Armstrong and some of his Sterling Savings co-workers then tried to escort the mother and her offspring to the Spokane River , but the ducklings were too slow to dodge traffic and make it all the way to the water under their own power .
So their human helpers obtained a cardboard box , placed the ducklings into it , and walked
them to the river , where the little fowl quickly took to the more hospitable aquatic environment .
“ It was amazing watching them jump , ” Armstrong said .
“ Could you imagine the second day of your life having to jump from a building to get home ? ”
Armstrong ’s story quickly spread on the Internet in the form of the narrative reproduced above , put together by his sister , Candace Mumm .
In May 2009 , the “ duckling rescue ” scenario was repeated when a second brood of ducklings hatched on the ledge at Sterling Savings Bank and was once again caught by Joel Armstrong as they jumped from their nest .

RAIL unions have forced the State Government to abandon plans to axe more than 400 jobs from the CityRail network and to endorse a pay rise well above the 2.5 per cent cap imposed by the Premier , Morris Iemma , and his Treasurer , Michael Costa .
While the Rail , Tram and Bus Union yesterday agreed to call off its 24 - hour strike planned for July 17 , which would have caused havoc in the middle of World Youth Day celebrations , the Government has been forced to make humiliating concessions .
The dispute has also driven a wedge between Mr Iemma and his deputy , John Watkins , who is also Transport Minister and whom unions were last night hailing as a peacemaker .
The secretary of Unions NSW , John Robertson , yesterday referred repeatedly to the Deputy Premier 's " positive and constructive " intervention in the dispute , comparing it with Mr Iemma 's statement on Monday likening rail workers to terrorists .
" I think the minister is someone who recognises the frustration the workers were feeling and why we 've ended up in this situation and the role he 's played has been positive and constructive and I think could lead to a satisfactory resolution of all outstanding matters , " Mr Robertson said .
" The Premier has played no role other than inflammatory comments . "
A recent report out of the DHS 's Inspector General 's office raises concerns that the Department of Homeland Security is still not taking adequate precautions to protect sensitive information .
From the article at Federal Computing Weekly :
“ Procedural and operational issues , however , remain regarding the effectiveness of the implementation of the department ’s intelligence security program and system controls , ” the report said .
“ Furthermore , the department has not yet fully addressed the issues and recommendations that we reported in fiscal year 2006 . ”
What I find alarming is that the Inspector General 's report reccomends , as a solution , security awareness training !
From the actual report :
To better manage and execute the responsibilities regarding the department ’s information technology security program for its intelligence systems , we recommended that the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis , through the Director , Information Sharing and Knowledge Management , issue formal guidance for the department ’s intelligence activities and establish an information systems ’ security education , training , and awareness program for intelligence personnel .
Sorry Charlie , an information security education program does not make information secure .
Technology , policies , procedures , and enforcement do that .
With a heavy emphasis on technology .
If " intelligence personnel " are walking away from their terminals with out logging out , impliment proximity sensors .
If they are forgetting to hit the " encrypt " key on emails deploy a DLP solution that knows when to encrypt .
Or encrypt everything .
If the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis ( Charles E. Allen ) issues formal guidance to DHS on user awareness training the net impact will be zero and next year the Inspector General will be issuing yet another dissapointing report .
WORCESTER , Mass .
– August 11 , 2008 – Anyone who has walked barefoot across a parking lot on a hot summer day knows that blacktop is exceptionally good at soaking up the sun 's warmth .
Now , a research team at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) has found a way to use that heat - soaking property for an alternative energy source .
Through asphalt , the researchers are developing a solar collector that could turn roads and parking lots into ubiquitous — and inexpensive–sources of electricity and hot water .
The research project , which was undertaken at the request of Michael Hulen , president of Novotech Inc. in Acton , Mass , which holds a patent on the concept of using the heat absorbed by pavements , is being directed by Rajib Mallick , associate professor of civil and environmental engineering .
On Monday , Aug. 18 , 2008 , team member Bao - Liang Chen , a PhD candidate at WPI , will present the results of research aimed at evaluating the potential for transforming stretches of asphalt into a cost - effective energy source at the annual symposium of the International Society for Asphalt Pavements in Zurich , Switzerland .
The study looks not only at how well asphalt can collect solar energy , but at the best way to construct roads and parking lots to maximize their heat - absorbing qualities .
" Asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector , " Mallick says .
" For one , blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down , unlike traditional solar - electric cells .
In addition , there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation , so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms .
Roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle .
Extracting heat from asphalt could cool it , reducing the urban ' heat island ' effect .
Finally , unlike roof - top solar arrays , which some find unattractive , the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible . "
Mallick and his research team , which also includes Sankha Bhowmick of UMass , Dartmouth , studied the energy - generating potential of asphalt using computer models and by conducting small - and large - scale tests .
The tests were conducted on slabs of asphalt in which were imbedded thermocouples , to measure heat penetration , and copper pipes , to gauge how well that heat could be transferred to flowing water .
Hot water flowing from an asphalt energy system could be used " as is " for heating buildings or in industrial processes , or could be passed through a thermoelectric generator to produce electricity .
In the lab , small slabs were exposed to halogen lamps , simulating sunlight .
Larger slabs were set up outdoors and exposed to more realistic environmental conditions , including direct sunlight and wind .
The tests showed that asphalt absorbs a considerable amount of heat and that the highest temperatures are found a few centimeters below the surface .
This is where a heat exchanger would be located to extract the maximum amount of energy .
Experimenting with various asphalt compositions , they found that the addition of highly conductive aggregates , like quartzite , can significantly increase heat absorption , as can the application of a special paint that reduces reflection .
Finally , Mallick says the team concluded that the key to successfully turning asphalt into an effective energy generator will replacing the copper pipes used in the tests with a specially designed , highly efficient heat exchanger that soaks up the maximum amount of the heat absorbed by asphalt .
" Our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable , pollution - free energy for our nation .
And it has been there all along , right under our feet . "

The Los Angeles Times reports today that the 15 year - old girl for whom the parental notification ballot initiative , promoted as " Sarah ’s Law " , is named , already had a child and was married at the time of her death .
" If you ca n’t believe the ‘ Sarah ’ story , there ’s a lot in the ballot
argument you ca n’t believe , " said Ana Sandoval , a spokeswoman for
Planned Parenthood and the campaign against Proposition 4 .
Update Saturday , August 2 , 2:52 p.m .
The San Diego Union Tribune is reporting today that proponents of Proposition 4 admited yesterday that Sarah ’s death could not have been prevented with the passage of this law .
In other words , they are using the tragic death of a fifteen year - old mother who was pregnant , for political gain .
Perhaps comprehensive sexuality education , better use of contraception , and an overall commitment to education and empowerment of young women so that they delay their first sexual experience ; and with young men so they grow up understanding to respect women and be responsible with their own sexuality , is a more useful approach .

I ’m guessing it was excessive exposure to either radiation or George Bush , but Senator John McCain ’s comments from inside a nuclear power plant in Michigan are so cracked - brained that I fear some loose gamma rays are doing to McCain ’s gray matter what they did to Homer Simpson’s .
On Tuesday , the presumptive Republican candidate descended into the colon of a nuke to declare we need to build 45 new nuclear plants – that this is the way out of our energy crisis .
Nuclear power , declared the senator , is a “ safe , efficient [ and ] inexpensive ” alternative to oil .
Really ?
We can argue all day about whether nuclear plants are safe ( they are n’t – period ) .
But there can be no argument whatsoever that these giant radioactive tea-kettles are breathtakingly expensive .
Nuclear plants are cheap until you actually try to build one .
Not one of the last 49 nuclear plants cost less than $ 2 billion apiece .
I ’m looking down the road at the remainders of the Shoreham nuclear plant which took nearly 20 years to build at a cost of $ 8 billion – or close to $ 7,000 per customer it was supposed to supply .
When I say “ supposed to , ” it was closed for safety reasons after operating just one single day .
We ’re told that the new generation of plants will be different .
Just like an alcoholic child - beater , the nuclear plant builders promise us that , “ This time it will be different . ”
Sure .
And McCain believes them .
I do n’t .
Maybe that ’s because I headed the government racketeering investigation of the Shoreham nuclear plant ’s builders .
Stone & Webster Engineering and its partner paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle the civil racketeering claim over the evidence we found of fraud and perjury .
Now Stone & Webster ( a division of Shaw Group Inc. ) will cash in big - time under Plan McCain .
The other big builder which will hit the jackpot under the McCain scheme is KBR , the one - time subsidiary of Halliburton , whose best known project is the rebuilding of Iraq .
( Halliburton dumped KBR last year .
Ca n’t blame them . )
KBR has built many nukes – not one within a mile of its promised cost .
But that does n’t bother McCain .
So who is McCain getting his energy advice from ?
I ’m looking at a photo of the perplexed senator inside the control room , looking like Homer without a donut , getting a lecture on the wonders of nuclear energy from a power company CEO , one Tony Early .
Early is the former President of LILCO , the very corporation the Feds and State of New York charged with civil racketeering .
( We did not name Early as a co-conspirator .
When the government got him on the witness stand , it was clear the guy was too clueless to recognize he was in the midst of a billion - dollar swindle .
McCain ’s got quite some team . )
Now , you Obamaniacs might not want to read this next paragraph :
While McCain is pushing nuclear power , a Senator from Illinois who shall remain nameless ( skinny , just gave up smokes ) , was already embracing radiation as the solution to pollution .
This Senator voted for George Bush ’s energy bill , a law which contained massive giveaways to nuclear energy , legislation which diss ’es and dismisses conservation .
Indeed , the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate has been derided as the “ Senator from Commonwealth Edison , ” the Chicago division of Exelon Corp. , the nation ’s largest operator of nuclear plants – and whose executives were the money backbone to his early presidential campaign .
So , we ’ve got both candidates hawking the nuclear snake oil .
But there is one difference between them .
A big big BIG difference .
McCain ’s ready to spend a hundred billion dollars on nuclear power , no questions asked .
But Barack Obama puts a crucial condition on his approval for building new nukes : an affordable method of disposing the new plants ’ radioactive waste .
That ’s not small stuff .
While The New York Times reporters following McCain repeated his line about “ inexpensive ” nuclear power without question , a buried wire story on the same day noted that the Energy Department is putting the unfunded bill for disposing nuclear plant waste at $ 96.2 billion – nearly a billion dollars per plant operating today .
And no one even knows exactly how to do it , or where .
Obama has the audacity to ask about the nuclear waste ’s cost .
“ Can we deal with the expense ? ” he said on Meet the Press .
McCain ’s plan to spend endless billions on nuclear plants without a waste disposal system in place is like building a massive hotel without toilets .
D'oh !
I suppose you can always tell the guests to poop in buckets until someone comes up with a plan for plumbing .
But the stuff piles up .
And unlike the fecal droppings of tourists , nuclear waste will stay hot and dangerous for a thousand generations .
So there you have our election in a nutshell .
We have two candidates who rise above their parties – only to agree on a ludicrous pro-nukes energy plan .
But at least Senator Obama , when confronted with an economic question , does n’t have to take off his shoes to add up the facts .

BUSH PUSHING WORLD TOWARD ARMAGEDDON
Russia refuses to become part of neo-con New World Order ; sleeping bear now roused By Paul Craig Roberts THE NEO - CONNED BUSH REGIME and the Israeli - occupied American media are heading the innocent world toward nuclear war .
Back in the Reagan years , the National Endowment for Democracy was created as a Cold War tool .
Today , the NED is a neo - con - controlled agent for U.S. world hegemony .
Its main function is to pour U.S. money and election - rigging into former parts of the USSR in order to ring Russia with U.S. puppet states .
The neo -conservative Bush regime used the NED to intervene in Ukrainian and Georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neo-conservative plan to establish U.S. - friendly and Russia - hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of Russia and the Soviet Union .
The NED was also used to dismember the former Yugoslavia with its interventions in Slovakia , Serbia and Montenegro .
According to Wikipedia , Allen Weinstein , who helped draft the legislation establishing NED , told The Washington Post in 1991 that much of what the NED does “ today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA . ”
The Bush regime , having established a puppet , Mikheil Saakashvili , as president of Georgia , tried to bring Georgia into NATO .
( For readers too young to know , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a military alliance between the United States and Western European countries to resist any Soviet move into Western Europe .
There has been no reason for NATO since the Soviet Union ’s internal political collapse almost two decades ago .
The neo -cons turned NATO into another tool , like the NED , for U.S. world hegemony .
Subsequent U.S. administrations violated the understandings that President Reagan had reached with Mikhail Gorbachev , the last Soviet leader , and have incorporated former parts of the Soviet empire into NATO .
The neo -con goal of ringing Russia with a hostile military alliance has been proclaimed many times . )
Western European members of NATO balked at the admission of Georgia , as they understood it as a provocative affront to Russia , on whom Western Europe is dependent for natural gas .
Western Europeans are also disturbed at the Bush regime ’s intentions to install ballistic missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic , as the consequence will be Russian nuclear cruise missiles targeted on European capitals .
Europeans do n’t see the advantage of helping the U.S. block Russian nuclear retaliation against America at the expense of their own existence .
Ballistic missile defenses are not useful against cruise missiles .
Every country is tired of war except for the United States .
War , including nuclear war , is the neo - conservative strategy for world hegemony .
The entire world , except for Americans , knows that the outbreak of armed conflict between Russian and Georgian forces in South Ossetia was entirely due to the United States and its Georgia puppet , Saakashvili .
Americans , alone in the world , are unaware that the hostilities were initiated by Saakashvili , because Bush , Cheney and the Israeli - occupied American media have again lied to them .
Everyone else in the world knows that the unstable and corrupt Saakashvili , who proclaims democracy and runs a police state , would not have taken on Russia by attacking South Ossetia unless given the go - ahead by Washington .
The purpose of the Georgian attack on the Russian population of South Ossetia is twofold :
 To convince Europeans that their action in delaying Georgia ’s NATO membership is the cause of “ the Russian aggression ” and that to save Georgia from conquest Georgia must be given NATO membership .
 To ethnically cleanse South Ossetia of its Russian population .
Two thousand Russian civilians were targeted and killed by the U.S. - equipped and trained Georgian army , and tens of thousands fled into Russia .
The hope is that the Russian population will be afraid to return or can be prevented from returning , thus removing the secessionist threat .
No doubt the Bush regime can con the insouciant American population , just as it did with Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , Iranian nukes and 9 - 11 itself , but the rest of the world is not buying it , least of all Moscow and
the Asia Times , and not even America ’s bought - and - paid for European allies .
Writing in the Asia Times , Ambassador M.K. Bhadrakumar , a former career diplomat in the Indian Foreign Service , notes the disinformation that is being peddled by the Bush regime and the U.S. media and reports that “ at the outbreak of violence , Russia had tried to have the United Nations Security Council issue a statement calling on Georgia and South Ossetia to immediately lay down weapons .
However , Washington was uninterested . ”
Bhadrakumar notes that the American and Georgian resort to violence and propaganda has brought an end to the Russian government ’s belief that diplomacy and good will can bring about a settlement of the South Ossetia issue .
If Russia wished , Russia could terminate Georgia ’s existence as a separate country at will , and there is nothing the United States could do about it .
It is certain that the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia was a Bush regime orchestrated event .
The U.S. media and the neo-con think tanks were ready with their propaganda blitzes .
Neo-cons had ready a Wall Street Journal editorial page article for Saakashvili that declares “ the war in Georgia is a war for the West . ”
Faced with the collapse of his army when Russia sent in troops to protect South Ossetians from the Georgian troops , Saakashvili declared :
“ This is not about Georgia anymore .
It is about America , its values . ”
The neo-con Heritage Foundation in Washington quickly called a conference hosted by warmonger Ariel Cohen , “ Urgent !
Event : Russian - Georgian War : a Challenge for the U.S. and the World . ”
The Washington Post breathlessly promoted neo-con Robert Kagen ’s war drums , “ Putin Makes His Move . ”
Only a fool like Kagen could think that if Putin intended to invade Georgia he would do so from Beijing , or that after sending the American - trained Georgian army in flight , he would not continue and conquer all of Georgia in order to put an end to American machinations on Russia ’s most sensitive border — machinations that are likely to eventually end in nuclear war .
That despicable rag , The New York Times , printed Billy Kristol ’s rant , “ Will Russia Get Away With It ? ” Kristol thunders against “ dictatorial and aggressive and fanatical regimes ” that “ seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the United States and its democratic allies . ”
Kristol presents a new axis of evil — Russia , China , North Korea and Iran — and warns against “ delay and irresolution ” that “ simply invite future threats and graver dangers . ”
In other words , “ attack Russia now . ”
What must be the effect on U.S. Intelligence services and the U.S. military of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s propagandistic and irresponsible statement of U.S. support for Georgia ’s war crimes ?
Does anyone really believe that the CIA or any U.S. intelligence service told the vice president that Russia opened the conflict with an invasion ?
Russian troops arrived in South Ossetia after thousands of Ossetians had been killed by the Georgian attack and after tens of thousands of Ossetians had fled into Russia to escape the Georgian attack .
According to news reports , Russian forces have captured Americans who were with the Georgian troops directing their attack on civilians .
The U.S. military certainly has no resources for a war against Russia on top of lost wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a planned war with Iran .
With its Georgian venture , the Bush regime is guilty of a new round of
Possibly , however , this time the Bush regime has overreached .
Certainly Russia now recognizes that the U.S. is determined to exert hegemony over
Russia and is Russia ’s worst enemy .
China realizes the U.S. threat to its own energy supply and , thereby , economy .
Even America ’s European allies , chafing under their role of supplying troops for America ’s empire , must now realize that being an American ally is dangerous and has no benefits .
If Georgia becomes a NATO member and renews its attack on South Ossetia , it must drag Europe into a war with Russia , a main supplier of energy to Europe .
Moreover , if Russian troops are sent across European frontiers , there is nothing to stop them .
What does America offer Europe , aside from the millions of dollars it pays to buy off Europe ’s political leaders to ensure that they betray their own peoples ?
Nothing whatsoever .
The only military threat that Europe faces comes from being dragged into America ’s wars for American hegemony .
The United States is financially bankrupt , with budget and trade deficits that exceed the combined deficits of the rest of the world together .
The dollar has wilted .
The American consumer market is dying from the offshoring of American jobs and , thereby , incomes , and from the wealth effect of the real estate and derivatives collapses .
The United States has nothing to offer Europe .
Indeed , American economic decline is killing European exports by driving up the value of the euro .
America long ago lost the moral high ground .
Hypocrisy has become America ’s best known hallmark .
Bush , the invader of Afghanistan and Iraq on the basis of lies and deception , thunders at Russia for coming to the defense of its peacekeepers and Russian citizens in South Ossetia .
Bush , the vampire who ripped Kosovo out of Serbia ’s heart and handed it to the Albanians , has taken an adamant stand against other separatist movements , especially the South Ossetians who wish to be part of the Russian Federation .
The neo -conned Bush regime is furious that the Russian bear was not intimidated by the United States supported aggression of the American puppet state , Georgia .
Instead of accepting the act of American hegemony
that the neo-con script called for , Russia sent the Americanized Georgian army fleeing in fear .
Moreover , do the morons who comprise the Bush regime really not understand that short of a surprise nuclear attack on Russia there is nothing whatsoever the United States can do to Moscow ?
The Bush regime owns no Russian currency that it can dump .
The Russians own U.S. dollars .
The Bush regime owns no Russian bonds that it can dump .
The Russians own U.S. bonds .
The U.S. can cut Russia off from no energy supplies .
Russia can cut America ’s European allies off from energy .
President Reagan negotiated the end of the Cold War with Soviet President Gorbachev .
The neo-cons , whom Reagan fired and drove from his administration , were furious .
The neo -conservatives had hoped to win the Cold War , thereby establishing American hegemony .
The Republican establishment re-established its hegemony under Bush the First that it had lost to Ronald Reagan .
With this feat , intelligence was driven from the Republican Party .
The neo-cons engineered their comeback with the First Gulf War and their propaganda , pure lies , that Iraqi troops bayoneted Kuwait babies in hospitals .
The neo-cons made a further comeback with President Clinton , whom they convinced to bomb Serbia in order to permit separatist movements to become independent states dependent on America .
With Bush the Second , the neo-cons took over .
Their agenda , American world hegemony , includes Israeli hegemony in the Middle East .
So far the schemes of these dangerous ideologues have come a cropper .
Iraq , formerly in the hands of secular Sunnis who were a check on Iran , is , after the American invasion and occupation , in the hands of religious Shiites allied with Iran .
In Afghanistan , the Taliban are resurgent , and a large NATO - U.S. army there is unable to control the situation .
Those Americans stupid enough to think that America ’s “ super power ” ensures its citizens from danger need to read the total contempt shown for President Bush in an editorial published in Russia ’s “ state ” newspaper , Pravda ( see below ) .
Nationally syndicated columnist , Paul Craig Roberts , Ph.D. , a former editor at The Wall Street Journal , is the author of several books .
He has been associated with the Hoover Institution , and the Institute for Political Economy and from 1981 to 1982 served as assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy .

The secret lying within the body of Eden Atwood seemed to be really terrible .
Some considered that it would have been better for her not to find out about her condition .
She was a model , actress and a jazz singer .
But she felt that there was something unusual about her .
She decided to pass a number of tests .
After that the doctors told her that her ovaries were twisted and cancer - prone , and they wanted to remove them , which in the end would make her infertile .
When she was 15 , her stepmother told her that she ( Eden ) was half - man , half - woman .
After that Atwood started thinking she was some kind of freak .
But she was neither a freak nor half - man , half - woman .
The DNA test showed she had a male chromosone XY .
The problem in the world of science is dubbed Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome , which is in fact a disorder of sexual development .
This mutation can occur spontaneously or it can be transmitted from mother to baby .
Dr. Charmian Quigley , a pediatric endocrinologist , mentioned that in the United States thousands of women have this disorder .
Just because they have a male chromosome does n't mean they are men .
They look and act like women and , in fact , they are women .
These women have a vagina , but with some differences : their vagina is not connected to the uterus and they have male testes which are hidden inside .
It seems that the doctors lied about twisted ovaries .
They have probably mistaken them for internal testes .
Women with AIS do not get acne and have no body odor .
Some say that telling a girl with AIS she has such a disorder may cause a psychological trauma .
Atwood said that she slept with many men in order to prove she was a woman .
It would be worth mentioning that sex is something normal for her .
Women with AIS may even experience orgasms .
But not all parents hide the truth about the condition from their children .
The parents of 11 - year - old Kylee Whitcher were honest with their daughter , who knows everything about her condition and feels quite comfortable talking about her male DNA .
" I do n't have ovaries , which I have to have in order to have a child , and I do n't have a uterus , and I do n't have fallopian tubes - but really , I look like any other girl , " Whitcher said .
" I just told her that she was special and had to adopt other people 's babies that do n't have mommies and daddies , " said Jen Cole , Whitcher 's mom .
The girl was only 3 years old when doctors discovered she had internal testicles .
It took 20 years before Atwood would feel somewhat comfortable with her condition .
After she got married she shared her secret with Bruce Anderson , her husband .
But due to some intimacy problems she and her husband divorced .
However , they remain close .
Bruce can be often seen in the kitchen , cooking meals with his 4 - year - old son , who was adopted as an infant by the two .

Tim Russert , NBC journalist and political heavyweight host of “ Meet the Press , ” has died after collapsing at NBC ’s Washington news bureau .
He was 58 years old .
Television sources said Russert was recording a voice - over when he collapsed in the studio today .
Reactions To Russert ’s Death

BIO : Tim Russert , 1950 - 2008
An ambulance rushed to the studio and a source at the network said Russert was briefly revived .
But , the broadcasting lion apparently passed away either on the way or at a local Washington D.C. hospital .
Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw announced news of Russert ’s death at 3:39 p.m .
“ The news division will not be the same without his strong , clear voice , ” a solemn Brokaw said .
Sources said the network allowed itself to be scooped by other media outlets as it tried to contact Russert ’s wife Maureen and son Luke , who just graduated from Boston College .
Russert had just returned from a family vacation in Italy last night .
Russert , who rose from the inside world of politics where he was former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo ’s press secretary and one - time chief of staff to the late Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan , was able to successfully cross over to political journalism and rise to become one of its leading lights .
In his role as host of the seminal Sunday morning political program “ Meet the Press ” – which he took over in 1991 – he became renowned for his hard - nosed interviews where he frequently cornered some of Washington ’s cagiest political figures with tough questions .
Russert joined NBC News in 1984 .
In April 1985 , he supervised the live broadcasts of the Today program from Rome , negotiating and arranging an appearance by Pope John Paul II – a first for American television .
In 1986 and 1987 Russert led NBC News weeklong broadcasts from South America , Australia and China .
In 2008 , Time Magazine named him one of the world ’s 100 most influential people .
A judge 's ruling today is a major victory for free speech and fair use on the Internet , and will help protect everyone who creates content for the Web .
In Lenz v. Universal ( aka the " dancing baby " case ) , Judge Jeremy Fogel held that content owners must consider fair use before sending takedown notices under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( " DMCA " ) .
Universal Music Corporation ( " Universal " ) had sent a takedown notice targeting a 29 - second home movie of a toddler dancing in a kitchen to a Prince song , " Let 's Go Crazy , " which is heard playing in the background .
Because her use of the song was obviously a fair use and , therefore , non-infringing , Lenz sued Universal for misrepresentation under the DMCA .
Universal moved to dismiss the case , claiming , among other things , that it had no obligation to consider whether Lenz 's use was fair before sending its notice .
The judge firmly rejected Universal 's theory :
[ A ] fair use is a lawful use of a copyright .
Accordingly , in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with “ a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner , its agent , or the law , ” the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright .
Universal had insisted that copyright owners could not efficiently police copyright infringement if they had to consider whether a give use was fair .
Not so , said the judge :
[ I ] n the majority of cases , a consideration of fair use prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owner ’s ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements .
The DMCA already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice ; indeed , it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of Section 512 ( c ) without doing so .
A consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review .
The court also noted that consideration of fair use is necessary to make sure that content owners do not abuse the takedown process :
A good faith consideration of whether a particular use is fair use is consistent with the purpose of the statute .
Requiring owners to consider fair use will help “ ensure [ ] that the efficiency of the Internet will continue to improve and that the variety and quality of services on the Internet will expand ” without compromising “ the movies , music , software and literary works that are the fruit of American creative genius . ”
Given the " shoot first and ask questions later " approach some content owners take to the DMCA notice process , improper takedowns of non-infringing fair uses are all too common .
We 're very pleased that Judge Fogel has put content owners on notice : ignore fair use at your peril !
McCain breaks embargo on Obama 's schedule
Obama , you may have noticed , does n't have a public schedule today .
The press generally respects campaigns ' and officials ' security concerns , when voiced .
So Josh Marshall is probably right to raise an eyebrow that John McCain — of all people — just said , at a fundraiser , that Obama would be in Iraq with other senators this weekend .
Ironically , McCain and the GOP have been demanding for months that Obama go to Iraq ; his comment may have made the trip slightly more complicated .
His comment was reported by Reuters .
NOTE : Nobody 's suggesting here that McCain was deliberately trying to do harm .
And some hints as to the timing of the trip had already leaked out elsewhere in the media — the Wall Street Journal mentioned a coming trip , and Andrea MItchell said on " Morning Joe " today that he'd be in Iraq " shortly . "
The Obama campaign is declining to comment .
yomoyomoさんがツボを押さえた紹介をされているこの議論、私も「競争は必要だ」という意見に同意します。
ただ、ここで 「競争か独占か」と言われている本当の対象は、「検索」ではなくて「クラウドコンピューティング」ではないかと思います。だから、「検索が独占されても、まだまだパイはたくさんある」というオライリーの主張にも同意できる部分もあります。
「 何がグーグルの本質か 」 「グーグルの何が既存の技術と違うのか」ということを明確にしていけば、この議論の本質が見えてくると私は思います。
グーグルが既存の技術と違う所は、二点あります。一点は既存の技術がこだわっている所をグーグルが捨ててしまった所。もう一点は、既存の技術に扱えない領域を扱えるようにしたこと。
グーグルが捨ててしまったもの、それは「トランザクション処理」だと思います。
三菱東京ＵＦＪ銀行のシステム障害が話題になっていますが、ある意味では銀行のオンラインシステムは、グーグルなんか足元にも及ばないすごい技術だと私は考えています。
銀行に限らず、企業の数字を扱うコンピュータシステムには、非常に大きな制約条件があるからです。
たとえば、私が自分の口座Aに1000円入っていて、それを全額自分の別の口座Bに送金したとします。口座Aから1000円引いて、口座Bに1000円足すだけの単純な処理です。
企業システムにおける大きな制約条件とは、「送金途中の口座を何があっても外に見せてはいけない」ということです。もし、この送金の処理と同時に、何か集計の処理が行なわれていて、口座Aから引いた直後の残高0円と、口座Bに足す前の残高0円を足し合わせたら、私は無一文になっていまいます。この集計処理は、口座A:1000円+口座B:0円=合計1000円としてもいいし、口座A:0円+口座B:1000円=合計1000円としてもいいのですが、送金の途中の状態を見せてはいけません。
これが 「 トランザクション処理」です。
企業のシステムは、ほとんどが金額や数量の足し算引き算だけの単純なものですが、一連の処理をまとまって行う多くの「トランザクション」の集合であって、こういう意味での一貫性を確保するのは大変なことなのです。
障害があって止まることは許されても、トランザクションの途中経過を外に見せることは許されません。上記の送金の処理中、口座Aから引いた直後にシステムが止まってそのまま復旧したら、私は無一文になってしまいます。
この 「トランザクション」という制約の為に、単純な足し算引き算のプログラムを作るのに、凄く高度な技術が必要になります。
ところが、グーグルはこれを捨てています。
私 が 「グーグルばんざい!」と書いたページを「マイクロソフトばんざい!」に書き変えたとします。もし検索にトランザクション処理が要求されたら、私のそのページは「グーグル」という単語の検索結果に出て「マイクロソフト」という単語の検索結果に出ないか、その逆か、どちらかであることが必要になります。両方出たらアウトです。
でも、検索にそんな意味での厳格さを求める人はいません。だから、グーグルは「トランザクション」という制約無しにシステムを開発することができます。もちろん、内部処理では、「トランザクション」に相当するような厳格な管理が随所に必要ですが、ユーザに見せる内容に一貫性が求められないということで、その負担はずっと軽いものになります。
グーグルはここをサボる代わりに、コンピュータの歴史上、他に誰もやってないことに挑戦しています。
それは 「粒の揃ってないデータを大量に処理すること」です。
銀行の口座は、どんな金持ちでもどんな貧乏人でも同じ一つのデータです。口座番号というIDと残高という金額の組み合わせであることは同じです。このように、既存のシステムは、規格化されたデータ、粒の揃ったデータのみを扱いました。
ところが 、WEBページというのは、いろんな意味で、それぞれのページに個性があります。長いページもあれば短いページもあるし、リンクが多いページもあれば、単なるテキストだけのページもある。相互につながっているページもあれば、ほとんど孤立しているページもある。
グーグルが凄いのは、大量のページを処理することではなくて、多種多様なバラツキの多いWEBページというデータをそのまま扱える技術を開発したことです。
同じ、大量データ処理とか分散コンピューティングと言っても、粒が揃っているデータを扱うのと粒が揃ってないデータを扱うのでは全然意味が違います。
グーグルは、 「トランザクション」を捨てて「粒の揃ってないデータ」を扱うことを可能にした。
これが、組織から個人へという権力の移行に直結しているわけです。つまり、組織というのは一貫性が要求されるので、組織の為のコンピュータはほぼ必然的に「トランザクション」を必要とし、その代わりにデータの粒を揃えることを受けいれます。
しかし、人間の行動は本来 、Webページのようにバラバラで粒が揃ってないもので、「トランザクション」を個人として求める人はいません。そういう個人としての人間が生成するさまざまなデータを、規格化しないで受けいれて何らかの計算結果を出す技術をグーグルは開発したのです。ここにグーグルの独自性があります。
そして、そういう技術の存在を前提として、組織と個人が同時に変容していくことがオライリーの言うWeb2.0の本質だと私は思います。
「 検索」というのは、その技術の適用範囲として第一歩であり入口に過ぎません。だから、それが独占されるかどうかはオライリーの言うように大きな問題ではないと私は思います。
しかし、「検索」を独占することは、同時に「粒の揃ってないデータ」を扱う技術の独占を意味するかもしれません。そういう前提に立つならば、TechCrunchが言うように、この分野での健全な競争が欠かせないということになるでしょう。

Torchwood is a successful spin-off of Doctor Who
A special radio episode of sci- fi drama Torchwood is to be broadcast as part of BBC Radio 4's Big Bang day .
The station will broadcast from the European nuclear research facility in Geneva on 10 September where scientists are to recreate the Big Bang aftermath .
Presenter Andrew Marr will report on the day 's events for Radio 4 which has exclusive access to the site .
The episode of Torchwood will be set inside the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) .
Insight
The show 's star John Barrowman will also appear in discussion with CERN physicist Brian Cox .
Cox , a former member of chart - topping band D: Ream , will also talk to Alan Alda , Eddie Izzard and comic actor Ben Miller - all of whom are particle physics enthusiasts .
The moment just after the Big Bang will be recreated by the fastest atom smasher in the world by scientists at CERN .
They are hoping it will give them an insight into the origins of the universe and its composition .
The experiment will be launched live on the Today programme .
In a statement , Andrew Marr said : " This will be one of the greatest scientific experiments , as well as the most expensive , ever conducted on Earth , which - fingers crossed - will reveal truths about existence guessed at but never demonstrated .
" The eyes of the thinking world will be watching CERN , which is why it will be such a privilege to report there for Radio 4's special day . "
It ’s not enough to mean well .
You have to get the science right .
I believe that Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy mean well .
They think they are saving the world from greedy corporations , corrupt government , and arrogant doctors .
In their minds they are enlightened saviors , leaders of a “ green ” army alerting the rest of us to the dangers of toxins and the malfeasance of those in charge .
Yesterday they lead a “ green our vaccines ” rally in Washington DC to help save the world .
But it ’s not enough to mean well .
Carrey and McCarthy get the science terribly , hopelessly , and tragically wrong .
In fact , meaning well is part of what makes them dangerous .
They display that toxic brew of arrogance and self - righteousness , combined with the power of celebrity to do real damage .
They are self - righteous because they think that only they and their group mean well .
Like all conspiracy mongers , they readily and eagerly believe that the faceless “ powers that be ” are evil .
They believe that doctors have abandoned ( as Jenny McCarthy claimed in her speech at the rally ) their oath to “ do no harm . ”
They believe that people in government are so corrupt they will knowingly condemn millions of children to autism in order to avoid inconveniencing their buddies in “ Big Pharma . ”
( Carrey also throws in the myth that restless leg syndrome is a made up diagnosis by Big Pharma – so I guess he only has to care about diseases that touch him personally , or does he think that all drug treatment is a conspiracy . )
They are arrogant because they believe that they know better than scientists – indeed than “ science ” itself .
McCarthy warns us that science has been wrong before , as if that is some big insight .
She wants us to trust her mommy instinct over hard evidence .
Carrey predicts that the future will vindicate his claims and anyone who disagrees with him will be viewed as a flat - earther .
He wants us to trust anecdotal hysteria over hard scientific evidence .
In fact they are both perplexed as to why those evil scientists wo n’t just accept their low grade bad evidence and why they insist on believing all that carefully collected scientific evidence .
They just do n’t get it .
Meaning well does not excuse the harm they are doing .
They lack the humility to consider that perhaps the science is complex and they better work harder to understand it , or at least understand why the scientific community disagrees with them ( rather than just leaping to the self - serving conclusion that they must be smarter and more ethical than all those scientists ) .
They lack the intellectual honesty or diligence to correct their egregious factual errors .
They lack the wisdom to see that just assuming the other side is evil is a recipe for dangerous ideological extremism .
Jenny McCarthy has the gall to chastise doctors for failing their oath to do no harm .
Meanwhile she and Jim Carrey have thrown that caution to the wind .
They and their antivaccinationist buddies are doing demonstrable harm – as evidenced by the resurgence of vaccine - preventable diseases in recent years .
Others have done an excellent job at outlining all the factual errors in the “ green vaccine ” propaganda , but I want to highlight a few here .
Too Many Too Soon
This is the primary slogan of the rally ; the phrase marchers are chanting as they move herd - like down the streets .
They claim that children are getting too many vaccines too soon .
Carrey , for example , harps on the point that 20 years ago children received 10 vaccines and now they get 36 in the routine schedule .
He fails to note , however , that even though the number of vaccines have increased , the total number of antigens in those vaccines have decreased ( due to improved vaccine technology ) .
So children are getting less of an antigen challenge today than 20 years ago .
Also – there is no evidence nor any reason to believe that the vaccine schedule is unsafe or that the number or timing of vaccines is too great .
This is just a convenient assumption .
They throw out numbers as if they have some scientific or empirical meaning , but they do n’t .
Where is the evidence that 20 vaccines is safer than 36 , or that spreading them out more reduces any side effect ?
There is evidence that delaying vaccines leaves children vulnerable to those diseases longer and increases the incidence of vaccine - preventable diseases .
First do no harm .
It ’s The Toxins
It ’s easy to scare people with “ toxins ” – it ’s difficult to understand the research and that everything is a toxin – toxicity is all about dose and risk vs benefit .
McCarthy loves to rattle off he list of supposed toxins in vaccine .
The problem is – she gets the science completely wrong .
She says there is still mercury in childhood vaccines , but she is wrong , or at least grossly misleading .
Mercury has been removed from the routine vaccine schedule – those 36 vaccines do not contain any significant mercury .
Some versions of the flu vaccine still do , but these are optional .
How does she deal with this inconvenient fact ?
She refers to the fact that some of these vaccines still contain “ trace ” amounts of mercury – left over from the manufacturing process .
These trace amounts are truly trace – an insignificant dose that no honest , thinking , and informed person could think is toxic .
But do n’t confuse McCarthy with these facts .
Instead she throws out the deliberately misleading propaganda that these trace amount are higher than the safe levels for drinking water .
This is deliberately misleading – safe levels for a one - time dose is different than safe levels in drinking water which someone could consume large quantities of every day for years .
If children were given 10 vaccines every day for years , she might have a point .
If the mercury in vaccines were linked to autism , as she amazingly still claims , then ( as toxicity is all about dose ) when the mercury - containing thimerosal was removed from vaccines by the end of 2001 ( even if small amounts remained ) this dramatic decrease in the dose should have been followed by an equally dramatic decrease in the supposed toxicity ( autism ) – but this decrease never happened .
Autism rates have continued to climb without the slightest blip .
Any honest person with the slightest understanding of science recognizes that his has killed the mercury hypothesis .
Mercury is the failed toxin of the anti-vaccine movement , so they have moved on to other toxins .
McCarthy is still claiming that vaccines contain antifreeze and ether – they do n’t .
This is simply a lie , probably based in extreme chemical scientific illiteracy .
She has been called on this nonsense , but has not changed her tune .
So add intellectual laziness vs dishonesty to her list of sins .
There ’s more , of course , mostly covered already by me and other science bloggers – but the nonsense never goes away .
There is no autism epidemic - the increased diagnosis rates are caused by expanding diagnosis and increased surveillance .
The Hannah Poling case was not an admission , as Carrey and McCarthy both claimed , by the government that vaccines can cause autism .
Conclusion
It is ironic that Carrey and McCarthy worry so much about toxins when they have drunk so deeply and carelessly of the toxin - laiden anti-vaccine Kool - Aid .
They mean well , but in the self - righteous and arrogant way that witch burners meant well .
They are inside the self - contained world of the conspiracy theorist – and just like the world of The Truman Show ( actually a decent movie starring Jim Carrey ) it ’s all fake , and there is no apparent way out .
They are buried under a pile of ideological propaganda and they do n’t have the scientific chops to dig themselves out , nor the humility to listen to those who do .
Carrey and McCarthy would be just another couple of sad cranks , except their celebrity gives force to their delusions .
They are now the poster children for the phrase –
It ’s not enough to mean well .
You have to get the science right .

Two weeks after Hurricane Ike , more than 400 still missing 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Gail Ettenger made her last phone call at 10:10 p.m .
She was trapped in her Bolivar Peninsula bungalow with her Great Dane , Reba .
A drowning cat cried outside .
Her Jeep bobbed in the seawater surging around her home .
Ettenger , 58 , told her friend she was reading old love letters by flashlight .
" I think I really screwed up this time , " she said , according to Monroe Burks , Ettenger 's neighbor who had evacuated to Houston .
That was Friday , Sept 12 .
On Wednesday — 12 days later — her nearly nude body was found face down by a huge debris pile in a remote mosquito - ridden marsh in Chambers County , about 10 miles inland from where her gray beach house once stood .
Two weeks after Hurricane Ike swept through the Texas coast , 400 people remain missing , mostly from Galveston County , according to an analysis of calls logged to a hot line set up by the nonprofit Laura Recovery Center to assist local authorities .
Until Wednesday , Ettenger was one of them .
About 60 of the missing lived on the Bolivar Peninsula , stripped bare by the storm surge that felled beach houses like a bomb .
More than 200 were listed as missing on Galveston Island itself , according to a city - by - city analysis of the data conducted for the Houston Chronicle by Bob Walcutt , executive director of the recovery center in Friendswood .
Hot line and rescue workers hope that many people , especially on Galveston Island , will be reunited with family and friends as hurricane recovery efforts continue .
More than 145 already have been located through blogs , media Web sites , Red Cross shelter lists , endless phone calls , welfare checks and sometimes dramatic rescues led by the Galveston County Sheriff 's Office and other agencies .
Yet disturbing tales told by survivors from Bolivar communities like Gilchrist , Crystal Beach and Port Bolivar suggest some may never return .
" There 's still lots of people who are not accounted for , " said Capt .
Rod Ousley , of the State Parks & Wildlife Service , which is helping to search for survivors or bodies in remote corners of several coastal counties .
" We do n't know if they got washed out to sea , or buried in the sand or in debris piles .
We just keep looking until they come up ... we 're just going to keep trying . "
Too late for rescue
Still missing is the grandmother of 16 - year - old Jerrith Baird .
Baird told the Chronicle that Jennifer Mclemore , 58 , refused to abandon her beach house in the village of Gilchrist , despite his pleas that she retreat to High Island , where he lives .
Mclemore believed her home , battered and rebuilt after Hurricane Rita , could survive a Category 2 storm .
When the first waves of seawater started to flood Gilchrist early on Sept. 12 , Baird called the Coast Guard , begging for her rescue .
" They said they were doing the best they could , " he said .
" But by the time they got around to it , the wind was too high .
They could n't fly . "
Flights were suspended after about 100 people were rescued from the peninsula , leaving at least 150 still stranded , according to a Sept. 13 Coast Guard press release .
Mclemore holed up at home with her pit bull Hoodoo .
At 8 p.m. , her cell phone went dead , her worried grandson on the other end .
The next morning , Baird set out to find her the only way he could : he kayaked with a friend about eight miles through the marshes and debris along the ravaged coastline .
" There 's really nothing left of Gilchrist .
We were kayaking over our friends ' cars that were out there that got washed away .
It was n't fun .
I was just in total shock , " he said .
Hours later , Baird reached the spot where his grandmother 's house had stood .
Nothing remained except a few snapped pilings , he said .
The search for survivors is an arduous one , stymied by the size and scope of the storm , which propelled wrecked boats as far south as Padre Island .
A handful of volunteer fire department members have led the search on the peninsula itself .
Meanwhile , dozens of sheriff 's deputies , U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Texas State Parks & Wildlife Department wardens are patrolling vast marshlands and other remote areas , including roadless sections of Chambers County where storm debris fields stretch for miles .
Airboats , four - wheelers , search dogs and helicopters are being used to scour areas where the water and wind blew cars , homes and animals , creating seemingly insurmountable piles of wreckage and waste .
" Some of these debris piles are real , real tall and real real wild areas with nothing but boards and nails and snakes and alligators and mosquitoes , " Ousley said .
" This is some of the hardest recovery efforts we 've ever faced with the storm surge and what all it moved and the debris that moved with it . "
Washed off road ?
Searchers confirm they 've also spotted countless cars in the floodwaters and marshes .
It 's impossible to tell which were once occupied , though so far no bodies have been reported recovered from vehicles sticking out above water .
Submerged vehicles are not being searched .
Raul " Roy " Arrambide last heard from his mother , sister and nephew as the three prepared to evacuate by car from Port Bolivar .
Just after 6 a.m. Sept. 12 , his sister , Magdalena Strickland , 51 , called from the house to say they were leaving .
The family 's 2000 white Ford Taurus and 1993 maroon Ford pickup were loaded and idling in the driveway .
It was a quick call , since Strickland was eager to go .
His mother , Marion Violet Arrambide , 79 , along with Strickland and Arrambide 's nephew , Shane Williams , 33 , had planned to evacuate to Arrambide 's house near Dallas .
They had two vehicles but no cell phone .
They never arrived .
Roy Arrambide fears they were washed off the road .
After the storm , he hired an airboat to visit the area , where he saw dozens of submerged cars in the floodwaters and marshes along the peninsula 's lone low - lying highway .
But neither he nor anyone else has found his relatives or their vehicles .
The house they left behind was damaged but intact .
Eight people , mostly from the Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Department , have formed the core of continuing search efforts on the peninsula , though the members of Texas Task Force 2 came to conduct rescues , house - to - house reviews and provide other assistance .
" We have not gotten enough help , we 're worn out , " said Shawn Hall , a member of the High Island Volunteer Fire Department who said he joined the VFD search team for 12 days straight .
" We have not had the resources to do the proper searches that need to done . "
He said they have relied on airboats provided by out - of - state volunteers .
So far , Galveston County Sheriff 's Office officials , busy with searches themselves , have not allowed volunteers from Texas ' EquuSearch , a nonprofit that specializes in searches , to respond to requests from families of 18 missing people on the peninsula , according to Tim Miller , its executive director .
Also unaccounted for are several transient beach residents who lived in travel trailers on the waterfront in places like Rollover Pass and San Leon .
' She needed to count '
Relatives and friends of the missing said they will keep pushing authorities to expand searches and to establish reliable and complete lists of missing persons .
" I did n't want the same thing in Galveston as in New Orleans , where they had all these unclaimed people after Hurricane Katrina , " said JoAnnBurks , who was Gail Ettenger 's neighbor and close friend .
" I did n't want that for Gail .
She needed to count . "
Ettenger , a contract chemist who worked for ExxonMobil in Beaumont , loved living at the beach .
She rose before dawn each day to walk with Reba , an aging black and white spotted Great Dane who looked like a Holstein calf .
Outside , Ettenger grew towering birds of paradise .
Inside , she filled her bungalow with mementos : a wolfskin from New Mexico , a collection of nautical antiques and endless snapshots of Reba and beach sunsets .
All is lost now .
Even Reba .

Wind Turbines and …
Health ?
August 18th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Wind turbines are a fast , efficient way to produce renewable energy .
They ’re good for the environment , the power grid , and local communities .
But some residents who live closest to the turbines complain about the noise , and limited data suggests it might be more than a nuisance .
Wind turbines have grown quieter with improvements in technology , but the fact remains that they generate noise .
At night in particular , the atmospheric conditions change so that turbines are more likely to generate audible sound .
Beyond causing annoyance , some residents have started to complain about health effects .
They claim to suffer from exposure to “ infra - sound ” .
This sound is so low that the human ear ca n’t detect it , but that ’s does n’t mean it ca n’t impact the human body .
After all , we ca n’t see UVA or UVB light rays , but you feel them in a sunburn .
The question is how and to what extent ?
Is it serious enough to be a concern ?
This is where research into the topic becomes tricky .
It ’s one thing to find a report or article online that discusses the topic ; it ’s another to find reputable research that provides ( unbiased ? conclusive ? ) evidence .
It ’s an emotional subject , so reliable information is hard to find .
Some sources made nasty accusations against an opponent ( government , industry , organization , etc. ) without any evidence at all .
The conclusions I was able to draw are pretty straightforward , and they fit nicely into two points .
Known Problems
If you live close enough to a wind turbine , the noise could interfere with your daily life .
Especially at night , the biggest complaint involves interrupted sleep .
As a student with rambunctious room mates , I can agree that wearing earplugs to bed everyday is uncomfortable and inconvenient .
The same problem is true near busy highways and construction sites .
Many communities and nations have laws concerning noise pollution for this reason , and wind turbines are subject to those laws .
Naturally , complaints begin to taper off as the distance between residents and the turbines increases .
Two kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) is often cited as an ideal minimum distance for everyone ’s comfort .
The Unknown
Scientific evidence is sparse on other complaints .
There ’s not enough data to link wind turbines to serious health problems .
Nevertheless , anecdotal evidence is common enough from residents around the globe to pinpoint several issues .
Infra-sound is one , and some studies propose that the vibrations can effect mood or bodily functions , including heart rhythms .
They can also rattle the windows on your house .
The flickering shadows from spinning propeller blades is another complaint , and is blamed for motion sickness , headaches , migraines and even seizures .
Keep in mind that low - frequency sound and inconsistent light are common features of modern life , especially in the city .
Diesel engines , for example , also produce a lot of infra-sound .
Fluorescent lights have long been blamed for headaches .
There ’s also the issue that many researchers perusing these problems observe them in a small group of residents ; as a result , most published studies involve a very small sample of people .
With such narrow results , data is inconclusive .
It ’s possible that these problems are limited to a small portion of the population .
As a renewable resource , wind power provides many benefits for the environment and local communities .
However , those benefits should not override the needs of residents .
It is one thing to build these tall structures and perhaps upset a scenic view .
It ’s another to put them in someone ’s back yard .
A buffer zone between turbines and residents will probably help prevent most reasonable complaints within a community , and could offer balance between the preferences of the people and the needs of the environment , economy , and / or power grid .
Ideally , wind farms should be seen as beneficial to a community and society , not as a nuisance .
What is your opinion ?
Do you live near wind turbines ?

If it ’s going to change the game , set the trend , turn your head , or straight up turn you on , you ’re going to find it in FLYLYF .
Visual artists Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg analyzed over 10,000 songs to find out which parts of the human body were mentioned the most and broke down the resulting data by genre .
The result :
An interactive graphic work called " Listen " that correlates musical genres with the body parts they mention the most , as part of their ongoing Fleshmap project .
Clicking on each genre brings up a more detailed representation of its chief bodily concerns .
" Listen investigates the relationship between language and the body , " reads one sentence of the project 's manifesto .
" Verbal manifestations of human physicality in music , poetry and religion are distilled to their basic elements . "
By presenting those elements in such an intuitive way , Viégas and Wattenberg bring data to life graphically , so that it can be grasped in seconds .
So , what do the results tell us ?
Across all of the categories , the eyes are most frequently mentioned body part ( Hall & Oates , " Private Eyes " ) , with the exceptions of hip hop , which places a firm emphasis on the posterior ( Sir Mix a Lot , " Baby Got Back " ) and blues ( Louisiana Red , " Keep Your Hands Off My Woman " ) and gospel music ( The Gospel , " Put Your Hands Together " ) , which are respectively focused on the keeping off of one 's hands and the clapping or raising of one 's hands .
As for the genre that talks about body parts the most , hip hop takes the honors with more references than any other genre .
Meanwhile , gospel refers to the body the least .
There are plenty of other data points to peruse .
It 's nice to know that 23.64 percent of hip hop songs refer to the behind , while 11.83 percent of rock songs talk about eyes .

In the LA Times today , A Good - Enough Spy Law says ,
In the aftermath of Sept. 11 , the White House directed telecommunications carriers to cooperate with its efforts to bolster intelligence gathering and surveillance -- the administration 's effort to do a better job of " connecting the dots " to prevent terrorist attacks .
No , it started a few weeks after Bush took office -- a time when the Bush administration was ignoring the terrorist threat .
So it was about something else , and was a high enough priority to plan out during the transition .
( Can you say " political spying ? " )
One telecom company , Qwest , refused because it was flat - out illegal .
The Bush administration punished them , blocked federal contracts , and in an early indicator of what was to come from the politicized Bush Justice Department , they prosecuted Qwest 's CEO on trumped - up charges .
The combination of the telecoms letting Bush illegally spy on us BEFORE September 11 , and the politicized Bush Justice Department punishing the company that refused -- refused because it was illegal -- is the reason so many of us are so adamant that Democrats should not be passing a law giving these companies immunity .
The president can't spy on people without warrants , and the telecoms knew that .
They knew it was illegal to spy on us without warrants but they went along with it .
Why ?
Why did n't they ask the Bush administration to just get warrants ?
And why would Democrats vote to let them off the hook ?
Do n't forget that Watergate was about Republicans illegally wiretapping Democrats .
Don 't think they do n't do it .

A new bike sharing program on Governors Island has proven so popular that the DOT is considering ways to implement a similar program throughout the rest of the city .
Transportation Alternatives is reporting that since launching “ Free Bike Fridays ” on June 6th , bike ridership on the island has more than tripled , from 120 daily bike renters to more than 400 .
On weekends , rentals are available for $ 5 for 30 minutes , which gives cyclists enough time to pedal the circumference of the island .
The DOT is now seeking proposals for a citywide bike share program , which has been successful in Paris .
The program would enable riders , for a small fee or annual membership , to access a bicycle at a bike station ( normally near a mass transit hub ) and then return it to other stations in the system .
DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik - Khan said bike sharing is integral to the city ’s goal of doubling the number of bicycle commuters :
New York is a world - class city for biking , and we are looking to build a world - class bike network .
The number of bike commuters has increased 77 % since 2000 .
We now have more than 300 miles of on - street bike lanes , more than 5,000 bike racks , and have distributed more than 15,000 bicycle helmets .
In the short term , the city is working to provide free bicycle rentals in August at Summer Streets to encourage cycling along 90 blocks of car - free streets .
And starting today , the Forum for Urban Design is launching a five - day bike share .
From now until Monday , free bikes will be available at four locations downtown ; attendants provide helmets , ask that riders sign a waiver , and get credit card information to discourage theft – which is a smart move considering how quickly borrowing can turn into keeping .

Ordinarily , the American Israel Policy Action Committee ( AIPAC ) has an influence on U.S. foreign policy which goes unchallenged .
In the case of the current House resolution , H. Con. Res. 362 , despite the intense pressure exerted by AIPAC , some members of the United States House of Representatives who initially were about to rubber stamp this reckless non-binding resolution promoted by the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group , are having a change of heart .
After receiving many thousands of messages which pointed out that the resolution could be interpreted as Congressional authorization for military action against Iran , some legislators began expressing their own reservations .
On May 19 , 2008 , a 12 - member House delegation led by House Speaker Pelosi met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
At that lunch meeting , Olmert proposed that a naval blockade be imposed on Iran in order to stop its uranium enrichment program .
Present at this meeting were Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman , and AIPAC loyalists Reps. Nita Lowey and Gary Ackerman .
Three days after this meeting , Mr. Ackerman introduced the resolution H. Con. Res. 362 in the House .
The legislation calls for “ prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; and imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran . ”
This certainly sounds as if the resolution is seeking the blockade which Prime Minister Olmert had requested .
A military blockade is an act of war .
The passage of this resolution would add the voice of the United States House of Representatives to the growing calls for armed intervention against Iran .
AIPAC , the highly influential advocate for the Israeli government on Capitol Hill , is the author and tireless promoter of H. Con. Res. 362 . Israel has openly declared that it seeks armed intervention in order to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability .
There are many in the Bush administration who are known to favor bombing either Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons sites or their military bases , among them , Vice President Dick Cheney .
It was reported in Israel , and has since been corroborated by Time , that , during the President ’s May visit to Israel , the U.S. delegation convinced the Israelis that America would attack Iran before the Bush term expired .
Time claims that the administration has reversed its policy and now favors negotiations , although the U.S. government ’s true intentions are not actually known .
Over 5000 AIPAC activists went to The Hill at the beginning of June where in 500 separate meetings they lectured our representatives and Senators about the great importance American supporters of Israel attribute to the swift passage of their Iran legislation .
Initially , the results were predictable based on past performance .
Congressman rushed to offer their support .
As of today , 259 members of Congress have co-sponsored the legislation in a truly extraordinary show of loyalty to the pro-Israel lobby .
An unnamed AIPAC official predicted the legislation would quickly and easily become law with no amendments , “ like a hot knife through butter . ”
But strangely that did not happen .
The legislation is presently stalled .
Mark Weisbrot reported that the Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee , Rep. Howard Berman , has promised that H. Con. Res. 362 will not be reported out of the committee until the “ blockade ” clause is removed .
Ghandi Peace Brigade activist Leslie Angeline wrote , after lobbying on the Hill , that Berman indicated he had “ no intention of moving the bill through his committee unless the language is first altered to ensure that there is no possible way it could be construed as authorizing any type of military action against Iran . ”
My requests to the House Foreign Relations Committee for information about the immediate future of the resolution and to verify statements attributed to Berman did not receive a response .
Many people , already alarmed by U.S. and Israeli saber - rattling , were startled at the aggressive tone of the AIPAC resolution .
They reacted especially adversely to the clause prohibiting imports of refined petroleum which appeared to demand a blockade .
Even if a blockade did not materialize , passage of the resolution could be understood by the Bush administration as a Congressional authorization for the use of force against Iran .
At the very least , passage of H. Con. Res. 362 would indicate a lack of Congressional resolve to prevent the U.S. from expanding America ’s Middle East war to Iran .
This is especially worrisome in light of the fact that , as Seymour Hersh has written in the New Yorker , a Congressional delegation led by Nancy Pelosi has already authorized 400 million dollars for covert operations in Iran aimed at arming dissident groups and subverting Iranian nuclear sites .
Galvanized by the extreme language of the AIPAC resolution and the growing evidence that both the U.S. and Israel are considering an attack on Iran before the end of Bush ’s presidency , activist groups started asking their members to send emails and make phone calls to their legislators in order to express concerns about H. Con. Res. 362 .
Among the groups that had formal actions were Peace Action , United for Peace and Justice , the National Iranian - American Council , the Friends Committee on National Legislation , Code Pink , Just Foreign Policy , the Madison Institute for Peace and Progressivism , Jstreet , Voters for Peace , AfterDowningStreet , and the Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran .
According to reports , members of the House of Representatives received tens of thousands of messages asking lawmakers to oppose the legislation , many specifically citing the “ blockade ” clause .
The non-binding resolution is built on a series of assumptions which selectively and inaccurately reflect the conclusions of American and UN intelligence sources .
The legislation ignores the key conclusion of the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) which state that there is no hard evidence that Iran has an active nuclear program .
The NIE report , which was published in November 2007 , states that evidence indicates that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
Rep. Gary Ackerman has written two separate letters to the members of the House which explain the importance of his resolution .
He described as “ nonsense ” the claim that the legislation calls for a blockade of Iran .
Ackerman stated that the qualifying clause which expressly says that the resolution should not be taken to assert that military force should be used against Iran , makes it clear that no use of such force could be implied by the resolution .
The problem is that if the resolution is quoted by those seeking to use military force , as an indication of Congressional support , it would be very easy for them to selectively quote the “ blockade clause ” and omit the denial of authorization of force clause .
Ackerman also stated that the prohibition of refined petroleum clause is meant to be enforced voluntarily in the exporting countries and not in the Persian Gulf .
The phrase “ entering or departing Iran ” in the resolution tends to contradict that claim .
Reps .
Robert Wexler and Barney Frank have publicly said that they will attempt to alter the legislation in order to eliminate all ambiguity about its demanding the use of military force .
Neither has withdrawn his co-sponsorship , however .
Three Congressman have withdrawn their co-sponsorships and others have expressed concern about the legislation in general and about the “ blockade clause ” in particular .
Rep. Ron Paul went further in a speech on the House floor in which he warned that the resolution is indeed a call to war .
Senator Barack Obama met with House Democrats on July 29 .
At that meeting , Rep. Howard Berman , who is so far refusing to report H. Con. Res. 362 to the House for a vote , asked about the candidate ’s opinion of the current state of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program .
The Democratic candidate , reflecting a reluctance many share about appearing “ soft ” on Iran said , according to Rep. Shelly Berkley , “ if the Iranians do n’t accept a deal now because they think they ’re going to get a better deal from the next president , they ’re mistaken . ”
If Berman thought he was going to get a statement from Obama supporting negotiations and / or opposition to military threats , he was mistaken .
Obama has been making a major effort to court the Jewish vote , so he is not about to criticize the Bush administration ’s or anyone else ’s use of a military threat against Iran .
Non-binding legislation initiated and supported by AIPAC usually passes in the House quickly with only 15 to 20 dissenting votes .
The unexpected delay in committee and the growing opposition to the legislation may reflect the increasing and understandable concern about the role of AIPAC in creating American foreign policy in the Middle East and the alarm that Iran will be the next target of America ’s expanding war in that region .
What will be the fate of H. Con. Res. 362 ?
Even if it is held up indefinitely in the House Foreign Affairs Committee , the fact that it has 259 co-sponsors means that it expresses “ the sense of the House ” regarding the alleged threat posed by Iran and a willingness of a majority of members of the House to support AIPAC ’s Iran foreign policy .
It is clear that the antiwar movement has emerged as a voice in the ongoing debate concerning Iran .
However , if military confrontation with Iran is to be avoided , the peace movement must convince our politicians not only to oppose legislation like H. Con.
Res. 362 , but , more importantly , to renounce the world view of AIPAC and the neo-cons which has been the foundation of the Bush administration ’s Middle East policies .
This means the work has just begun .
The new question , as it pertains to oil , is now : how far will it fall before a significant shift in consumer thinking occurs , yet again ?

Influential monthly consumer magazine Which ? is calling on British Gas customers to switch suppliers in order to avoid a price increase imposed by the former gas monopoly .
British Gas said last month that it plans to up its prices by around 5 % from January 2002 , blaming an increase in wholesale energy costs .
The move , which is expected to add around £ 17 a year to the average gas bill , followed an initial price hike in February last year .
In its current edition , Which ?
says British Gas is the country 's second most expensive supplier , and urges more consumers to consider change to another provider .
Switching suppliers ' easy '
" Consumers fed up with the second British Gas price rise in 10 months should remember they have the power to do something - It 's easy to switch , " Which ?
editor Helen Parker said .
The Consumers ' Association , owners of Which ? , is also pushing British Gas to stop preventing customers who have not settled their bills from changing to another supplier .
Consumer groups claim that ' debt blocking ' unfairly penalises the poorest subscribers .
British Gas has around 13.5 million individual subscribers , accounting for around 70 % of all UK households .
Around 6.3 million British Gas subscribers have switched to a different supplier in the last three years .
Customer inertia and a lack of access to full price information are the most common reasons for subscribers staying put .
British Gas is owned by Centrica , which also owns the AA breakdown service and the OneTel telecom company .
A new mathematical model indicates that dust devils , water spouts , tornadoes , hurricanes and cyclones are all born of the same mechanism and will intensify as climate change warms the Earth 's surface .
The new equation , developed by University of Michigan atmospheric and planetary scientist Nilton Renno , could allow scientists to more accurately calculate the maximum expected intensity of a spiraling storm based on the depth of the troposphere and the temperature and humidity of the air in the storm 's path .
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth 's atmosphere .
This equation improves upon current methods , Renno says , because it takes into account the energy feeding the storm system and the full measure of friction slowing it down .
Current thermodynamic models make assumptions about these variables , rather than include actual quantities .
" This model allows us to relate changes in storms ' intensity to environmental conditions , " Renno said .
" It shows us that climate change could lead to increases in how efficient convective vortices are and how much energy they transform into wind .
Fueled by warmer and moister air , there will be stronger and deeper storms in the future that reach higher into the atmosphere . "
Renno and research scientist Natalia Andronova used the model to quantify how intense they expect storms to get based on current climate predictions .
For every 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit that the Earth 's surface temperature warms , the intensity of storms could increase by at least a few percent , the scientists say .
For an intense storm , that could translate into a 10 percent increase in destructive power .
Renno's model is what scientists call a " generalization " of Daniel Bernoulli's 18th - century equation that explains how airplane flight is possible .
Bernoulli's equation basically says that as wind speed increases , air pressure decreases .
It leaves out variables that were considered difficult to deal with such as friction and energy sources ( which , in the case of a whirling storm , is warm air and condensation of water vapor . )
And in certain idealized situations , omitting that information works fine .
But by including these additional variables , Renno was able to broaden Bernoulli 's equation to apply it to more general phenomena such as atmospheric vortices .
" The laws of physics are generally very simple , " Renno said .
" When you make assumptions , you are not representing the simple , basic law anymore .
If you do n't make assumptions , your equations have those simple , basic laws in them .
It gets a little more complicated to get to the solution , but you do n't introduce error , and you answer is more elegant , more simple . "
Renno's work bolsters studies by others who say hurricanes have grown stronger over the past 50 years as sea surface temperatures have risen .
This effect has not been extreme enough for humans to notice without looking , scientists say .
Hurricane Katrina and Cyclone Nargis were not the most intense storm to hit land in the past half century .
Other factors contributed to the devastation they caused .
This new model helps explain the formation of spiral bands and wall clouds , the first clouds that descend during a tornado .
It 's clear now that they are the result of a pressure drop where the airspeed has increased .
Renno says unifying convective vortices from dust devils to cyclones will help scientists better understand them .
" This is the first thermodynamic model that unifies all these vortices , " he said .
" When you unify them , you can see the big picture and you can really understand what makes them form and change . "
A co-investigator on NASA 's Mars Phoenix Lander mission , Renno has used his new model to calculate the intensity of dust storms in Mars ' polar regions .
He found that at the Phoenix landing site dust storms can have winds in excess of 200 mph .

The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder
Vanguard , US $ 27 , Reviewed by MICHAEL COLLINS
Vincent Bugliosi wants George W. Bush prosecuted for murder .
There are others who are complicit in the crime , namely the Vice President and Condoleezza Rice , but Bush is the target of this famed former Los Angeles prosecutor ( the Charles Manson case ) and best selling author ( Helter Skelter and The Betrayal of America as two examples ) .
He is undeterred by the virtual major media blackout on interviews and advertising .
He ’s taking his case directly to the people through alternate media and the internet .
Bugliosi constructs a devastating case in The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder .
As I write this review , it is still difficult to grasp my sense of shock at this title with this author ’s name below it .
A legendary prosecutor with a near perfect record in big cases , Bugliosi articulates one of the most revolutionary ideas imaginable in a mix of today ’s otherwise vapid and obtuse political thinking .
But first , the book and how the prosecutor makes his case .
He wastes no time in following up on the shock generated by the title .
In the first sentence , we ’re told :
“ The book you are about to read deals with what I believe to be the most serious crime ever committed in American history – – the president of the nation , George W. Bush , knowingly and deliberately taking this country to war in Iraq under false presences , a war that condemned over 100,000 human beings , including 4,000 American soldiers , to horrific , violent deaths . ”
( V. Bugliosi , p. 3 )
The president “ knowingly and deliberately ” caused the deaths of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians and that ’s called murder , plain and simple .
This is not a hypothetical case that could happen under special legal interpretations .
When the president leaves office , he is subject to the same law as the rest of us .
Bugliosi explains the ability to prosecute the case against George W. Bush by a district attorney or states attorney in any local jurisdiction where a life was lost in the Iraq war .
Federal prosecutors also have that option .
Bugliosi ’s detailed analysis of this phenomenon offers some of the best analysis in the book and the detailed end notes .
In the first chapter , “ Opening up One ’s Eyes , ” Bugliosi explains how he was able to reach this conclusion and then encourages the reader to do the same .
He attributes his huge success as a prosecutor and author to his willingness` to “ see what ’s in front of me completely uninfluenced by the clothing ( reputation , hoopla , conventional wisdom , etc. ) put on it by others ” ( p. 5 ) .
After the stage is set for an open minded look at recent history , we ’re offered a series of incriminating quotations from Bush , Cheney , Rice , and others .
Before the invasion , these statements had the power to shift public opinion in favor of the war .
How could we tolerate a dictator , Bush asked , who “ threaten ( ed ) the world with horrible poisons and diseases , and gasses and atomic weapons ” ?
Iraq had “ unmanned aerial vehicles ” and was “ exploring ways of using these to target the United States ” ( p. 22 ) .
These and other inflammatory claims by Bush and his crew were not only wildly off target , he knew that they were when he made them , without any doubt .
By the end of the carefully constructed first two chapters , the prosecutor , known to devote several hundred hours to a closing statement for a jury , has the reader prepared to accept his charges .
He pauses before beginning his core case to let us know the cost of these lies .
Over a hundred thousand died in a war predicated on lies which were deliberately fabricated by the president .
These are n’t just any deaths , we are told .
We are dealing with the murder of young , impressionable , patriotic Americans who joined the service for a variety of honorable reasons .
They all shared one bond , loyalty to their country and a willingness to die for it in war .
While Bugliosi shows highly appropriate concern for the dead Iraqi civilians as a result of the civil chaos caused by the Bush invasion , he notes that he could find no domestic law allowing a prosecution for those losses .
After the first three chapters we know the tragedy that requires a legal remedy and we are clear about the author ’s motivation to seek justice on behalf of the fallen .
He is righteously angry that this crime has taken place and determined to provide the means for justice .
Bugliosi is indifferent to a virtual media blackout as a result of the comatose state of the political and corporate elite , manifested through the calculated denial of their network news readers and the Bush administration stenographers at the New York Times and Washington Post .
There are three dates that define the guilt of Bugliosi ’s defendant :
On October 1 , 2002 , Bush received a National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) representing all federal intelligence sources .
Iraq ’s imminent danger to the Unites States was described in this sentence :
There ’s no reference to poison dispensing unmanned aircraft , weapons sales to al Qaeda which would be turned against us , or other immediate dangers .
Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States , fearing that exposure of Iraqi involvement would provide Washington a stronger cause for making war .
“ Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the U.S. Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable , or possibly for revenge .
Such attacks –more likely with biological than chemical agents–probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives . ”
NIE , 10/2002 and ( V. Bugliosi , pp. 104-105 ) .
On October 4 , 2002 , Bush released a doctored summary of the NEI to Congress referred to as a White Paper .
He left out the critical information – Iraq was deemed an imminent danger only if the survival of the regime were threatened by a U.S. attack .
“ Judgments ” and other qualifying language in the NIE were converted to simple assertions of fact in the White Paper giving the case for war a seemingly unambiguous authority from the intelligence community .
In fact , the White Paper provided to Congress was diametrically opposed to the NIE which the White House received from the intelligence agencies on Oct. 1 , 2002 and withheld from Congress .
The critical trigger for an Iraqi threat to the U.S. was said to be just what Bush had proposed –.an attack that threatened the survival of Hussein ’s regime .
Rather than securing the nation ’s safety , by the logic and advice of his own intelligence community , Bush put the nation at risk while concealing vital intelligence .
White Paper – Iraq ’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program and ( V. Bugliosi , pp. 112-116 )
On October 7 , 2002 , Bush spoke to an audience in Cincinnati , Ohio and claimed that Saddam Hussein was a danger to the United states with his “ unmanned aerial vehicles ” with WMD “ for missions targeting the United States ” ( p. 105 ) .
This is the critical evidence .
It is unambiguous .
Bush knew that Iraq was not an imminent threat to the nation , yet portrayed just that to gain approval for his war .
It represents only a part of the detailed and overwhelming case presented in a determined , thorough , and totally engaging narrative that Vincent Bugliosi sets out to do what he promised .
He builds an overwhelming case against George W. Bush , lays out the jurisdictional and other legal issues that make this a viable case for prosecution , and argues that presidential accountability is a fundamental requirement to restore the status of “ great nation ” to the United States , so damaged over the past eight years .
But there ’s a much broader significance to the prosecution , should it take place .
The Birth of the Public Servant
While a trial and conviction of George W Bush for murder would be an event of momentous proportions , it would pale in comparison to enduring impact due to the precedent established .
Presidents could no longer offer up the lives of soldiers and civilians sent to a war that was stated for anything other than national defense or imminent danger to the country .
Although the president had rotating rationales for the invasion , that act and occupation had little to do with protecting the United States .
As Bugliosi said in a recent interview with this author , over 4,000 soldiers have died “ not your war or my war or America ’s war , but George Bush ’s war . ”
The explanations offered by Bush have been discarded by all but the perpetrators and none of the financial or political motives suggested by others are acceptable justifications for the death and destruction caused .
Were there a prosecution and conviction , any future president would need to think long and hard before serving his political interests or necessities by filling the trough of financial backers and other chosen few no matter what they gave or promised .
The president and his top aids would be accountable for a fundamental individual right that is obvious to us but not them : the right of each citizen to be free from death due to a president ’s egotistical , political , or financial desires .
Presidents would no longer be able to conceal the sin of premeditated murder by draping it in the fiction of necessary losses in the service of a larger national interest .
The real basis for presidential decision making would be opened up to the scrutiny of communities through their local prosecutors .
The long standing conflict between individual rights versus collective rights would be resolved as well .
By having to serve each member of the public by refraining from unnecessary war making , the chief executive would need to show restraint thus eliminating the requirement for an oversized military establishment designed as an imperial presence throughout the world .
The tools of diplomacy would devolve to shared interests rather than coerced solutions forced on weaker states .
And this would not just be for major wars .
The United States has engaged in over 40 military incursions since World War II .
Unless a president could be assured that no one soldier died , he or she would be wise to have a solid justification for defense of the nation for any military action in order to avoid an indictment carrying a hefty sentence .
The president would also have the example of a convicted and sentenced ex president who was vulnerable ddue to nonstop lying about the rationale for war .
The national defense was sorely lacking during the 9/11 attacks , despite an awesome world wide military potential .
Similarly , the administrations successful efforts to exempt themselves from the consequences of international war crimes tribunals since 2003 occurred while the potential existed for domestic prosecutions as Bugliosi outlines in this book .
It poses a much more serious and final threat to willful leaders who casually use their citizens as fodder in their wars to benefit the narrow interests of financial interests who fear real competition on an even playing field .

Statement By the United Civil Front – War in Georgia

Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili ’s military adventure in South Ossetia became possible as result of longstanding mediocre and two - faced politics of the Russian leadership in the Caucasus when taken as a whole , and relations with Georgia in particular .
Politics not based on the principles of international law does not serve the true interests of the Russian people and can in no way work to resolve national - territorial conflicts in this region .
Extending political and material support to quasi-criminal separatist regimes over a period of many years ; providing Russian citizenship to residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on a large scale ; publicly using pejorative imperial rhetoric in regard to official Tbilisi ; the cynical kindling of anti-Georgian hysteria within Russia – the Kremlin coupled all these questionable and entirely unacceptable means with an absence of a sensible and reasoned strategy in the region .
Having frozen for a long time in a state of post - war anarchy , the unrecognized republics , nourished by Moscow , became an natural objective of Tbilisi ’s aggressive politics –and meanwhile , Russia never verbally disputed Georgia ’s territorial integrity , which only spurred the local [ Georgian ] “ hawks . ”
It must be noticed that instances of relatively successful assertion of one ’s positions in territorial disputes preclude any kind of ambiguity : Armenia never recognized Nagorno - Karabakh as a part of Azerbaijan , and Israel consistently considers the Golan Heights as its territory .
Incidentally , the governments of these countries rely on broad public support and are accountable to their own people .
To the contrary , the Putin - Medvedev regime enacts its own , unconventional foreign policy decisions , to put it mildly , in a strictly voluntary way : with a wave of the commanding hand , the Kremlin writes off multi-billion [ ruble ] debts to by - no - means impoverished Iraq , Algeria and Libya ; forfeits a part of its indigenous territory to China ; acquires more than questionable friends in distant parts of the world and aggressively seeks out enemies in neighboring states , with which it is connected historically and spiritually .
As result , our government has ended up in a ring of unfriendly countries , and in a state of open military conflict with one of them .
Today , it is short - sighted to concentrate solely on criticism of Saakashvili .
To demand an immediate cease - fire and start of talks is correct , but insufficient .
If we want to eliminate the risk of repeating similar tragic situations in the future , the Russian authority must bear responsibility for its actions before its citizens .
As a first step , the president and prime - minister would do well to explain why the government is issuing tens of thousands of Russian passports in the territory of a neighboring country , with which we maintain normal diplomatic relations ?
Why are the key posts in the South Ossetian government and security services occupied by career Russian civil servants and military personnel ?
Why , after an attack on Russian peacekeepers by the superior forces of the opponent in Tskhinvali , did the official establishment stand in a state of stupor for several hours , and did n’t rush to provide military assistance ?
What does the Kremlin want to achieve by escalating the conflict with Georgia and expanding the theater of military operations ?
It is impossible to imagine that Putin or Medvedev would stoop to such clarifications : this would fully contradict the order of mutual relations between the authorities and citizens in Russia .
However , citizens must learn to put such questions before the authorities , or otherwise the unaccountable rulers will time and time again make mistakes that the humble “ subjects ” will have to pay for .
With the most expensive price at that – the price of human lives .

He Ping Ping World 's Shortest Man ( Photos )
China is home to the World 's Shortest Man and the World 's Tallest Man. According to Guinness World Records , , who measures 2 ft 5.37 in ( 74.61 centimeters ) is twenty years old and is the World 's Shortest Man .
His father said that he was no larger than the size of a man 's palm at birth .
The World 's Tallest Man , Bao Xishun , also from China , lives 500 miles from He Ping Ping .
Bao is 7 ft 8.95 in tall .
He recently moved into top spot when Ukrainian Leonid Stadnyk refused to be measured under new Guiness guidelines , which called for 6 measuring sessions over the course of one day , in standing and prone positions .
The 8 ft 5.5 in giant did n't want to be bothered .
Some 75 years ago the U.S. claimed the World 's Tallest Man , Robert Wadlow , who died at age 22 in 1940 .
He measured 8 ft 11.1 in .

For all those that thought cats ca n’t swim we have news for you .
They can if they are being taught , and that ’s exactly what Dr Bhagavan Antle did for the last 25 years .
A young lion cub is being taught how to swim
Tiger loves to get his paws wet for a good swim
Baby orangutan learns how to swim
A swimming tapir , enjoys life underwater
Born in Arizona on a vast cattle ranch and with a passion for wild and exotic animals , Dr Bhagavan Antle is now the director of T.I.G.E.R.S and is considered one of the foremost animal trainers in the country with more than 350 bit cats trained for movies , TV commercials , and live performances .
Would we have fun if tigers would play with us ?
Probably not !
I salute his lions swimming lessons but I think animals should be left alone in their natural habitat and not used to entertain humans .
Ever had a really cool idea for something you wanted to build , but you had no way to actually build it ?
Ever designed a toy or a piece of art that you thought would be a neat thing to have , but your skills at molding plastic or at sculpture just were n't up to the task ?
If so , Shapeways may be for you .
Design whatever you want ( within certain parameters ) and they 'll print it for you in 3D , out of plastic , and send it to you .
Like many geeks , I 've lusted after 3D printing technology pretty much since I first heard about it .
But I never actually got a chance to try it out until Shapeways contacted me about trying out their service .
My design abilities are excellent , I think , when it comes to software ; when it comes to 3D artistic design , they are sadly lacking .
Shapeways kindly created a design for me , which I then uploaded to their site and ordered .
It arrived about two weeks later , and it is remarkably cool .
( See the picture , with a U.S. quarter coin for size comparison .
The text on the inside reads " Shapeways , " and below that " Matt Blum @ Wired . " )
The Shapeways website offers the ability to browse other people 's designs as well , and you can decide whether you want your designs to be public or private , and whether or not to allow other people to copy them for their own modification purposes .
You can upload designs from pretty much any major design software product out there , and the website now offers an online " creator , " which currently only allows you to create what they call " light poems " ( which are a really cool idea ) , but will eventually allow more freedom .
There are certainly some very cool designs that others have made , and some people have even made puzzles out of it .
Unfortunately from a GeekDad perspective , the plastics they currently offer are not certified as non-toxic , and are therefore not a viable medium for making toys for little kids .
They do say that they plan to offer certified safe materials soon .
The service is also , while not horribly expensive , not very economical , either .
I understand their need to make money on the service , of course , but if any fairly complex design comes out costing $ 100 US or so , as seems to be the case from my experimentation , I do n't know how many people are likely to complete their orders .
In short , it 's a really cool service , and I highly recommend that anyone with design talent give it a try , and anyone with or without design talent take a look at some of the designs on the website .
If you can afford to buy one of them , they do look really cool on your shelf .
Just do n't let any children who still put toys in their mouths play with them .
The minister has defended his actions ( Photo : Nepalnews )
Thousands of local government workers in Nepal have gone on strike after a Maoist minister locked up an " errant official " in a toilet .
The official had incurred the minister 's wrath for allegedly running an illegal stone mine .
Striking workers said that his incarceration inside a toilet was an " inhumane and objectionable act " .
But the minister responded by saying that the official now knows what it is like to live in a " foul environment " .
Reports from Nepal say that the Minister for Forest and Soil Conservation , Matrika Yadav , locked up local development officer Dandu Raj Ghimire for one and a half hours on Tuesday inside a toilet room .
Mr Ghimire was accused by the recently elected Maoist minister of " violating his order for banning stone mining in the Devichaur area " of the Kathmandu valley .
The minister has accused Mr Ghimire of allowing the illegal mining operation to continue despite frequent requests to ban such activities that were upsetting the locals .
The Local Level Employees Organisation ( LLEO ) has now called a nationwide strike over the minister 's actions .
More than 4,000 local development committees and municipalities have shut their offices .
But correspondents say their protest is unlikely to have much impact in the day - to - day administration of the country .
" It is indeed very disgraceful that a senior minister treated a government official in such an objectionable manner , he must apologise for the misconduct , " a LLEO spokesman said .
Mr Yadav said he had locked Mr Ghimire in the toilet " to teach him a lesson " .
Are CFL ’s Designed to Make Us Pay More on Our Power Bills ?
By Steve Windisch ( jibbguy ) 8-08
There is much talk about Compact Fluorescent Lamps recently .
These are the small glass fluorescent tubes often shaped into a coil , designed to directly replace regular incandescent light bulbs .
These new CFL ’s have been touted to save energy , and they do certainly save significant amounts of electricity .
But there are some interesting and largely unknown facts about these devices .
It would appear that those sold within the United States and other countries may be specifically designed to allow the utility corporations to bill us nearly double what we should be paying for their use .
The problem lies in the combination of two factors : First , that the CFL ’s sold in the U.S. are generally built without the addition of a low - cost capacitor to provide something called Power Factor Correction ; and second , the way in which our power companies calculate our monthly bill using “ AC Apparent Power ” instead of “ AC Real Power ” .
Together these factors insure we are not able to see all the possible savings on our electric bills that these new lamps should offer … .
And in fact , when “ AC Power Factor ” in consumer devices is examined closer in general , it would seem that CFL ’s are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to home and small business Customers paying more than they should for power , to a truly staggering extent …
All for the want of a low - cost capacitor .
One would suspect the electric utility corporations do not want you to know this , but it is nonetheless fact anyway :
The power companies charge their non-industrial customers using something called “ AC Apparent Power ” .
This is not the same as “ AC Real Power ” ; which takes into effect “ AC Reactive Power ” caused by electrical Inductance .
The difference between Real and Apparent Power is called the AC Power Factor , and is generally determined in these cases by the phase angle difference between the AC Voltage and the AC Current across a device .
This phase shift is commonly seen with induction devices such as Compact Fluorescent Lamps , and more importantly , AC motors like those used in common Consumer home products such as refrigerators , freezers , washing machines , and air conditioners ( by far the greatest users of power in the home ) .
In large industrial applications , this Power Factor is routinely “ Corrected ” by adding electrical Capacitance to the circuit , to “ balance ” and remove the phase angle difference , bringing it to a state approaching “ Resonance ” , and thus insuring greatest efficiency .
However , Power Factor Correction is mainly unknown in American consumer products ; so the “ unbalanced ” motors and other devices such as CFL’s are reported on the Customer ’s billing meter to be using more power than they would be consuming if properly built , or if the power companies actually charged us by Watts as they now wrongly claim .
And thus many of us are being charged more on our power bills by a significant amount every month than we should be .
When using the Compact Fluorescent Lamps ( which are Inductive in nature ; meaning they use inductive coils in the circuitry to step - up the voltage of internally - generated pulses to power the fluorescent tubes ) , there usually is a Power Factor difference of “ .55 ” with the non-PF Corrected ones sold here in the U.S. ; which means that the “ Real Power ” figure in Watts is almost half what the Apparent Power figure is .
So although these bulbs are indeed saving energy ; the electric company is charging us almost double what the actual Watt rating would denote .
Simply adding a few low - cost components ( mainly a capacitor ) to Correct and “ balance ” the Power Factor would eliminate this :
And CFL ’s sold in the European Union appear to always have these low - cost items added into the internal circuitry of the CFL already .
When considering the Power Factor of an appliance 's AC inductive motor , the Consumer can pay up to 25 % more in the cost of electricity for operating that device if there is a phase imbalance ( which there will most likely be unless a capacitor is added for PF Correction ) .
And literally hundreds of millions of AC motors in U.S. Consumer appliances today are not Power Factor Corrected .
Regular “ old fashioned ” incandescent light bulbs ( which are “ Resistive ” in nature and exhibit very little AC inductance or capacitance and therefore no phase shift ) , have an AC Power Factor very close to “ 1.0 ” ; therefore Real and Apparent Power are virtually the same .
So if rated at 75 Watts , then the Consumer is charged by the electric company for 75 Volt - Amperes .
It is interesting to note that Apparent Power figures should never use the “ Watts ” metric , and should always be stated in “ Volt - Amperes ” ( V/A ) , although this is not the case with our power companies who erroneously bill us by the “ Kilo - Watt Hour ” :
When in fact the residential and small business meters only read Apparent Power and not Real Power .
We can easily check this for ourselves :
Go outside to where your billing meter is , and look at the dial :
It reads in “ Volt - Amperes ” .
Compact Fluorescents designed to replace 75
Watt incandescent bulbs are usually rated by the manufacturer for an impressively low “ 18 Watts ” ( an AC Real Power figure ) .
The universally - repeated misinformation is that these bulbs use “ only about 25 % ” of the power the old - style bulbs do :
This is not precisely the truth .
In actuality because CFL ’s sold here in the U.S. have significant inductive Reactance and thus an AC phase difference between Voltage and Current , the Power Factor of the CFL is around “ . 55 ” … And since we are being charged by the utility in Apparent Power , the draw on our billing meter is actually about 33 Volt - Amperes of power … .
Nearly double the figure in Watts .
And thus is revealed a chronic and institutionalized over - paying by Consumers of our electric utility bills :
Only because a small low - cost part was left out when our CFL ’s and appliances were manufactured .
Deliberately left out ?
That is a question which deserved further investigation .
There are Compact Fluorescent Lamps that have a “ resonance tuning ” capacitor circuitry added internally to solve the phase angle difference and provide a Power Factor near “ 1 ” :
These appear to be sold mainly in Europe ; and this was rumored to be done at the insistence of the European testing agency TUV who have some ability to stop imports which do not meet their design criteria .
These Power Factor Corrected lamps are not generally seen for sale here in the U.S. ( apparently the “ U.L. Approval ” stamp we are familiar with here does not represent quite so picky a testing regimen ) .
The cost of adding the capacitor to CFL ’s in mass production would be only a few pennies … .
And there is no chance at all that any electrical engineer with General Electric or its competitors would not fully understand AC Power Factor :
It has been known , taught , and extensively written about for over 100 years .
It is just that since the end of World War Two , PF Correction technology has all but disappeared from American Consumer products …
As well as the Consumer awareness for this important money saving technology .
This is certainly not the case in industrial settings or with large buildings …
Power Factor Correction is very important in these cases and banks of AC capacitors up to the size of oil drums can often be seen in power rooms for this express purpose .
This is because in industrial and large commercial billing , the power companies will usually charge in Real Power , but also charge a penalty if the Power Factor is not within a certain limit .
In these cases , since the power company is the one “ holding the bag ” not the Consumer , they are very helpful , and even insistent , when it comes to Power Factor Correction : Providing much information and even consulting help to solve the issues .
Is it not odd that they never mention this issue to us , the Consumer ?
Considering we are the ones who pay for the Apparent Power difference when it comes to homes and small business , not them :
It then be becomes understandable ( if “ not exactly ” ethical ) .
CFL ’s offer a great savings in energy , and are very worthy of use in themselves ( Power Factor considered or not ) .
However the power companies are benefiting from their use because of a design flaw .
Although we can still save 50 % by their use over incandescent bulbs , we should be saving 75 % … But again , the differences here pail in comparison to what we could be saving on our bills when it comes to Power Factor - Corrected AC induction motors .
A few home appliances and some business equipment devices do offer this technology installed by the manufacturer , but most do not in the U.S.
If they all did , then we could be saving many billions of Dollars collectively on our power bills each month .
This is not so much a “ green ” energy savings issue , but more a question of billing between the Consumer and our electric utilities …
Or perhaps an issue of our appliance and CFL manufacturers not adding the Power Correction technology that they should have , and that is already enjoyed by our European friends .
This is mainly because of the European Union ’s mandated standard # IEC61000 - 3 - 2 regarding Consumer appliances of over 75 Watts requiring harmonics distortion protection and Power Factor Correction ; which was also closely followed by Japan , China , and many other countries …
But largely ignored in the United States ( please note that European appliances built before the law came into effect in January , 2001 may not have PFC technology installed …
But those sold afterwards in Europe , including those built and exported by American manufacturers , do have Power Factor Correction …
Just not the ones sold within the U.S. ) .
The above technical information can be verified by use of a “ Kill - A - Watt ” or similar power meter , or by use of an oscilloscope measuring the phase angle between Voltage and Current , and then doing the calculations manually .
Any text books for the last 100 years on AC electricity can fully explain the meanings and relationships between the terms Phase Angle , Apparent Power , Real Power , Power Correction Factor , Capacitance , Inductance , and Resonance .
There are easily - done techniques for checking the Power Factor of your home appliances ( simply reading voltage across the motor , and using a shunt to read it ’s current draw and comparing them ) ; and a good electrician should be able to do so and provide the added capacitors to “ balance ” the AC motors of our homes ’ major appliances to the point of 0.95 Power Factor ( the highest recommended PF figure for motors ) .
If we had unbalanced ( out of phase , non-Power Corrected ) AC motors in a refrigerator , air conditioner , and washing machine …
And our monthly bill was $ 200 ; it is very possible we could to see a savings of $ 35 or more on that bill ; realized simply by adding the necessary capacitors to bring each appliances ’ motor to a Power Factor of close to “ 0.95 ” .
Such capacitors are of low cost , consume very little energy themselves ( when installed in parallel across the motor ’s power terminals so they only operate when the motor runs ) , and the modifications are relatively easy to perform .
It is interesting to note that although many “ green ” advances in motors and electronics have come to pass with consumer devices in recent years , making them significantly more energy efficient ; Power Factor Correction technology is still not in widespread use by the U.S. consumer appliance industry …
Questions sent to the customer / technical support services of over 8 different U.S. major manufacturers have verified this :
None of them apparently do use PFC technology in their appliances .
A very good question for us to ask these corporations like General Electric would be : “ Why is this ” ?
When reading about CFL ’s around the ‘ Web , there is much consumer information about them available ; and they are certainly a “ Hot Item ” .
Walmart sold roughly 100,000,000 of them last year alone .
Yet , in over 12 mainstream articles regarding CFL’s ; only one brief mention was seen regarding Power Factor ( on G.E. ’s CFL pages ) , which stated that although they were not “ Corrected ” ( with no further explanation of the term given ) ; they were still an important energy saving device .
The term “ corrected ” by itself is meaningless :
One wonders why they did not wish to use the proper “ Power Factor Corrected ” , which is the only acceptable term .
Not surprisingly , the “ Popular Mechanics ” article on CFL Consumer awareness from May 2007 also did not mention the Power Factor issue ; although an “ expert ” equipped with “ pro meters ” measured the wattage of the various models tested .
Nor was the issue mentioned on the “ Energy Star ” pages about CFL’s .
Several of the CFL models that have the Energy Star “ blessing ” are not Power Factor Corrected , so it would seem this is not a criteria to gain this “ prestigious ” award .
In fact , at least one of the G.E. refrigerators which won an award for “ Best ” last year from Energy Star has no Power Correction technology in it either .
Energy Star is a unique sort of creature : Born of an alliance between the U.S. Dept. of Energy and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ; but actually supported and “ steered ” by the electronics and appliance manufacturing industries along with the power utility corporations “ in partnership ” .
Knowing this , it is then perhaps no wonder that Energy Star has also all but ignored an important technology like PF .
Oddly enough , Power Factor Correction is required for computer power supplies to gain the Energy Star rating ( which often have some leading - current Capacitive , not lagging - current Inductive phase shift ) …
Yet major appliances that have AC inductive motors with many more times the power usage and possible savings ; are not required to have Power Factor Correction technology installed in order to meet Energy Star requirements ?
This question also begs further investigation .
Especially since homes with computer power supplies with current - leading Capacitive phase shift could actually help balance out and improve the total Power Factor when summed with the AC motor ’s Inductive current - lagging phase shift causing poor Power Factor …
In other words , if they had left the issue alone all together , then the difference we pay on our bills because of Apparent Power could actually be lower …
The costs to the manufacturers of adding Power Factor Correction would be minimal , but the savings to the Consumer could be dramatic .
If the figures on General Electric ’s CFL information web page can be used ; over 30 Billion Dollars are “ saved ” annually by U.S. Consumers using CFL ’s ( this figure assumes the billing is done in Real Power Watts , which it clearly is not in most cases ) .
So knowing what we now do about CFL’s and Power Factor Correction , and that we are actually billed by Apparent Power …
Then this would mean that the American consumer is paying over $ 14 Billion a year more on their power bills than they should be … .
Just for non-PF Corrected CFL ’s alone .
The amount of money for non-Power Factor Corrected AC motors in homes and small businesses would be difficult to estimate with accuracy ( there are several hundred million such motors in operation within the U.S. ; with only a small but unknown percentage of the Consumer models being Power Factor Corrected ) ; but this amazing figure could easily be well over $ 150 Billion annually … .
All because of missing low - cost components ?!
There are many things we can do to save energy ; and this is unquestionably a worthy endeavor .
But as we have seen , there are also things we can do to simply save money as well …
Perhaps it is time to call the electric utilities on their deceptive practice of charging by Apparent Power ; and insist that we be billed by Real Power ; as their charging by the “ Kilo - Watt Hour ” wrongly suggests ( they should be naming it “ Volt - Amperes Hours ” to correctly denote Apparent Power ) .
There is some debate on whether the electric utilities are actually being loaded down at their generators with the Apparent Power figure or the Real Power figure …
They must always supply Power Factor Correction in their transmission lines and sub-stations anyway , and even at the residential neighborhood transformers .
So on one hand they must provide enough power to supply the higher Apparent Power amount ; yet the question is which power figure is actually being drawn from the system at the generator end : Real or Apparent ?
There are differing opinions ; but it is much evidence that the entire additional amount of Apparent Power is not seen at the generators ( and that the amount is somewhere in between the Real and Apparent figures ) ...
Meaning Consumers are being over - billed , and have been for many decades .
We can contact our State ’s Public Utility Board , and insist action be taken to stop the “ time honored tradition ” of the power companies billing us by the “ Kilo - Watt Hour ” instead of accurately using the “ Volt - Amps Hour ” figures that reminds us that we are really paying for Apparent Power , not Real Power … .
An age - old “ trick ” on their part that can be described as deliberate deception ; which has helped to successfully suppress the entire question of Power Factor with Consumer billing for over a century .
Perhaps more importantly , we need to start insisting that our home and office appliances with AC inductive motors , as well as the CFL ’s sold in the U.S. , all have AC Power Correction technology installed by the manufacturer .
It would cost the appliance manufacturers much less to add the capacitor than for what they pay for the unit ’s cardboard shipping box .
Compact Fluorescent Lamps are a wonder of technology .
And despite a small danger from Mercury inside the tubes , they are a Godsend to many undeveloped areas of the world where they now provide light when before was only darkness or polluting chemically - fueled lanterns after sundown .
But CFL ’s can certainly be even better and more useful , as proved recently by members of the Free Energy and Open Source Energy community who have greatly improved the lamps efficiency through experimentation ; making them several times more efficient through significant modifications to the circuitry .
By harnessing the usually - ignored energy contained within the collapsing field of the inductive coils in the circuit , the modified CFL ’s can actually charge batteries while supplying light ; “ reusing ” the inductive voltage pulses and creating a system that is nearly self - sustaining .
In fact , a small solar panel run only one hour a day may be all that is needed to make this CFL / Battery charging system operate indefinably in a closed - loop , with “ Charge ” and “ Source ” batteries for power , and the solar panel to help keep the regularly - swapped batteries at full charge .
This experimentation and improvement of CFL’s , done by many intrepid researchers and inventors of the Open Source Energy movement ( especially one known on the Internet as “ The Inventor **~ Imhotep ~ ** ” , who first developed the improved circuit design ) , have helped bring this very interesting and “ illuminating ” Power Factor Correction issue out into the open .
For more information on this amazing “ nearly - Free Energy ” CFL modification , see the Energetic Forums thread link below which details the great work done by **~ Imhotep ~ * * and others ; which may prove to be a wonderful boon for many poor people around the world who do not enjoy reliable grid power :
Providing bright light to stave off the darkness without pollution , significant cost , or generator / grid power ; simply using 2 small or medium - sized 12V batteries , a low - cost solar charger , and modified CFL ’s ( several lamps can be used together per battery set ) .
http://www.energeticforum.com/renewable-energy/2255-imhoteps-radiant-oscillator-video.html .
CFL ’s can cost American Consumers even less on our power bills than they now do …
If we would only demanded the same 100 - year old Power Correction technology be installed that our wiser friends in Europe now enjoy .
But as stated before , this is just a drop in the bucket compared to the non-Power Factor Corrected AC motors …
There are few viable reasons for our appliance manufacturers to continue to ignore this important money - saving technology …
Perhaps it is time to ask the power utilities and the U.S. appliance manufacturers if they have ever discussed this issue between themselves ; and what was the outcome of those discussions ?…
When over 160 Billion Dollars per year in Consumer “ over - charging ” is in question ; year after year …
Is n’t this question worth looking into ?
But these “ happy days ” for the utility corporations will be ending soon :
When put under the hard scrutiny of Consumer awareness ; they will have no choice but to change their deceptive practices .

Alistair Darling is under pressure to come up with solutions to the crisis
The UK is facing its worst economic crisis in 60 years , Chancellor Alistair Darling has admitted .
He told the Guardian newspaper that the economic downturn would be more " profound and long - lasting " than most people had feared .
Using strong language , Mr Darling acknowledged voters were angry with Labour 's handling of the economy .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said Mr Darling had " let the cat out of the bag " about the state of the economy .
The chancellor admitted the government had " patently " failed to get its message across that it understood people 's concerns about rising living costs and growing job insecurity .
He said that voters were " pissed off " with Labour 's handling of the economy , a key issue at the next election , and said it was " absolutely imperative " that ministers communicated their intentions better .
This coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the Labour party has had in a generation , quite frankly
Alistair Darling
" This coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the Labour Party has had in a generation , quite frankly . "
When asked why he had been so frank , Mr Darling told BBC News : " It 's important I tell people in this country that we , along with every other country in the world , face a unique set of circumstances where you 've got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices . "
But he said the current government differed from past ones because it is prepared to " take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time " .
He cited the rescue package provided for Northern Rock and tax rebates due at the end of next month as examples of assistance offered by the government .

Ministers are expected to announce a package of measures next week to kick - start the moribund housing market .
The chancellor has been criticised for sending contradictory signals over possible measures to assist homebuyers , particularly the prospect of a temporary suspension of stamp duty on home purchases .
In a wide - ranging Guardian interview , Mr Darling said Labour had to rediscover its " zeal " if it wanted to be re-elected for a fourth term .
But he admitted that was " a huge problem for us at the moment " .
Mr Darling hinted at tensions within Gordon Brown 's Cabinet , saying there were " lots of people who'd like to do my job " and " no doubt , actively doing it " , although he appeared to rule out an autumn Cabinet reshuffle .
The chancellor 's remarks come after a summer of unremittingly bad economic news .
House prices are falling at their fastest rate in 18 years , leading to fears of a wave of repossessions .
Mortgage lending has slowed dramatically due to the credit crunch while key indicators have suggested that the economy could be poised to go into recession .

The economy showed no growth in the second quarter of the year while building firms and retailers have laid off thousands of staff amid fears that the economy will deteriorate further .
A member of the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee said on Friday that radical action was needed to ensure the crisis did not get worse and warned of a sharp rise in unemployment .
Mr Osborne said : " Who is telling the truth at the top of government ?
" The prime minister says the economic situation is n't as bad people think and that Britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 - year low .
" Gordon Brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out , meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long - lasting than people thought .
" It 's not clear whether Alistair Darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a Labour government has left our economy in , but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
He has come out and been frank , but I have no sympathy and nor I hope has anyone else !
James , Surbiton Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the government had been inconsistent with its message .
" Until very recently there was no problem , there was a state of denial , Britain was the strongest country in the western world , any problems we had were from overseas , " he said .
" Now suddenly we 've lurched into Apocalypse Now , the return of the Great Depression . "
The Treasury said the chancellor 's comments were " entirely consistent " with his previous statements .
A spokesman said : " These are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with .
" But with employment levels near record highs , interest rates that are historically low and the past decade of rising incomes and job creation , the UK is well placed to deal with this . "

What are these ?
If you live in an apartment or older home , your bathroom is probably hurting for space .
A sink , a shower stall , and a toilet in your bathroom leave but a few extra square feet to turn around .
You could enlarge the bathroom at the expense of reducing your bedroom ?
Or ...
I know !
Get a vertical bathroom !
The new Vertebrae® , by Paul Hernon of Design Odyssey Ltd , was made to let you do more with less space ( but watch your money ) .
This stylish aluminum sculpture of seven stacked modules that rotate from the center " spinal column , " has every basic item you need in a bathroom , plus it leaves you some room to bend down to touch your toes without hitting your head on the way up .
With a toilet , sink and two shower modules ( one for children ) , the Vertibrae gives most of the space in your bathroom right back to you .
And the Vertebrae even provides some storage space for shower , bath , shaving , and cosmetic products right along the column .
Cleaning supplies and your favorite toilet paper ... in the cupboards under the toilet seat .
Really smart design !
The Vertebrae fits into any room that the plumbing goes to .
It can be installed in a corner of a room or in the center , but corner installation will limit the pivoting ability of the Vertebrae modules to 100 degree rotation , whereas center placement of the Vertebrae will allow up to 200 degrees of rotation -- better for use by two persons at a time .
A few closeups of the fixtures ...
Currently the basic model of the Vertebrae , shown in this column , goes for about £ 10,000 , but you can order it in one of hundreds of matt , semi-gloss , and gloss colors .
The " luxury " version of the Vertebrae will have a mirror and a television on the outside of the cistern ( tank ) module .

The photos are being used to prove the tribe 's existence
Image : Gleison Miranda , Funai
Enlarge Image
One of South America 's few remaining uncontacted indigenous tribes has been spotted and photographed on the border between Brazil and Peru .
The Brazilian government says it took the images to prove the tribe exists and help protect its land .
The pictures , taken from an aeroplane , show red- painted tribe members brandishing bows and arrows .
More than half the world 's 100 uncontacted tribes live in Brazil or Peru , Survival International says .
Stephen Corry , the director of the group - which supports tribal people around the world - said such tribes would " soon be made extinct " if their land was not protected .
' Monumental crime ' Survival International says that although this particular group is increasing in number , others in the area are at risk from illegal logging .
What do the pictures tell us ?
In pictures : Brazil tribe
The photos were taken during several flights over one of the most remote parts of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil 's Acre region .
They show tribe members outside thatched huts , surrounded by the dense jungle , pointing bows and arrows up at the camera .
" We did the overflight to show their houses , to show they are there , to show they exist , " the group quoted Jose Carlos dos Reis Meirelles Junior , an official in the Brazilian government 's Indian affairs department , as saying .
" This is very important because there are some who doubt their existence . "
He described the threats to such tribes and their land as " a monumental crime against the natural world " and " further testimony to the complete irrationality with which we , the ' civilised ' ones , treat the world " .
Disease is also a risk , as members of tribal groups that have been contacted in the past have died of illnesses that they have no defence against , ranging from chicken pox to the common cold .

What are these ?
It 's amazing how ideas with no merit become popular merely because they sound good .
Most every politician and pundit says " energy independence " is a great idea .
Presidents have promised it for 35 years .
Would n't it be wonderful if we were self - sufficient , protected from high prices , supply disruptions and political machinations ?
The hitch is that even if the United States were energy independent , it would be protected from none of those things .
To think otherwise is to misunderstand basic economics and the global marketplace .
To be for " energy independence " is to be against trade .
But trade makes us as safe .
Crop destruction from this summer 's floods in the Midwest should remind us of the folly of depending only on ourselves .
Achieving " energy independence " would expose us to unnecessary risks -- such as storms that knock out oil refineries or droughts that create corn -- and ethanol -- shortages .
Trade also saves us money .
" We import energy for a reason , " says the Cato Institute 's energy expert , Jerry Taylor , " It 's cheaper than producing it here at home .
A governmental war on energy imports will , by definition , raise energy prices " .
Anyway , a " domestic energy only " policy ( call it " Drain America First " ? ) is a fantasy .
America 's demand for oil is too great for us to supply ourselves .
Electricity we could provide .
Not with windmills and solar panels -- they are not yet close to providing enough -- but coal and nuclear power could produce America 's electricity .
But cars need oil .
We do n't have nearly enough .
That does n't keep the presidential candidates from preying on the public 's economic ignorance .
" I have set before the American people an energy plan , the Lexington Project -- named for the town where Americans asserted their independence once before , " John McCain said .
" This nation will achieve strategic independence by 2025 " .
Barack Obama , promising to " set America on path to energy independence , " is upset that we send millions to other countries .
" They get our money because we need their oil " .
His concern that " they get our money " is echoed in commercials funded by Republican businessman T. Boone Pickens , who wants government subsidies for alternative energy .
He tries to scare us by saying , " $ 700 billion are leaving this country to foreign nations every year -- the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind . "
Do n't Obama and Pickens realize that we get something useful for that money ?
It 's not a " transfer " ; it 's a win - win transaction , like all voluntary trade .
Who cares if the sellers live in a foreign country ?
When two parties trade , each is better off -- or the exchange would never have been made .
We want the oil more than the money .
They want the money more than the oil .
They need us as much as we need them .
And Obama is wrong when he implies that America imports most of its oil from the Mideast .
Most of it comes from Canada and Mexico .
McCain and Obama talk constantly about how much they will " invest " -- with money taken from the taxpayers , of course -- to achieve energy independence .
" [ W ]e can provide loan guarantees and venture capital to those with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market , " Obama said .
What makes Obama think he 's qualified to pick the " best plans " ?
It 's the robust competition of the free market that reveals what 's best .
Obama 's program would preempt the only good method we have for learning which form of energy is best .
Has he learned nothing from the conceits of his predecessors ?
Jimmy Carter , saying that achieving energy independence was the " moral equivalent of war , " called for " the most massive peacetime commitment of funds ... to develop America 's own alternative " .
Then he wasted billions of our tax dollars on the utterly failed " synfuel " program .
McCain promises a $ 300 - million prize to whoever develops a battery for an electric car .
But the free market already provides plenty of incentive to invent a better battery .
As George Mason University economist Donald Boudreaux writes , " Anyone who develops such a device will earn profits dwarfing $ 300 million simply by selling it on the market .
There 's absolutely no need for any such taxpayer - funded prize " .
Central energy planning and government - funded prizes are economic idiocy .
( CNN ) --
A charter plane crashed while attempting to land at a regional airport in southern Minnesota on Thursday morning , killing all eight people aboard , authorities said .
A plane 's wreckage lies in a field Thursday near Degner Regional Airport in Owatonna , Minnesota .
One of the eight died after being taken to a hospital .
Brad Cole , the president of the company that owned the plane , said the two crew members who died were pilots Clark Keefer and Dan D'Ambrosio , both of Pennsylvania .
The company was still trying to confirm the identities of the six passengers , Cole said .
The Raytheon Hawker 800 left Atlantic City , New Jersey , on Thursday morning and crashed off runway 30 at Owatonna , said Elizabeth Cory , spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration .
CNN affiliate KARE reported that the corporate jet was trying to land in a thunderstorm .
The plane 's passengers were customers of Owatonna architectural glass manufacturer Viracon , KARE reported .
No Viracon employees were aboard , it said .
KARE said the Hawker 's pilot radioed the airport at 9:44 a.m. to say the plane was approaching for a landing .
Radar detected it at 1,600 feet at the time of the call .
The crash apparently happened shortly after that , KARE reported .
Cameron Smith , a mechanic at the airport , ran to the crash scene to find a long skid path and " shredded " debris , KARE reported .
" There was no fuselage .
There were just parts . "
Do n't Miss KARE : Local coverage of plane crash
A trail of wreckage extended 500 feet beyond the runway , KARE reported .
The plane was owned by charter firm East Coast Jets Inc. , according to KARE .
Minnesota saw strong thunderstorms and tornado warnings Thursday morning , but it was not known whether weather was a factor in the crash .
Owatonna is a city of about 22,000 people south of St. Paul .

Father - of - three branded a ' pervert ' - for photographing his own children in public park
When Gary Crutchley started taking pictures of his children playing on an inflatable slide he thought they would be happy reminders of a family day out .
But the innocent snaps of seven - year - old Cory , and Miles , five , led to him being called a ‘ pervert ’ .
The woman running the slide at Wolverhampton Show asked him what he was doing and other families waiting in the queue demanded that he stop .
Picture of innocence :
The photograph Gary Crutchley took of his sons Cory and Miles
One even accused him of photographing youngsters to put the pictures on the internet .
Mr Crutchley , 39 , who had taken pictures only of his own children , was so enraged that he found two policemen who confirmed he had done nothing wrong .
Yesterday he said : ‘ What is the world coming to when anybody seen with a camera is assumed to be doing things that they should not ?
‘ This parental paranoia is getting completely out of hand .
I was so shocked .
One of the police officers told me that it was just the way society is these days .
He agreed with me that it was madness . ’
Father - of - three Mr Crutchley , a consultant for a rubber manufacturer from Walsall , West Midlands , was with his wife Tracey and their sons when the pleasant Sunday afternoon out turned sour .
He said : ‘ The children wanted to go on an inflatable slide and I started taking photos of them having a good time .
Moments later the woman running the slide told me to stop .
‘ When I asked why , she told me I could not take pictures of other people ’s children .
I explained I was only interested in taking photos of my own children and pointed out that this was taking place in a public park .
‘ I showed her the photos I had taken to prove my point .
Then another woman joined in and said her child was also on the slide and did not want me taking pictures of the youngster .
All together now , smile : Gary and Tracey with Cory , left , and Miles
‘ I repeated that the only people being photographed were my own children .
She said I could be taking pictures of just any child to put on the internet and called me a pervert .
We immediately left the show . ’
Mrs Crutchley , 37 , a teaching support assistant and qualified nursery nurse , said : ‘ I was shocked by the reaction of those women .
' It is very sad when every man with a camera enjoying a Sunday afternoon out in the park with his children is automatically assumed to be a pervert . ’
The slide was run by Tracey Dukes , 35 , whose father Malcolm Gwinnett has an inflatables hire company .
Mr Gwinnett , 58 , a LibDem councillor in Wolverhampton , said : ‘ Our policy is to ask people taking photos whether they have children on the slide .
If they do , then that is fine .
‘ But on this occasion another customer took exception to what the man was doing and an argument developed between those two people that continued without any further involvement from staff on the slide . ’
Mathematicians have often been considered a little eccentric ; Charles Darwin once defined a mathematician as " a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which is n't there . "
Now , in the age of film , movie makers seem to go one step further : mathematicians appear to be disturbed at best , displaying a kind of neuroses through numbers .
Browse the Web for films about mathematicians , and you will find a collection of protagonists plagued by mental instability .
In film , it seems that maths signals madness .
Intrigued as to why this should be , I decided to embark on an experiment ; I resolved to watch as many films about maths as I could persuade my local DVD store to part with , in the hope of unravelling this conundrum ...
23
Not your average mathematician .
Jim Carrey in 23 .
Image © New Line Cinema , all rights reserved .
My first film , 23 , claimed to be a thriller .
To set the scene , the opening credits list various miscellanea about the number 23 , from the number of chromosomes in a haploid cell to Hitler 's birthday .
These factoids supposedly provide evidence for a sinister association between 23 and the forces of darkness .
The plot seemed promising : a man ( Jim Carrey ) is given a book entitled — yes , you 've guessed it — 23 , a memoir of a man obsessed by a number .
Carrey 's character , believing the story is about his own life , soon finds evidence of 23's dark work everywhere .
I was particularly enchanted by the observation that pink ( due to the addition of its component red and white wave - lengths ) is in fact a satanic colour .
Other examples of numerical naughtiness were more disappointing : for example , Carrey 's character is riddled with dread at discovering his wife has 23 shoes .
Perhaps many husbands would find that quantity of footwear similarly terrifying , but I could n't help feeling we were hardly pushing the horror - envelope .
Carrey 's long - suffering wife ( Virginia Madsen ) becomes increasingly concerned with her man 's obsessive behaviour as he points out instances of numerical demonism , leaving the audience to wonder whether we are viewing some dark power , or mental breakdown .
The trouble with the film was that neither were convincing .
Yet , despite its disappointing execution , 23 poses an interesting question — do some numbers have a meaningful association with some kind of supernatural presence ?
Wikipedia assures me that there is a genuine belief in the world ( called the 23 Enigma ) that all numbers can be traced to 23 , and many cultures endow different numbers with specific associations : 666 ( the number of the beast ) , 7 ( considered lucky ) , 13 ( considered unlucky ) , 4 ( the number of death in China ) and 99 ( the number of eternity ) .
That numbers hold a power beyond human understanding can be seen as a blessing , not necessarily a curse .
St. Augustine of Hippo ( AD 354-430 ) once commented that " numbers are the universal language offered by the deity to humans as confirmation of the truth . "
Then again , a little later , he offered a somewhat more pessimistic view : " The good Christian should beware the mathematician and all those who make empty prophecies .
The danger already exists that the mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and to confine man in the bonds of hell . "
That a number or numerical system can become associated with any kind of consciousness at all is a fascinating concept and one that my next film exploited to the full .
Pi
Sean Gullette in Pi. Image © Artisan Entertainment , all rights reserved .
For a truly terrifying watch , Pi has earned its reputation as an avant - garde maths classic .
Max ( Sean Gullette ) is a number theorist who believes that everything in the world can be understood through numbers if they are only graphed and charted correctly .
Max 's trusty sidekick for his philosophical adventure is a homemade computer named Euclid .
Euclid decodes a pattern in the stock exchange ( supposedly an unpredictable system ) spewing forth a 216 - digit number before crashing , a point in the film that caused me almost painful empathy .
Predicting the outcome of financial systems stimulates the interest of stock market moguls , and the elusive 216 - digit number also attracts the Hasidic Jewish community , who claim a divine origin for it .
This juxtaposition between worldly ambition and spiritual questing is handled well , with both becoming equally terrifying : the idea of a universal pattern is ordinarily a reassuring one , but in Pi , the ordered world is far from comforting .
Max has a former mentor , Sol ( Mark Margolis ) , who also claims to have come across this 216 - digit number during his own research into Pi — this , Sol claims , directly led to a premature stroke and early retirement .
Undeterred , Max continues with his research , but appears to be spiralling into insanity .
Pursued by Hasidic mathematicians and Wall Street brokers alike , we follow Max 's effort to unravel the mysteries of a numerical system that appears to underwrite the world .
His deteriorating state of mind , genuinely unsettling to watch , is a clear and important theme to the film , supported by jerky black and white photography .
Pi achieves what 23 could not , that is , a plausible balance between madness and genuine esoteric activity as the source of its protagonists ' experiences .
If in a nerdish sort of mood , you can spot the odd mathematical error , suggesting that the focus ( and budget ) of the film was more arthouse than mathshouse — for example , Pi is incorrect at the ninth decimal place , and a golden rectangle is drawn wrongly ; yet I found myself able to forgive pretty much anything for the film 's undeniable quality .
Pi is not for the faint - hearted , ( or those for whom mathematical inaccuracies will irritate ) but it 's well worth watching .
Two films in , and so far numbers , in one way or another , have had a sinister hold over the mind of the heroes .
In the aftermath of all this gloom , I found myself hungering for some kind of light relief .
The movie world seems convinced that maths can be terrifying — but can it be romantic ?
Proof
Maths and romance ?
Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal in Proof .
Image © Miramax , all rights reserved .
The next film I reached for was Proof .
The cover looked promising , showing an image of a Merchant - Ivory - esque woman looking very intense , with a well - muscled man in the background .
Perfect .
Yet , despite my hopes , Proof is , yet again , a tale of maths haunted by madness .
The film tells the story of Catherine , ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) the daughter of a recently deceased mathematician ( Anthony Hopkins ) .
Catherine has sacrificed much of her own life to nurse her father through psychological illness .
Overshadowed by his genius and reputation , her own mathematical abilities , which formed the basis of her relationship with her father , are overlooked .
She herself is haunted by the possibility of her own mental health deteriorating , a fear compounded by the pain of bereavement .
Enter the handsome and sane ( if a little less gifted ) mathematician / love interest Hal ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , who is hungry to discover whether there are any unpublished theorems hiding in the dead professor 's office .
When he discovers a notebook with a mathematical proof of sublime perfection , his challenge is to discover whether Catherine or her father wrote it , and , harder still , how to prove authorship .
The performances are strong , bringing out an association between mental fragility ( be it grief or mental illness ) and brilliance , revealed through a fascination with maths .
The central theme of the film is engaging : problems in theorem and calculation find their parallel in reality , proving that maths imitates life no less than art does .
However , this is an idea that could have been pushed further .
There are a few one - line mathematical jokes , but no attempt to unravel what the illusive theorem is — to spell out the genius of it all might have necessitated either plagiarism or genuine mathematical brilliance on the part of the script - writers , but it seems a shame that , in an otherwise excellent film , the maths remains un - translated from its notebook .
A beautiful mind
Maths induces graphomania .
Russell Crowe in A beautiful mind .
Image © Imagine Entertainment , all rights reserved .
In contrast , A beautiful mind explores the maths as well as the life of mathematician John Nash ( Russell Crowe ) .
An iconic scene finds Nash and some mathematically minded friends in a bar , describing how game theory can help them pull .
To my mind , this is exactly the film - friendly PR that maths needs more of .
I was slightly less convinced about the mathematical art of pointing out shapes in stars to one 's love interest — surely that 's a universal compulsion after a few pints ?
I am certain that most of us , if thus sozzled , could pick out an elephant or two .
Using biographical material also enables
Nash 's character to achieve a greater depth than is possible for fictional film characters ; from his early years at Princeton , through years of mental health problems to his winning of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics , Nash 's academic triumphs and personal struggles make for compulsive viewing .
He faces schizophrenia with courage and is anchored to the world by his love for the people in it .
This depth and humanity makes it possible to identify with Nash , and perhaps makes for a more realistic portrayal of a mathematician .
Yet , the fact that A beautiful mind , is also the archetypal film about maths and mathematicians causes me to think that my initial theory is possibly right : mathematicians in film seem invariably disturbed , finding patterns in everything with no boundaries between reality and the alarmingly abstract world of numbers .
From the moment the first credits roll , you can almost predict the point at which one of the sane protagonists discovers that their numerically inclined love interest / colleague / mentor has been scrawling over the walls .
In better films , such as A beautiful mind , this graphomania is genuinely chilling , an uncontrolled exposition of a mind turned inwards , and of genius unravelling .
Less successfully , the random scribbling is reminiscent of low - budget horror films where it 's used as a short hand visual to signify demonic possession .
I wondered , therefore , whether any films about maths exist with a sane protagonist ?
Would it make for a good film , or does the continual insistence on a troubled genius betray a reluctance to engage with the nitty - gritty of more ordinary mathematics ?
Good Will Hunting
Matt Damon and Minnie Driver in Good Will Hunting .
Image © Miramax , all rights reserved .
To answer this question , I looked to Good Will Hunting to give me a happier ending .
Here , a young man ( Matt Damon ) with a brilliant mind has a penchant for self - sabotage .
He escapes his life of booze , friendship and fighting to creep about a maths department , there to decode cryptic equations left by the resident academic , Professor Lambeau ( Stellan Skarsgård ) .
This reversal of standard student behaviour illustrates the fact that all is not well with Will .
When Will 's violence causes a ruckus with the police , Lambeau offers him a choice : to learn maths and take therapy , or to go to prison .
Even for Will , this is something of a no - brainer .
Although Good Will Hunting deals with emotional trauma , maths , for once , is not to blame .
As the relationship between Will and his therapist turned mentor Sean ( Robin Williams ) develops , he discovers that people rather than numbers are the root of all evil .
We even see several sane mathematics professors having ordinary conversations about their subject .
Occasionally , they even give lectures that look vaguely realistic .
So far , so good .
Yet the film has a weakness , in that Will explores all manner of issues with Sean except the one he 's likely to be burdened with for the rest of his life : namely , the impact of living with his own genius .
And it is this discrepancy that sheds some insight into my enquiry .
With the exception of 23 , the lead mathematicians in film all seem remarkably gifted , and that comes with a heavy price .
Maths does not so much equate with madness , but it does , sometimes , associate with an intelligence that can be impossibly hard to cope with .
Max , Catherine , John and Will , unlike their less gifted colleagues and friends , are all tinged with genius .
This mathematical fluency brings revelations , and here , to some extent , numbers themselves appear to be to blame : they are portrayed in film as a maze of complex symbols too abstract for the everyday mind to bend round .
Only genius can hope to unravel the secrets of scribbled equations .
For a society fluent in symbolism ( from the toilet sign to the Freudian slip , we all seem to manage ) , this phobia of numerical signs deserves further attention .
Why should ability in maths be such a burden , and what secrets do our hapless protagonists discover ?
While the majority of human symbols encode human inventiveness ( a road sign , a trademark , a political moniker ) , numbers pose a far more expansive puzzle , and one that only a mind touched with brilliance can truly light upon : numbers are capable of coding nothing short of life , the universe and everything .
And to the film makers , perhaps the world just is n't meant to be understood .

Frame
A - frame is actually the skeleton on which a sofa is built .
The best brands of sofa beds make use of kiln - dried hardwood as it is super durable .
Sofa beds made of frames from pliable woods such as pine do not last .

Mattress

Placement
It is good to always be mindful of where you will place the seat .

Documents reveal PR push for Iraq war preceded intel findings Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 22 , 2008
Print This Email This
New documents from within the Bush administration and US intelligence community during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq reveal that the White House began assembling a case for war before it had compiled the intel that ostensibly formed the basis of that case .
A new report on the documents from George Washington University 's National Security Archive also presents compelling evidence that the Bush administration pressured the CIA and other intelligence agencies to tailor their reports to back - up Bush 's desire to invade .
The report suggests the bulk of this effort was run out of Vice President Dick Cheney 's office , backing up numerous other post - war examinations of the path to invasion that saw Cheney as the mastermind of the plan to oust Saddam Hussein .
The Archive published a July 2002 draft of a CIA " White Paper " on Iraq 's Weapons of Mass Destruction .
The draft was prepared months before a National Intelligence Estimate on Saddam 's regime , which Congress did not demand until September , although the final " White Paper " released in October purportedly summarized that very NIE .
In addition to the Archive 's newly obtained documents , Dr. John Prados , who compiled the report , examined previous investigations of pre-war intelligence manipulation such as the recently completed Senate Intelligence Committee " Phase II " report on administration officials ' pre-war rhetoric and books on the subject such as former White House spokesman Scott McClellan 's memoir .
He concluded , in essence , that the Bush administration cherry picked intelligence to justify an invasion , that Tony Blair 's British government was complicit in producing shaky intelligence on Saddam 's WMDs , that administration figures -- especially Cheney -- pressured the CIA to give them what they wanted , and that intelligence undercutting the case for war was ignored in favor of less reliable sources who backed administration beliefs .
 The Phase II report on Bush administration public statements , in conjunction with the SSCIs original July 2004 report on Iraqs alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction , indicates that political manipulation extended beyond the intelligence itself to affect investigation of the intelligence failures on Iraq as well as the Bush administrations use of that information .
 In conjunction with other recently declassified materials , the Phase II report shows that the Bush administration solicited intelligence then used to substantiate its public claims .
 A recently declassified draft of the CIAs October 2002 white paper on Iraqi WMD programs demonstrates that that paper long pre-dated the compilation of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraqi capabilities .
 The timing of the CIAs draft white paper coincides with a previously available draft of the British Governments white paper on Iraqi WMD , demonstrating that the Bush administration and the Tony Blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of Iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood .
 A comparison of the CIA draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against Iraq by inserting additional alarming claims , in the manner of an advocacy , or public relations document .
The draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained .
Similar comparison of the British white paper shows the same phenomenon at work .
 Declassified Pentagon documents demonstrate that the CIA white paper was modified in ways that conformed to the desires of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy and his office , in much the same way that British documents indicate that countrys white paper was changed to conform to the desires of the Blair government .
The CIA was under enormous pressure , which resulted in its production of a White Paper that did not conform to the facts , according to the report .
" Under the circumstances , it is difficult to avoid the impression that the CIA and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the Bush administration through a process of self - censorship , " Prados writes .
" That is the very essence of politicization in intelligence . "
He goes on to report that CIA reports had " the character of rhetoric " and did not reflect " the kind of approach characteristic of intelligence analysis . "
The Archive 's report backs up similar contentions that first came to light with release of the Downing Street memo in 2005 and have been reinforced in scores of books and investigative articles .
Most recently , investigative journalist Ron Suskind reported in his new book The Way of the World that the British government was secretly in contact before the invasion with the chief of Iraq 's intelligence services who told them unequivocally that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons stockpiles .
That revelation -- received in plenty of time to delay the invasion -- was ignored , Suskind wrote .
Prados reports on other sources the CIA had developed among scientists in Iraq and within Saddam 's foreign minister .
Information they provided was ignored in favor of what was later revealed to be untrue exaggerations passed along by Iraqi exiles .
The White Paper went through several drafts , Prados writes , and it is clear to see the administration 's influence in its preparation .
" The net impression is that the CIA white paper was rewritten to conform to administration preferences .
If so , U.S. intelligence a priori made itself a tool of a political effort , vitiating the intelligence function and confirming the presence of a politicized process , " he writes .
" The specific analytic failures on Iraq intelligence become much less significant in such a climate , especially in that they all yielded intelligence predictions of exactly the kind the Bush administration wanted to hear . "

Man Who Assisted in Burning Girlfriend ’s Ex-Lover Wins Appeal
A South Korean guy has won an appeal over his one - year jail conviction for assisting in the suicide of his girlfriend ’s ex-lover .
Last September , a couple were driving in their car in South Korea when they were stopped by the girl ’s ex-lover .
He had poured gasoline all over himself and threatened to kill himself if she did not get out of the car and talk to him .
The current boyfriend , a 30 year - old South Korean , tossed him a lighter , saying “ Go ahead and kill yourself ” , which the girl ’s ex-lover followed through with by setting himself on fire .
The current boyfriend was charged with assisting in a suicide and sentenced to one - year prison term for his part .
The Seoul appeal court reversed the initial ruling , stating that the defendant did not believe his girlfriend ’s ex-lover would actually kill himself .
The ruling was based on evidence that showed the girl ’s ex-lover had given a friend his cigarettes and lighter so they would not be damaged by the gasoline .
This showed the man really did n’t plan to kill himself at all .

Turns out Texas parents can opt out of having their children learn anything about evolution .
All they have to do is send the kids to science classes at “ virtual school ” through the
program offered by the charter school
in Houston .
Like lines from the old hymn “ The fight is o’er , the battle won , ” creationists have figured out a way to keep their kids away from all that monkey talk without further fights before the Texas Legislature .
The Texas Virtual Academy buys its curriculum from K12 Inc. , which was co-founded by former Education Secretary Bill Bennett ( remember him for his Book of Virtues ? ) .
And here ’s what K12 has to say about evolution :
How does K¹² teach Evolution ?
The concepts of evolution and creationism do not come up in grades K - 2 .
In later grades , we teach evolution as a theory broadly accepted in the scientific community as an organizing theory of biology .
We believe that a complete education includes understanding the basics of what this theory is about , even if one disagrees with it .
K¹² emphasizes that parents have every right to explain to their children why they do or do not accept the theory and what they believe instead , including the concept of creationism .
If parents are n't interested in any teachings surrounding the theory of evolution , they can skip these lessons .
( Emphasis ours . )
Yeah , just skip it , but still get state credit toward your graduation !
What makes it even better is that Texas Education Commissioner Robert Scott recently approved an extension of the areas of the state in which the Texas Virtual Academy can be offered .
It has grown from its beginnings here and in the Dallas - Fort Worth area to now include Corpus Christi , Waco , San Antonio and Austin .
Asked about this apparent state - approved gigantic loophole , a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman said she did n’t know about the program herself but would put out calls .
We ’ll update when we hear back from her .
Update : Debbie Ratcliffe , spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency , got back to us with this response :
Evolution is required to be taught as part of biology which is a high school level course and this charter school ( Southwest Schools ) only goes up to the eighth grade .
Parents can opt out of anything in the curriculum if they object to it .
… They would have to just tell their district they want to opt out ; they would n’t have to tell us … we would n’t have any numbers one way or the other about how many people do it .
But even if the child is pulled out of the class , they ’re still responsible for learning our curriculum standards and they could be tested on evolution because it is part of our 10th grade TAKS [ Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills ] test .
So that ’s something for parents to weigh if they do pull their child out .
I did look at the Southwest Schools website and it does mention teaching an element of evolution at the sixth grade level .
K12 is a national company so I think that FAQ you found is their nationwide response to that question and is n’t peculiar to Texas .
So this is a nationwide loophole ?
What a relief .

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , commenting on the Russia - Georgia conflict , has accused the United States of making a " serious blunder " in pursuing its interest in the Caucasus region .
He also said the US charge that Russia was committing aggression in Georgia was " not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity " .
" By declaring the Caucasus , a region that is thousands of miles from the American continent , a sphere of its ' national interest , ' the United States made a serious blunder , " Gorbachev said in an opinion piece to be published in the Washington Post on Tuesday .
BEIJING --
By now , if you ’ve paid attention at all , you will be up to speed on the story of Lopez Lomong , United States Olympic 1,500 - meter runner and opening - ceremony flag - bearer .
You have read the stories , have seen him march , white tam in place and smile wide as he and the horde of blue blazers behind him waved to George Bush and George waved back .
You heard NBC tell you why he was there .
His is a story like few others , a confluence of happenstance and significance seldom seen before in the Olympic movement .
For him , at age 23 , it is both simple and amazing .
Or , as he says in his quaint English : “ It is a dream makes true , right here . ”
Advertisement
For the rest of us , who have generally eaten well , felt safe and experienced total hopelessness only in sad movies , Lomong is a gift .
He lights up the room again and puts a Band - Aid on the cynicism .
If you are a writer , you want to tell his story , even if dozens have preceded you .
You want to tell it better , to grip the reader just in case your predecessors have n’t .
And then you sit in the audience on the morning of the opening ceremony and realize you need do nothing more than listen and take notes , because Lomong is telling it to you , for you , and better than ever before .
He is one of the “ Lost Boys of Sudan , ” one of a group of more than 3,000 who was taken from his home as a child in the midst of a war between guerrilla factions looking to train young males as soldiers .
He escaped to Kenya , where he was put into a refugee camp , then eventually rescued and taken to the United States and to a family in upstate New York through a United Nations - U.S. Embassy program .
Advertisement
That paragraph is a summary of what has been told before .
But before Friday morning , the details were never quite as available , or openly offered .
In a room of perhaps 100 reporters from all corners of the world , Lomong , huge eyes scanning the crowd in disbelief that he was where he was , went into stunning detail .
“ I was 6 years old .
I was the happiest kid in Sudan .
My parents were around .
We were always playing .
They never told me about what was going on around us . ”
And then , one Sunday , they went to church .
Advertisement
“ It was 8 a .m . Mass .
Just my dad and mom and me .
It was an open - air church .
The priest was praising God .
Then the soldiers came in . ”
Lomong said everyone was told to lie down and the soldiers took all the children away .
He said he was crying , they were all crying .
They were herded into a truck , boys and girls , and it was covered with a canvas top .
Eventually , the truck stopped ; they were blindfolded and marched single file into a room with no windows .
“ They took the blindfolds off and now there were only boys . ”
They stayed for three weeks , getting water twice a day and little else .
When they were given food , it was sandwiches with grain .
Three of his friends he called “ angels ” advised him not to eat the food , to merely pick out the bits of grain , because it had been combined with sand and the indigestible “ sand sandwiches ” would eventually be fatal .
Advertisement
“ Kids would eat them , then just be sitting there and go to sleep . ”
He escaped when older boys saw a hole in the fence and took him along .
“ There was no moon .
We could see the lights [ soldiers smoking ] and when they talked , we crawled .
When they stopped , we stayed still . ”
They got to the hole in the fence and got through as the soldiers chased .
One older boy took his right hand , another his left , and they ran .
For two days , then another .
Advertisement
“ We ran and there were trees and thorns .
My legs were a mess . ”
They hid him in a cave at night and brought him water on tree leaves .
At night , they made sure to sleep facing in the direction they were headed so they did n’t mistakenly backtrack into the pursuers .
“ Then we would get up again and run and run .
We did n’t know where we were going . ”
Unknowingly , they strayed into Kenya , where they were captured and put into a refugee camp .
Lomong stayed for 10 years .
He said the Kenyans did n’t care for them because , as little as it was , they were getting food from the U.N .
Advertisement
“ We would have to make it last , because the food only came once a month .
We would eat once a day , and only late at night , so it would stay with you to the next night .
During the day , we would play soccer to keep our minds off the hunger . ”
The rest of the story is oft told -- the essay that got him an interview , that led to his adoption at age 16 by the Rogers family in Tully , N.Y. , that led to a flight on an airplane bigger than he had ever seen , that led to his first - ever trip to McDonald’s .
“ They got me a chicken sandwich , and I did n’t eat it right away because I was looking at it .
They told me it was OK if I wanted to take it home .
In the camp , we had chicken twice a year , Christmas and Easter , and there was one little piece and we had 10 people , so we chopped it up and boiled it up in water and ate the soup .
If you got a little piece of chicken , it was Merry Christmas .
“ And here I was , with my own piece , and they were telling me I could take it home and there was more there . ”

The story moved happily from there , to Northern Arizona University , to the ranks of track and field elite , to American citizenship on July 6 , 2007 , and exactly one year afterward , to a spot on the U.S. team in the 1,500 meters .
And then to a Friday night march with a flag of stars and stripes , in front of a team of athletes who had the common sense and historical sensitivity to select him to lead them , in front of 91,000 in an Olympic stadium , and for millions more in front of their TV sets .
The story also has political ramifications , of course , because China has been taken to task repeatedly for perceived humanitarian violations in the Darfur region of Lomong ’s country , Sudan .
Lomong has signed on , along with as many as 75 other Olympic athletes , as part of a group called Team Darfur that seeks increased recognition of the problem .
He was asked about that Friday .
He struggled with the subject .
His storytelling had come much more easily .

That ’s OK .
We have a world full of politicians and diplomatic spinners and we have only one Lopez Lomong .
Too bad it is n’t the other way around .

Russian troops have begun handing back the town of Gori to the Georgians
The US defence chief has warned relations with Russia could be damaged for years if Moscow does not step back from " aggressive " actions in Georgia .
But Robert Gates said he did not see a need for US military force in Georgia .
His words came as Moscow said the idea of Georgian territorial integrity was an irrelevance .
Georgia 's breakaway regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - would never agree to being part of Georgia again , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said .
Earlier , Russia said it had begun handing back the town of Gori to Georgian police but insisted its troops would stay in the area .
See map of the region A Russian general said his forces were there to remove weaponry and help restore law and order in Gori , which lies some 15 km ( 10 miles ) from South Ossetia and on a key route to the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
The BBC's Natalia Antelava in Tbilisi said plans for a joint patrol force by the Georgian police and Russian military had failed .
Our correspondent said there were also reports of Russian military vehicles moving around the town of Senaki and the Georgian Black Sea port of Poti in western Georgia .
Russia has questioned what is in US aid deliveries to Georgia Moscow had earlier denied the reports but Russia 's deputy chief of staff , Gen Anatoly Nogovitsyn , told a televised news conference it was legitimate for Russians to be in Poti as part of intelligence - gathering operations .
Georgia 's Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said a convoy of more than 100 Russian tanks and other vehicles was moving from the major western town of Zugdidi deeper into Georgia , but officials were later quoted as saying the column had turned back .
Mr Gates said that despite concerns that Moscow may not be keen quickly to leave Georgian territory , the Russians did seem to be pulling back .
" They appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards Abkhazia and to the zone of conflict ... towards South Ossetia , " he said .
Gen James Cartwright , vice - chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , also said he believed Russia was " generally complying " with the terms of the truce , which called for its withdrawal from hostilities .
But , Mr Gates warned : " If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia , the US - Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come . "
' Lawlessness '
The Russians were trying to redress what they regarded as the many concessions forced on them after the break - up of the Soviet Union and were trying to " reassert their international status " , Mr Gates said .
Georgia was also being punished for its efforts to integrate with the West and in particular to join Nato , the defence secretary went on .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says Mr Gates 's address was the first effort by a senior member of the Bush administration to set out what the Americans believe is happening in Russia .
But while Mr Gates said Russia 's aggressive posture was not acceptable , our correspondent says , he took an unusual step for the Bush administration in ruling out the use of US force .
This is not a fight that America wants to have .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said he is " extremely concerned by the humanitarian impact " of the conflict on the civilian population .
He warned that aid agencies were not able to reach areas worst - affected by the conflict " due to ongoing insecurity , lawlessness and other constraints " .
He said " all fighting should end immediately and the current state of lawlessness should cease " .
Withdrawal Georgia attacked the rebel region of South Ossetia from Gori a week ago , prompting Russian retaliation .
The Georgians say it followed continuous provocation .

Advertisement Both sides agreed to a French - brokered ceasefire on Tuesday , amid international concern , but it has seemed fragile so far .
Earlier on Thursday in Moscow , Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would respect any decision South Ossetia and Abkhazia made about their future status .
His words followed warnings from the US that Russia had to respect Georgia 's territorial sovereignty and withdraw its forces .
Meanwhile , the US has sent its second shipment of humanitarian aid into Georgia .
Russia has questioned whether the deliveries contain only humanitarian supplies .

Brother of the fist : Peter Norman
By Dave Zirin
It 's 1968 , and 200 - metre gold medalist Tommie Smith stands next to bronze winner John Carlos , their raised black - gloved fists smashing the sky on the medal stand in Mexico City .
They were Trojan Horses of Rage — bringing the Black revolution into that citadel of propriety and hypocrisy : the Olympic Games .
When people see that image , their eyes are drawn like magnets toward Smith and Carlos , standing in black socks , their heads bowed in controlled concentration .
Less noticed is the silver medalist .
He is hardly mentioned in official retrospectives , and people assume him to be a Forrest Gump - type figure , just another of those unwitting witnesses to history who always end up in the back of famous frames .
Only the perceptive notice that this seemingly anonymous individual is wearing a rather large button emblazoned with the letters O - P - H - R , standing for the Olympic Project for Human Rights .

In a joint communiqué on the Environment and Climate Change , The Group of 8 ( G8 ) has agreed to work toward a goal of cutting the worldwide emissions that cause global warming by at least 50 percent by 2050 .
The G8 , which includes Canada , the United States , Japan , Russia , Britain , Italy , Germany and France , also said it is committed to the successful conclusion of United Nations - run negotiations designed to provide global emissions - reduction targets after the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012 .
A little short on substance , or “ teeth ” , the G8 statement indicated that developed and developing countries would need to make much sharper cuts in emissions to head off the most pressing effects of global warming .
Also , the agreement does not stipulate a baseline year to measure the extent of emissions reductions needed to reach the goal of 50 percent cuts by 2050 .
This is a departure from Kyoto and earlier agreements that had set 1990 as the baseline for future cuts .
A growing rift between rich and poor nations
A day after the release of the communiqué from the world ’s eight largest economies , another document was produced by the leaders of the fast - growing and less - developed countries , who were invited by their G8 counterparts .
The special session , as well as the document produced in that session merely showcased a widening rift over the best approach to slash greenhouse gases
The five main developing nations — China , India , Brazil , Mexico and South Africa , who together represent 42 percent of the world ’s population — issued a statement explaining their split with the G8 over its emissions - reduction goals .
They said they rejected the notion that all should share in the 50 - percent target , since it is wealthier countries that have created most of the environmental up to now .
“ It is essential that developed countries take the lead in achieving ambitious and absolute greenhouse gas emissions reductions , ” said the statement .
South Africa ’s minister of environmental affairs , Marthinus van Schalkwyk , issued a seething critique of the statement , calling it a concession to “ the lowest common denominator ” and expressing concern that it “ may , in effect , be a regression from what is required to make meaningful change .
In the New York Times , Andy Revkin writes :
“ In exchange for agreeing to the ’50 by 2050 ′ language , Mr. Bush got what he has sought as his price for joining an international accord .
And that is a statement from the rest of the Group of 8 that developing nations like China and India , which have not accepted mandatory caps on carbon emissions , must be a part of any climate change treaty . ”
Added to a growing list of the discontented on Wednesday , the head of the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) voiced concern for the soft targets in the document .
When asked by German radio if the agreement concluded Tuesday at the G8 summit in Japan was a success and would halt climate change , Achim Steiner replied , “ No way .
“ I think the G8 delivered what it could .
But in terms of what the world needs , what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has asked for and what is necessary in view of the Copenhagen meeting in 2009 the results fall short , ” he said in a statement .
White House claims victory
But despite criticism from rightly skeptical environmentalists , the Bush administration is claiming that the communiqué is a huge diplomatic success .
“ The G - 8 is giving a lot , but the G - 8 is also suggesting that others need to be part of that equation , ” said James L. Connaughton , Mr. Bush ’s top environmental adviser .
Connaughton is quite optimistic that more high - level diplomatic agreements could bring substantive cuts in carbon emissions .
He said that the strategy going forward would be to :
“ [ B ]uild on the success of a major agreement that we reached last year under the Montreal Protocol , which is the treaty that deals with ozone - depleting substances , where we got China and India and other developing countries to join with the developed countries to phase out what are called HCFCs …
That one agreement alone will reduce more greenhouse gases than the Kyoto Protocol . ”
Is President Bush placing another bet on “ Only history will be the judge of that ” ?
Perhaps .
But Yvo de Boer , who leads United Nations negotiations to forge a new climate change treaty , also challenged Bush ’s optimistic assessment of the meetings .
“ I do n’t find the outcome very significant , ” de Boer told The Associated Press in an interview in the Netherlands .
He said the target for reducing carbon emissions by 2050 mentioned no base line , was not legally binding and was open to vastly different interpretations .

Go Green With Rechargeable Batteries
Most electronics use some sort of battery such as standard alkaline batteries .
While these batteries appear to be cheap , they really are n’t in the long run .
Some electronics drain the batteries quicker than others ( especially the high powered gadgets we have in this day and age ) and depending on the quality of the battery , some will be sucked dry quicker than you can say “ crap ” .
This means that you ’ll probably have to be buying batteries again within a short period of time .
Not only does this add up in your wallet , these batteries will only pile up in some sort of landfill later on , which when you think about the billions of batteries leaking acid into the ground , that ca n’t be good for the Earth .
Regular batteries are for one use only and once the energy has been drained out , it ’s time to throw them out and get new ones .
This is definitely not environmentally friendly , and certainly not “ green ” .
Luckily there is a very economical and eco-friendly solution to this .
By using rechargeable batteries you not only save money , but the environment as well !
They are also not as expensive as you think .
For less than 30 dollars you can probably pick up a set of rechargeable batteries along with the charger .
This is a small investment as most of these batteries can be recharged about 1000 times .
I have personally not recharged a thousand times , but I have at least recharged mine 100 times and so far no problems .
Keep in mind that after so many charges , the battery ’s life span will begin to shorten , which is to be expected .
But this obviously only occurs in the later stages .
When compared to regular batteries , the life span is much , much longer .
I ’ve been using rechargeable batteries for some time now and have saved a great deal of money .
When my calculator , remote control , and game controller batteries run out I simply pop in a charged set of batteries that are waiting for me on the charger .
It ’s a shame that not everyone uses rechargeable batteries , as it ’s estimated that if everyone did so , it would prevent approximately 3 billion single use batteries from going to the landfill every year , which if you really think about it – is quite a few batteries .
According to statistics , the average household can save up to $ 200 by using rechargeable batteries .
So next time you ’re thinking about getting a pack of Energizers or Duracells to use in your $ 300 remote , think twice about it and instead get some batteries that you can use over and over again .
Not only will you be doing your part to go green , but you ’ll feel darn good about it too !

How can you not at least send me awarning that my account will be disabled ?
Ca n’t you at least give me the reason ?
I have multiple users and one of them might have commited a violation , but should n’t you disable their accounts first ?
Instead of disabling my account which affects a lot of websites ( most of them I do not own ) ?
Please send me a reply ASAP because I have a lot of websites that are losing revenues at the moment .

We disable any DreamHost accounts associated with such violations .
Disabling just a single sub-user does not negate the fact that we have a customer who does not wish to abide by the policies they agreed to .
This is especially true in cases such as yours where you have received multiple warnings but done nothing to curb the activity .

Guys , have a heart here .
As far as I know I have only been warned twice about the alleged , in both cases I have made the appropriate action of deleting them .
Another isolated case was one of the users using unlicensed VBulletin software which I immediately took down .
If you really ca n’t let these cases slip and restore my account , then AT LEAST GIVE ME CONTROL OF MY REGISTERED DOMAINS .
This is causing me a lot of frustration since a lot of my clients ’ websites are affected , and if you really do n’t want to host them then I should be allowed to transfer them elsewhere .
Please I need your response ASAP because this is really important .

Yes , I was warned Aug 30th and I complied immediaely by removing the said files .
Can you at least have my account retained without the web hosting ?
like the domain name registry , and temporarily the FTP accounts , and databases ?
( so I can facilitate transfering to a different webhost . )
I have slaved for years to develop some CMS softwares hosted on my account .
Please I ’m really begging you now .
Please .
It ’s not like I intentionally violated the TOS .
How about my remaining account balance ?
What can you do about that ?
Please have some sympathy .

Please take note of the following :
– You did not notify me by any means that you were going to disable my account .
You should have given me enough time to move all my websites / databases to a different host if you were planning to do so .
– All my sites have been down for almost 2 days now .
This would n’t have happened if you notified me beforehand .
– I have taken necessary action everytime a TOS violation warning has been sent to me .
– I still have 1 year left on my hosting plan since I prepayed for 2 years .
– I still have $ 90 left on my account .
what am I supposed to do with that ?

Please reenable all panel features that are necessary so I can download via FTP all MY hosted files on your servers .
This includes all FTP accounts , Email accounts , and databases .
That ’s going to be Gigabytes of data so I appreciate if we can do something about this ASAP .
It ’s bad enough that you did n’t give me any grace period that you we ’re going to disable my account , but now all the websites are going to be down for more than 3 days until I can set it up on a different webhost .
Please help me out here dreamhost .
This has been a very frustrating weekend as I have to discuss with all my clients why their websites are down and why I am going to have to change hosts without any prior notice .
For the record I have taken necessary action everytime I was warned about a TOS violation .
I do not know why my account was disabled without warning because no recent notice was given to me about any TOS violation .
Assuming there was another violation , I would understand if you told me that I should host my sites elsewhere ( but that ’s not what happened . )
As a paying customer since 2004 I think I deserve better treatment than this .
Please help me .

As I ’ve already told you , we cannot provide backups for accounts closed for Terms of Service violations .
Your account was the source of such violations on multiple occasions , and you were previously warned on August 30th that any further such violations would result in the closure of your account .
It is your responsibility to ensure that those you give access to your account are using it in a legal manner and according to the Terms you agreed to when signing up .
At this point all we can assist you with is transferring your domain registrations .

As I ’ve told you I have acted on the two ( 2 ) warnings you gave me the soonest possible , and you still have n’t told me what the latest violation was .
( You can check my support message history for your said “ multiple ” warnings )
Honestly I do n’t care anymore if how you treated me was unfair or unjust .
I just want my client ’s files / databases back .
Just please let us have our files back .

While they may have no intention of ever signing up for the service , Windows users are finding an unexpected addition to their Control Panels .
A link for " MobileMe Preferences " has begun appearing at the bottom of the Control Panel screens of those who have installed the latest Apple iTunes software -- according to one user , without any notification at all .
The MobileMe preference panel has also been reported to be showing up in Windows XP as well .
Advertisement
MobileMe does feature Vista compatibility , and the most recent update to iTunes , version 7.7 , added functionality necessary for iTunes to work with the service -- although it is not necessary to sync information .
It is through iTunes 7.7 where Apple added the MobileMe functionality to Windows computers .
The tutorial for setting up MobileMe on a PC confirms this .
As Step 1 clearly reads , " Download and install the latest version of iTunes .
iTunes includes the software required to set up MobileMe on your PC . "
Some may take issue with this :
Apple never explicitly said that MobileMe software would come as part of the new version of the software .
However , Apple distributing software like this is nothing new .
For example with QuickTime , the company has used its player software to also deliver its iTunes music service , which some users have found to be intrusive .
And last March , Apple used iTunes ' Software Update service for Windows as a way of pushing its Safari browser .
Other companies have adopted similar approaches in an effort to promote a new product on the back of an already established one .
Users have not yet revealed whether they 've discovered a method to remove the MobileMe icon without uninstalling iTunes 7.7 altogether .
After a full week of operation , the Large Hadron Collider has yet to swallow the world , leaving humanity free to concentrate on its rather geeky name .
Unimportant , you say ?
Well , people who were excited when physicists flipped the LHC 's switch might be less enthusiastic if , a year or two down the line , nobody 's actually found Higgs bosons or sparticles or gluinos or other assorted dawn - of - the - universe dust bunnies .
Heck , even if scientists do confirm the existence of other universes or the Big Bang 's details , there 's no guarantee that the public will consider it a satisfactory return on their $ 8 billion investment .
An 18 - mile track and 27 tons of magnets are a great toy , but the public is a fickle child .
That 's where branding – or , if you prefer , framing – comes in .
A year ago to the day , Wired Science called for the Large Hadron Collider to be renamed .
" It 's an atom smasher .
A giant atom smasher , " I wrote at the time .
" Smash stuff together and see what happens – that 's eternal !
We dig that , we spent much of our childhoods doing that . "
The Royal Society of Chemistry feels the same way , more or less :
Last week they said the LHC 's name " fails to reflect the drama of its mission , or the inspiration it should be conveying to the wider public , " and sponsored an LHC renaming contest that ended today .
The winning entry , submitted by Rhode Island resident Aaron Borges , was " Halo . "
No offense to Aaron , but I just can't get excited about this :
Beyond the fact that Microsoft probably owns the word by now , it 's a little too cute .
Wired Science is therefore proud to announce our own Large Hadron Collider Renaming Contest .
Unlike the Royal Society of Chemistry , we can't offer a £ 500 prize – so long , Lehman Brothers !
– but we will submit the winning entry to the European Organization for Nuclear Research , operators of the LHC .
And the best part of a new name :
You wo n't ever Google " Large Hardon Collider " by accident .
Submit your suggestions below , and vote away !
The winner will be announced on September 24 .

Boehner Golfing , McCain Absent During GOP Revolt
During the ongoing saga of the House 's " Phantom Session , " two items have caught Capitol Briefing 's eye :
Item 1 : On Monday , John McCain joined the party by declaring " Congress should come back into session , " for an energy vote .
" I am willing to come back off the campaign trail , " he said .
Item 2 : On Tuesday , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) issued a release commending McCain for his call , trashing Barack Obama and adding : " While Democrats left town for a month - long break , House Republicans have stayed behind and continued to demand a vote on the American Energy Act , which will help lower energy prices and liberate America from its dependence on foreign oil . "
Boehner was around for the start of the fake House session Friday but then left town and has n't been back since .
Even former Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) showed up today to rally with his GOP comrades , but the current party leader was nowhere to be seen .
What 's Boehner been up to ?
His office says he 's been in Ohio raising money for his political action committee , the Freedom Project , and that he should be back in D.C. later this week .
He 's also doing 18 events in August for GOP candidates across the country .
But Boehner also has found time to squeeze in a couple rounds of golf .
Scores reported by Boehner himself to a United States Golf Association site show that he posted an 85 sometime this week at his home course , Wetherington Golf & Country Club in West Chester , Ohio .
Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said he was n't exactly sure of the details of Boehner 's 18 holes , but that he felt confident that " if he did play at home , it was over the weekend . "
And The Sleuth passes along a tip that Boehner was spotted yesterday at the lovely Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin , Ohio .
Muirfield was designed by Jack Nicklaus and is the home of the Golden Bear 's annual memorial tournament .
Here 's a nice shot of Boehner and Nicklaus together at the 2005 tournament .
It turns out Boehner was at Muirfield for his annual Freedom Project fundraiser / golf tournament , and Steel said " cancelling it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars for Republican candidates across the country . "
Boehner played at the tournament too -- while his House GOP compatriots were holding the fort on the House floor -- though Steel said Boehner has generally cut down on golf this year because of back trouble .
The stats bear that out , as Boehner 's scores , assuming he reports them all , show that he 's only played a few times this year .
As for McCain , it would be a big deal indeed if Congress came back into session for an energy vote and the Arizonan actually showed up .
This Friday will mark the four - month anniversary of the last time McCain actually cast a vote in the Senate .
Since April 8 , he 's missed 103 consecutive floor votes , including several on energy - related issues .
That 's a remarkable streak , even for a presidential candidate .
McCain is like the anti-Cal Ripken .
Khalid Shahenshah , who was the former Pakistan prime minister 's security chief at the time of her assassination , was killed in a drive - by shooting as he left his house in the southern port city of Karachi on Tuesday , police said .
With the holidays right around the corner , it is now time to start thinking about how we will fund them .
Not only do we have to think about buying gifts for family and friends , but also food and drinks for the celebrations .
And do n’t forget about the festive decorations and holiday attire either .
These things can really add up , especially if you do n’t plan for them ahead of time .
So here are some of the best ways to start building up your holiday nest egg now .
Budgeting
This is the most important part of being properly prepared for the holidays .
If you do n’t have a budget already set in mind , it gets extremely easy to spend money like it ’s water .
None of us want to do that , and have to deal with the ramifications after the fun holiday season is over !
Setting a realistic budget is key .
So go through your finances with a fine tooth comb when you have your budget meeting .
This is when you will see how much wiggle room you have to start saving a little bit of money now to set aside for the holidays .
My spouse and I just talked about this very topic a few weeks ago and decided what budget we are comfortable with for the holidays .
Our budget consists of :
$ 125 family gift
$ 40 for each child ( we have 5 kids , so that equals $ 200 )
$ 25 for each family child gift swap ( this is multiplied by 5 again to equal $ 125 )
$ 50 for each adult couple towards a charity
$ 10 for each stocking ( since we have the kids for Christmas this year , we had to include this into our budget )
$ 50 each for my spouse and myself ( although we do n’t usually spend this much , if anything )
$ 150 for our food and drink contributions for both holidays
Total amount budgeted : $ 800
While that might not seem like a lot of money for a family of 7 , it can really hurt our budget if we do n’t plan ahead .
I really like using Personal Capital to see exactly where all of our money is located .
We check it every week when we have our budget meeting and then discuss if , and where , we can move money around to serve our goals better .
This is an awesome tool to have in your arsenal !
Side Hustles
One of the best ways I have found to bring in a little extra money is through side hustles .
Now , as some of you already know , my bread and butter is a multitude of different regular side hustles .
But , there are times that I take on additional short term side hustles to bring in extra cash for a specific goal .
The holidays just happens to be one of them .
Some great side hustles to try are :
This season , I have just signed on for two new side hustles that should be fairly busy during the fall .
One is as an organizer and the other is doing in home catering and cooking classes .
I am pretty excited about these two new side hustles and to see how much they help us get towards our holiday goal faster .
Savings Apps
Adding in side hustles to increase your income and throw that extra money towards your holiday budget is just one way to start saving now .
Another great way is to connect with a few different savings apps to help you along your journey .
I , personally , use quite a few of them .
This is because they are all structured a little bit differently and do different things .
Digit is a great savings app that will help you save money a little bit at a time .
The app analyzes your bank account every day and moves small amounts of money into your Digit account .
You can set up a bucket specifically for the holidays so you can see how much you have .
You can also put in your own deposits as you bring in extra side hustle money .
So this app makes it pretty easy to track your progress , and hopefully , get to your holiday budget goal faster .
I also use shopping extensions / apps on my computer and phone that help me get small amounts of money .
The three I use all the time are Rakuten Ebates , Ibotta , and Honey .
All of these apps will reward you for your regular shopping by putting money into an account on their app .
Once you have a certain amount you can cash it out for gift cards ( can anyone say Amazon ? ) or cash via PayPal .
And to boost this even further , I have been using Receipt Hog for a while now , and have had great results .
Receipt
Hog gives me coins for uploading my receipts which then gets cashed out into an Amazon gift card or cash .
Get Upside gives me money back for my gas receipts ( in some places it works with grocery stores also , just not here yet ) , which I can then use for the same options as Receipt Hog .
All of these apps have really helped us put a decent dent in the amount of money we need for our holiday nest egg .
Holiday Nest Egg
Overall , there are so many different ways you can begin preparing for the holidays now .
The biggest question is how much do you plan to spend , so that you know where to start your budgeting .
Once you have the answer to that , adding in side hustles and savings apps will help you get to your holiday nest egg goal faster .
Since there are only a couple of months left now before the holiday season begins , there is no time like the present to get started .
What are some of the best ways you have found to start building up your holiday nest egg ?
From the DOT : Nearly 10 Billion Fewer Miles Driven in May 2008 than May 2007 Seven - Month Decline in Travel Reflected in Highway Trust Fund
Secretary Peters said that Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer vehicle - miles traveled ( VMT ) in May 2008 than in May 2007 , according to the Federal Highway Administration data .
This is the largest drop in VMT for any May ... and is the third - largest monthly drop in the 66 years such data have been recorded .
Three of the largest single - month declines - each topping 9 billion miles - have occurred since December .
VMT on all public roads for May 2008 fell 3.7 percent as compared with May 2007 travel , the Secretary added , marking a decline of 29.8 billion miles traveled in the first five months of 2008 than the same period a year earlier .
This continues a seven - month trend that amounts to 40.5 billion fewer miles traveled between November 2007 and May 2008 than the same period a year before , she said .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The oil company BP , known for thorough statistical analysis of energy markets , estimates that countries with subsidies accounted for 96 percent of the world ’s increase in oil use last year — growth that has helped drive prices to record levels .
...
China raised gasoline and diesel prices on June 21 , though still keeping them below world levels .
World oil prices plunged more than $ 4 a barrel within minutes on the expectation that Chinese demand would slow .
...
Indonesia spends more on fuel subsidies , $ 20 billion this year , than any country except China .
Some economists estimate that fuel use in Indonesia would fall by as much as a fifth if the government were to eliminate subsidies entirely .
...
Malaysia ’s government incited public anger on June 4 when it raised gasoline prices by 40 percent .
...
Before adjusting the prices , Malaysia was spending 7.5 percent of its entire economic output on fuel subsidies , a greater share than any other nation .
Indonesia follows with 4 percent .
This graph shows the the moving 12 month total for vehicle miles driven .
The miles driven ( on a rolling 12 month basis ) is just starting to decrease - similar to what happened during the oil crisis of the ' 70s .
And from the NY Times : Fuel Subsidies Overseas Take a Toll on U.S. Further reductions in these subsidies would reduce demand , and lower world oil prices .
Reading , writing and . . . global warming ?
A Silicon Valley lawmaker is gaining momentum with a bill that would require “ climate change ” to be among the science topics that all California public school students are taught .
The measure , by state Sen .
Joe Simitian , D - Palo Alto , also would mandate that future science textbooks approved for California public schools include climate change .
“ You ca n’t have a science curriculum that is relevant and current if it does n’t deal with the science behind climate change , ” Simitian said .
“ This is a phenomenon of global importance and our kids ought to understand the science behind that phenomenon . ”
The state Senate approved the bill , SB 908 , Jan. 30 by a 26 - 13 vote .
It heads now to the state Assembly .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has taken numerous actions to reduce global warming , but he has yet to weigh in on Simitian ’s bill .
Other Republicans in the Capitol , however , are not happy about the proposal .
Some say the science on global warming is n’t clear , while others worry the bill would inject environmental propaganda into classrooms .
“ I find it disturbing that this mandate to teach this theory is not accompanied by a requirement that the discussion be science - based and include a critical analysis of all sides of the subject , ” said Sen .
Tom McClintock , R - Thousand Oaks , during the Senate debate .
Only two Republicans voted for the bill , Sen. Abel Maldonado , R - San Luis Obispo , and Sen. Tom Harman , R - Costa Mesa .
Maldonado ’s district includes Los Gatos , Morgan Hill , parts of San Jose , Scotts Valley , Watsonville and Monterey .
Harman represents Orange County .
All 13 of the no votes were from Republicans .
One of the opponents , Sen. Jeff Denham , R - Modesto , said he wants guarantees that the views of global warming skeptics will be taught .
“ Some would n’t view them as skeptics .
Some would view them as the right side of the issue , ” said Denham , an Atwater almond farmer who also runs a plastics recycling business .
“ We do n’t have complete factual information yet , ” Denham said .
“ From what I have seen the Earth has heated and cooled on its own for centuries .
I do n’t know that there ’s anything that is a direct cause of that right now , but we can do a better job of cleaning up our planet . ”
Simitian noted that his bill would n’t dictate what to teach or in what grades , but rather would require the state Board of Education and state Department of Education to decide both .
Although global warming is mentioned in high school classes about weather , it is currently not required to be covered in all textbooks , said the head of the California Science Teachers Association .
“ This is a great idea .
I do n’t think there ’s any reason to talk about politics , ” said Christine Bertrand , the group ’s executive director .
“ There ’s no argument that there is climate change .
The argument is how much is caused by the activities of mankind . ”
Bertrand said teachers would have plenty to discuss : rising levels of carbon dioxide , how temperatures are measured globally , and what is known and not known about global warming .
Meanwhile , the 10 hottest years – ranked by global surface temperature – since 1880 all have occurred since 1995 , according to the National Climatic Data Center , a federal agency in North Carolina .
In 2005 , America ’s most prestigious scientific body , the National Academy of Sciences , issued a statement with the headline “ Climate change is real . ”
It was signed by the national scientific academies of Japan , Britain , Canada , China , Germany , Italy , France , Russia , India and Brazil .
Citing direct measurements of air and oceans , along with melting glaciers , it noted :
“ There is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring .
. . .
It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities .
This warming has already led to changes in the Earth ’s climate . ”

Group targets liberal donors
In a mirror - image of a threat from a liberal group to publicize and raise legal problems for conservative donors , a conservative group has mailed a warning letter to what appear to be the backers of an array of liberal causes .
The letter from Americans for Limited Government says :
As a donor to one or more of these organizations and efforts , you have been able to engage in these activities without notice , operating in relative obscurity .
I am writing to inform you that this will no longer
be the case .
Your name has been put in our database .
We are monitoring all reports of a wide variety of leftist organizations .
As your name appears in subsequent reports , it is our intent to publicize your involvement in your local community .
Should any of these organizations be found to be engaged in illegal or questionable activity , it is our intent to publicize your involvement with those activities .
You should know that instances of coordinated voter fraud are surfacing all across America and investigations into possible criminal coordination are underway .
The letter is signed by the group 's chairman , Howard Rich , a publicity - shy conservative donor who frames the threat as personal retribution for the ( occasional ) negative publicity he himself has received :
As someone who has been put through that abuse over the years , I can tell you from first - hand experience that it is not fun and not something to take lightly .
I have supported groups and efforts that I believe will push back against the radical agenda of the Left .
And , I have paid the price for it , in attacks , slurs and threats .
The president of Americans for Limited Government , Bill Wilson , said he 'd sent out more than 11,000 copies of the letter and legal memo ( .pdf ) to " donors to left - wing 527s and organizations of that type .
Anyone on the liberal , left - wing side of the line . "
" We 've looked at it as fair warning .
A number of these groups have had no problem stepping over the line with the FEC in the past , " said Wilson .
" The people funding them should be aware of what 's going on . "
He said it was n't a threat to the donors as much as a call on them to " exercise some restraint over these groups ' activities . "
UPDATE : Tom Matzzie , head of the liberal group , Accountable America , that began this tit - for - tat by targeting conservative donors , " thanks " Rich 's group for the legal memo , which he says he 'll use to warn conservative donors .
Full letter after the jump .
Dear [ redacted ] ,
Recently a new left - wing organization announced that it would be targeting donors to conservative , free - market organizations .
The major press announcement stated that the organization intended to engage in such activities as " public exposure , " having " watchdog groups digging through the lives " of these individuals , and " possible legal trouble . "
As someone who has been put through that abuse over the years , I can tell you from first - hand experience that it is not fun and not something to take lightly .
I have supported groups and efforts that I believe will push back against the radical agenda of the Left .
And , I have paid the price for it , in attacks , slurs and threats .
As a donor to one or more of these organizations and efforts , you have been able to engage in these activities without notice , operating in relative obscurity .
I am writing to inform you that this will no longer
be the case .
Your name has been put in our database .

Should any of these organizations be found to be engaged in illegal or questionable activity , it is our intent to publicize your involvement with those activities .
You should know that instances of coordinated voter fraud are surfacing all across America and investigations into possible criminal coordination are underway .
For your review , I have enclosed a memorandum from our legal counsel .

It appears Russia is wasting little time responding to the neocon provocation of declaring its intention of installing missiles at Redzikowo , on Poland ’s Baltic coast .
Russia has dispatched the aircraft carrier at Admiral Kuznetsov to the Syrian port of Tartus .
Admiral Kuznetsov , along with Russia ’s biggest missile cruiser Moskva and at least four nuclear submarines , left Murmansk on the Barents Sea on August 18 , according to DEBKAfile .
Russia plans to install Iskandar missiles in Syria and its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad .
On August 21 , at the Black Sea port of Sochi , Syrian president Bashar Assad told the media he is considering a Russian request to deploy missiles in his country .
The Arabic language newspaper , Asharq Al - Awsat , reported Bashar as saying he hopes to see Moscow cease its cooperation with NATO - allied states .
“ He is quoted as saying that Israeli arms sales to the Georgian army should prompt the Kremlin to strengthen the military alliance between Russia and Syria , ” reports the Israeli news site , YNet News .
Bashar is scheduled to meet with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev .
According to the BBC , fast track military and technical co-operation are at the top of the agenda .
It should be noted that prior to Russia ’s defense of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and the signing of the Polish missile deal , Moscow promised the U.S. it would not provide Iran and Syria with advanced military technology .
“ I want to voice support for Russia over the situation around Abkhazia and South Ossetia , ” Assad told Itar - Tass .
“ We understand the essence of the Russian position and consider its military reaction a response to provocation by the Georgian side . ”
Assad also said “ Syria was and is striving to develop strategic relations with Russia , in the interests of security in the whole world , ” an obvious reference to the neocon plan to confront Syria , Iran , and Russia .
Russia plans to install Iskandar surface missiles in Syria and its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad , sources at DEBKAfile report .
As widely reported over last weekend , Russian Baltic and Middle East warships , submarines and long - range bombers may be armed with nuclear warheads .
“ One plan on the table in Moscow , DEBKA file ’s sources report , is the establishment of big Russian military , naval and air bases in Syria and the release of advanced weapons systems withheld until now to Iran ( the S - 300 air - missile defense system ) and Syria ( the nuclear - capable 200 km- range Iskandar surface missile ) . ”
“ We have brought Syria to this situation , ” Israel Likud MK Yuval Steinitz told Israel Radio on Thursday .
“ We must freeze talks with Syria until it stops calling on Moscow to arm Israel ’s enemies , and until [ Damascus itself ] stops transferring arms to Hizbullah . ”
Several months ago , Israel and Syria announced they would resume peace talks .
Russia ’s move is at least in part a response to Israel ’s arming and training of the Georgian military .
“ Israel armed the Georgian army , ” Russian Deputy Chief of General Staff Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn told a Moscow press conference last week .
Jerusalem provided Tblisi with “ eight types of military vehicles , explosives , landmines and special explosives for the clearing minefields . ”
Georgia ’s Deputy Defense Minister Batu Kutelia previously said that “ Georgian corporals and sergeants train with Germans , alpine units and the navy work with French instructors , and special operations and urban warfare troops are taught by Israelis , ” Noah Shachtman reported for Wired on August 18 .
Earlier this year , Russia shot down a number of Georgian spy drones , specifically Hermes 450 reconnaissance planes manufactured by Israel ’s Elbit Systems .
As reported by Infowars and Prison Planet , Georgia ’s defense minister , Davit Kezerashvili , is a former Israeli who is fluent in Hebrew .
Kezerashvili contributed to military cooperation between Israel and Georgia .
“ Israel ’s defense industries managed to sell to Georgia [ drones ] , automatic turrets for armored vehicles , antiaircraft systems , communication systems , shells and rockets , ” former Israel internal security minister Roni Milo told Ynetnews .
Moreover , “ Israel has reportedly helped upgrade Soviet - designed Su-25 ground attack jets assembled in Georgia .
And former Israeli generals serve as advisers to the Georgian military , ” according to the Jewish Week .
On Wednesday , Bush praised Georgia ’s NED engineered “ Rose Revolution ” while addressing a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Orlando , Florida , the Washington Post reported .
NED ’s installation of Mikheil Saakashvili was “ one of the most inspiring chapters in history , ” according to Bush .
“ Georgia stood for freedom around the world , ” he said .
“ Now the world must stand for freedom in Georgia . ”
Bush ’s “ freedom in Georgia , ” that is to say the imposition of a client state micromanaged by the IMF and World Bank , will become less tenable now that Russia “ plans to establish a long - term presence inside Georgia and one of its breakaway republics , ” as the Chicago Tribune reports .
“ If implemented , the plan would effectively put under Russian control the border between Georgia and South Ossetia , which is seeking independence , as well as a small chunk of Georgia proper . ”
Obviously , with the Russian presence in Georgia and its renewed military relationship with Syria , the neocon plan to confront Iran and encircle Russia has encountered a speed bump .
It remains to be seen how the Bush neocons , quickly approaching the apogee of their power , will react to Russia ’s latest move .

According to Channel 2's exit poll , Livni won 48 % of the vote , while Mofaz won 37 % .
Avi Dichter and Meir Sheetrit were tied at 7 % each .
According to Channel 10 , Livni won 49 % of the vote and Mofaz garnered 37 % .
Sheetrit and Dichter were tied at 7 % in this poll as well .
Meanwhile , Channel 1 predicted that Livni won 47 % of the vote , compared to Mofaz 's 37 %
As of 1:00 am 4,992 votes have been counted out of a total of 40,000 – awarding Livni 57.9 % of the vote , Mofaz with 28.6 % , Sheetrit with 8.2 % and Dichter with 5.3 % .
Exit polls : Big win for Livni
Throughout the campaign , Livni aimed to convince Kadima voters that she will bring the party back to former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's glory days .
She repeatedly stressed her clean , uncorrupted image , noting that " I 've been conducting myself differently throughout my political life , not in order to say I 'm different , but rather , to prove that it is possible to do it differently . "
Livni will now replace Ehud Olmert as Kadima chairman and will have the opportunity to form a government .
Should she be able to secure a coalition , Livni will become Israel 's first female prime minister since Golda Meir , who led the country in the 1970s .
Livni supporters ecstatic ( Photo : AP )
Meanwhile , Mofaz 's activists were stunned by the exit polls .
" I 'm shocked .
This contradicts everything I thought , " one of them said .
A female activist added : " Perhaps there is still some hope .
Maybe the actual results will be the oppositeand Shaul Mofaz will become the next prime minister .
We believe in him . "
Elsewhere , Dichter 's camp issued a statement in response to the exit polls : " This is Minister Dichter 's first but certainly not last race .
Overall we 're quite satisfied with the poll results and are waiting for the actual results . "
Tense day
The day was marred by reports of irregularities and mayhem .
The Central Elections Committee disqualified the polling station in Rahat after a man entered the site and threw all the ballots out the window .
Irregularities were also reported in other polling stations .
Big winner – Livni earlier in the day ( Photo : Reuters )
Wednesday evening , following a tense day , Kadima 's Central Elections Committee approved Livni 's request to extend voting hours to 10:30 pm , instead of 10 pm , as result of " congestion at polling stations " nationwide .
Earlier in the day , Livni associates expressed deep concern over the low voter turnout rate reported across the country .
Voting hours were initially extended to 11 pm in wake of Livni 's request , but the decision was changed following an appeal submitted by Mofaz 's camp .
Mofaz was hoping for a low turnout rate in order to capitalize on his camp 's superior organizational abilities .
However , it now appears Livni was able to bring her supporters to the polling stations and score a huge victory .
Well it ’s official .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
The Taliban claimed responsibility for dual suicide bombings at a Pakistani military arms factory on Thursday that police say killed 100 people and wounded 80 others .
Police and authorities investigate the scene of the arms factory blast in Wah , near Rawalpindi .
The spokesman for Pakistan 's Taliban , Maulvi Omar , said his group , Tehrik - e - Taliban , was responsible for Thursday 's attacks .
Two suicide bombers blew themselves up near the gates of the military arms factory in Wah , near Rawalpindi , where Pakistan 's military is based .
The attack took place during a shift change at one of several factories that employ several thousand people .
It was the second deadly suicide attack in the country since President Pervez Musharraf resigned Monday .
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack , his spokesman said in a statement .
Ban " reiterates his rejection of such indiscriminate and reprehensible acts of terrorism and extends his condolences to the families of the victims and to the government of Pakistan . "
Watch a report on the deadly attack »
U.S. President Bush called Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani to express his sympathies for the recent attacks , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" Bush expressed to Prime Minister Gillani the United States ' strong commitment to working with the prime minister and the government of Pakistan to address the ongoing battle against extremists and to assist Pakistan through its current economic situation , " Johndroe said in an e-mail .
The U.S. president also told Gillani that he had spoken to Musharraf on Thursday to thank him for " his efforts in the democratic transition of Pakistan , as well as the fight against al Qaeda and extremist groups , " Johndroe said .
Omar promised more attacks as long as Pakistan continued its military operations in Bajaur Agency , a tribal region where the military has launched a major offensive against militants .
On Tuesday , a suicide bomber detonated explosives near the emergency entrance to a hospital in the Dera Ismail Khan district , killing 29 and wounding another 35 .
The Taliban also claimed responsibility for that attack .
Pakistani security forces have been battling Islamic militants in the country 's tribal regions that border Afghanistan .
Clashes have killed dozens since late June .
And militants have vowed to retaliate .
Muhammad Amir Rana , director of an Islamabad - based think - tank , said he expected the militants to increase their attacks as a show of force against the new government now that Musharraf is out of power .
The act of picking Musharraf 's successor has taken a back seat as the two political parties that lead the ruling coalition wrangle over restoring the 60 judges Musharraf fired .
Pakistani newspapers and bloggers have urged the Pakistan People 's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League - N to reconcile their differences and tackle the country 's more pressing concerns : the economy and terrorism .
The PML - N , the junior partner in the coalition , indicated Thursday that it may pull out unless judges fired by Musharraf were quickly reinstated , claiming that the PPP was reneging on assurances .
The PPP wants the coalition to focus on picking a successor for Musharraf , but if the PML - N pulls out , the coalition will probably crumble unless the PPP can line up enough smaller parties to retain a majority .
" The two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of Musharraf 's impeachment , " PML - N Information Secretary Ahsan Iqbal said Thursday .
" We honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work .
But the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign .
And if that is not respected , then people will ask why are we clinging on to the coalition . "
The Pakistan People 's Party said it hoped the PML - N stayed in the coalition .
" We will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country , " said Farzana Raja , central coordinator for the PPP .
" If they want to do something in haste , they have all the right to do that .
We cannot force them to be with us .
But we are trying to reach a consensus . "
CNN 's Reza Sayah and Saeed Ahmed and journalist Kamran Yousaf contributed to this report .

Sun 's Profits Dip 73 Percent , Pins Hopes on Open Source
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 01 , 2008
Sun Microsystems , which is pinning much of its future on open source , just reported its fourth - quarter numbers , and they were not rosy .
The company 's profit dipped 73 percent , year over year , for the fiscal quarter ended June 30th .
Some observers are blaming the drop in profit on slumping revenues , but revenues were $ 3.78 billion , down only 1.4 percent from a year ago , and the company has continued with cost - cutting measures as the economy underperforms .
The real reason for the slump in profits is that Sun has faced heavy competition from IBM and Hewlett - Packard in the high margin server market .
Still , Sun maintains that its many open source initiatives will lead it toward brighter days .
" Looking forward , we remain confident in open source innovation as the accelerant to our growth strategy through increased adoption of our open source offerings , ” Jonathan Schwartz , Sun CEO , said in a statement .
MySQL , OpenSolaris , VirtualBox ( virtualization ) and many other open source technologies remain centers of focus at Sun .
Likewise , it 's not slowing down the pace at which it unveils new open source initiatives .
At the recent OSCON conference in Oregon , Sun announced the Sun Web Stack , an enterprise scale AMP ( Apache / MySQL / Perl or PHP stack for Solaris and Linux .
It also announced that it is making the core components of the Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 and Sun Java System Web Proxy offerings open source .
As Sun continues to push forward with meaningful open source software , stacks and components , I think it will eventually see the strategy pay off .
That 's because its high - margin hardware offerings -- servers , in particular , and storage systems -- will be cheaper to deploy than competition from IBM and HP , even as its open source software offerings gain in popularity .
At the moment , though , in a bad economy , Sun continues to face harsh criticism and share downgrades .
It has announced a new $ 1 billion share repurchase program in addition to the $ 3 billion repurchase program it launched in 2007 .
We 've made the point before that gloomy economic times can bode well for open source , including commercial open source strategies .
Matt Asay recently pointed out that companies such as Red Hat and Sun could benefit from a bad economy since there are " efficiency gains to be had by dumping BEA for JBoss , Oracle for MySQL , etc . "
In my opinion , it 's still very early in the game for Sun 's open source bets .
It needs time for adoption , popularity , and favorable buzz to spread .
For those of us who are not economists , where do we go to get a sense of just what is going on ?
Is the bailout a good or bad deal ?
Are things going to get worse before they get better or a lot worse before they get better ?
Two blogs I ’m watching closely at the moment are Paul Krugman ’s blog at the NYT and Nouriel Roubini ’s blog at RGE Monitor .
Roubini is the man of the moment for , to a great degree , predicting well in advance much of what has transpired over recent months and weeks .
Economist Brad DeLong ’s blog and Barry Ritholtz ’s blog are also key .
To be clear , these are only a few examples .
And we ’re going to try to put together a lengthier and more comprehensive list .
But these are some places to start .
In case you ’re wondering , Krugman ’s take seems to be that we need a major government intervention and that even though the Dodd / Frank revision of the original Paulson plan is pretty bad on a lot of counts , it was probably the best the Dems could do with Bush still in office .
And at this moment it ’s probably better than the other politically - viable alternatives — including doing nothing and waiting for January .
Here are the details from Paul .
What I find increasingly troubling is that a lot of people whose opinions I respect seem to think the buying up the toxic debts model is fundamentally misguided — that we’d be better stewards of taxpayer money and accomplishing more good by using the government money to recapitalize these ailing firms by buying big equity stakes in them .
In a sense , I guess , we ’d be setting up what amounted to a limited lifetime US sovereign wealth fund ( I know it ’s not precisely like that , but a little ) to do what the Gulf emirates and others have been doing on an ad hoc basis through much of this year .
( ed.note :
On most issues I write about on TPM , I do so with what I believe is some level of expertise , at least a solid enough understanding of the issues to know what I do and do n’t know .
This high - wire economics and finance stuff is in a different category .
So I ’m trying to strike a balance between not writing about what I do n’t know about while also trying to point you in the direction of people who do .
All of which is to say that on these topics I would more aggressively than usual check my speculation against other more knowledgable sources like the ones I ’ve linked to above .
— jmm )
Late Update : Seems some economists do n’t think they ’re in a much better position than I am .
From an academic economist …
I suppose we economists are in a relatively good position to pontificate on the bailout .
But it ’s an elephantine analysis .
I know that the government is likely to do badly in most trading situations because of private information .
I know that there can be liquidity problems in an economy .
But our real training is to boil a problem down to one or maybe two choice variables and figure out what effect small changes have on a fairly simple measure of welfare .
Here , the problem is what to do with a melting down economy that has a central problem of information in a market ( housing ) that is beyond our comprehension in itself .
I like to flatter myself that I am a leading housing economist , but all I know about the fundamental value of my house is that it is somewhere between $ 450,000 and $ 1,250,000 .
Economists do not have the tools to forecast with any precision what effect a major intervention would have , even if you held constant a lot of stuff that will not be held constant over the course of the intervention .
Things like “ this bailout will create bad incentives down the road ” may be true and important but are impossible to quantify on the same dimension as the also impossible to calculate “ the economy will shut down if we do n’t do something soon . ”
Latter Update : I ’m interested in what seems to be a growing consensus that Hank Paulson made an extremely bad decision letting Lehman go down the tubes .
SANTA CRUZ , Calif . 
The police and federal authorities are investigating firebombings at the homes of two researchers at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
The attacks , which the university described as “ antiscience violence , ” occurred nearly simultaneously before dawn on Saturday , just days after the police in Santa Cruz discovered pamphlets in a coffee shop warning of attacks against “ animal abusers everywhere . ”
The pamphlets included the names , addresses and other personal information of several researchers at the university , according to a news release put out on Friday by the university .
About 5:30 a.m. Saturday , two small bombs ignited outside the researchers ’ homes .
In one of the attacks , a vehicle was destroyed in a faculty member ’s driveway .
At the second residence , a two - story home near the university ’s front gates , the fire forced the researcher , his wife and two children to flee the home from an upstairs window .
The fires were quickly extinguished .
One minor injury was reported , according to The Santa Cruz Sentinel , which also said the police were viewing the attacks as acts of attempted homicide and domestic terrorism .
The Santa Cruz Police Department would not comment on their investigation on Sunday .
Mobile phone use is currently banned onboard aircraft Mobile phone calls will be allowed on planes flying in European airspace under new European Commission rules .
The decision means that mobiles could be used once a plane has reached an altitude of 3,000 m or more .
It follows six months of consultation by the European regulator and the first services could launch next month .
Viviane Reding , the EU telecoms commissioner , has warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on planes at a reasonable level .
" If consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take - off .
" I also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in - flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she said .
The European Commission has introduced new rules to harmonise the technical requirements for the safe in - flight use of mobile phones .
The commission is also making it possible to enable the national licences granted to individual airlines by a member state to be recognised throughout the EU .
The decision to offer the services now falls to individual airlines .
However , there are other regulatory hurdles to overcome before the technology is considered to be fully approved .
The European Aviation Safety Agency still needs to approve any hardware that would be installed in aircraft to ensure that it did not interfere with other flight systems .
How does the system work ?
The plan is to install small mobile phone base stations , called pico cells , in aircraft that will be switched on after take - off .
The base station generates a bubble of coverage in and around the aircraft .
Calls made via the pico cell will be routed to terrestrial networks via satellite link .
Across Europe radio spectrum has been set aside for the technology .
The services could stop working once aircraft leave European airspace .
Martin Selmayr , spokesman for Ms Reding 's office , said that flight captains would be able to switch off the on - board service if they felt it necessary .
Initially , only second generation networks will be offered but growing interest would mean that third generation , or 3G , services will follow .
The first flights offering calls could start as early as next month .
Air France is believed to be ready to deploy the technology while Ryanair is expected to submit an application .
The cost of making a mobile phone call from a plane will be higher than making one from the ground .
In the UK , regulator Ofcom said it would investigate and address any evidence of " excessive charges and abuses of competition " if prices were set unfairly by airlines and mobile networks .
Ms Redding has said the EC had no plans to cap the cost of calls made on planes .
The European Commission backing means planes registered in one country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other EU countries without having to apply for additional national licences .

What are these ?
A new study confirms what most of us have known for a while — that conservative whining about “ liberal bias ” in the media is baseless .
It was always difficult to believe .
After all , the mainstream media in this country is largely owned by large conservative corporations , and cable news channels like Fox News are little more than government propaganda outlets .
But now , the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University , where researchers have tracked network news content for two decades , and whose studies have often been cited by conservatives , did a detailed analysis of the three television networks ( ABC , CBS , and NBC ) and concluded that they were much tougher on Obama than on McCain .
During the evening news during the first 6 weeks of the general election campaign , of the opinions expressed about Obama , 72 % were negative and 28 % were positive ( over 2.5 to 1 against Obama ) .
For McCain , 57 % were negative and 43 % were positive ( just over 1.3 to 1 against McCain ) .
In other words , the media was twice as negative against Obama as they were against McCain .
What I find especially ironic is when someone from the conservative media ( Limbaugh , Hannity , Beck , etc. ) complains about liberal bias in the media — the white kettle calling the kettle black !
ERICE , Sicily 
This ancient hilltop town , rife with Roman , Greek , Norman and other influences , is hosting a very modern gathering : a conference on global risks like cyberterrorism , climate change , nuclear weapons and the world ’s lagging energy supply .
More than 120 scientists , engineers , analysts and economists from 30 countries were hunkered down here for the 40th annual conference on “ planetary emergencies . ”
The term was coined by Dr. Antonino Zichichi , a native son and a theoretical physicist who has made Erice a hub for experts to discuss persistent , and potentially catastrophic , global challenges .
The participants were not particularly optimistic .
They presented data showing that the boom in biofuels was depleting Southeast Asian rain forests , that “ bot herders ”  computer hackers for hire  were hijacking millions of computers , and that the lack of progress over handling nuclear waste was both hampering the revival of nuclear energy and adding to terrorism risks .
The meetings , which end Sunday , were sponsored by the Erice - based Ettore Majorana Foundation and Center for Scientific Culture and by the World Federation of Scientists in Geneva .
Both organizations are led by Dr. Zichichi with what the physicist Dr. Richard L. Garwin , a longtime Erice conference participant and expert on nuclear weapons , affectionately called “ imperious ” zeal .

Location : Bottom of Mt. Rose Hwy
it 's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
Driving on Mt. Rose Hwy , and serving our communties is where !
So I 'm coming home to Reno on my motorcycle Saturday Evening after a short ride up to the top and back down cuz it was too smokey up there , somewhere around 8 pm I think ?
Anyways ...
Near the bottom , I hit some oil , gravel , not sure what ... but even as an experienced rider for some 30 + years , made my bike wobble so bad , I eventually lost control after doing everything I could try to do to keep it up .
From what I hear , might have even hit a guard rail at some point during the crash , no memory so not sure , all I do know is next thing I 'm on the pavement in a ton of pain .
Rolling in the road I think ... Stranger # 1 - Then , there was a hand ... holding mine , comforting me thru my gloves ...
Kept hearing a voice that I think was female telling me " everything was gonna be ok " and " help is on the way " .
Could n't really open my eyes much , that 's why I 'm not sure if it was male or female , but it did n't really matter at that point , ya know ?
I just know ' till the day I die , I will forever remember how comforting it felt to know that " if " I was gonna die then , someone was gonna be holding my hand while it happened and I would not die alone on some road tasting asphalt .
You have no idea what that meant to me , still does , and always will .
You probably also have no idea how much gratitude I would like to express to you for the comfort you gave me , a complete stranger , when I really , REALLY needed it .
I just remember your hand , rubbing mine and your soft , kind , compassionate words letting me know , someone cared .
You did n't just drive by , you took time out of your Holiday weekend to help me - some fat ass biker guy that some here on CL wish we would all crash and die .
Stranger # 2 No clue who this was either , but someone called police / ambulance , etc. super quick and there they were , hot on the spot within minutes .
( felt like minutes to me anyways , damn quick ! ) , can't thank you enough and damn glad ya had signal ... hahaha !
Stranger # 3 Again , same as the others , no idea who you were , but I heard someone else say something I think about removing my helmet .
In my mind I was thinking please , please do n't do that , but I could n't say it .
But you could and did , you spoke up and advised against it .
Damn I am glad there are people like you who know better and again , my sincere appreciation and grattitude to you as well .
Strangers # 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , etc ..
To all the police firemen / women , ambulance drivers , person in the back of the ambulance .. to all of you emergency responder type people who showed up who did whatever it was you had been trained to do , and loaded me on some kind of back board or something I think , and then put my big ol ' self in the ambulance and got me to Renown so quickly - my most humble thanks and appreciation as well .
I know you were " just doing your jobs " , but damn you do them well !
You will NEVER hear me bitch about your pay raises or what it costs for the absolute QUALITY services you provide our community !
I do know of one policeman or hwy patrolmen who I think arranged to have my bike towed and visited me in the ER letting me know it 's condition and where it had been towed to , cuz he put his badge number on my insurance paper , as I get better in the next few days I would like to find you and thank you in person since I have a clue on maybe how to find you from the badge # .
You also gathered my personal belongings I had on the bike that would have been stolen for sure .
( cam corder , etc . . )
Yes , I know , small things to worry about in that moment , but you made sure I did n't have to , again , thank you for going out of your way for my needs .
To all the Dr.s , Nurses , and whoever else was working in that ER room , my eternal thanks and grattitude as well .
Man I was hurting , them ribs are a bitch when smashed , but you folks all again , did what you were trained to do in the finest proffesional manner ( even on the embarssing stuff ) and I just knew from all your demeanors , I was gonna be ok .
I am sure there are some typos and mis-spellings in this post , forgive me as i am on some pretty strong pills for pain , but i just got to my computer and wanted to get these thank yous out as soon as possible .
All of you people just really have no clue what your kindness and compassion meant , and means to me even now .
I would like to let you all know , that from your kindess , skills and so on ...
I 'm going to be ok .
Could have been a lot worse , but thanks to good people like you , a damn fine helmet and a little luck , both I and the bike are fixable .
If there is any chance of any of you " unknowns " letting me know who you are , I would greatly like to thank you all in person , if that 's not your style , I respect that and just know you meant alot to one hurting , scared guy , yeah ...
I was scared I 'll admitt to it no problem !
Last and not forgotten in any way , once I was admitted to the 3rd floor , all the Nurses , CNA 's , Orderlies , people waking me up every few hours to check my vitals and stuff , I also sincerely thank you , but since I know how to re-find you all , i will be seeing you again in person to thank you properly , especially Melissa , a nurse or CNA not sure , but one awesome lady I did not have enough time to thank properly today as I left !
I really wish I could have stayed and healed longer as today really ended up hurting , but you know why I had to leave .
You friggin ROCK !
Sincerely , Tim H .
Before I die I want to be able to greet all the people I love who are still alive and make one last trip to the mountains
Those overheating Nvidia laptop graphics cards that are dying en masse ?
The Inquirer is reporting that " all the G84 and G86 parts are bad .
Period .
No exceptions , " on mobile and desktop .
Those chipsets are in pretty much every GeForce 8 - series graphics card below the 8800s ( here 's a complete list of cards and chipsets ) .
Notably , that means every MacBook Pro since the Santa Rosa update has the bad cards , which fail at a " higher - than - normal " rate .
Advertisement
The root of the problem is the substrate / bumping material , which Nvidia themselves had characterized as " weak . "
The G84 and G86 chipsets use the same application - specific integrated circuit , which the Inquirer has been told had no changes made to it during its life cycle - besides , Nvidia would n't change the assembly process or materials for a single batch , according to engineers .
So Nvidia 's official claim , that the weak materials were only used for a single batch , does n't hold so much water .
And as the Inquirer points out , their fix , to run the fan more to offseat the heat issue simply covers up the problem while it drains your battery .

If this is all true , Nvidia better have more than $ 200 million set aside for fixes .

Could You Afford to Be Poor ?
There are people , concentrated in Manhattan 's Upper East Side and Beverly Hills , who still confuse poverty with the simple life .
No cable TV , no altercations with the maid , no summer home maintenance issues — just the basics , like family , sunsets , and walks in the park .
What they do n't know is that it 's expensive to be poor .
In fact , you , the reader of middling income , could probably not afford it .
A 2006 study from the Brookings Institution documents the " ghetto tax , " or higher cost of living ...
By James Baxter , NMA President
In 1982 Congress authorized the National Academy of Science to do a study that documented the “ benefits ” of the 55 MPH National Maximum Speed Limit ( NMSL ) .
I , as the President of the organization most critical of the national speed limit , was considered as a potential member of the advisory panel to oversee and guide this study .
This invitation was withheld and never offered because it was determined ( by an unknown someone ) that political advocates would not be seated on the Advisory Panel .
In exchange , I was offered the opportunity to present testimony to the Advisory Panel and Transportation Research Board staff responsible for the national speed limit study .
While my testimony covered a wide range of subjects I specifically attacked the premise that the 55 MPH NMSL was responsible for reducing highway fatalities by 17 percent ( from 55,000 to 46,000 traffic related deaths ) .
I pointed out that many of those reductions took place on roads and streets with speed limits that were never higher than 55 miles per hour .
Even those fatal accidents that did take place on highways with higher speed limits were often in no way related to speed or speed limits .
My main premise was that the combination of a distressed economy , embargo related fuel shortages , and escalating fuel prices drastically reduced discretionary travel and that is why fatalities dropped in the manner they did .
My apolitical detractors on the Advisory Panel ( like former heads of NHTSA and insurance industry representatives ) were quick to point out that miles traveled only declined two to three percent , so surely reduced travel could not account for 9000 fewer fatalities in 1974 .
However , subsequent investigation by the TRB staff ultimately determined that estimates of vehicle miles traveled are riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions .
( They remain so today . )
In the end , the authors of the “ 55 ” study concluded that the reduced speed limit was responsible for somewhere between 2000 to 4000 of the fewer fatalities ( a number dutifully reported by U.S. Senator Warner during a recent press conference promoting the reincarnation of a national speed limit ) .
This number was little more than a politically expedient guess .
Fast forward to July 2008 , the economy is in distress , fuel is readily available but very expensive , and traffic - related fatalities are plummeting .
The big missing ingredient is that there is no national speed limit to take the credit .
Furthermore , while travel speeds have decreased , the decrease is very moderate — approximately an average of one mile per hour according to our home state ( Wisconsin ) highway patrol .
Highway fatalities are 30 percent behind those of a year ago for the same time period , in the same state .
There ’s the usual official claptrap about stepped up speed enforcement , DUI arrests , and restrictions on teen driving , all of which were equally in play last year and the year before that .
The bottom line is that discretionary travel has tanked and with it some of our highest risk driving .
This trend will continue until the economy recovers and / or household fuel bills decline .
Fuel prices are likely to remain high , at least in the near term and probably beyond that .
However , individual strategies intended to reduce fuel use will reduce household fuel bills .
To the extent that these strategies reduce travel we will see commensurate fatality reductions .
Those strategies that simply make travel less expensive , e.g. buying a more efficient vehicle , will increase travel and most likely they will result in increased traffic related fatalities .
The good news is that long term trends indicate reduced highway fatality rates , primarily because of better vehicles and improved highways .
Political gimmicks , like 55 MPH national speed limits , will not improve highway safety , reduce fuel prices , or have a meaningful effect on fuel supplies .
All they do is generate red tape , traffic tickets , and auto insurance surcharges .
Keep that in mind the next time you hear some self - appointed “ expert ” touting a national speed limit .

WASHINGTON --
As financial institutions continue to fail , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is under pressure to decide how to replenish the fund that insures consumer deposits .
The fund is stocked mostly by fees levied on U.S. banks .
If the FDIC raises the fees , that would siphon more money from already cash - strapped financial institutions .
It could also deplete funds that banks would otherwise use to make loans .

The logo of the Chinese Wikipedia
Wikinews has confirmed that the unblocking of the Chinese Wikipedia in China has probably been extended to cover the whole of China .
Ting Chen , who is currently the community elected board member of the Wikimedia Foundation , said at 09:54 ( UTC ) today on Wikimedia ’s foundation - l mailing list that he has “ reports from provinces and cities from very different corners of the country , that the users have direct access . ”
Ting Chen , community elected board member of the Wikimedia Foundation , announced that the Chinese Wikipedia was unblocked earlier today
Wikinews previously reported that the Chinese Wikipedia was unblocked in China , although that unblock did not cover the whole of the country .
Wikipedia user Aphaia has also said that Wikipedia can even be accessed in remote districts such as Fujian .
She said that “ Fujian is rather near to Taiwan so this lifting would be nationwide , I suppose . ”
Using a Website Testing tool , Wikinews has also confirmed access in Shanghai , Beijing and Hong Kong .
However , access to controversial pages such as the article on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 was found to remain restricted .
Despite the fact that the ban has been lifted , the Chinese Wikipedia continues to tell readers a way to get around the firewall .
At the top of every page there is a message telling users ( who are not logged in ) to view Wikipedia using the https server to bypass the block .
Some Wikipedia contributors have said that the block may reappear after the Olympic games have finished .
Titan Deng , an active Wikimedia who organized Wikimania 2007 said that “ the lift of the ban is brought by the Olympic Game [s ] which is going to be held next week . ”
He then said that “ the lift[ing of the block ] might end after the Olympic Game[s ] finishes . ”
The International Olympic Committee warned China in April that it wanted the internet freely accessible for the entire duration of the Olympic Summer Games .
Unrestricted access is guaranteed to the 30,000 reporters and media staff expected for the Olympics under Beijing 's " host city contract " .

Enlarge By Nicholas Kamm , AFP / Getty Images U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor outlines the case against Bruce Ivins Wednesday at a news conference .
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S ANTHRAX COURT DOCUMENTS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S ANTHRAX COURT DOCUMENTS
Part One , ( PDF file , 11.8 MB ) Part Two ( PDF file , 10.3 MB ) Part Three ( PDF file , 7.1 MB ) Part Four ( PDF file , 5.7 MB ) Part Five ( PDF file , 3.4 MB ) Part Six ( PDF file , 2.1 MB ) LEARN MORE ABOUT ANTHRAX LEARN MORE ABOUT ANTHRAX MULTIMEDIA : Information from the National Institutes of Health WORLD HEALTH ORG . : Fact sheet FDA : Update on potential anthrax vaccine CDC : Anthrax backgrounder WASHINGTON 
On several nights before the anthrax attacks in September and October 2001 , bioweapons scientist Bruce Ivins repeatedly spent long periods alone in a secure laboratory that housed a strain of the lethal bacteria .
He later " could provide no legitimate reason " for his after - hours work to investigators , who used new DNA technology to match the specific strain of spores in Ivins ' lab with the one used in the attacks .
Those were among the revelations contained in court documents unsealed Wednesday , as the U.S. government proclaimed it had solved the nation 's worst case of bioterrorism .
The anthrax attacks , which involved mailings of powdered spores that killed five people and sickened at least 17 others , jolted a country reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks and have been a major mystery of the post - 9/11 period .
The release of the court documents and the government briefing that followed shed light on the evidence against Ivins , 62 , who died July 29 from an overdose of acetaminophen .
Yet they also raised new questions about the government 's handling of the seven - year anthrax probe , which initially focused on another scientist and turned toward Ivins less than two years ago .
TIMELINE : Key dates in probe " We are confident , based on the evidence we had , that we could prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt , " said Jeffrey Taylor , U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia .
" We are confident that Dr. Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks . "
The government 's assertion was disputed by Ivins ' lawyers , who issued a statement calling the Justice Department briefing an " orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements , heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence — all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by Dr. Ivins . "
Much of the evidence against Ivins is circumstantial , including an e-mail he sent to an associate after the 9/11 terror attacks that contained warnings about terrorists having " anthrax and sarin gas , " and having " decreed death to all Jews and Americans .
There was similar language in the letters that were mailed with the deadly powder .
The court papers released Wednesday also alleged that Ivins , when asked to provide samples of certain anthrax spores for testing by investigators , tried to mislead agents by providing other types of spores — and then lied about doing so .
The documents also describe increasingly erratic and threatening behavior by Ivins as federal agents pressured him for details .
Taylor and others noted that such circumstantial evidence is routinely used to win convictions in U.S. courts , but some legal analysts found the government 's case against Ivins lacking .
They noted that beyond matching the spores used in the attacks to those " created and solely maintained " by Ivins at the U.S. lab at Fort Detrick in Frederick , Md. , the documents cited no physical evidence — no hair or handwriting match , for example .
" If they 're saying , ' We found the guy , and this is it , ' to me this falls short of that mark , " said Michael Greenberger of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland School of Law .
" There 's a lot of circumstantial evidence that certainly supports probable cause , but I have questions ( about ) whether this proves anything beyond a reasonable doubt . "
Some scientists , however , saw the link between the specific type of spores used in the attacks to Ivins ' lab as particularly strong .
In early 2005 , using new techniques , FBI scientists identified the " genetically unique " parent used in the anthrax mailings .
Eight of the lab samples the FBI collected had four genetic mutations unique to the anthrax mailings , an affidavit says .
All came from a single flask , called " RMR - 1029 , " that Ivins created and maintained at the Fort Detrick lab .
The affidavit says Ivins was the " sole custodian " of the flask since its anthrax was first grown in 1997 .
" We have a flask that 's effectively the murder weapon , from which those spores were taken , that was controlled by Dr. Ivins , " Taylor said , adding that others with potential access to the flask gradually were ruled out as suspects starting in 2005 .
" The anthrax in that flask was created by Dr. Ivins . "
Steven Salzberg , a University of Maryland biologist , says that " finding those four mutations , that 's pretty compelling evidence . "
Salzberg was an author of the 2002 Science magazine paper that first released genetic details of the anthrax in the 2001 bioterrorist letters .
" If Bruce Ivins has been the ' sole custodian ' — if that 's true — then they got him , " Salzberg said .
On Capitol Hill , where several buildings had to be shut down after anthrax - laced letters were sent to then - senator Tom Daschle and Sen.
Patrick Leahy in 2001 , the Justice Department 's briefing drew some skepticism .
U.S. Rep. Rush Holt , D - N.J. , whose district includes a mailbox that was used to send the letters containing anthrax , said that " while the circumstantial evidence pointing to Dr. Ivins … is compelling , a number of important questions remain unanswered , such as why investigators remained focused on Dr. ( Steven ) Hatfill long after they had begun to suspect Dr. Ivins … and why investigators are so certain that Ivins acted alone . "
The case against Ivins
When tainted letters began arriving at news organizations and the Senate offices in mid-September 2001 , the FBI initially focused on foreign terrorists .
Then investigators began to suspect Hatfill , another Fort Detrick weapons scientist , whom then - attorney general John Ashcroft called " a person of interest " in the case .
Hatfill was subjected to 24 - hour surveillance .
The FBI wiretapped his phone and accosted him at job interviews , according to a lawsuit he later filed that accused the government of invading his privacy and ruining his career .
In June , Hatfill won a $ 5.82 million settlement in the case .
On Wednesday , Taylor said the government began to consider Ivins as the primary suspect last year .
" We thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access " to the key flask of anthrax at the Fort Detrick lab , " and we were able to rule out all but Dr. Ivins , " Taylor said .
The probe found that Ivins had access to a sophisticated machine that could have been used to dry the anthrax spores to make them airborne .
In the days before each of the 2001 anthrax mailings , Ivins worked at the lab unusually late into the night and on weekends in the high - security section where the anthrax is stored , the probe found .
When questioned by FBI agents , he said he was having trouble at home , the documents say .
A few days before the attacks began , the government says , Ivins sent the e-mail that used language similar to that of the anthrax letters .
Among the other evidence outlined Wednesday : • Envelopes used in the mailings were available in only a few places , including the Frederick , Md. , post office frequented by Ivins .
• The court documents cited e-mails in which he acknowledged being paranoid and depressed and said he was obsessed with a sorority that has an office near the Princeton , N.J. , mailbox used to send some of the anthrax letters .
Eventually , the FBI began watching Ivins day and night .
He showed " consciousness of guilt , " Taylor said .
Ivins also told people at his group therapy session that he wanted to kill those who had wronged him , Taylor said .
That was on July 9 , according an affidavit .
Ivins told the social worker and group members that he was a suspect in the anthrax investigation .
" He stated … he was angry at investigators , the government and the system in general .
He said he was not going to face the death penalty , ( and ) had a plan to kill co-workers and other individuals , " the document says .
" He said he had a bulletproof vest and a list of co-workers and … was going to obtain a Glock firearm from his son within the next day because federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own . "
The social worker called the Frederick police , who took him into custody and sent him to a hospital for evaluation .
He was later released .
' He did some stupid things '
Evidence of a potential motive for Ivins to have sent the letters is scant .
Investigators have pointed to trouble at work with a failing anthrax vaccine and a possible cut in his program .
The FBI has not said how agents eliminated as suspects others in the lab who also may have had access to Ivins ' flask .
The FBI also did not explain why it relied on Ivins to assist their probe even after the 2003 incident in which Ivins gave investigators unsuitable anthrax samples from his lab .
And agents have not been able to place Ivins at the Princeton mailbox where the anthrax letters were mailed , but they say he had the time in his work and home schedules to drive there the days the letters were mailed .
One of the nation 's leading anthrax researchers , Martin Hugh - Jones of Louisiana State University , says the documents leave some critical questions unanswered .
For example , they fail to confirm a genetic match between the strain of anthrax found in Ivins ' laboratory and the first victim , Robert Stevens of American Media in Boca Raton , Fla .
" The evidence points at Ivins , but they do n't give evidence excluding other people working in the same facility , " Hugh - Jones says , adding , " Bruce did n't help himself .
He did some very stupid things . "
Geneticist Michael Stebbins of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington , D.C. , notes that the science is not very detailed in the affidavit , which the government prepared to obtain approval for a search warrant — not to present its case to a jury .
" The four mutations , that alone is n't a smoking gun , but it certainly is compelling evidence that the anthrax came from the flask where Ivins worked , " he says .
Holt , who was briefed Wednesday by FBI Director Robert Mueller , says , " I hope that as the rest of the information comes out , it will seem more than just another assertion by the FBI that they 've got the right guy . "
' No doubt in my mind ' Victims of the anthrax attacks and family members of those who died reacted emotionally at a private briefing by Mueller , said Patrick O'Donnell , a New Jersey postal worker who was infected by the anthrax .
It lasted nearly four hours and included every agent assigned to the case .
" A lot of people were breaking up , crying , " O'Donnell said .
He found the evidence circumstantial , but solid .
" I pretty much have no doubt in my mind he did it now , " he said .
However , he wishes Ivins were alive to stand trial .
" It left a lot of doors open . " Ivins ' attorney , Paul Kemp , attended a memorial service for Ivins on Wednesday at Fort Detrick .
" I do n't understand how 250 scientists and soldiers , including the base commander and the commanding general , could be here eulogizing Bruce and the FBI seriously consider him a suspect , " Kemp said via e-mail .
" In the words of his commander , he was open , sharing , funny and scientifically brilliant . "
Taylor , though , said the Justice Department is in the process of ending its investigation and plans to formally close the case .
" We regret that we will not have the opportunity to present the evidence to a jury , " he said .

The number of schools receiving A ’s under New York ’s much - contested grading system increased significantly this year from last in what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said was a clear sign of success and evidence that his signature accountability program was spurring improvement at schools across the city .
Nine of the schools that got F ’s for the 2006 - 7 school year got A’s in this year ’s grading ; just one of last year ’s A ’s plummeted to an F this time around .
Critics immediately seized on the wild fluctuations as proof that the system was flawed because of its emphasis on year - to - year progress by individual students rather than multiyear gains .
Over all , nearly 80 percent of the 1,040 elementary and middle schools judged got A’s or B’s , while the number labeled failures dropped to 18 from 43 .
The percentage of schools getting A ’s jumped to 38 percent , from 23 percent last year .
About 57 percent of last year ’s A schools received A ’s again , while no school was deemed an F twice .
“ Not a single school failed again , ” Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference at Public School 5 in Bedford - Stuyvesant , one of the F - to - A schools .
“ That ’s exactly the reason to have grades , to show what you have n’t done yet and what you do to improve .
The fact of the matter is it ’s working . ”
It looks our old friends are up to their old games again .
In Michigan : “ The chairman of the Republican Party in Macomb County , Michigan , a key swing county in a key swing state , is planning to use a list of foreclosed homes to block people from voting in the upcoming election as part of the state GOP ’s effort to challenge some voters on Election Day . ”
In Virginia : “ Election officials in the county that is home to Virginia Tech were wrong when they issued a news release saying college students who register to vote there cannot be claimed as dependents on their parents ’ income tax returns , a civil liberties group said Monday . ”
In MIssissippi , that traditional bastion of progressive voting rights : “ Mississippi ’s governor , Haley Barbour , and its secretary of state have come up with a particularly cynical dirty trick for the November election .
Let ’s call it :
Where ’s the Senate race ? ’
Defying state law , they have decided to hide a hard - fought race for the United States Senate at the bottom of the ballot , where they clearly are hoping some voters will overlook it .
Their proposed design is not only illegal .
It shows a deep contempt for Mississippi ’s voters . ”
One hates to speculate , but we wo n’t be surprised to hear about similar ( or even more innovative ) shenanigans in other states , will we ?
Not that the neo - Jim Crow crowd is going unchallenged .
The stories above indicate that a bright light is being cast on these kinds of unAmerican activities , and Obama is getting involved in Michigan .
The Obama Campaign and the Democratic National Committee are joining with three Michigan residents in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to defend the lawful right of families facing foreclosure or who have lost their homes to vote in the November election .
“ Senator McCain said last week that he was ‘ divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have , ’ and he certainly has proven that to Michigan families , ” said Obama Campaign Manager David Plouffe .
“ Senator McCain has no real plan to turn Michigan ’s economy around or help families faced with losing their homes – so his party has decided the only way to save his campaign is to deny the right to vote to families most affected by his disastrous economic policies . ”
This wo n’t be enough , though .
We know dirty tricks are being plotted ( or at least , if we do n’t know it for a demonstrable fact , we probably have enough evidence before us that we ’d be comfortable betting our life savings on it ) , and we saw in 2000 what happens when we ’re too willing to trust the system to act in good faith .
Therefore , you ’re advised to be vigilant and vocal when you encounter voter suppression of any sort .
Call your Congressweasel .
Write an e-mail to everyone you know with links to the stories .
Tell your friends , your neighbors , your family , your co-workers .
Even better , call your local newspaper and demand that they do their damned jobs , because as thick as the average voter can be , he or she probably does n’t like being confronted with this kind of anti-democratic behavior .
Meanwhile , here are a couple other things you can do :
This ai n’t Zimbabwe – not yet , anyway .
If the integrity of our election system matters to you , then talk it and walk it .
You do n’t need a national platform to make a dent .
Speak up .
Viral is your friend , folks .
Jazzers and Programmers ( Nick Sieger )
Nick Sieger had two talks ready and put it to an audience vote .
They could pick either :
Pointless and Time — Wasting Things You Can Do with JRuby , or
Jazzers and Programmers
As you can see by the title , the audience picked “ Jazzers and Programmers ” .
Experience the music !
Carsten Nielsen put together a muxtape page where you can hear the samples of jazz that Nick used in his presentation .
You should also see Nick Sieger ’s blog entry Jazzers and Programmers , which is his presentation in article form .

Do the Hustle ( Obie Fernandez )
From the RubyFringe program booklet :
Sales is an a rt that very few technical people have mastered .
Very few .
It takes patience , confidence , empathy and a whole slew of other skills mixed together — a brew that is seriously difficult for many geeks to figure out .
In this talk , Obie will leverage his experience successfully selling consulting services for both Thoughtworks and Hashrocket to help you with the following questions :
How do I figure out how to price my services ?
How do I figure out the kind of work I want to sell ?
How do I write contracts and statements of work ?
What about proposals ?
And RFPs ?
How do I close the deal ?
- My formula :
Get into programming , write a bestselling book , start consultancy , profit ! - I 've had to make my own luck - I come from a humble background , with no prospects coming out of high school - I landed my first job in IT in 1996 - It was as a Java programmer - I read " Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days " and wore a nice suit to interview - I knew how to present myself -
That 's what I 'm talking about today - I 'm talking about hustling ! -
This is not about scams or cons -
It 's about being able to jump on opportunities when they present themselves -
The dictionary definition of " hustle " is to " obtain by forceful action or persuasion " - Yes , I do mean " forcefully " -
The sales cycle , which I will discuss , is made up of these phases : 1 . Marketing 2 . Qualifying 3 . Closing * -- ALWAYS BE CLOSING 4 . Maintenance - Marketing -
Take a holistic approach - Looking good is a must : often it's what makes or breaks you when trying to get other people to " buy into you " - Your site / blog is your face -- make sure it looks good !

The Framework Mass Index : Why Your Web Framework Sucks and You Should Build Your Own ( Jeremy McAnally )
From the RubyFringe program booklet :
Frameworks are getting fat .
Many times it ’s just as easy to build your own stuff that does what you want rather than shoehorning what you want into an existing framework .
This talk will discuss experiences in shoving specific functionality into a general framework and some options for curing the problems that were encountered .
- Pete Forde : " It 's pronounced Mack - uh - NAL - lee . " -
They told me to come here and drop a brain bomb - I 'm going to present what is " just a bunch of old ideas that need to be repeated " - Beased on Obie 's earlier talk , I checked our site and realized that our contact page is broken .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wachovia
Corp posted a surprise first - quarter loss on Monday as credit problems from mortgages and other debt soared , prompting it to raise $ 7 billion of capital , slash its dividend and cut jobs .
Wachovia , the fourth - largest U.S. bank , sold shares at a discount after boosting its reserves for credit losses 16 - fold to $ 2.83 billion , and writing off $ 1.56 billion of debt , largely tied to the nation ’s housing slump and strained credit markets .
Wachovia will cut 500 corporate and investment banking jobs this quarter .
“ These actions are not without cost , and I wish they were not necessary , but they are , ” Chief Executive Ken Thompson said on a conference call .
Wachovia shares closed down $ 2.26 , or 8.1 percent , to $ 25.55 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The stock has slumped 32.8 percent this year , more than twice the 24 - member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index ’s 14.7 percent decline .
Most other major U.S. banks are scheduled to report quarterly results by April 22 .
Several have already raised capital , or cut dividends and jobs .
Wachovia has suffered from its $ 24.2 billion purchase of mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp in 2006 , near the peak of the U.S. housing boom .
The bank said the housing slump is only half over , and might not hit bottom until the middle of 2009 .
Wachovia ’s investment banking unit , a large packager of mortgage debt and provider of loans to fund corporate buyouts , has also struggled .
Standard & Poor ’s cut the bank ’s credit rating outlook to “ negative . ”
“ The Golden West deal could go down as one of the worst - timed transactions in recent memory , ” said Gerard Cassidy , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Portland , Maine .
“ Whenever you grow too fast , and an economic slowdown comes , you pay the price . ”
FIRST LOSS SINCE 2001
The first - quarter net loss was $ 350 million , or 20 cents per share , compared with a year - earlier profit of $ 2.3 billion , or $ 1.20 per share .
The quarterly loss was Wachovia ’s first since 2001 .
Excluding items , it lost $ 270 million , or 14 cents per share .
On that basis , analysts , on average , expected a profit of 47 cents per share , Reuters Estimates said .
Revenue fell 5 percent to $ 7.9 billion , missing the average $ 8.37 billion forecast .
The bank cut its quarterly dividend by 41 percent to 37.5 cents per share from 64 cents , saving $ 2.1 billion of capital a year .
In January , Thompson said the dividend was safe .

Wachovia sold $ 3.5 billion of common stock at $ 24 per share , or 13.7 percent below its Friday closing price .
It also sold $ 3.5 billion of preferred shares with a 7.5 percent dividend that convert into stock at a 30 percent premium .
Both offerings may grow 15 percent , boosting the sum raised to $ 8.05 billion .
The amounts are more than the $ 3.5 billion in preferred stock that Wachovia sold in February .
Wachovia plans no stock buybacks this year .
The bank ’s set - aside of $ 2.83 billion for loan losses included $ 1.1 billion for adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , known as “ Pick - a - Pay ” mortgages , that give homeowners payment options , including paying less than interest and principal due .
Results were hit hard in California , Golden West ’s former home .

Total net charge - offs quintupled to $ 765 million , and nonperforming assets more than quadrupled to $ 8.37 billion .
Thompson said Wachovia will de-emphasize option ARMs .
“ It ’s clear to me that we will move to a mortgage company with a balanced product line , ” he told reporters on a conference call .
Wachovia joins other struggling lenders such as Citigroup Inc and Washington Mutual Inc in raising capital .
Citigroup and National City Corp have cut their dividends , and Citigroup and Bank of America Corp have eliminated investment banking jobs .
“ They needed to do this , ” said Lee Delaporte , director of research at Dreman Value Management LLC in Jersey City , New Jersey , which invests $ 19 billion and owns Wachovia shares .
“ They ’re heavily exposed to some difficult areas . ”
CREDIBILITY
The corporate and investment banking unit lost $ 77 million in the quarter , including write - downs of $ 521 million tied to commercial mortgages , $ 339 million for subprime mortgages , $ 309 million for loans to fund corporate buyouts , $ 251 million for consumer mortgages and $ 144 million for nonsubprime debt .
Wachovia ended March with a Tier - 1 capital ratio of just 7.5 percent , up from 7.4 percent at the end of 2007 , despite February ’s preferred stock sale .
The ratio measures its ability to cover losses .
Regulators deem 6 percent sufficient .
Wachovia expects a ratio near 8.75 percent by the end of 2009 .
Before the Golden West purchase , Thompson had largely shed his predecessor ’s reputation for bad acquisitions .
He told reporters that Wachovia is not currently focused on mergers .
Profits in consumer and business banking -- Wachovia ’s largest unit -- fell 17 percent to $ 1.2 billion .
Capital management profits rose 22 percent to $ 381 million , while wealth management profit increased 10 percent to $ 92 million .
The semiconductor silicon and the ferromagnet iron are the basis for much of mankind 's technology , used in everything from computers to electric motors .
Writing in Nature , an international group of scientists from the UK , USA and Lesotho report that they have combined these elements with a small amount of another common metal , manganese , to create a new material which is neither a magnet nor an ordinary semiconductor .
They then show how a small magnetic field can be used to switch ordinary semiconducting behavior ( such as that seen in the electronic - grade silicon which is used to make transistors ) back on .
The magnetic moments associated with the mobile electrons ( red arrows ) responsible for electrical conduction and manganese atoms ( green arrows ) in manganese doped iron silicide ( Fe1 - xMnxSi ) .
This figure depicts the coupling of the magnetic moments as the temperature is reduced from room temperature ( top of the figure ) where the magnetic dipoles are independent , to very low temperature ( bottom of the figure ) where coupling between the dipoles creates regions where the moments add to zero ( light blue region ) .
The existence of a population of uncoupled complexes ( depicted here in the yellow region ) down to the lowest temperatures results in the material being neither a magnet nor common semiconductor .
External magnetic fields align these rare yellow regions to the magnetic field , switching on ordinary semiconducting behavior .

The new material exists in a quantum halfway house between magnet and semiconductor - in the same way that much more complex materials such as ceramics which exhibit high temperature superconductivity exist in quantum halfway houses between metals and magnetic insulators .
The research is of fundamental importance because it demonstrates , for the first time , a simple recipe for reaching this halfway house , whilst also suggesting new mechanisms for controlling electrical currents and magnetism in semiconductor devices .
Professor J.F. DiTusa of Louisiana State University and a co-author of the paper said : " It 's amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements . "
Professor Gabriel Aeppli of UCL ( University College London ) , another member of the research team and Director of the London Centre for Nanotechnology , added : " It might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers .
This would put what we 've seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies . "
The first author of the paper , Dr. N. Manyala of the National University of Lesotho , said : " We are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers .
These wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits . "
Dr. Ramirez , who is now with LGS - Bell Labs Innovations echoed this thought , noting that , " with the end of Moore 's law in sight , mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after . "
Military censorship of the war in Iraq
By Naomi Spencer
31 July 2008
Five years of bloody US occupation have seen numerous crimes against humanity unfold in Iraq .
Millions of Iraqi civilians have been killed and wounded , with millions more made into refugees .
Ancient , once - vibrant cities have been destroyed by air raids and chemical weapons .
Thousands of Iraqis have been imprisoned by the US military in barbaric conditions , and in many cases tortured .
In carrying out the occupation , more than 4,400 military personnel — most of them American — have died and tens of thousands have been wounded .
Little reflection of these realities is to be found , however , in the US media , particularly in visual form .
Censorship by the military — and self - censorship by media outlets — is part of an effort by the ruling elite to sanitize the war and keep the American public in the dark about its real nature .
As highlighted in a July 26 piece in the New York Times , titled “ 4,000 U.S. Deaths , and a Handful of Images , ” very few photographs of the occupation have trickled out from the military - embedded journalists and been released by the American media .
The military and Bush administration have imposed rules barring photos of flag - draped caskets , as well as documentation of battlefield casualties in which faces , ranks , or other identifiers are visible .
The Times notes , “ Even memorial services for killed soldiers , once routinely open , are increasingly off limits .
Detainees were widely photographed in the early years of the war , but the Department of Defense , citing prisoners ’ rights , has recently stopped that practice as well . ”
Journalists have also been forbidden from releasing images showing what the military deems to be sensitive information — anything from an image of American weaponry to the aftermath of an insurgent strike .
Journalists interviewed by the Times said that even tighter rules imposed last year , requiring written permission from wounded soldiers before their images could be used , were nearly impossible to satisfy in the case of seriously wounded and dying soldiers .
“ While embed restrictions do permit photographs of dead soldiers to be published once family members have been notified , ” the Times commented , “ in practice , the military has exacted retribution on the rare occasions that such images have appeared . ”
Clearly , none of these restrictions have anything to do with “ prisoners ’ rights ” or respect for the families of fallen soldiers .
To the contrary , the military ’s intent is to obscure from the American people the hellish reality in which prisoners and US soldiers alike have found themselves .
Indeed , while employing typical military jargon and doublespeak , Defense Department officials make no secret of the subject : free and easy access to photographs , print journalism , and first - hand accounts of the war are a “ vulnerability ” for US imperialism because it fuels antiwar sentiment in the population and within the military .
The Times article invites a comparison of Vietnam war - era photojournalism and coverage of the present occupation in Iraq : “ If the conflict in Vietnam was notable for open access given to journalists — too much , many critics said , as the war played out nightly in bloody newscasts — the Iraq war may mark an opposite extreme : after five years and more than 4,000 American combat deaths , searches and interviews turned up fewer than a half - dozen graphic photographs of dead American soldiers . ”
Significantly , the Times was able to document only five published images of war dead that had been released by embedded journalists .
In four of those cases , the paper notes , “ the photographer was immediately kicked out of his or her embed following publication of such photos . ”
The number of embedded journalists has been cut drastically in the last five years .
At the time of the invasion in 2003 , 770 journalists accompanied US forces .
Currently , according to the newspaper industry journal Editor & Publisher , only a dozen embedded journalists remain , about half of whom are photographers .
Even if they were granted complete liberty to witness and document the occupation , the idea that 12 journalists could adequately cover the operations of 150,000 troops around the country is absurd .
The first “ disembedded ” photojournalist documented by the Times was Stefan Zaklin , then of the European Pressphoto Agency , who was barred from working with the US Army after publishing a photo of a dead US officer in Fallujah in 2004 .
In 2005 , Chris Hondros of Getty Images was “ kicked out of his embed ” with an Army unit after photographing a young girl , screaming and covered in blood , after US soldiers killed her parents .
Two Times journalists were barred in January 2007 after the paper printed a photo of a fatally wounded soldier .
The soldier died within hours of being wounded , but the military insisted that the Times reporters violated rules by not getting his written permission to use his image .
The most recent barring of a photojournalist followed a devastating suicide bombing June 26 in Anbar province .
The bombing killed 20 people , including three Marines .
The photographer , Zoriah Miller , who goes by his first name , was among the first on the scene after the blast .
He documented scattered body parts , pools of blood and debris , and wounded and shocked survivors .
According to a July 17 piece in Photo District News , a photography industry magazine , Zoriah was told to “ stop photographing , delete his memory cards , [ and ] surrender his cameras ” .
Three days after family members had been notified of the Marine deaths , Zoriah published the images on his independent website .
The next morning , the Times reported , “ high - ranking Marine public affairs officers demanded that Mr. Miller remove the photos .
When he refused , his embed was terminated . ”
Zoriah wrote on his blog that officers claimed the military “ would not allow even the pants or shoes of an injured or killed Marine to be depicted in images . ”
On July 3 , the photographer was handed a letter claiming he had violated embed rules by publishing photos that revealed “ tactics , techniques and procedures witnessed during operations , ” and provided “ information on the effectiveness of enemy techniques . ”
“ Specifically , Mr. Miller provided our enemy with an after - action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of U.S. and Iraqi forces , ” Marine spokesman Lt. Col.
Chris Hughes told the Times .
Another Marine officer , Captain Esteban Vickers , waxed indignant to the paper : “ Mr. Miller ’s complete lack of respect to these marines , their friends , and families is shameful ...
How do we explain to their children or families these disturbing pictures just days after it happened ? ”
Zoriah countered : “ The fact that the images I took of the suicide bombing — which are just photographs of something that happens every day all across the country — the fact that these photos have been so incredibly shocking to people , says that whatever they are doing to limit this type of photo getting out , it is working . ”
“ It is absolutely censorship , ” the photographer told the Times .
“ I took pictures of something they did n’t like , and they removed me .
Deciding what I can and cannot document , I do n’t see a clearer definition of censorship . ”
In an earlier interview with PDN magazine , Zoriah commented : “ They embedded a war photographer , and when I took a photo of war , they disembedded me .
It ’s as if it ’s okay to take pictures of them handing lollipops to kids on the street and providing medical care , but photographing the actual war is unacceptable . ”
Indeed , the claim that documenting casualties aids the enemy is crafted to stifle information about almost any situation .
It has also been used to justify the military targeting of independent journalists and media outlets that document American atrocities .
The US bombings of independent Arab media Al - Jazeera offices in Kabul , Afghanistan , and in Baghdad served to quash critical coverage of the wars .
Photographers have been increasingly held back from combat zones .
James Lee , a photojournalist embedded with a Marine unit , told the Times that he was thwarted by commanders from entering Basra during the massive air assault and raid offensive in April .
He was told the military brass “ did not want any Western eyes down there . ”
As with Fallujah in 2004 , the sieges on Basra and Sadr City constituted major war crimes .
Over the course of a few days , hundreds of civilians and militiamen were slaughtered .
During the siege in Basra , hospital and health officials were prohibited from speaking to independent journalists .
American media dutifully reported Pentagon talking points , referring to killed civilians — even when children were counted among the dead — as “ terrorists , ” or at best “ collateral damage . ”
Such suppression of the truth is an expression of the larger crime of the war .
More fundamentally , however , military censorship and the self - censoring of the media reflect the immense and growing militarization of American political life .
For the first time in the dozen years of turmoil since state voters legalized medical marijuana , California ’s top law enforcement official stepped into the fray Monday with new guidelines designed in part to quell the ongoing friction between the state and federal authorities .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown issued an 11 - page directive intended to help legitimate patients avoid arrest while giving police the tools to distinguish legal medical marijuana operations from illegal cultivators and criminal middlemen .
He suggested his new “ road map ” would serve as a shield against the federal government , which has waged war against the state ’s pot rules by conducting raids and mounting court challenges .
“ Hopefully the feds will back off in instances where people are really following these guidelines , ” Brown said Monday in a telephone interview .

The guidelines affirm the legality of many of the state ’s medical marijuana dispensaries , but only those operated as collectives or cooperatives and not in business for profit .
“ Clearly there have been abuses , places that served as big fronts for illegal drug dealing , ” Brown said .
“ This will help get criminals out of medical marijuana . ”
An unlikely coalition of police and medical marijuana activists welcomed the new guidelines , the first substantial directive from a state agency since voters approved Proposition 215 in 1996 .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , I give this two thumbs up , ” said Kevin Reed of the Green Cross , a collective in San Francisco .
“ If you ’re in it for profit , you should n’t be in medical cannabis . ”

“ This is huge , ” said Kris Hermes of Americans for Safe Access , a pro-medical marijuana group .
“ Hopefully this will send a message to the federal government that California does n’t intend to deter from the course it has set . ”
The federal government maintains a strict prohibition against marijuana as medicine , and for more than a decade it has made California -- which has an estimated 200,000 cannabis- using patients -- the principal beachhead in the battle against medical marijuana .
Federal officials at the president ’s Office of National Drug Control Policy and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration did not return calls for comment .
Police , meanwhile , welcomed Brown ’s guidelines , saying they shed light on what had often seemed to them a shadowy world .

“ We have been operating in the dark for many years , ” said Jerry Dyer , Fresno ’s chief of police and president of the California Police Chiefs Assn .
Dealing with medical marijuana patients and dispensaries , he said , “ has been like trying to hit a moving target .
This allows us to know what the target is . ”
Brown ’s guidelines urge patients to apply for state - sanctioned medical marijuana ID cards -- and advise police to accept authenticated cards as proof of medical need .
Patients are prohibited from using cannabis near schools and recreation centers or at work , unless an employer gives permission .
Police , meanwhile , must return seized cannabis to patients who are later proved legitimate .

Brown takes a notably hard line on for - profit dispensaries .
Scores of storefront operations have sprouted up , often with business owners running virtual emporiums of cannabis .
Under the attorney general ’s guidelines , they must operate as not - for - profit collectives or cooperatives , and establishments are prohibited from buying marijuana from illegal , commercial growers .
Instead , the marijuana must be grown by patients or their caregivers , with fees limited to covering overhead and operating expenses .
Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy project questioned the nonprofit distinction , saying , “ The last I heard , Walgreens is n’t a charity . ”
Advertisement
But the rules essentially give police a green light to raid for - profit storefront dispensaries .
The guidelines also say that a dispensary that signs up patients after they simply fill out forms making the owner their primary caregiver is “ likely unlawful . ”
They suggest that investigating officers be alert to signs of mass production and illegal sales , including “ excessive amounts ” of marijuana and cash , weapons and other indicators of criminal activity .
“ We know that cartels are controlling many of the medical marijuana dispensaries operating for profit , ” said Dyer , the Fresno police chief .

“ I ’m hopeful the state will partner with local police and the feds to shut down the cartels . ”

When the earth shook in Los Angeles last week , the first reports did n't come from traditional media outlets , but from Twitter , the " micro- blogging " service where users can send short , instant status updates to their friends via e-mail and mobile phone .
Ten minutes before the Associated Press reported news of the tremor , a Twitter user named Caroline ( Vixy ) posted a simple update : " Earthquake . "
Blogs and news sites buzzed the next day about how Twitter had ushered in a new era of communication .
Such proclamations would have most internet entrepreneurs seeing dollar signs .
But not Biz Stone , who insists Twitter 's mission is simply to provide a useful , robust service and let the dollars follow later .
" At this point , given that we have plenty of money in the bank , it makes a lot more sense not to distract ourselves with trying to put the finishing touches on a revenue plan , " says the 34 - year - old Stone , who founded Twitter with Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams in 2006 .
Stone 's hesitance to " monetize " Twitter echoes that of other major Web 2.0 companies , such as Facebook and YouTube , whose founders have said they 'd build their audience first and find revenue streams later .
But those giants have shown that converting eyeballs into money has n't exactly been easy ; Facebook has yet to start generating meaningful profit , and Google has said on a number of occasions that it has yet to find the right business model for monetizing YouTube 's considerable traffic .
Twitter , despite some plans Stone has up his sleeve , may very well find itself in the same position .
Today Twitter makes a negligible amount of revenue from users that send and receive messages as SMS texts , and overall loses an undisclosed amount of money .
But Twitter 's user base has undeniably skyrocketed .
The service has grown to more than 2 million per month , ten times more than April 2007 , according to Compete.com .
As of March 2008 , 200,000 active Twitter users per week sent 3 million updates per day , according to numbers obtained by TechCrunch .
Indeed , the service 's growth has caught the company by surprise , and outages are not uncommon .
On the heels of all this growth , Twitter announced a new round of funding in June , raising a reported $ 20 million in financing from V.C. 's Spark Capital and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at a $ 100 million valuation .
But Stone is unconcerned about Twitter 's current lack of profits or even revenues , saying too much focus on these things would be " a distraction " for Twitter .
For one thing , the company is improving its infrastructure so the service does n't keep getting overloaded .
" Unless we have a reliable service that works the way we think it should , " Stone says , focusing on revenue " is really putting the cart before the horse . "
Longer term , Stone , who previously worked on startups Xanga , Blogger.com , and Odeo , sees the company as a new paradigm for how people will find out about and respond to news in the future , with potential revenues to match .
But one idea that Stone is considering simply capitalizes on the user behavior his network has helped to establish : real - time news .
" For over the last 200 years , you 've seen big companies grow off the concept of real - time updates , " he says .
" If you look at media companies like Thomson Reuters or Bloomberg , or the stock exchange , people and businesses are dependent on real - time news coming in as it happens .
Twitter is similar , except it 's much broader than just one kind of news , like stock updates .
So when you think of it that broadly as a utility , I think you can begin to imagine how big the potential is for Twitter as a commercial entity . "
The most obvious solution to how Twitter can make money would be to serve advertising directly in a user 's Twitter feed ( or " timeline " as the company calls it ) , or elsewhere on the site .
But Stone and his fellow execs are wary of alienating Twitter 's hardcore user base , which has grown accustomed to an ad - free service .
" How would they respond to us putting ads on the site ? "
Stone says .
" Are we going to end up pissing them off ? "
Stone says the key to making advertising acceptable to the Twitter community is ensuring that users choose which commercial messages they are exposed to , a lesson Facebook failed to heed last year when it was forced to quickly abandon its disastrous Beacon marketing system .
But as with other potential revenue models under consideration , Stone would not elaborate on how he'd use such an opt - in system on Twitter .
One of Twitter 's most likely revenue streams is through advertisements in search results where messages could be tied to what users were searching on .
Twitter recently purchased Summize , a search engine specifically designed to sift through Twitter messages , for a reported $ 15 million in cash and stock .
" There is a pretty obvious opportunity there , " Stone says .
" There is a level of intent that someone is showing when they come to a Twitter search and type in , say , ' iPhone . ' "
Another possible revenue stream is corporations paying to use the service to stay in frequent contact with their customers .
Several large companies , including Dell , Whole Foods , and JetBlue , have already set up corporate presences on Twitter to let customers know about special offers and even answer customer questions .
In Dell 's case , the company says it 's made " well over " $ 500,000 in sales from sending special offers from its Dell Outlet store to its Twitter group , which it began in June 2007 .
The group has almost 1,500 " followers " who receive its messages on a regular basis .
" This is where are our customers are going , " says Bob Pearson , Dell 's vice president for communities and conversations .
" These folks are influencers , and they want to talk about the hottest or latest stuff going on . "
Dell also answers individual user questions via its Twitter group , which is what companies like JetBlue ( almost 3,500 followers ) and Whole Foods ( 2,000 - plus followers ) primarily use Twitter for .
To a company like Dell , $ 500,000 is a relatively small amount , but it does hint at the potential windfall companies can reap from Twitter .
" If you 've got 1,000 people following you , something 's happening , " Pearson says .
" The real potential is in the future when you 've got 10,000 people following . "
While Stone says charging corporate users for a Twitter presence is something he might consider doing , it 's not at all clear that companies would be willing to pony up for it .
When asked whether Dell would consider paying Twitter for , say , each user that signed up to receive its feed , Pearson says " probably not . "
Whole Foods and JetBlue both say it 's too early to say whether they'd be willing to pay Twitter for its service .
" One of the beauties of Twitter is that anyone can go on , and it does n't cost anything , " says Pearson .
" There are other ways that Twitter can monetize its site , through advertising or other means .
They do n't have to be charging business customers to be part of it .
But that 's for them to think through . "
( Real Simple ) -- Life coach Gail Blanke went to acting school to learn to improvise in any situation .
Turns out the tricks that actors use on stage can help you score a date , land a job -- or just make any conversation more engaging
If you repeat what someone else says and then start next phrase with ' and ' that comment can become conversation .
There 's no getting around it .
We live in an unscripted world .
You can rehearse in front of a mirror till the cows come home -- for that job interview , for that meeting where you 're expected to speak , for the moment when you finally walk up to that very attractive guy at the gym and introduce yourself .
But the minute there 's another person involved , the script goes out the window .
If you mean to make an impression , you have to be able to think on your feet , hurl yourself into the moment , and improvise .
How ?
Well , obviously , some people are simply naturals .
To help the rest of us develop some techniques , I turned to the professionals .
An actor friend had told me about the Upright Citizens Brigade ( UCB ) , a highly respected training center for comic improv in New York City , so I called up the academic supervisor , Joe Wengert , and asked if I could sit in on one of his classes .
Luckily , he said yes .
And saying yes , it turns out , is nothing less than the heart and soul of improv .
But more on that in a minute .
Real Simple :
When friends behave badly
Here 's the first thing I learned in that class :
Advancing the dialogue -- or " moving the scene forward , " as they say in the acting world -- is what improvising is all about .
It 's the same deal if you are onstage , in a boardroom , or trying to get your point across at a PTA meeting .
" Dead air " is verboten in acting , and it does n't work too well in life , either .
You either take the conversation into new territory or you kill it .
So to make better connections with people and to get what you want -- whether it's a promotion at work , a new relationship , or simply a delightful conversation -- you have to be ready to " move the scene forward . "
I watched the 14 men and women in that improv class invent hilarious , fast - moving dialogue on the spur of the moment with words like " beach , " " reunion , " or ( my favorite ) " eating contest " as their only direction .
And , boy , did they take the scenes to some pretty wild places .
Still , I actually believed them .
What 's their secret ?
Interestingly , all the improv actors I spoke to pretty much agreed that the following three principles are at the heart of their art .
And , without exception , they use them to propel conversations forward in their real lives , too .
1. The " yes ...and " technique
How it works :
Say two actors are given the words " blueberry pie " with which to create a scene .
It might go :
Actor 1 : " I made a blueberry pie . "
Actor 2 : " Yes , you made a blueberry pie .
And you remember the last time we had blueberry pie ? "
Actor 1 : " Yes , I remember .
We took a picnic into the woods , and that 's when you said you wanted to join a nudist colony . "
You see what 's happening ?
Suddenly there 's a story ; suddenly there 's a direction and a purpose .
Using the simple words " yes ...and " moves the scene into new territory , and that 's where new possibilities occur .
How to make it work for you :
So let 's say it 's Monday and you 're at the gym and that very attractive guy says , " It was a beautiful weekend . "
If all you say is " Yes , it was great , " that ends the conversation right there .
But if you say , " Yes , it was great .
And I really made the most of it .
I went to a concert in the park and brought my yellow Lab .
He snatched a sandwich right out of the hands of some poor woman having a picnic .
But we had fun . "
Now you 've got something .
You can follow up with " Do you like dogs ? " or " Have you ever been to a concert in the park ? "
And , bingo , the next thing you know , you 're on your way to another concert in the park with none other than that very attractive guy .
( Maybe minus the dog . )
The " yes ... and " technique gives you the chance to acknowledge what 's been said and then move the conversation to a new place , where you just might discover something -- or someone -- delightful .
Using " yes ...and " can also help you direct a conversation to where you want it to go .
Here 's an example : Your son says , " I hate my math teacher . "
Instead of saying , " Well , that 's just silly " or , distractedly , " Aha , " and ending the conversation right there , you could say , " Yes , you hate your math teacher .
And that reminds me of how much you hated your history teacher -- until you started to love her .
Remember ?
I mean , things can change , right ? "
I recently tried " yes...and " at a meeting of the board of governors of the small golf club in Connecticut that I belong to .
One board member gravely announced some disturbing news :
" The porta - potty is quite close to the women 's tee on the seventh hole , and some of the women have complained about the , uh , odor and noise . "
There was silence while we all pondered this momentous issue .
" Yes , " I said , leaping in .
" It 's close all right .
And we should move it to the men's tee . "
It got a laugh , but more important , new suggestions were offered , the problem was resolved , and we moved on .
I mean , I definitely " forwarded the scene . "
Real Simple : Easy ways to exit awkward situations
2 . Go with your gut
How it works : Improv actors do n't think too much before they speak .
And , in the experience of those I spoke to , the first , intuitive thought is usually the best anyway .
" There 's no time to rationalize , no time to weigh the pros and cons of your response , " says Mike Ross , a 34 - year - old lawyer and a student at the UCB .
Or as Yogi Berra put it : " You ca n't think and hit at the same time . "
How to make it work for you :
Try to break the habit of second - guessing yourself before you speak .
While you 're busy thinking up the " right " response , that awkward silence is settling in .
Imagine that you 're in a job interview .
Of course you 've memorized your list of " strengths " and come up with a good answer for the inevitable question about your " weaknesses " and all the reasons why you'd be perfect in this position .
But your prospective boss does n't ask you about any of that .
Instead , she says , " So what in the world would make you want to join a crazy company like this , where people work around the clock and just about everything changes every day ? "
Rather than struggling to come up with the perfect scripted response by saying , " Well , uh , you ask an interesting question .
Let 's see , I , uh ... , " listen to the voice inside your head .
Trust it .
And start speaking without critiquing yourself ( which is when those ums and uhs jump in ) .
Maybe you 'll say , " Well , why do you do it ? " which is n't perfect , but it 's just fine .
Or " Well , if you love what you 're doing , I guess it does n't matter , does it ? "
Or maybe you 'll blurt out something like " What ?
Are you all nuts ? "
In which case , you 'll probably break the ice and get a laugh .
The key is to trust your instinct .
And the key to that is to practice , so when it comes to the crunch , you know your intuition is n't going to pull any lousy tricks on you .
Try these exercises to hone your intuitive responses .
• " Watch Desperate Housewives or 30 Rock and assume you are one of the characters , " suggests Mike .
" Respond out loud to whatever is going on with whatever comes into your head .
Be outrageous , be crazy , but keep the scene going . "
Will you put your foot in your mouth sometimes ?
Absolutely .
In improv , you go on as if that 's what you meant to do .
If you act like you meant it , the audience will buy it .
That works in real life , too .
• Play speed improv games with friends at a dinner party or on the beach .
Throw out a word or a phrase , like " shower curtain , " " police precinct , " or " family reunion . "
Tell them about the " yes ... and " technique and take turns creating a fast - talking scene where you have to think on the fly .
Real Simple : How to handle sticky situations
3 . Make everyone else in your group look good .
How it works :
Here 's what you learn in improv :
You 're nothing without somebody else .
There 's nothing to improvise without someone to improvise with .
The more you trust others to be your props , the more you invite them to shine , the stronger you get .
Sammy Buck , a 39 - year - old UCB student and a writer said he was astounded at how much satisfaction he feels when playing a supporting role in a scene .
" In improv , I 've learned I 'm as happy to help move things forward as I am to take the lead , " he says .
" Maybe even happier . "
How to make it work for you :
In any situation , practice acknowledging the others in your group ( the " yes " ) and always make an effort to promote their ideas ( the " and " ) .
It quite simply makes for better conversation .
For instance , you 're at the first meeting of a newly formed book club .
You 've read the book .
You 've even made notes about what you liked and did n't like .
You 're really prepared to look smart .
But that 's not what you 're here for , is it ?
So when the host asks , " What did you think of the book ?
Did you like it ? " instead of running through your list of critiques , you say , " Yes , I loved it .
I thought it was so touching , especially at the end .
But I was really impressed when Lydia told me how she thought the ending could have been different .
I 'd love to hear her talk more about that . "
It 's such a relief -- and so much more enjoyable for everyone -- when you do n't have to prove yourself to be the smartest person in the room .
It 's so easy to incorporate these improv techniques into your life .
And , with a bit of practice and observation , you 'll be winging it like a pro before you know it .
Whenever you have a chance , watch improv artists at work and learn from them .
Catch Larry David on HBO 's " Curb Your Enthusiasm , " which uses dialogue that is largely improvised .
Or rent any Robin Williams movie .
Boy , talk about tapping into your intuition !
Nobody does it better or has more fun with it .
Better still , consider taking an improv class yourself .
Check the listings for local acting schools or community centers .
Bring a friend with you .
Let yourself go .
And , hey , you might even move your own scene forward in ways you never dreamed you could .

Many people say they have lost everything in the flooding
At least 20 people have been killed after a boat capsized while carrying dozens of refugees from flooding in the Indian state of Bihar , say police .
More than 70 people have now died in the floods and hundreds of thousands are stranded without food or water .
Indian soldiers are using boats and helicopters to reach several hundred remote villages .
The flooding occurred as water flowing from Nepal caused the Kosi river to breach its banks and change course .

The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Bihar says more rain is expected in the next two days so authorities are moving as swiftly as they can to evacuate villages before the waters rise again .
The continuing bad weather is hampering efforts to get aid to about 2.5 million people who have been displaced .
' National calamity '
Our correspondent says many of those stranded in remote villages are sitting on the roofs of their submerged homes .
How we rescued survivors
See how the river changed course
There is an acute shortage of food and some people are eating uncooked rice and drinking stagnant water to stay alive .
Tens of thousands of people have crowded into temporary relief camps .
The boat incident took place on Friday in the worst - affected district , Madhepura , 150 km ( 95 miles ) north - east of Bihar 's capital , Patna .
Police said 40 people were saved .
ON Bhaskar , superintendent of police , told the Associated Press news agency : " The boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board . "
Angry villagers in Madhepura said they had no idea where to take shelter and complained they had received no food or aid .
" We have lost everything , " said Bimlesh Yadav , escaping with his family to a nearby town .
" All our belongings have been submerged in the floodwaters .
We are leaving to save our children . "
Mohanlal Sharma of the BBC's Hindi service in Madhepura said the road between Madhepura and Purnea districts was under 10 feet of water .
" Along the route , I saw thousands of villagers running towards the town .
Some were on foot , some on their bicycles .
Some were taking their cattle .
Villagers have loaded their entire life 's acquisitions on ox - carts and are trying to escape the waters . "
Indian PM Manmohan Singh , who visited the affected areas in Bihar on Thursday , said the flooding was a " national calamity " .
He has announced an aid package worth $ 230 m ( £ 115 m ) .
But aid agencies say many of the victims are being moved to temporary shelters which lack basic amenities .
A report released by Unicef says there are fears of infectious diseases at the camps .
Army and air force helicopters are continuing to provide aid to the flood - ravaged parts and 600 boats are helping with the relief and rescue work .
But the floods have washed away roads and railway tracks , and water and electricity supplies have been affected in many areas .
" This situation is beyond comprehension , " Bihar resident , Arshad Khaqani , told the BBC News website .
Nepal 's damage The Kosi river flows from Nepal where it is called the Saptakoshi river .
On 18 August a dam on the Saptakoshi burst , triggering the subsequent flooding in Bihar .
Officials in Nepal say hundreds of people there have been hit by illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia and an estimated 50,000 are homeless .
They say nearly 1,000 houses have been completely destroyed .
Power supplies and transport have been severely affected .
The costs to the economy are now estimated at one billion Nepalese rupees ( $ 14.25 m ) .

What are these ?
From Conservapedia
The Earth is the third planet in the Solar System .
It is the largest of the terrestrial planets and is the only known planet which has life as we know it .
The surface of the planet is approximately two - thirds covered in water .
The atmosphere is roughly 78 % nitrogen and 21 % oxygen , with trace amounts of water vapor , carbon dioxide , and other elements .
Both the Bible and the available scientific evidence indicate the earth is about 6,000 years old ( see also : Age of the Earth ) . [ 5 ]
Physical Description
Within the Solar System , Earth is the third planet from the Sun .
It is approximately 8,000 miles ( 13,000 km ) in diameter ; its equatorial circumference ( measured around the equator ) is 24,901 miles ( 40,075 kilometers ) , and the polar circumference is slightly less at 24,809 miles ( 40,008 km ) . [ 6 ]
The reason its metric circumference is so close to the " round number " of 40,000 is that the kilometer was defined ( by the French ) as 1/10,000th the distance from the Equator to the North Pole .
Its surface area is approximately 4·π ( 4000 mi ) 2 = 200 million square miles ( 510 million km2 ) .
It has been said that Earth should really be called " water " , as the larger part of it — about 70 % — is covered by water .
In fact , the Pacific and Indian oceans alone cover about half of the Earth 's surface .
The Earth orbits at an average distance of about 93 million miles ( 150 million km ) from the Sun in an almost circular orbit .
The plane of this orbit , or ecliptic , is the common reference plane for the inclinations of the orbits of all planets and dwarf planets in the Solar System , though in fact Earth 's orbit is inclined 7.25° to the plane of the Sun 's equator .
It takes light ( and other forms of electromagnetic radiation ) approximately 500 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth , i.e. the distance can also be stated as " 500 light - seconds . "
The distance to nearby stars is made by measuring the stellar parallax between observations when the earth is at opposite ends of its orbit , so the Earth 's orbit itself is a measuring stick for astronomical distances , and is known as the astronomical unit ( A. U. )
It is worth noting that if the Earth were slightly closer to the Sun , it would be too hot for life while if Earth were slightly further away from the Sun , water would freeze and life as we know it would be impossible .
Origin
People disagree about when and how the Earth was created .
The three most popular ideas are :
Clashes between adherents of these ideas have gone on since time immemorial ( see origins debate ) , though the last theory has only matured in the last 200 years .
Young Earth Creationist view
Formation and Age
Young Earth creationists believe , on the basis of the biblical account in Genesis and biblical geochronologies , that the entire Earth , including animal , plant , and human life , was formed in six days , around 4000 B.C. Mainstream scientific journals , committed to a naturalistic worldview , contend this view . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
Most scientists believe that the Earth formed by natural processes instead of having been created by a supernatural entity .
However , as one scientist noted , “ ... most every prediction by theorists about planetary formation has been wrong . ” [ 11 ]
Magnetosphere
Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field powerful enough to prevent most of the Sun 's radiation from reaching the Earth and harming the life on it .
This field has been decaying at a known exponential rate , as decades of recordkeeping reveal .
In 1984 , Dr. Russell Humphreys developed a model for the creation of magnetic fields [ 4 ] that suggests that the Earth was at first made entirely of water , [ 12 ] much of which God transmuted into other elements after He made the Earth , probably on the third day of Creation .
Humphreys 's predicted magnetic decay time for the Earth agrees well with published data and thus constitutes further evidence for a young Earth .
Shape of the Earth
Some people dispute the shape of the Earth , arguing that the Bible describes the Earth as flat ( presumably square , given that it is described as having " four corners " ( Revelations 7:1 ) ) rather than spherical .
However , no credible organization has ever expressed support for this theory . [ 13 ]
Some have disputed the idea that the Earth rotates around the Sun . [ 14 ]
In Revelations 7:1 it is stated :
" And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth ... " ( Revelations 7:1 )
A sphere has no corners .
The four corners are also mentioned in Isaiah 11:12 .
This is often accepted to be a figure of speech .
It is also stated :
" Then was the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold , broken to pieces together , and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors ; and the wind carried them away , that no place was found for them : and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain , and filled the whole earth . "
( Daniel 2:35 )
AND
" Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
The tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth : " ( Daniel 4:10 - 11 )
AND
" Behold , [ Jesus ] cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him " ( Revelations 1:7 )
AND
" Once again , the devil took him to a very high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world [ cosmos ] in their glory . "
( Matthew 4:8 )
Apologist JP
Holding 's take on this is that this may have been a vision . [ 15 ]
Christianity and the Earth
Christian Historical - Grammatical Bible Exegesis or Bible Literalism
According to Creation Ministries International , most young earth creationists use a hermeneutic " best described as the historical - grammatical method in which historical narrative ( such as the book of Genesis ) is interpreted as literal history , prophecy is interpreted as prophecy , poetry is interpreted as poetry , etc . " [ 16 ]
Creation Ministries International further states that " Historical - grammatical exegesis involves a systematic approach to analyzing in detail the historical situation , events and circumstances surrounding the text , and the semantics and syntactical relationships of the words which comprise the text . " [ 17 ]
Bible scholars have estimated the age of the earth based on the Creation account in Genesis and the genealogical accounts in Numbers and other books of the Pentateuch .
One famous estimate was published in 1650 by James Ussher Archbishop of Armagh in a book called Annals of the World , in which he estimated the Creation to have occurred on 23 October 4004 B.C. Other Biblical scholars maintain that there are possible gaps in the genealogies , often using the ideas of the 19th century Calvinist theologian Benjamin Warfield on the issue . [ 18 ]
However , James Barr , regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford University , wrote in 1984 the following : " … probably , so far as I know , there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world - class university who does not believe that the writer (s ) of Genesis 1 –11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that : … the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical story . ’ " [ 19 ]
Furthermore , it should be noted that Barr himself rejects supernatural Christianity , and so is not a priori biased in favor of creationism . [ 20 ]
Many Christians believe that the Earth is the perfect distance away from the Sun and take this to be evidence of God 's existence . [ 21 ]
Secular scientists , however , reject this reasoning using the anthropic principle . [ 22 ]
Christian Non-Literalism
Many mainstream Christian denominations believe the story of Genesis is not meant to be read literally , and believe that the age of the Earth is on the order of millions or billions of years , not thousands of years . [ 23 ]
Scientific Uniformitarianism
Uniformitarian scientists believe that the earth is beyond 4 billion years old . [ 24 ]
They also refute that the Earth is only 6,000 years old by quoting older human societies dated by their dating method as older than that . [ 25 ]
Naturalistic view
Estimates by uniformitarian geologists of the age of the Earth and the beginning of life give about 4.55 billion years and 3.5 billion years ago respectively .
These estimates are primarily based on radioactive dating of meteorites and fossil specimens .
Most scientists today conclude that the Earth formed by natural processes , specifically by the accumulation of debris orbiting the sun billions of years in the past . [ 26 ]

Reality is variously defined as the totality of everything that exists , or as an aspect of a thing which exists independent of anyone 's awareness or perception of that aspect .
Reality is independent of the human mind , i.e. reality would continue to be the case whether or not anyone believed it , or indeed whether or not there were any human minds to believe it in the first place .
" That which , when you stop believing in it , does n't go away . " -- Philip K. Dick
" You can avoid reality , but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality . "
[ 1 ] -- Ayn Rand
Something that is said to be a " fact " is a concept , statement , thing , scientific law , or event that has been unequivocally ( indisputably ) proven to be reality , i.e. truth .
Facts are always based on concrete , verified evidence which substantiates their reality .
However , on the other hand , a too strict application of this procedure might result in a closed - minded materialist worldview .
Few would argue that some aspects of reality , namely the divine , should be subjected to a strict materialist critique , because these methods still rely on imperfect human understanding of the world .
Combining a reality - based outlook on life in everyday matters while still maintaining a strong reliance on the - no less real - truth derived from higher sources is a reasonable way to realize the potential as well as the limitations of human understanding of reality .
M. Scott Peck described sanity as " dedication to reality at all costs " .
Ontology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the study of reality .
An entry in a physics glossary :
We say that science studies the " real " world of perception and measurement .
If we can apprehend something with our senses , or measure it , we treat it as " real " .
We have learned not to completely trust our unaided senses , for we know that we can be fooled by illusions , so we rely more on specially designed measuring instruments .
Yet much of the language of science has entities that are not directly observable by our senses , such as " energy " , and " momentum " .
These are , however , directly related to observables and defined through exact equations .
Philosophers may argue whether the " real " world exists , but so long as our sense impressions and measurements of this real world are shared by independent observers and are precisely repeatable , we can do physics without philosophical concerns . [ 1 ]
Monorealism
Monorealism , a term coined by the Church of Reality is a world view that there is only one true reality that includes all other realities , parallel dimensions , universes , next worlds , deities , that are actually real .
Everything that exists , that which is real , that which is true , is all part of reality .
That which is not real , fiction , imaginary beings , stories , and things that do not exist are not part of reality .
In this world view there are two and only two mutually exclusive classes , real and unreal , and everything is in one of these classes and not the other .
Kucinich to bring single article of impeachment for misleading US into war Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) is sticking to his drive to impeach President Bush .
Few in the House of Representatives have any intention of doing anything with the last 35 articles of impeachment Kucinich set before them last month , so the former presidential candidate appears to be lightening the load .
Kucinich sent a letter to colleagues Tuesday asking them to support a single article of impeachment , to be introduced Thursday , which accuses President Bush of leading the country to war based on lies .
" There can be no greater offense of a Commander in Chief than to misrepresent a cause of war and to send our brave men and women into harm 's way based on those misrepresentations , " Kucinich wrote in the " Dear Colleague " letter .
" There has been a breach of faith between the Commander in Chief and the troops .
Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 or with Al Qaeda 's role in 9/11 .
Iraq had neither the intention nor the capability of attacking the United States , " he continued .
" Iraq did not have weapons of Mass of Destruction .
Yet George W. Bush took our troops to war under all of these false assumptions .
Given the profound and irreversible consequences to our troops , if his decision was the result of a mistake , he must be impeached .
Since his decision was based on lies , impeachment as a remedy falls short , but represents at least some effort on our part to demonstrate our concern about the sacrifices our troops have made . "
Last month , Kucinich presented 35 articles of impeachment .
Those have since been referred to the Judiciary Committee , where they are expected to die .
Kucinich threatened to double the number of impeachment articles if the Judiciary Committee did not act .
In a video message , Kucinich thanked supporters for responding to his Independence Day call for Bush 's impeachment .
In the video , Kucinich said his threat for more articles was still operative and promised an update later this week .
Kucinich 's full letter to his colleagues is reprinted below : Dear Colleague ,
During the Fourth of July holiday a WWII veteran stood ram - rod straight in his crisp dress uniform and saluted our flag as it passed in a parade .
His silent reverential stance was a powerful reminder of the love of country that is reflected in our veterans of all generations and all services .
It is also a powerful reminder of the responsibilities of the President of the Untied States in his capacity as Commander in Chief .
It is worse than heartbreaking that George W. Bush , as Commander in Chief , caused this country to go to war based on information which was false , and which he knew to be false .
The consequences for our troops have been devastating .
We have lost 4,116 of our beloved servicemen and women since the war began , with over 30,000 physically wounded and countless others emotionally wounded .
The toll on the service persons and their families will be felt throughout their lives .
There can be no greater responsibility of a Commander in Chief than to command based on facts on the ground , and to command in fact and in truth .
There can be no greater offense of a Commander in Chief than to misrepresent a cause of war and to send our brave men and women into harm 's way based on those misrepresentations .
There has been a breach of faith between the Commander in Chief and the troops .
Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 or with Al Qaeda 's role in 9/11 .
Iraq had neither the intention nor the capability of attacking the United States .
Iraq did not have weapons of Mass of Destruction .
Yet George W. Bush took our troops to war under all of these false assumptions .
Given the profound and irreversible consequences to our troops , if his decision was the result of a mistake , he must be impeached .
Since his decision was based on lies , impeachment as a remedy falls short , but represents at least some effort on our part to demonstrate our concern about the sacrifices our troops have made .
This Thursday evening I will bring a privileged resolution to the House with a single Article of Impeachment of President Bush for taking our nation and our troops to war based on lies .
We owe it to our troops who even at this hour stand as sentinels of America because they love this country and will give their lives for it .
What are we willing to do to match their valor and the valor of their successors ?
Are we at least willing to defend the Constitution from the comfort and security of our Washington , DC offices ?
Sincerely ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Member of Congress
The virulently anti-gay American Family Association generates buzz and media attention year after year by launching outlandish boycott campaigns – McDonald ’s is the latest target .
It also does n’t hurt that their flamboyant founder and chairman , Don Wildmon , more than lives up to his name .
PR is the lifeblood of a group like AFA , so you might think that they ’d be thrilled when a longtime supporter of the group rocketed to the top of the media charts .
Maybe so , but not when that supporter happens to be the FBI ’s only suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks – Bruce Ivins .
Indeed , the nation learned today that Ivins and his wife – who served as president of a local anti-abortion group – were strongly committed to the AFA :
Donations were made to AFA in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Ivins 11 times between 1993 and 1997 .
Another donation by the couple was recorded one month after an article about the Greendale incident appeared in the AFA Journal .
The Ivins subscribed to the Journal until March 2005 .
And his support for the AFA actually helped the FBI catch him :
Bureau investigators also connected the fictitious return address on the second round of anthrax letters – the “ Greendale School ” of Franklin Park , N.J. – to a charity well - known to Ivins .

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Toshiba Corp. claimed that the newly - launched ultraportable laptop , the Portege R500 - S5007V , is the world 's lightest , according to U.S. media reports Wednesday .
The claim came after the Tokyo - headquartered electronics manufacturer announced it added a 128 GB solid state drive ( SSD ) to its straw - weight laptop .
The Portege R500 now measures 0.77 inches ( about 1.96 cm ) at its thinnest point and weighs at just 2.4 pounds ( 1.08 kg ) , compared to Apple 's MacBook Air , 3 pounds ( about 1.36 kg ) , and Lenovo 's Thinkpad X300 , around 2.93 pounds ( about 1.33kg ) .
The new laptop is outfitted with a 7 mm DVD SuperMulti Drive to go with the new SSD , which consumes less power as it has no moving parts like a hard drive and gives the battery more runtime .
According to the company , the laptop can run for eight hours on a single battery charge .
The notebook also features a 1.33 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo chip and a transreflective backlit LED screen .
Porteges with the SSD will cost 2,995 U.S dollars , roughly 1,000 dollars more than the versions with hard disks in the 120 GB to 160 GB range .
The laptop will start shipping in the third quarter this year , according to the company .
But it was n't available to comment on worldwide availability .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve ’s decision to cut interest rates in response to the U.S. financial market crisis of the past year is a bad mistake that will lead to higher inflation , a former Bank of England official said on Saturday .

In a paper presented at the Federal Reserve ’s annual conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , the London School of Economics professor Willem Buiter , comes down hard on the Fed for misjudging the effects of the U.S. housing market slump .
“ The Fed over - reacted to the slowdown in economic activity , ” Buiter writes .
“ It cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation . ”
“ The official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues , ” he adds .
As rising default rates on home mortgages and falling house prices in the U.S. housing market impacted the value of financial assets worldwide in the past year , the Fed cut its benchmark borrowing rate down to from 5.25 percent last summer to the current 2.0 percent , and has held them steady at the past two policy meetings .
Buiter agrees with the general consensus at the Fed , which is only now beginning to be questioned , that asset price bubbles cannot be adequately dealt with through monetary policy .
However , Buiter writes that proper regulation might have done what the federal funds rate cannot .
By sitting idly by while investment banks and hedge funds were taking wild risks in financial markets , the Fed itself holds some responsibility for the developments of the past year , the author argues .
“ I do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts , ” says Buiter .
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England do not entirely escape Buiter ’s sharp critique .
He praises them for resisting pressure to push interest rates lower , but says they too have threatened the independence of central banks by erring on the side of doing too much .
“ All three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi - fiscal agents of the state , providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions , ” Buiter says .
The implications of these actions are far reaching , the author says , and will be felt in the form of inflation pressures that are already showing up prominently in the latest data releases .
U.S. consumer prices jumped 5.6 percent in the year to July , the highest reading since the early 1990s .
Against that backdrop , the central bank ’s credibility has already been tarnished , according to Buiter .
“ The Fed ’s reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented , ” he said in an e-mail interview .
Another key error on the central bank ’s part was to overestimate the role of falling prices on overall economic activity , and to give too much credit to the productive use of purely financial businesses .
“ Much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning , driven by regulatory arbitrage and tax efficiency considerations , ” concludes Buiter .

The Army is moving ahead with plans to mount a laser cannon on a massive , 35 - ton - plus truck .
The service just handed Boeing a $ 36 million contract to " continue developing a truck - mounted , high - energy laser weapon system that will destroy rockets , artillery shells and mortar rounds , " according to a company statement .
* Under the High Energy Laser Technology Demonstrator ( HEL TD ) Phase II
contract , awarded Aug. 15 , Boeing will complete the design of , then build , test and evaluate , a rugged beam control system on a Heavy
Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck .
Boeing also will develop the system - engineering requirements for the entire HEL TD laser weapon system . *
Low power demonstrations are scheduled for 2010 , with battlefield - strength laser tests to follow in 2013 .
About a year ago , the Army asked Boeing and Northrop Grumman to work up preliminary designs for the HEL beam control system – and promised to choose a winning model by 2009 .
So the program appears to be on track .
And it's one of a number of energy weapon projects that have been picking up steam , after decades of unfulfilled promise .
Relatively easy - to - deploy electric lasers have just about worked their way up to weapons - grade .
Boeing recently test - fired the real - life ray gun on its Advanced Tactical Laser – a blaster - equipped gunship .
Raytheon has worked up a prototype of its Phalanx mortar - shooter that uses fiber lasers , instead of traditional ammo , to knock down targets .
Even the eternally - delayed Airborne Laser – a modified 747 , designed to zap ballistic missiles – may finally get a long - awaited flight test .

People of a certain generation remember when a wire connected the headset to your phone , your phone to the wall and your wall to the world .
The big advance in the 1990s was -- amazingly -- freeing the handset from the wire , allowing you to roam more than a few feet while talking .
Now , according to new data released this morning by Nielsen , more people are taking the wire completely out of the equation .
And the whole concept of a landline appears to be going the way of the bulky rotary phone ( pictured at right ) .
More than 20 million U.S. households -- 17 % of all homes with phones -- use only a cellphone , according to Nielsen .
That figure has quadrupled since late 2003 , when only 4.2 % of households were wireless only .
" As wireless network quality improves and unlimited calling becomes increasingly pervasive , we expect the trend toward wireless substitution to continue , " Alison LeBreton , vice president of client services for Nielsen Mobile , said in a news release .
" In a tightening economy every dollar counts , and consumers are more and more comfortable with the idea of ditching their landline connection . "
Young people are more likely to use only a wireless phone .
And the majority of people who have dropped their landline service are in lower income brackets , according to the Nielsen report ( you can download a PDF here ) .
Cutting costs appears to be a big reason for cutting the cord .
A landline phone costs an average of $ 40 a month .
But going wireless - only does n't mean you can pocket all those savings .
" Wireless substitutors " use their cellphones more , paying an average of $ 6.69 a month more than people who also have a land line , Nielsen said .
Those increased wireless charges are one of the reasons people give for returning to landline service .
( Not to mention the occasional outrageous bill ) .
About 10 % of households with a landline phone in the second quarter of this year relied only on a cellphone before .
Among the reasons for reconnecting the cord : 17 % needed it for another service , such as the Internet or TiVo ; 12 % said it was too expensive to use a cellphone for all their calls ; 11 % found it was cheaper to buy a bundled package that included TV and and Internet ; and 10 % just liked the safety and reliability of landline service , which tends to work better during events such as earthquakes .

“ The Rubyist ” Ruby Magazine Launches
By Peter Cooper
The Rubyist - not to be confused with the Japanese Rubyist Magazine - a new paper - and - PDF based magazine for Ruby developers has released its first issue .
This is a significant milestone , since it was just over a year I lamented about how the blogosphere killed the enthusiasm for Ruby magazines .
In response to that post , Jeremy McAnally announced his intention to produce a Ruby magazine , and now , with the advent of simple Print On Demand magazines from MagCloud , it has become a reality .
The first issue is available in print for the United States only and costs $ 8 plus postage .
A PDF version is available for $ 3 from Lulu for those who prefer PDFs or are located outside of the US .
Contents include interviews with Rein Henrichs and Hampton Catlin , articles from Jamie van Dyke , Ben Scofield and Yehuda Katz , some unbelievably good ads , and more .
There 's nothing particularly deep in the first issue , but for a first issue this is a remarkable effort and one I 'd certainly recommend purchasing , even if only in PDF form .
It ’s tough to be a superhero .
Not only do you have to drop everything and get into a brawl at a second ’s notice , but you ’re frequently misunderstood .
Superheroes ’ personal lives are a mess — especially their sex lives .
But it gets worse .
Here are 10 superheroes who are physically unable to have sex .
Ever .

Spoilers ahead ...
1 ) The Incredible Hulk
This one is somewhat dependent on circumstances .
In the 2008 Incredible Hulk movie , there ’s a scene where Bruce Banner is in a motel room with Betty .
They start to do what the young people do in motel rooms , and Bruce ’s heart - rate monitor gets more and more bleepy .
His heart is pounding with the excitement of making out with a vacant - eyed Liv Tyler , it ’s too much for him , he ’s losing his shit , he ’s going to , oh my god , he ’s going to ... he ’s going to ...
Bruce pulls away from Betty just in time to keep from becoming the Hulk .
Yes , he ca n’t get sexually aroused without Hulking out .
( And I am not going to make any jokes about whether you would like him when he ’s horny .
I ’m better that that . )
Advertisement
But what about the comics version of the Hulk ?
We know that the Hulk is Incredibly , perhaps Unfeasibly , well - hung , because the Hulk gets naked in Incredible Hulk # 400 and his arch - enemy The Leader remarks on how well - endowed he is .
But it ’s strongly implied , during the “ gray Hulk ” period , that the gray Hulk — who ’s working as a Las Vegas leg - breaker — is getting laid on a fairly regular basis .
Bruce Banner and his wife Betty have sex at least twice that I can think of .
Once when they first get married , after Bruce has been “ cured ” of being the Hulk ( so there ’s no danger of Bruce Hulking out . )
And once when Bruce gets his pathology backwards , so he ’s either a peaceful Hulk or a savage , rampaging puny human .
In his “ savage Banner ” form , Betty has sex with him , and this calms him down .

There ’s also the famous sequence in Hulk # 300 , where the Hulk has gone completely berzerk and Bruce ’s influence is all gone .
The Hulk is trashing New York , and Eros , “ the creepiest Avenger ” tries to subdue the Hulk using his psychic abilities to generate “ waves of pleasure . ”
He learns the hard way that you should n’t try to pleasure the Hulk in the middle of his rampage .
Still more evidence , I guess , that the Hulk and sex do n’t usually mix .
Unless he ’s gray .
( Update : Commenters have pointed out that the Hulk hooked up with Caiera The Oldstrong in Planet Hulk , the greatest Hulk storyline ever .
But she ’s an alien who ’s almost impervious to most harm , so it ’s slightly different .
It ’s also hinted that the Hulk has non-consensual sex when his neck is broken and he can’t move , in Future Imperfect . )

2 ) Hancock
Will Smith ’s superhero has an image problem and a drinking problem ... but he also has a Larry Niven problem , according to one deleted scene from the film .
( See above . )
Actually , Hancock can have sex , he simply has to be very , very careful where , and how , he ejaculates .
In this deleted scene from Hancock ( which had the original title of Tonight , He Comes ) Hancock has brought a cute young thing back to his trailer , and they ’re getting busy .
But then Hancock gets close to his climax , and warns the woman to back way , way up .
Hancock gets off — and we see his semen riddle his ceiling with holes , almost like bullet holes .
( Comics afficionados will not be surprised to learn this scene is ripped off from a Garth Ennis comic . )

3 ) Rogue from the X - Men
Advertisement
Poor Rogue .
She ’s got the cool Susan Sontag hair , and the leather jumpsuit , and the hot boyfriend ... but she can never touch anyone .
Whenever she does touch another person , she absorbs their memories , strength and physical abilities .
She also steals people ’s superpowers with her touch .
She ’s tragically untouchable .
The sexual frustration is so horrendous , it drives her to get rid of her powers in X - Men 3 .
4 ) Beautie in Kurt Busiek ’s Astro City
Advertisement
Beautie is one of the members of the Honor Guard , one of the main superhero teams in Astro City , Kurt Busiek ’s fictional superhero town .
She ’s always looked like a Barbie doll , but we ’ve never known much about the robot girl — until Busiek published the Astro City Character Special : Beautie last February .
There , we see some “ pick - up artists ” try to hit on Beautie , only to be told that she has no genitalia .
None whatsoever .
5 ) Various Cyborgs
Advertisement
At least the first few versions of Deathlok in Marvel Comics do n’t appear to have been “ anatomically correct ” — because nobody thought a combat cyborg needed to have any equipment down there .
Ditto for Robotman , from the Doom Patrol .
And Vic Stone , aka Cyborg , from the Teen Titans .
But the hordes of comic book sex-perverts are pretty certain that the Vision , the android member of the Avengers , did in fact get it on with the Scarlet Witch when the two of them were married .
6 ) Superman
Advertisement
We already mentioned Larry Niven — and Niven famously thought way too much about the implications of Krypto - sperm .
Besides the speeding - bullet properties of the sperm themselves , there ’s the fact that Superman might cause an injury if he got too excited during intercourse — and according to the movie Mallrats , the sperm would probably tear Lois Lane ’s fallopian tubes apart as well .
Some self - proclaimed experts also believe Wonder Woman is incapable of having sex with a normal human , for similar reasons .
Advertisement
Spider - Man , meanwhile , has a slightly different problem :
He can have sex .
But prolonged exposure to his ummm ... radioactive bodily fluids eventually kills his wife Mary Jane in a future dystopian story , Spider - Man : Reign by Kaare Andrews .
8 ) Deadman
Advertisement
A surprising number of superheroes are dead , either undead or ghosts ... and most of them never get laid .
In particular , Deadman is insubstantial except for when he takes control over a living body .
( And his ethics might prevent him from using someone else ’s body as a vehicle for sex , I ’m guessing . )
There ’s also the Spectre , who ’s basically the spirit of vengeance — he can become tangible , but I ’m highly doubtful he ever gets any .
( Although the Ostrander run on The Spectre did get a bit saucy at times . )
9 ) Ben Grimm from the Fantastic Four
Advertisement
Turns out The Thing ’s hero name is slightly ironic — because it ’s hinted at various times that he has nothing but more rocks under his little shorts .
His girlfriend , Alicia , dumps him and starts dating Johnny Storm , the Human Torch .
She makes it pretty clear that this is the first time in ages that she ’s gotten any action — meaning she was n’t getting any when she was with Ben. Poor Ben .
10 ) Negative Man from the Doom Patrol
Advertisement
Yep , the Doom Patrol are the rulers in the “ ca n’t have sex ” sweepstakes .
Negative Man is basically a radioactive mummy who has to wear protective bandages at all times , and ( I think ) can never touch anybody without the bandages in the way .
Similarly , Fuji from the Stormwatch series is a hero who ’s molecularly stable , and if he takes off his containment suit he turns into a radioactive cloud of plasma and probably dies .
There are also some other heroes whose bodies just are n’t compatible with anybody else ’s .
Like Mogo , who ’s an entire planet and a member of the Green Lantern Corps .
Who can Mogo have sex with ?
Element Lad from the Legion of Superheroes was celibate for a long time because he was the last of his kind , but did finally find love with a member of the Science Police who took a sex - change drug .

Justice Department asks court to keep wiretapping challenges secret John Byrne
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This
In a little - reported brief filed late Tuesday with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , the Bush administration asked the court to keep any review of the warrantless wiretapping law passed earlier this year by Congress secret .
The administration also asked that the court refuse to accept legal briefs from anyone other than the Justice Department itself .
The filing , made by the Justice Department , comes in response to a motion filed by the American Civil Liberties Union earlier this month asking the court to ensure that any proceedings relating to the " scope , meaning or constitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act " be as transparent as possible .
" The government is proposing that the intelligence court should consider the constitutionality of the new surveillance law in proceedings that will be entirely secret , " Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project , said in a release .
" If the government 's request is granted , the court wo n't hear arguments from anyone except the government and those arguments will be presented to the court in secret briefs .
At the end of the process , the court will issue a ruling that is also secret .
The process the government is proposing is completely unacceptable .
Especially because the new surveillance law departs so significantly from the standards that have applied to government surveillance for the last 30 years , any proceedings relating to the new law 's constitutionality should be adversarial and as informed and transparent as possible . "
The ACLU is also seeking a court ruling declaring the law unconstitutional in the Southern District of New York .
Critics have bemoaned the law , which granted the telecommunications industry retroactive immunity for participating in a program that was at the time not authorized by law .
" This bill has quite literally no public value for citizens or civil liberties , " constitutional law scholar Jonathan Turley said earlier this year .
" It is reverse engineering , though the type of thing the Bush Administration 's famous for , and now the Democrats are doing -- that is , to change the law to conform to past conduct .
" It 's what any criminal would love to do , " Turley added .
" You rob a bank , go to the legislature , and change the law to say that robbing banks is lawful . "
NYT columnist : ' Demoralized ' Republicans fleeing RNC will make McCain ' lonely guy ' in Minnesota David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Suspected cause of defections is fears of Bush - McCain baggage More than one in five Republican senators have said they wo n't attend the GOP convention next month or are considering missing out on the Minnesota confab to formally nominate John McCain .
Eight Republican Senators are skipping the Twin Cities convention , and two more say they might have better things to do Sept. 1 - 4 . It 's a troubling sign for a party that already expects to lose more seats in Congress this year and indicates that John McCain continues to be saddled by the baggage of President Bush 's last eight years , says one observer .
" The ones who are running away are definitely assuming that the voters are going to see McCain linked up there with Bush , " New York Times columnist Bob Herbert tells MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow .
Maddow , who was guest hosting Countdown Thursday night , said some of the GOP defections were understandable .
For example , Idaho Sen .
Larry Craig is likely trying to avoid any unpleasant memories of his foot - tapping escapades at the Minneapolis / St.
Paul airport , and Alaska 's Ted Stevens is perhaps too busy prepping for his upcoming public corruption trial .
Most of the Republican truants , though , seem more worried that pictures of them applauding Bush or McCain would doom their chances in already tough re-election races .
Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - OR ) has run ads linking himself with Democrats Barack Obama and John Kerry , and he recently rejected the largely honorary position of serving as McCain 's Oregon campaign co-chairman .
Also skipping the Republican convention will be North Carolina 's Elizabeth Dole , Maine 's Susan Collins , Nebraska 's Chuck Hagel , Colorado 's Wayne Allard and Kansas 's Pat Roberts .
New Hampshire Sen. John Sununu and Mississippi's Roger Wicker have n't yet decided whether they 'll be at the convention to nominate McCain .
Just three Republican senators in competitive races have said for sure they will attend the convention , and the head of the Republicans '
House campaigns has encouraged them to skip the convention .
" He 's going to be a lonely guy , " Herbert joked of the presumptive GOP nominee .
" The short answer is , this is weird .
...
They have reason to be demoralized . "

Get Your Geek On : 100 + Works of Creative and Geeky Art and Graffiti
Some artists take the mainstream approach and paint on canvas or carve from stone .
Others take vast strides off the beaten path to create unusually creative art and graffiti that appeals to our subversive selves or our inner geek .
From 3D , light and reverse graffiti to steampunk art , fashion and design here are some ways in which non-standard artists create works that challenge conventional thinking .
20 Extremely Geeky Works of Art and Graffiti ( and 7 More Unusually Geeky Works of Street Graffiti and Even More Geek Graffiti ) :
So what exactly does ‘ geek graffiti ’ even mean ?
The label can reflect the approach of the graffiti artist , the types of materials they use or the meaning of the symbols employed – or even all of the above .
As the nature of mass communication has changed and as information technology has evolved so too have the means , modes and subject matter of what used to be a much simpler subversive form of urban artistic expression .
10 Steampunk Designs and Mods ( and 15 More Steampunk Art and Fashion ) : Steampunk is arguably one of the most geeky approaches to art out there .
Retrofuturism takes present objects and by some strange twist makes them appear as if they were once futuristic wonders of a bygone age .
The genre has moved from literature to ecompass many forms of art , design and fashion .
10 Light Graffiti Artists and Photographers ( and Creative Urban Light Graffiti and More Light Art ) :
Not all graffiti requires paint – or the defacement of buildings for that matter .
Architectural light graffiti uses projectors that range from technically sophisticated to amazingly simple to make .
Tagging , in turn , ranges from comedic talk - bubbles to complex and moving amorphous patterns on the walls of buildings .
10 Amazing 3D Graffiti Artists ( and the Top 3 3D Sidewalk Chalk Artists )
Most people complain about graffiti but these artists tend to draw a crowd and a great deal of public approval .
Perhaps it is their skill or the fact that their 3D street art and sidewalk art appeal to a broader audience including children and families .
Whatever the reason their 3D graffiti and painting has a popular appeal often missing in more overtly subversive art .
3D Painting and Murals :
Of course 3D painting illusions are n’t limited to sidewalks and streets – these also can be drawn in small and extremely large scale on vertical urban surfaces .
3D murals can create the appearance of depth and illustrate amazing scenes that enliven streets and dull buildings as well as tricking passers by with incredibly lifelike depictions of strange scenes .
Unusually Legal Street Art ( and More Legal Urban Art ) : Guerrilla or subversive art does n’t necessarily have to be illegal .
Colorfully decorated urban objects from manhole covers to light posts and utility boxes all manage to add life and energy to an urban setting without breaking the law , and traditionally high - art figures like the Mona Lisa can be reappropriated by graffiti artists .
Flash mobs can also fall within legal limits if their organizers are clever and reverse graffiti is an amazing way to decorate urban surfaces without getting into trouble .
While U.S. media obsesses about John Edwards ’ extramarital shenanigans
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Friday , August 8 , 2008
Georgian forces , trained and equipped by the Pentagon and the U.S. government , killed 10 Russian peacekeepers early this morning in a provocation attack that has escalated into military conflict , but the subsequent corporate media coverage would have us believe that the U.S. and NATO - backed client state Georgia is a helpless victim , when in actual fact a far more nuanced geopolitical strategy is being played out .
Original reports early this morning detailed how Georgian forces had killed 10 Russian peacekeepers and wounded 30 others , which was the provocation for Russian forces to begin military operations , but the fact that Georgian forces were responsible for starting the conflagration has been completely buried in subsequent media coverage .
“ Georgia and the Pentagon cooperate closely , ” reports MSNBC , “ Georgia has a 2,000 - strong contingent supporting the U.S. - led coalition in Iraq , and Washington provides training and equipment to the Georgian military . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The latest exercise , Immediate Response 2008 , which took place last month , involved no less than one thousand U.S. troops working with Georgian troops in a war game scenario .
Moreover , the very “ Rose Revolution ” that brought the Harvard trained pro-US Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvilli to power in 2003 was wholly aided and abetted by the Central Intelligence Agency .
Russian fury at U.S. support for Georgia and Georgia ’s aspirations of becoming a NATO member have flared regularly in recent months , with tensions also rising following U.S. attempts to place missile defense shield technology in Poland and the Czech Republic , which most observers agree has nothing to do with Iran and is in fact aimed at countering Russian military superiority in the region .
In addition , the pro-Israeli news source DebkaFile reports that Georgian infantry units were “ aided by Israeli military advisors ” in capturing the capital of breakaway South Ossetia , Tskhinvali earlier today .
DebkaFile elaborates on the true geopolitical significance behind today ’s events .
DEBKAfile ’s geopolitical experts note that on the surface level , the Russians are backing the separatists of S. Ossetia and neighboring Abkhazia as payback for the strengthening of American influence in tiny Georgia and its 4.5 million inhabitants .
However , more immediately , the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the Caspian region .
The Russians may just bear with the pro-US Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili ’s ambition to bring his country into NATO .
But they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of Western oil companies , including Israeli firms , to route the oil routes from Azerbaijan and the gas lines from Turkmenistan , which transit Georgia , through Turkey instead of hooking them up to Russian pipelines .
Jerusalem owns a strong interest in Caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the Turkish terminal port of Ceyhan , rather than the Russian network .
Intense negotiations are afoot between Israel Turkey , Georgia , Turkmenistan and Azarbaijan for pipelines to reach Turkey and thence to Israel ’s oil terminal at Ashkelon and on to its Red Sea port of Eilat .
From there , supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the Far East through the Indian Ocean .
Former Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan , Paul Craig Roberts , told The Alex Jones Show today that the entire scenario smacked of a maneuver on behalf of the Neo - Con faction controlling the White House , led by Dick Cheney .
Roberts said the date was precisely picked due to the distraction of the Olympics and Bush being out of the country .
Both Condoleezza Rice and John McCain have today demanded Russia withdraw its forces from Georgia immediately .
Meanwhile , the U.S. media networks are seemingly more interested in the complete non-story of John Edwards having an affair , while a conflict that could have devastating and thunderous geopolitical consequences fizzes on the verge of explosion .
As of early Friday evening , Edwards ’ extramarital shenanigans were dominating CNN and Fox News , while Drudge also afforded the story more prominence that the situation in Georgia , which was also deemed less important than the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics .
One of our readers contributed the following , which explains in detail exactly what is unfolding .
Most folks on here can not or will not look up the history or facts for themselves … morons ..
Those who dont learn from history are destined to repeat it ..
In 1992 , Georgia was forced to accept a ceasefire to avoid a large scale confrontation with Russia .
The government of Georgia and South Ossetian separatists reached an agreement to avoid the use of force against one another , and Georgia pledged not to impose sanctions against South Ossetia .
A peacekeeping force of Ossetians , Russians and Georgians was established at the time .
And late in 1992 the OSCE set up a mission in Georgia to monitor the peacekeeping operation .
From then , until mid-2004 , South Ossetia was generally peaceful .
In June 2004 , tensions began to rise as the Georgian authorities strengthened their efforts against smuggling in the region .
Hostage takings , shootouts and occasional bombings left dozens dead and wounded .
A ceasefire deal was reached on August 13 , but it has been repeatedly violated .
Tensions in the region soared in 2008 and outbreaks of violence became increasingly frequent in the border area .
Georgia said it was an internal affair as the breakaway republic had never been recognized internationally .
The Georgian side repeatedly insisted the conflict could be resolved without outside interference .
However , early on August 8 Georgia launched a massive military offensive to take control of the republic .
A quote from another Reuters
At an emergency session of the United Nations on Thursday night , Russia failed to push through a statement that would have called on both sides to stop fighting immediately .
Council diplomats said a phrase calling on all sides to “ renounce the use of force ” had been unacceptable to the Georgians , backed by the United States and the Europeans .
UK Times online :
Mr Saakashvili , a US - educated lawyer who succeeded Eduard Shevardnadze in 2004 and has since tried to align it more closely to the West , compared the Russian action with the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and appealed to the outside world to intervene .
“ Russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory , ” he told CNN as Russian armour rolled into South Ossetia .
“ It ’s not about Georgia anymore .
It ’s about America , its values : we are a freedom - loving nation that is right now under attack .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Presidential hopeful Barack Obama called the situation in Afghanistan “ precarious and urgent ” on Sunday and said Washington should start planning to transfer more troops there from Iraq .
The Illinois Democrat spoke from Afghanistan on the CBS program “ Face the Nation ” after meeting privately with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on an overseas trip meant to bolster his foreign policy credentials .
“ We have to understand that the situation is precarious and urgent here in Afghanistan and I believe this has to be the central focus , the central front , in our battle against terrorism , ” Obama said .
Obama was spending Sunday night in Kuwait where he met the Gulf Arab state ’s emir , Sheikh Sabah al - Ahmad al - Sabah .
He was due to fly on to Iraq for meetings on Monday .
He is also due to visit Jordan , Israel , Germany , France and Britain on a foreign tour he hopes will help answer Republican criticism that he lacks the experience to be commander in chief .
BERLIN SPEECH
The Obama campaign in Chicago confirmed he would deliver a speech on Thursday at Berlin ’s Victory Column , and not at the iconic Brandenburg Gate , their original idea for a venue .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear she would frown upon using the Brandenburg Gate for “ electioneering ” .
“ It is my belief , which some people may think old - fashioned , that the Brandenburg Gate is linked to presidential speeches and if the candidate , or any other candidate is elected , then he will be most welcome to give a speech at the Brandenburg Gate , ” Merkel told German ARD television .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
German media say tens of thousands of people could turn up to hear Obama speak .
The senator is popular in Europe and an opinion poll published last week in the Bild newspaper found 72 percent of Germans would vote for him over Republican John McCain in the November 4 election if they could .
Obama said after meetings with commanders in Afghanistan that Washington should start planning immediately for a shift of American soldiers to the war with the Islamist Taliban from Iraq , where there are four times as many U.S. troops .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
“ I think the situation is getting urgent enough that we have to start doing something now , ” Obama said .
Obama wants to send two more brigades , or some 7,000 U.S. troops , to Afghanistan and shift the emphasis from what he calls the Bush administration ’s “ single - minded ” focus on Iraq .
“ There ’s starting to be a growing consensus that it ’s time for us to withdraw some of our combat troops out of Iraq , deploy them here in Afghanistan ...
Now is the time for us to do it . ”
If the United States waited for a new administration to take office , it could take a year to boost troop levels , he said .
Adm. Michael Mullen , President George W. Bush ’s top military advisor as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the situation in Afghanistan was mixed , but not dire .
“ I would not say in any way , shape or form that we ’re losing in Afghanistan , ” Mullen said on “ Fox News Sunday ” .
Asked about a hypothetical two - year timeline for a U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq , he said he believed “ the consequences could be very dangerous ” .
In our never - ending quest to provide you the tools and knowledge to raise your kids in your own geeky image , we present you with a list of
10 geeky movies to raise your kids with .
This is a starter list , and by no means comprehensive .
It also skews towards the younger set because we have to lay the proper geeky foundation .
As always , leave your suggestions for additional titles in the comments .
Star
Wars :
You must , MUST !
I say , start your child our with Episode IV : A
New Hope .
Diligence is key , brothers and sisters , and while your kids will probably enjoy even the new trilogy for its grand spectacle , they must be brought into the fold the right way .
Is n't it a thousand times better to fall in love with the non-verbal pluckiness of R2 - D2 in New
Hope , and then cheer when he pops up in Phantom Menace ?
I knew you 'd agree .
2. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's ( Philosopher 's ) Stone :
The Potter movies are this generation 's Star Wars trilogy , and so far ,
ALL of them have been well - done .
The first is a perfect introduction to the world , in a more kid-friendly Chris Columbus way , and makes for a great way to get your kids into all sorts of fantasy literature later .
I 'll also take my lumps now : I 'm * not * putting LOTR on this list because I do n't think it 's for younger kids - too long for them , and in cases too scary and violent .
It 'll definitely make the second list , for your Geeky Tweens , though , so have no fear .
3. The Last
Starfighter :
This is the film from our youth that did the first , and maybe best , job of arguing that being good at videogames could be worthwhile in other aspects of your life ( like being able to save the universe someday ) .
They early CG was pretty darned good , too .
Classic tale of the downtrodden geeky kid getting to find out they 're special , and live out a wish fulfillment .
4. My Neighbor Totoro : All
Miyazaki is wonderful , with a beauty and spirit we seldom see in
American - produced animation ( Iron Giant counts as an exception to that statement ) .
I chose Totoro because it 's the most accessible for a child , I think ( Spirited Away and * Princess Mononoke * are a bit too scary in parts ) .
The imaginary friend angle appeals to every young - at - heart parent , as well .
If you can get your kid in love with this , then follow up with Howl 's Moving Castle , Kiki's Delivery Service , and
Nausicaa .
5. Time Bandits : Another great story of wish - fulfillment for a downtrodden kid , but this one has a merry band of miscreant little - people , time - travel , Sean Connery , John Cleese , and David Warner .
Plus , it sets them up for Brazil and all the Monty Python oeuvre as they get older .
More after the break .
The Dark Crystal :
The best pure - fantasy movie out there for younger kids , period .
There are no human characters in the film at all ( yes , I know , they 're all puppets ) , but we still get attached to them and sucked into their world .
An also - ran here would be
Neverending Story , but I 'd put Labyrinth in the tweens list for next time .
WarGames :
You could argue for WarGames to be on the tweens list as well , but I like it here because the kids will connect with the computer angle , the being ignored by grown - ups angle .
I also like the idea of starting them young with a sense of the government and military being important , but not always bad .
Let 's just pretend the
" sequel " that 's out on DVD now never happened , okay ?
Chitty - Chitty
Bang - Bang* :
The technicolor American musical in all its splendor , with
Dick van Dyke at his prime , and a magical car .
The breakfast machine in the beginning should inspire many a Maker , and I always revel in noticing Desmond Llewelyn ( original Q in the Bond movies - this was an
Ian Fleming story , after all ! ) , and Benny Hill as the toymaker .
Goonies :
The perfect geek - gang adventure story with home - made gadgets , pirates , treasure and all , this movie also helps reinforce finding and sticking to friendships .
The talk about a sequel for this movie , with most or all of the original cast , really gets me excited ( just like the Tr2n
footage ) .
Back to the Future * :
The best way to initiate your kids into the joys of time - travel stories , and the joys of all things
Christopher Lloyd .
This is one of those cases where the whole series is enjoyable and family - friendly , and the great geeky repeatable dialog will keep you amused for a long time .
Hello , McFly ?!?!
So , what do you think ?
Any other great geeky starter movies for our kids ?
Let us know !

One Bright Idea

If you 're going to do just one thing for the planet , make it the switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) .
Although they cost several times more upfront than regular incandescent light bulbs , they also last about 10 times longer , which means that for every CFL you screw in , you 'll be saving eight incandescent light bulbs from landfill purgatory .
Plus , you 'll save some serious cash in the long run .
Because CFLs use 75 percent less energy , swapping one incandescent bulb for a CFL reduces carbon dioxide by 500 pounds a year ; replacing 17 has the equivalent effect of taking one car off the road for a year .
Just remember to recycle spent bulbs responsibly - CFLs contain trace amounts of mercury , which although is n't enough to be hazardous to you , could pose a problem in landfills when mercury from multiple bulbs leaches into the ground .
Seeing Stars

The average home can pump out twice as much greenhouse - gas emissions as the average car .
Purchasing energy - saving Energy Star - rated appliances , electronics , and lighting can help mitigate that , while slashing a third of your electric bill .
( A power guzzler is nobody 's friend . )
Improving the energy efficiency of your home could even earn you tax credits from Uncle Sam .
Paper Nor Plastic

Eschew plastic bags by bringing your own reusable canvas totes the next time you 're at the supermarket or store .
Because petroleum - based plastic is n't biodegradable , it 's certain to outlive you - by about a millennium or so .
Each year , thousands of marine animals , including the endangered leatherback turtle , choke to death on plastic trash they mistake for snackable morsels .
Our unholy love for plastic disposables has also bred a swirling vortex of plastic trash the size of Texas in the North Pacific Ocean - not surprising when you consider that Americans run through about 100 billion plastic bags annually , using up an estimated 12 million barrels of oil .
No Soliciting

Deforestation is responsible for 25 percent of all carbon emissions released into the atmosphere , through the burning and cutting of 34 million acres of trees annually .
Save some virgin and old - growth forests by opting out of paper catalogs and browsing online , instead .
Why did you think Al Gore invented the Internet ?
Shed those extra 41 pounds of junk mail the average American packs on each year by removing yourself from direct - mail mailing lists ; if you need a tad more help , companies such as GreenDimes and 41 pounds.org have got your back .
Get Better Mileage
Photo ( Image credit : Stockxpert )
Who knew cauliflower were such globe - trotters ?
Or that jet - setting tomatoes racked up frequent - flier miles ?
But it 's true : North American produce typically travels a minimum of 1,500 miles .
Grapes can clock 2,143 miles cruising from vineyards in Napa Valley to supermarket aisles in Chicago , gobbling up barrels of crude oil and spewing pollutants and greenhouse - gas emissions in their wake .
By buying your produce locally , whether it's through the farmers ' market or a community - assisted agriculture program , you can reduce your " food miles , " otherwise known as the distance your food has to travel to get from the farm to your plate .
Now that 's fresh .
The 3 Rs
Photo ( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
Start rolling those Rs : Reduce , reuse , and recycle - and in that order .
Let 's face it , we 're mired deep in ecological debt because we 're consuming more resources than nature can replenish .
By gorging on more than our fair share of the world 's resources , we 're also diverting essentials such as food , clothing , and water from communities in greater need .
So let 's recap :
It 's better to reduce your personal consumption than it is to reuse something , and itâ€™s less environmentally taxing to reuse a product than to have it recycled .
Separating recyclables from your regular trash , which barely takes any effort , is a no- brainer , of course ; recycling aluminum , for instance , takes as little as 5 percent of the energy we 'd need to manufacture virgin aluminum .
Get Off the Grid
Photo ( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
Opt for clean , renewable energy if it 's offered in your area .
Low - impact sources such as wind , solar , and hydroelectric power reduce our dependence on coal - burning power plants , a major source of greenhouse - gas emissions .
And because harnessing the power of renewable " fuels " such as sun and wind are free , your electric bill is likely to scale down because of the reduced price of wholesale electricity .
Slay Energy Vampires
Photo ( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
You may not know it , but households across the globe are infested with vampires .
Energy vampires , that is .
Cleverly disguised as innocuous household appliances ( psst , your television is one of them ) , their nasty pointed teeth plunge deep into your wall socket , draining power all hours of the day and night , even after you 've switched them off .
( Americans pay $ 1 billion a year to power our televisions and VCRs while they 're turned off . )
Other sleeper agents of the electric undead that consume 1,000 kilowatt hours a year per household , while in standby mode : your toaster , coffeemaker , hair dryer , PC , printer , cable box , and cell phone charger .
You donâ€™t have to live in a constant state of fear , however , forever checking behind your back for that one appliance you forgot to pull the plug of .
Just plug adjacent equipment into power strips with surge protectors , and before you crawl under the safety of your covers - or head out to work - simply flip the switch .
Go Au Naturale
Photo ( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
Our chemical arsenal may be able to exterminate creepy crawlies and polish our countertops , but they 're slowly killing us , too .
The man -made chemicals we favor are like the obnoxious houseguest who overstays his welcome - an average of 200 industrial compounds , pollutants and other chemicals , for instance , were recently discovered in the umbilical - cord blood of newborns .
( These included seven dangerous pesticides , some of which were banned in the U.S. more than 30 years ago . )
Weâ€ ™re serving our kids potent chemical cocktails even before they 're born - not quite the head start they may have been hoping to get .
Pesticides have also been implicated in Parkinsonâ€™s disease , infertility , brain damage , and cancer .
So ditch the poisons and choose natural , non-toxic , and equally effective methods of cleaning and corralling pests .
You probably already have what you need in your kitchen to get started .
Chowing down on organically grown food will cut out pesticides from your diet , as well .
Build it Green

Trees , in a word , rock .
They absorb heat - trapping carbon dioxide , hold soil together to prevent landslides , and provide a rich habitat for diverse plants and animals .
Choose furniture made from eco-friendly sources such as sustainably managed forests , bamboo , and reclaimed wood .
Buying vintage wherever possible , rather than adding something new into the waste stream , is always in style .
Also , look for furniture that is durable and likely long - lived - you 'll save money on replacements in the future and prevent more wasted materials from winding up in the landfill .
And , if for some reason , that dresser or dining table no longer suits your needs , something in fine shape will always have takers via Craig 's List , eBay , or Freecycle .
One of the issues I consider important in my forecast is systemic risk .
This relates to the interconnectedness of the system , and predicts that if one part fails , other parts are also likely to fail .
Many other articles mention this issue , but rarely address its full ramifications .
Most forecasts are made with an overriding assumption of infinite growth , but the analysis made in January and updated now maintains an underlying assumption of resource limitations , such as will likely accompany the advent of peak oil .
Under resource limitations , debtors are likely to find it difficult to pay back loans , as resources become more and more scarce .
As a result , default rates are likely to continue to rise .
Back in January , I made a financial forecast for 2008 .
In this post , I will update my analysis , looking both at what has happened thus far in 2008 , and refining what is likely ahead .
I also consider the impact of , which is different from .
Systematic bias is more closely related to the issue of resource depletion , and the fact that the infinite growth is ultimately not possible .
Lenders , and those who write insurance against loan defaults , assume that the future will be much like the past .
If there is problem with loan defaults , the assumption is made that higher defaults are likely to be temporary .
Models based on this assumption are faulty , because resource shortages are likely to raise the price of all types of energy products and food , year after year .
This will tend to cause progressively more loan defaults , because people will have less and less money available to repay loans , after buying basic necessities .
This situation of progressively more defaults can be expected when the world is at peak oil ; it can also be expected before peak oil , if energy prices rise over an extended period because the quantity of oil available is not sufficient to meet demand at a lower price .
This seems to be the position we have been in recently .
Failure of financial markets to recognize the increasing risk of defaults due to resource depletion can be expected to result in a consistent underpricing of risk .
Individuals and institutions owning debt - based financial products are likely to suffer huge losses , year after year , as more and more defaults occur .
Insurance companies writing this risk are likely to be among the first to have problems , since their financial results are closely tied to the proper pricing of the risk charge underlying loans .
Ultimately , the large number of loans which never can be paid back is likely to bring a crash to the already unstable financial system .
Background
My January forecast provides a more detailed explanation of systematic bias and systemic risk .
I explain that as we approach peak oil , events that financial modelers would like to think are independent , such as defaults on loans , become much less independent .
I also explain why , with systematic bias and systemic risk becoming more relevant because of resource depletion , the predictive value of financial models such as of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Black and Scholes Option Pricing Model is likely to decline .
I also elaborate on the reasons for my forecasts .
Forecast for 2008
Let 's first look at the forecast I made at the beginning of the year .
Here is a point - by - point review :
1 . Many monoline bond insurers will be downgraded in 2008 , and some may fail .
As I noted in the introduction , insurers writing the risk of debt default are likely to be among the first with bad results .
Not surprisingly , there have been many downgrades of companies writing this risk .
As the year goes on , I expect to see further downgrades and financial failures .
I also expect to see a ripple effect through to other financial institutions ( including banks , hedge fund , pension funds , and multi-line insurance companies ) because they will have to take over the risk that the monoline insurers were supposedly insuring .
Part of the impact of the failed insurers can be expected to be sudden , as banks , insurers , and other institutions fail regulatory ratios , and find themselves in need of greater capital , or need to divest themselves of certain securities which no longer meet investment standards .
Part of the impact will be more gradual , as formerly insured bonds enter into default , and the lack of insurance affects the owners of the bonds .
The number of defaults is likely to be much higher than in the past , because previously " safe " bonds , such as municipal bonds , will be affected by affected by falling home prices and declining tax revenues .
There have already been several bond insurer downgrades , including MBIA Insurance Corporation , Ambac Assurance Corporation , and Financial Guaranty Insurance Corporation .
Among mortgage insurers , PMI Mortgage Group and MGIC have also had their ratings reduced .
Mike Stathis , in the Market Oracle indicates that he considers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be similar to bond insurers .
. . . much of the debt sold to institutions is guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie , making them similar to the monolines like MBIA and Ambac .
Combined , they hold around $ 1.4 trillion in their retained portfolios and they 've guaranteed over $ 3 trillion of what could end up being junk bonds .
So you can think of Fannie and Freddie as a hybrid of bond insurers like MBIA and AMBAC , along with Washington Mutual and Countrywide .
The insurance guarantee component of Fannie and Freddie makes the situation for these companies much worse than if they were simply holders of mortgage bonds .
2 . More and more people influential in financial markets will begin to recognize peak oil .
Nearly everyone is now aware that there is some kind of problem with the oil supply , and that old assumptions may not hold .
For example , Business
Week recently had an article in which it questioned whether Saudi Arabia could ramp up production to 12.5 million barrels a day .
Even the Economist is beginning to mention peak oil , proffering an interview with Matt Simmons .
At this point , some leaders understand peak oil , but the majority is at the " peak oil lite " stage -- oil supply is short relative to demand , and the situation does n't look like it will get much better very soon .
With even this limited understanding , lenders are likely to be more cautious about granting credit , since with continued high oil prices , consumers are likely to have less money available for debt repayment .
If lenders become peak oil " savvy " , lending practices are likely to become even more restrictive .
3 . Long term loans , including those for energy companies , are likely to become less available as awareness of peak oil rises .
The Bank for International Settlements , in its annual report , describes the world financial markets as being in turmoil , with credit availability greatly reduced .
For several years , banks were able to resell loans they initiated to third parties , using structured securities .
About a year ago , the US market for structured securities , other than those guaranteed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , or Ginnie Mae , started to deteriorate , as illustrated in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . US Structured Securities Issued based on Table 1.4 of a report by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association .
Without the structured securities market , banks have become much more cautious about long term loans , such as commercial real estate loans and home mortgages that are larger than those Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will handle .
Smaller home mortgages have continued to be reasonably available , but only because government agencies have provided a market .
In the first three months of 2008 , more than two - thirds of new mortgages were bought by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , according to the New York Times .
If Ginnie Mae ( providing FHA and VA loans ) were included , the percentage would be even higher .
Regarding energy companies being affected by current financial disruptions , there have been articles about the collapse of SemGroup pinching small oil firms .
SemGroup filed for bankruptcy after losing $ 2.4 billion in the oil futures market .
Through its subsidiary SemCrude , it collected 541,000 barrels of oil a day from more than 2,000 independent operators in Oklahoma , Kansas , and Texas .
With its failure , many of these producers have not been paid for oil already shipped .
Some of the more remote producers are now being left without a market for their oil .
This example shows how financial problems can affect energy companies .
While I have not seen a long - term debt example , the trend toward reduced credit almost assures that there will be energy companies that will be unable to make desired investments because of unavailability of long - term debt .
4 . There is likely to be a serious recession in 2008 , deepening as the year goes on .
According to the official arbiter of recession , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) , the US is not yet in recession .
The reason they do not believe the US is in recession may partly be timing .
The NBER 's review is based on several measures , and some are not available immediately .
Also , according to the President 's Council of Economic Advisors ( CEA ) , real GDP is not yet declining .
This may reflect a mis-measurement of inflation .
The CEA 's analysis uses an estimate of inflation that seem quite low -- an annual rate of 2.4 % in the fourth quarter of 2007 and of 2.7 % in the first quarter of 2008 .
If the inflation rate is even a little higher than this , the country has been in a recession for some time .
The reason the inflation rate is important in this calculation is because the gross domestic product is estimated first in current dollars , and then an inflation adjustment is backed out to calculate " real " gross domestic product .
If the inflation adjustment is too low , it will tend to make the country look like it is not in recession , when it really is .
Whether or not the NBER says the United States is in recession , many economists believe that the United States is either in a recession now , or will soon be in a recession .
When USA Today surveyed 52 economists in April 2008 , it found that two - thirds felt the US is already in a recession , and 79 % believed that a recession was likely by the end of the year .
I continue to believe that we are already in a recession , and the recession will get worse and worse , as the year progresses .
5 . At least several large banks will fail .
At this point , IndyMac has failed , and is expected to use up as much as 15 % of the funds of the FDIC .
The investment bank Bear Stearns got into financial difficulty and was sold to JP Morgan Chase at a fire - sale price .
The Wall Street Journal has reported that the FDIC is staffing up for an increased number of bank failures .
Estimates of the likely number of bank failures range from 90 to more than 300 .
The SEC recently stated , " There now exists a substantial threat of sudden and excessive fluctuations of securities prices generally " that could affect orderly markets .
Because of this risk , short sale activity is being restricted on a list of 19 large financial institutions .
This list includes many very large banks , including Bank of America , Citigroup , and Deutche Bank .
Some people must believe there is a risk of these institutions failing , if the price of their stocks has been dropping rapidly , and investors want to short their shares .
6 . The amount of debt available to consumers is likely to decline .
According to a May 6 , 2008 article of the Wall Street Journal :
The Federal Reserve 's survey of banks ' senior loan officers , one of the most closely watched gauges of lending practices , found that the credit crunch is widening .
The proportion of domestic banks tightening their standards was at or near historical highs for almost all loan categories , including credit cards and student loans .
According to that article , 55 % of banks that participate in the federal student loan program are planning to reduce their lending in the fall of 2008 .
Banks are increasing credit score requirements and reducing available limits on credit card debt .
The survey showed that 70 % of banks had increased standards for home equity lines of credit in the previous three months .
7. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may need government assistance .
The financial problems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in the news recently .
Legislation has been passed which would establish a new regulator , and would provide a temporary rescue plan .
8 . A new class of homes -- those " never to be sold " -- will emerge .
The Wall Street Journal talks about a glut of unsold homes , because of a weakening housing market .
More and more homes are entering foreclosure , as owners find that their homes are no longer affordable , and the market value of the homes is less than the mortgage amount .
Foreclosed homes often sit vacant for long periods of time .
Sometimes they are vandalized and stripped of their copper piping and scrap metal .
Cleveland now has a grant that will allow it to renovate 50 foreclosed homes and demolish 100 others .
9 . Politicians will continue to make attempts to help homeowners , and perhaps other types of borrowers .
Federal legislation under the title American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 stagnated in the US congress for months , and was finally passed last week , when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac problems became apparent , and assistance for them was added to the legislation .
Prior to that , about 20 states launched foreclosure intervention or prevention initiatives .
10 .
The amount of structured ( sliced and diced ) debt issued is likely to drop to close to zero .
The amount of new structured debt sold in recent quarters , other than that guaranteed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae , has declined by more than 90 % .
Figure 2 is the same graph as shown above .
Figure 2 . US Structured Securities Issued based on Table 1.4 of a report by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association .
Structured securities continue to be used for housing , but almost entirely with agency guaranteed debt .
A proposal has been made in the last few days for banks to offer covered bonds as an additional option for writing mortgages .
With covered bonds , investors would have recourse to banks ' balance sheets , in addition to the underlying assets .
It is not clear that these will be much used , because the FDIC currently restricts their use , so as to not deplete assets supporting ordinary depositors .
11 . Besides banks , many other players in financial markets are likely to find themselves in financial difficulty in 2008 .
One of the big issues for any organization that holds financial securities faces is how to properly value those securities .
This is especially an issue for structured securities .
On July 28 , Merrill Lynch sold $ 30.6 billion of collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) for only 22 per cent of their face value .
Now that this sale has been made , other organizations will have a real value to assign to similar securities , and this is likely to result in many other write - downs .
According to the Timesonline article quoted above , the Egan Jones Ratings Company ( EJRC ) believes that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be forced into combined write - downs of $ 100 billion , because of this new valuation .
In total , for all financial institutions , Sean Egan of EJRC believes that the write - downs related to this new valuation might total $ 400 billion .
Prior to the Merrill Lynch sale , American International Group , a large insurer , was in the news for its large investment losses , relating to the valuation of securities .
The price of its stock has dropped 64 % , and its ratings have been downgraded .
12 . The value of the dollar will fall relative to some currencies , causing the relative price of oil to rise .
The value of the dollar has continued to fall relative to a trade weighted basked of currencies , while the Euro and Yen are higher .
Figure 3 . Relative changes of dollar , yen , and euro from July 18 , 2008 , Wall Street Journal
13 .
The stock market probably will decline during 2008 .
The general trend of the stock market has been down .
The Dow Jones industrial Average is down 13 % since the beginning of the year ; the S&P 500 index is down 14 % beginning of the year .
Both indexes have recently been down more than 20 % from their 2007 highs , putting them into " bear territory " .
14 . Prices are likely to rise in 2008 for food and energy products .
Prices may decline for homes and non-essential goods and services .
The price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil is up 45 % since the beginning of the year .
The price of gasoline is up 35 % from the beginning of the year .
Recent CPI data shows US grocery prices up 6.1 % relative to a year ago .
Food prices around the world have been rising rapidly , and many of the poorer countries are concerned about food security .
15 .
There is a chance that some type of discontinuity will make financial conditions suddenly take a turn for the worse .
In my earlier article , I wrote :
Will the " wheels come off the economy " ?
I really do n't know .
I then gave a few considerations that might prevent a serious disruption in 2008 .
These included the underlying momentum of the economy , the ability of regulators to change rules as they go along , the fact the congress is likely to go along with any proposed bailout plan , and the fact that much of the problem is a balance sheet problem , which it may be possible to hide for a while longer .
Since January , the events that have transpired have tended to make me more pessimistic .
One of the issues I see is that Congress is not inclined to do very much , and what it does do seems to work in the direction of increasing the deficit .
Congress seems willing to pass legislation that will hand out more dollars to people ( as in the stimulus legislation and the housing legislation ) , or raise the lending amount available to people ( as in the new $ 625,000 cap on Fannie and Freddie loans ) .
It does not seem to be willing to raise tax dollars to go with all of the new commitments .
The higher spending coupled with the unwillingness to raise taxes can be expected to make it more difficult to fund government debt , and is likely to lead to an increase in interest rates .
A second issue is the limited nature of the various insurance funds which insure against insolvencies of banks , pension funds , and insurance companies ( including FDIC , PBGC , and state insurance funds for insurance companies ) .
These insurance funds generally have a small fund to handle insolvencies , and some mechanism for assessing solvent entities in the group if one of the members fails .
In some cases , the additional funding is accomplished by increasing the insurance premiums payable in the upcoming year for the remaining solvent entities .
This funding approach works if there is only an occasional small insolvency , but not if there is an avalanche of insolvencies , all arising from the same root cause ( higher oil prices , feeding through to cause higher energy and food prices , causing defaults in many areas ) .
This means that if there is a large number of insolvencies , there will need to be some governmental approach for propping up all of these organizations , rather than just the insurance funds .
A third issue is the apparent inflexibility of our refined petroleum product pipeline distribution system .
As I understand it , we need to have a certain amount of refined petroleum products in the pipelines to keep the pipelines filled .
If we have too little , pipelines drop below the " minimum operating level , " and we have trouble getting petroleum products to the ends of the pipelines .
This is not really a remote possibility -- we have already run into this problem in various parts of North America in recent years , including North Dakota , Colorado , and Canada .
It seems to me that as the amount of oil we are using decreases , our vulnerability to disruption caused by available oil dropping below the minimum operating level increases .
Some possible sources of disruption include a major hurricane ; the US not being able to purchase enough oil because of a drop in the value of the dollar ; and OPEC refusing to sell us oil .
It would seem as though such a disruption could have cascading effects -- parts of the country might be left without any petroleum products ( gasoline , diesel , or jet fuel ) for an extended period , because all refined products are shipped in the same pipeline , with spacers in between .
I do n't believe that we have adequate truck and barge backup to prevent disruptions from occurring .
Looking ahead
As we go forward , I expect that there will be more and more individuals , businesses and governments that will be unable to repay their debt , because of indirect impacts of higher oil prices flowing through the economy .
Eventually , the US government will have to make a decision as to what to do about all these defaults .
The most obvious options would seem to be :
(1) Prop up as many as possible
(2) Let the chips fall where they may
Either of these would seem to have the potential to lead to serious disruption .
If the " prop up as many as possible " approach is used , it theoretically could lead to a high inflation rate , high interest rates , and a severe drop in the dollar .
I would expect imports of all kinds to drop , including petroleum imports .
This could lead to parts of the country losing liquid fuels because the pipeline structure cannot easily distribute a much smaller fuel supply .
The decline in imports other than oil could also be a major problem because we manufacture so little ourselves .
If a " let the chips fall where they may approach " is followed , it is possible that bankruptcies will cascade through the system .
If there are inadequate funds in the FDIC , and banks are simply allowed to fail , this would have very negative consequences .
One can think of a lot of other organizations that might need propping up -- states with a lot of debt , like California ; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ; auto manufacturers ; airlines ; LNG terminals ; independent oil refineries ; and pension funds , to name a few .
Letting any of the major organizations fail would likely cause more homeowners to default on their mortgages and trigger yet more bankruptcies .
In this scenario , our imports would likely also drop , because people and businesses will not have the funds to purchase them .
This could get us back to the problem of pipelines below minimum operating level .
How much of this will happen in the next two quarters ?
I do n't know .
It is likely that Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson have some ideas I have n't thought of , and there is a way out of this predicament .
I do n't have all of the answers .
It is likely to be an interesting rest of 2008 .
Some researchers have way too much time on their hands .
Case in point :
A group of Belgian researchers believe that research has already demonstrated a link between vaginal orgasm and better mental health ( although I ’d argue such a link is nebulous at best ) .
They wondered if one could determine whether a woman experienced vaginal orgasms just by observing everyday body movement .
Specifically , walking .
Looking at a group of healthy Belgian women , half of whom have vaginal orgasms and half who do not , trained sexologists discovered that they could pick out the vaginal orgasmic women 81 % of the time — far better than chance .
They could not , however , pick out women who had clitoral orgasms .
( Vaginal orgasms were defined for this study , according to the researchers , by penile - vaginal intercourse , not orgasm from direct clitoral stimulation . )
How did they do it ?
Exploratory analyses suggest that greater pelvic and vertebral rotation and stride length might be characteristic of the gait of women who have experienced vaginal orgasm ( r = 0.51 , P < 0.05 ) .
So the “ trained sexologists ” were apparently looking for greater hip movement and walking stride , but this is a pretty weak association .
The researchers ’ conclusions were also good for a laugh :
The discerning observer may infer women ’s experience of vaginal orgasm from a gait that comprises fluidity , energy , sensuality , freedom , and absence of both flaccid and locked muscles .
Results are discussed with regard to previous research on gait , the effect of the musculature on sexual function , the special nature of vaginal orgasm , and implications for sexual therapy .
I think the “ special nature ” of vaginal orgasm is mostly in these folks ’ heads .
But I suppose if you ’re interested in trying to better understand attractiveness , this kind of research can point us in one direction .
It seems these sort of observations may also help inform future researchers about sexuality and attractiveness .
We ’ve also published quite a few news stories about attractiveness :
Attractiveness is in the Way We Walk
Friends , Family Find Similar Faces Attractive
Physical Attractiveness , Earning Power , Ambition Are All Equal Aphrodisiacs
The first one seems most relevant , and this study may provide a reason as to why the attractiveness ratings for perceived women increased by about 50 percent when they walked with hip sway .
Could it be an unconscious signal of their sexual abilities ?

A study of top - selling laundry products and air fresheners found the products emitted dozens of different chemicals .
All six products tested gave off at least one chemical regulated as toxic or hazardous under federal laws , but none of those chemicals was listed on the product labels .
" I first got interested in this topic because people were telling me that the air fresheners in public restrooms and the scent from laundry products vented outdoors were making them sick , " said Anne Steinemann , a University of Washington professor of civil and environmental engineering and of public affairs .
" And I wanted to know , ' What 's in these products that is causing these effects ? ' "
Manufacturers of consumer products are not required to disclose the ingredients , so Steinemann analyzed the products to discover their contents .
" I was surprised by both the number and the potential toxicity of the chemicals that were found , " Steinemann said .
Chemicals included acetone , the active ingredient in paint thinner and nail - polish remover ; limonene , a molecule with a citrus scent ; and acetaldehyde , chloromethane and 1,4 - dioxane .
Nearly 100 volatile organic compounds were emitted from the six products , and none were listed on any product label , she said .
Plus , five of the six products emitted one or more carcinogenic " hazardous air pollutants , " which are considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to have no safe exposure level , Steinemann said .
The study is detailed online in today 's issue of the journal Environmental Impact Assessment Review .
Steinemann chose not to disclose the brand names of the six products she tested .
But in a larger study of 25 cleaners , personal care products , air fresheners and laundry products , now submitted for publication , Steinemann found that many other brands contained similar chemicals .
Steinemann studied three common air fresheners ( a solid deodorizer disk , a liquid spray and a plug - in oil ) and three laundry products ( a dryer sheet , fabric softener and a detergent ) , selecting a top seller in each category .
She bought household items at a grocery store and asked companies for samples of industrial products .
In the laboratory , each product was placed in an isolated space at room temperature and the surrounding air was analyzed for volatile organic compounds , small molecules that evaporate from the product 's surface into the air .
Results showed 58 different volatile organic compounds above a concentration of 300 micrograms per cubic meter , many of which were present in more than one of the six products .
For instance , a plug - in air freshener contained more than 20 different volatile organic compounds .
Of these , seven are regulated as toxic or hazardous under federal laws .
The product label lists no ingredients .
This study does not address links between exposure to chemicals and health effects .
However , two national surveys published by Steinemann and a colleague in 2004 and 2005 found that about 20 percent of the population reported adverse health effects from air fresheners , and about 10 percent complained of adverse effects from laundry products vented to the outdoors .
Among asthmatics such complaints were roughly twice as common .
Manufacturers are not required to list the ingredients used in laundry products and air fresheners .
Personal - care products and cleaners often contain similar fragrance chemicals , Steinemann said .
And although cosmetics are required by the Food and Drug Administration to list ingredients , no law requires products of any kind to list chemicals used in fragrances .
" Fragrance chemicals are of particular interest because of the potential for involuntary exposure , or second - hand scents , " Steinemann said .
" Be careful if you buy products with fragrance , because you really do n't know what 's in them , " she added .
" I 'd like to see better labeling .
In the meantime , I 'd recommend that instead of air fresheners people use ventilation , and with laundry products , choose fragrance - free versions . "
The European Union recently enacted legislation requiring products to list 26 fragrance chemicals when they are present above a certain concentration in cosmetic products and detergents .
No similar laws exist in the United States .
" I hope this study will raise public awareness , and reduce exposures to potentially hazardous chemicals , " said Steinemann .
Steinemann 's work was funded by University of Washington research funds .
The government is out of Google 's way :
The FCC has just approved the HTC Dream , the first phone that will run Google 's " GPhone " Android mobile operating system .
No hi-res product shots included in the FCC 's documentation , but we 're able to confirm that the Dream will be able to access T - Mobile 's nascent 3G data network -- it 's been approved to use the 1700 MHz band , the chunk of airwaves that T - Mobile uses for 3G service .
And the phone includes a " jog ball , " which we understand is the correct jargon for the tiny trackball used on BlackBerries .
Now T - Mobile can start selling the Dream pretty much as soon as it wants .
We expect it to go on sale next quarter as promised -- specifically , before Nov. 10 -- that 's the date HTC has requested the FCC keep Dream photos and user manuals confidential until .

A few comments from the American Express conference call : ( hat tip Brian )
“ Over the past month or so , we have seen clear signs that the US economy is weakening .
Unemployment rates , as we know , took the largest jump in over 20 years .
Home prices declined at the fastest rate in decades , and consumer confidence is at one of its all - time low points .
Card member spending particularly among consumers slowed sharply during the latter part of the quarter .
Credit indicators as we signaled a few weeks ago deteriorated beyond our expectations , and by almost any measure the US economy and business environment are much weaker than the assumptions we first spoke to you about back in January and the conditions that existed in early June .
Now this fallout was evident across all consumer segments , even our longer - term super prime card members . ”
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
“ Affluent customers in some situations are cutting back on discretionary spending … we ’re seeing a slowdown in spend across the board ”
“ The severe decline in home prices and the marked rise in oil prices have had a fundamental impact on consumer budgets and behavior .
Not just as it relates to mortgages and home - related spending , but also across the full spectrum of the consumer economy .
We saw the first signs of weakness in our credit indicators at the end of last year and communicated this to you in January when we reported our fourth - quarter results .
At that time we took a credit - related charge in order to recognize the deterioration by strengthening our lending and charge card reserves , coverage ratios and levels .
In the first quarter , US lending write - off rates rose further , and at that time we indicated that the second - quarter loan - loss rate would be higher than the first quarter , which has proven to be the case .
In April and May US lending write - off rates were generally consistent with the 4 % to 6 % EPS growth plan that we discussed with you in early June .
However , as I showed you on the slide package , we saw our credit deteriorate in June beyond our expectations as the write - off rates rose and roll rates within the portfolio deteriorated versus prior months .
In other words , more and more consumers who are falling behind in their payments are remaining delinquent .
This causes us to assume that a greater percentage of past - due loans will not be repaid .
In light of the magnitude of the negative economic trends and our experience , we now believe the economic weakness in the US will likely worsen throughout the remainder of the year and negatively impact credit and business trend ... we now expect that our lending write - off rate in the third and fourth quarter will be higher than June levels . ”
We are all subprime now !
Here are the AmEx slides .
Several are interesting and show the credit deterioration .
U.S. Card Services billing only increased 2 % year - over - year in June - less than inflation .

Scientists at Schepens Eye Research Institute have discovered what chemical in the eye triggers the dormant capacity of certain non-neuronal cells to transform into progenitor cells , a stem - like cell that can generate new retinal cells .
The discovery , published in the March issue of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science ( IOVS ) , offers new hope to victims of diseases that harm the retina , such as macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa .
“ This study is very significant .
It means it might be possible to turn on the eye ’s own resources to regenerate damaged retinas , without the need for transplanting outside retinal tissue or stem cells , ” says Dr. Dong Feng Chen , associate scientist at Schepens Eye Research Institute and Harvard Medical School , and the principal investigator of the study .
“ If our next steps work in animal disease models , we believe that clinical testing could happen fairly quickly . ”
Scientists have long been aware of Müller cells ( which exist in great abundance in the eye ) and have generally assumed that they were responsible for keeping retinal tissue protected and clear of debris .
In recent years , however , researchers have reported that these cells sometimes exhibit progenitor cell behavior and re-enter the cell cycle ( dividing and differentiating into other type of cells ) .
Progenitor cells are similar to stem cells but are more mature and are more limited in the number of cells types they can become .
But until this study , scientists have not understood what triggers the transformation .
In their study , Chen and her team observed that when the naturally occurring chemicals known as glutamate and aminoadipate ( which is a derivative of glutamate ) were injected into the eye , the Müller cells began to divide and proliferate .
Not certain if these chemicals directly signaled the transformation , they tested them in the laboratory and in mice .
They added each chemical separately to cultures of pure Müller cells and injected each into the space below the retina in healthy mice .
In both cases , the cells became progenitor cells and then changed into retinal cells .
And with aminoadipate , the newly minted retinal cells migrated to where they might be needed in the retina and turned into desirable cell types .
Specifically , they showed that by injecting the chemical below the retina , the cells give rise to new photoreceptors – the type of cells that are lost in retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration , as a result , leading to blindness .
The team ’s next step will be to test this process in animals that have been bred to have diseases that mimic macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa .
The goal would be to learn if damaged retinas regenerate and vision improves .
The team will likely use just aminoadipate because it only binds with Müller cells without the side effects of glutamate , which can actually harm retina cells in large doses .
“ We believe that a drug created from the chemical aminoadipate or a similar compound has great potential for healing damaged retinas , ” says Chen .

Russia appears to be rolling back its military incursion into neighboring Georgia .
But that ’s probably because what Russia wanted was n’t territory at all .
Instead , experts say , by sending in its troops Russia seized the upper hand strategically in dealing with countries around its periphery .
“ They do n’t want to rebuild the Soviet Union , but they do want a sphere of influence , ” said Steven Pifer , a former deputy assistant secretary of State and ambassador to Ukraine .
Russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor Georgia ’s brash , Western - oriented leader , President Mikheil Saakashvili .
And Saakashvili gave the Kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of South Ossetia last week in an effort to reassert Georgia ’s sovereignty .
Advertisement
U.S. officials have called Russia ’s response disproportionate because its forces did not just expel Georgian troops from South Ossetia , but drove deep into Georgian territory and bombed Georgian targets .
Russian leaders most likely were responding not only to Georgia ’s military operation but to actions by neighbors and Soviet - era allies over a number of years .
“ I think this was aimed much more to the West , more to Ukraine , Central Asia and the other Caucasus states , ” said Sarah Mendelson , a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
“ I worry that any country in the region , such as Ukraine , that has been tilting towards the U.S. , may now think twice .
They may lean back a bit toward Russia . ”
For years , Moscow could do little but fume as NATO courted and enrolled Russia ’s former Soviet allies as members .
But now , with its economy resurgent because of high oil and gas prices , and NATO and the United States preoccupied with Iraq and Afghanistan , Russia ’s relative power in the region has grown .
Advertisement
“ For 3 1/ 2 centuries , Russia has dominated its neighborhood , ” said Angela Stent , director of the Center for Eurasian , Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University .
Russia is “ throwing a gantlet down , saying that there is n’t going to be any more NATO enlargement . ”
So far , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has granted membership to the three former Soviet Baltic republics : Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
Former Warsaw bloc countries from Poland in the north to Bulgaria in the south also have become members .
Georgia and Ukraine had been hoping to gain candidate status at a NATO meeting in December .
But recent events in Georgia may make NATO members and even the two countries themselves think twice .
“ The Russian argument is : ‘ We are a great power .
This is our sphere of influence .
Just because the Soviet Union collapsed does not mean that NATO can expand on our border , ’ ” Stent said .
Advertisement
Russia has sought to use other issues to reassert its sphere of influence , including objecting to NATO ’s plans to install missile defense radars and interceptor missiles in Eastern Europe and objecting to the West ’s recognition of the independence of Kosovo , formerly a separatist region of Russian ally Serbia .
But Russia has n’t gotten what it wanted in these cases .
The conflict in Georgia has drawn attention to its priorities in a new way .
“ I think that American officials and analysts -- and I would put myself in this boat -- underestimated the scope of the Russian reaction to Kosovo ’s separation from Serbia , ” Charles Kupchan , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , said in a conference call .
“ The Russians at the time said that they may well retaliate by stirring up trouble in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and I think many people said , ‘ Well , that ’s going to be mostly talk . ’
In fact , they ’ve gone ahead and done it . ”
Advertisement
In addition to reasserting Russia ’s regional preeminence , the incursion into Georgia also demonstrated the United States ’ relative weakness .
Janusz Bugajski , author of a forthcoming book on Russia ’s relations with its neighbors , said Washington ’s lack of forceful response sends a chilling message to nations that had been relying on the U.S. to counter Russia ’s power .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin “ is demonstrating to the rest of the world that the United States is not the sole superpower any more .
Or if it is , it ’s so stretched that it ’s not going to come to your aid , ” Bugajski said .
“ That weakens the U.S. position globally quite a bit . ”
U.S. protestations over Russia ’s incursion into Georgia probably would strike Russians as hypocritical , coming from a nation that invaded Iraq -- a country not even on its borders , Stent said .
Advertisement
Even if the United States resists the idea , it ’s possible that a resurgent Russia is ready for a new geopolitical rivalry in which powerful countries compete politically and militarily .
“ I think it ’s not inappropriate to put this conflict in the context of a ‘ great game , ’ ” Kupchan said .
“ There is still a battle going on for influence -- Western influence vs. Russian influence -- in the Caucasus and in the southern borderlands around Russia .
And clearly I think as a result of this conflict Russia will probably feel that it has taken a step forward in maintaining a ‘ sphere of influence . ’ ”

From Larry Lessig 's blog , a major victory for open licenses :
I am very proud to report today that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( THE " IP " court in the US ) has upheld a free ( ok , they call them " open source " ) copyright license , explicitly pointing to the work of Creative Commons and others .
( The specific license at issue was the Artistic License . )
This is a very important victory , and I am very very happy that the Stanford Center for Internet and Society played a key role in securing it .
Congratulations especially to Chris Ridder and Anthony Falzone at the Center .
In non-technical terms , the Court has held that free licenses such as the CC licenses set conditions ( rather than covenants ) on the use of copyrighted work .
When you violate the condition , the license disappears , meaning you 're simply a copyright infringer .
This is the theory of the GPL and all CC licenses .
Put precisely , whether or not they are also contracts , they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license .
Click above for high - res gallery of Jay 's Tank Car in Monterey
We were as surprised as anyone to see Jay Leno 's name on the entry list for this year 's Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance .
Then we saw that he would be arriving in a 1953 Chrysler .
As nice as 1953 Chryslers may be , Jay 's is pretty special .
It 's an imposing custom hot rod that is powered by a 28.4 - liter Chrysler built tank engine .
Most people call it the Tank Car , and last year this time it was on display across the country at the Woodward Dream Cruise .
The heart of the Tank Car is the 1792 cid V - 12 Continental - designed , Chrsyler - built tank engine that in turbocharged form puts out something like 1,600 hp and 3,000 ft-lbs. of torque .
The engine alone weighs 2,000 lbs and easily qualifies Jay 's car in this year 's featured 20 + liter class .
While performance is n't this car 's main goal , it can scoot along pretty well with all of that power being routed through an Allison 6 - speed transmission .
Switching from the original 3 - speed trans doubled Leno's gas mileage , which now stands at around 5 mpg .
As bad as that might seem , it comes across as almost reasonable when you hear it guzzles 80 quarts of oil every time Jay swings through a Jiffy Lube .
We have to admit that we were among the many fans who rushed to see the car as Jay entered the Pebble Beach fairway .
It 's really a spectacular sight , even at an event that is known to stop even seasoned auto afficianados in their tracks every few seconds .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has introduced her family to the nation as small - town common folk since she burst onto the scene as the surprise pick for the Republican vice - presidential nominee last month .
A check of financial records , though , shows the Palins live anything but a common life when compared with their fellow residents of their hometown of Wasilla .
Their combined income of nearly a quarter - million dollars last year was five times the median household income for Wasilla ’s 7,000 residents .
They own a single - engine plane , two boats , two personal watercraft and a half - million - dollar , custom - built home on a lake that is worth three times the average of other homes in town .
For the future , they also have a 401 ( k ) retirement account compliments of Todd Palin ’s years as an engineer with oil giant BP .
“ Gov. Palin ’s story is emblematic of the American dream , ” McCain campaign spokesman Ben Porritt said .
The Palins have been hugely successful by most standards in both their public and their private lives , according to the records .
“ As a person , she ’s consistent , honest and warm , ” said Cheryl Metiva , executive director of the chamber of commerce in the Palins ’ hometown of Wasilla .
“ As a politician , she ’s focused , direct and clear .
And she ’s done a tremendous job of balancing her family life and with her public duties .
“ You underestimate her at your peril , ” she said .
The couple ’s house was appraised this year at $ 552,100 , which , according to Alaska magazine , was designed and built by Mr. Palin .
Mr. Palin , known in Alaska as the “ First Dude , ” is a longtime commercial fisherman who maintains a highly sought - after commercial - fishing permit that has been handed down in his family from generation to generation .
A native of Dillingham , Alaska , his mother is one - quarter Yup ’ik Eskimo and his maternal grandmother is a member of the Curyung tribe , which is the source of the permit .
“ Hard work and principled convictions have allowed her to catapult to being the most popular governor in America , ” Mr. Porritt said of the Republican candidate .
“ As a mayor , governor and mother of five , she stuck to her principles and found success , ” he said , adding that a McCain - Palin administration would establish policies and goals to “ provide a transparent and efficient government that aids taxpayers to follow the same pathway of success . ”
But it has also provided fodder for numerous public attacks on the Alaska governor , questioning her competence and experience , along with her family and lifestyle .
She has faced rising criticism in the press , including conservative commentators who have expressed doubts about her ability to serve as vice president .
In a state known as “ The Last Frontier , ” where only about 1 percent of the land is privately owned and the rest is controlled by a distrusted federal bureaucracy , however , Mrs. Palin enjoys a near 90 percent approval rating and more property than nearly all her neighbors .
Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain ’s running mate lives with her husband and their five children - Track , 19 ; Bristol , 17 ; Willow , 14 ; Piper , 7 ; and Trig , 4 months - in a two - story house built in 2002 and located on more than 2 acres overlooking Lucile Lake in Matanuska Susitna County , about 40 miles north of Anchorage .
The couple also own four lakeside parcels , described in county records as “ recreation ” sites .
They encompass 35 acres of forest along Trapper Creek near Safari Lake , north of Wasilla , and were appraised this year at $ 102,700 .
The total tax bill on the couple ’s five properties , according to the records , was $ 7,662 .
The Palins reported no debts in disclosure documents filed by the governor other than the mortgage on their home .
State records also show that Mr. Palin has a pilot ’s license , owns a 320 - series Piper single - engine airplane and two boats , a 22 - foot Pacific Skiff fishing boat and a 22 - foot homemade aluminum fishing boat .
He also owns two Bombardier personal watercraft , valued at about $ 7,000 .
But as Alaska ’s first female governor , who told Congress “ thanks but no thanks ” to the notorious “ bridge to nowhere ” project derided nationally as an example of pork - barrel spending , Mrs. Palin has shown she is capable of eschewing her success to connect with voters .
“ Sarah Palin is a very goal - oriented person who has been very successful in all that she has tried , ” Wasilla ’s current mayor , Dianne Keller , told The Washington Times .
“ As the mayor here for six years and a member of the City Council before that , her constituents were her neighbors and she knew the buck stopped with her .
“ She showed her ability to put together a strong , nonpartisan team of advisers to get the job done , ” said Mrs. Keller , who first was appointed to the Wasilla City Council in 1996 and elected as mayor in 2002 .
“ She learned , as did I , that you go to the grocery store , the school and to the post office with your constituents .
She may have more executive experience than anybody else on the ticket . ”
In keeping with the small - town theme , Mr. McCain and Mrs. Palin began their post - convention tour of battleground states on Friday in Cedarburg , Wis. , a town of 11,056 , and the Alaska governor promptly ordered a large scoop of moose tracks - vanilla ice cream with peanut - butter cups and fudge , served in a waffle cone .
It would come as no surprise that during her recent gubernatorial race , Mrs. Palin - a proud member of the National Rifle Association - announced during a debate that her favorite meal was “ moose stew , after a day of snow machining . ”
After Mrs. Palin ’s election as governor in 2006 , Mr. Palin took a cut in his $ 120,000 annual pay as an engineer at BP in Prudhoe Bay to be to be an oil production operator at $ 46,790 a year .
The move was part of an effort to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest with big oil and to spend more time with his children as his wife went about the business of being governor .
Mrs. Palin had been a chairwoman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission .
Mr. Palin , according to his wife ’s state financial disclosure forms , also has participated for several years in a 401 ( k ) plan with BP and a pre-1996 SARSEP IRA pension plan through Smith Barney in his fishing business , both of which permit contributions to be made through employee salary reductions .
He relies mainly on mutual funds and exchange traded funds to guarantee his returns , the records show , and maintains a diversified portfolio .
Last year , Mrs. Palin received $ 125,000 as governor and Mr. Palin , an oil production operator and commercial fisherman , earned $ 93,000 , along with $ 22,500 as a professional snow - machine racer .
Mrs. Palin was elected to the Wasilla City Council in 1992 and won the major ’s job in 1996 , serving six years before being term - limited .
In addition to being a mayor and raising four children at the time , Mrs. Palin and her husband found time in 2004 to help start a business venture in Wasilla - part - owners of a car wash .
According to the Alaska Division of Corporations , Business and Professional Licensing , the Palins were partners in the Anchorage Car Wash , each holding a 20 percent share of the business - although Mrs. Palin failed to report their involvement in disclosure forms required in Alaska for gubernatorial candidates and it was later dissolved .
In February 2007 , state licensing officials said in a letter to the Palins ’ business partners , Ray and Carolin Wells of Anchorage , that the business had “ not filed its biennial report and / or paid its biennial fees , ” which were more than a year overdue .
The warning came on State of Alaska letterhead , which carried Mrs. Palin ’s name at the top , next to the state seal .
Two months later , the state issued a “ certificate of involuntary dissolution ” because of the car wash ’s failure to file its report and pay state licensing fees .
One of the coupe ’s lakeside properties , according to the county records , was jointly owned by the Palins and Scott and Debbie Richter , who also were business partners .
Mrs. Richter served as treasurer of Mrs. Palin ’s gubernatorial campaign and her inaugural committee and later was named to head the Permanent Fund Dividend Division at the Alaska Department of Revenue , which allocates oil revenues to Alaska residents .
The Richters have since divorced and the property is now jointly owned by the Palins and Mr. Richter , according to the record .
Mr. Palin finished fourth in February in the 2,000 - mile “ Tesoro Iron Dog ” race - the world ’s longest and most grueling snow - machine competition - despite breaking his arm after a 60 - miles - per - hour crash 400 miles short of the finish line .
The four - time race champion was thrown 70 feet from his Arctic Cat machine and had to be hospitalized , but only after crossing the finish line .
“ These are big boys ; they make their own decisions , ” Mrs. Palin said as she waited for her husband to cross the finish line .
“ They ’re hard - core Alaskans doing hard - core adventures .
I totally support him , and I totally support the race .
I love it .
Going 400 miles with a broken arm , now that ’s impressive .
“ If there ’s any way he can finish the race , ” she said , “ he ’s going to finish it . ”
The Iron Dog race was n’t the first time Mr. Palin tested his abilities or his work ethic .
The quarter Yup ’ik Eskimo has spent more than 20 years working the oil fields on Alaska ’s North Slope , along with duty as a commercial fisherman at the Bristol Bay Salmon Fishery on the Nushagak River in his hometown of Dillingham - two of the state ’s most physically demanding industries .
But the governor also is no stranger to adversity and determination .
She helped her high school basketball team win the state ’s small school championship in 1982 by sinking a critical free throw in the final seconds of a game despite an ankle stress fracture .
Mrs. Palin , a marathon runner whose intensity and tough play earned her the high school nickname “ Sarah Barracuda , ” sometimes went moose hunting with her father before school and found time in 1984 to finish second in the Miss Alaska beauty pageant , where she won a college scholarship and the “ Miss Congeniality ” contest .
The couple met at Wasilla High School and eloped in 1988 because they had no money for a wedding .

“ Science ” has many meanings , but one common meaning is “ the scientific method ” which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following steps :
Form a hypothesis about the world .
Use the hypothesis to make predictions .
Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions .
The ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method .
In particular , predictions must be made before experiments are run .
Given that we all believe in the scientific method of investigation , it may be surprising to learn that cheating is very common .
This happens for many reasons , some innocent and some not .
Drug studies .
Pharmaceutical companies make predictions about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to determine their effect .
Unfortunately , they have also been caught using some of the more advanced techniques for cheating here : including “ reprobleming ” , “ data set selection ” , and probably “ overfitting by review ” .
It is n’t too surprising to observe this : when the testers of a drug have $ 109 or more riding on the outcome the temptation to make the outcome “ right ” is extreme .
Wrong experiments .
When conducting experiments of some new phenomena , it is common for the experimental apparatus to simply not work right .
In that setting , throwing out the “ bad data ” can make the results much cleaner … or it can simply be cheating .
Millikan did this in the ‘ oil drop ’ experiment which measured the electron charge .
Done right , allowing some kinds of “ cheating ” may be helpful to the progress of science since we can more quickly find the truth about the world .
Done wrong , it results in modern nightmares like painkillers that cause heart attacks .
( Of course , the more common outcome is that the drugs effectiveness is just overstated . )
A basic question is “ How do you do it right ? ”
And a basic answer is “ With prediction theory bounds ” .
Each prediction bound has a number of things in common :
They assume that the data is independently and identically drawn .
This is well suited to experimental situations where experimenters work very hard to make different experiments be independent .
In fact , this is a better fit than typical machine learning applications where independence of the data is typically more questionable or simply false .
They make no assumption about the distribution that the data is drawn from .
This is important for experimental testing of predictions because the distribution that observations are expected to come from is a part of the theory under test .
These two properties above form an ‘ equivalence class ’ over different mathematical bounds where each bound can be trusted to an equivalent degree .
Inside of this equivalent class there are several that may be helpful in determining whether deviations from the scientific method are reasonable or not .
The most basic test set bound corresponds to the scientific method above .
The Occam ’s Razor bound allows a careful reordering of steps ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and step ( 3 ) .
More “ interesting ” bounds like the VC - bound and the PAC - Bayes bound allow more radical alterations of these steps .
Several are discussed here .
The Sample Compression bound allows careful disposal of some datapoints .
Progressive Validation bounds ( such as here , here or here ) allow hypotheses to be safely reformulated in arbitrary ways as experiments progress .
Scientific experimenters looking for a little extra flexibility in the scientific method may find these approaches useful .
( And if they do n’t , maybe there is another bound in this equivalence class that needs to be worked out . )
