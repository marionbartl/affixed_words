President George W Bush has promised Americans their government is working " aggressively " to steady the economy .
Speaking from the White House , Mr Bush said recent market turmoil was being driven by " uncertainty and fear " .
He spoke as world markets tumbled amid rising fears of a global recession , despite interest rate cuts and huge cash injections by central banks .
Group of Seven finance ministers are meeting in Washington to discuss how to tackle the global economic crisis .
The G7 most industrialised nations - the US , Japan , Britain , Germany , France , Italy and Canada - pledged a co-ordinated response and are expected to issue a joint statement on Friday evening .
We 're in this together and we 'll come through this together
President Bush
Peston : Global fix needed Fear grips global stock markets Credit crisis : World in turmoil
In his White House Rose Garden statement , Mr Bush defended the $ 700 bn ( £ 410 bn ) Wall Street rescue plan he signed into law a week ago .
He said it was big enough and stressed it would take time have its full impact .
Offering no new remedies , he said : " We are a prosperous nation with immense resources and a wide range of tools at our disposal .
We are using these tools aggressively . "
He pledged : " Fellow citizens :
We can solve this crisis , and we will . "
The US president said America was working with other world governments to stabilise the panic - stricken markets .
" We 're in this together and we 'll come through this together , " said Mr Bush .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington says that of several recent attempts by Mr Bush to inspire a rally in the markets , this was one of the longer and more detailed .
The White House later dismissed suggestions US markets could be suspended so international financial rules could be rewritten .
The idea had been raised by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
" There are absolutely no plans or discussions to interfere with the functioning of markets in the United States , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
' Self - feeding frenzy ' The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) will also hold talks in the US capital over the weekend .
And the French presidency has announced that leaders of the eurozone countries are to meet in Paris on Sunday .
Wall Street has lost more than a fifth of its value in the past 10 trading days and is heading for one of its biggest weekly falls since the Dow Jones index was created 112 years ago .
European shares plunged to end Friday between seven and nine percent lower .
The UK's FTSE 100 closed 8.9 % down , while the French Cac lost 7.7 % and German Dax dropped 8.4 % .
Shares in Asia also closed down sharply , with Japan 's main Nikkei index suffering its biggest one - day drop since the 1987 stock market crash and Hong Kong 's Hang Seng slumping to a three - year low .
There have been suspensions in trading in at least seven countries : Russia , Austria , Iceland , Romania , Ukraine , Brazil and Indonesia .
Volatile market conditions continued despite moves on Wednesday by six of the main central banks to cut interest rates by half a percentage point .
" It 's a self - feeding frenzy - you go to sleep and hear Japan is down , you wake up and hear Europe is down , then you come in to work and markets here are down , " said one New York banker .
The recent market mayhem has overshadowed the 4 November elections to choose a successor to Mr Bush , who steps down as president in January .
In other major developments : The British pound tumbled to a five - year low against the US dollar
Oil prices plummeted to a one - year low , with US light crude dropping to $ 78.61
The rate at which banks lend dollars to each other - known as Libor - has risen to 4.8 %

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said on Tuesday the U.S. housing sector faced more losses and the economy was in recession even as authorities moved to stabilize the financial system .
Volcker said the priority for U.S. authorities in the credit crisis was to stabilize the financial system even though that meant heavy government intrusion .
“ The first priority is to stabilize the financial system .
It is necessary even though the cost involved is heavy government intrusion in markets that should be private , ” he said in a speech at a seminar in Singapore .
“ House prices in the U.S. are still declining .
There are still more losses to come there .
The economy , I believe , is in recession . ”
Volcker is chairman of the board of trustees of the Group of 30 , an international body composed of central bank governors , leading economists and private financial sector experts .
He is credited for battling double - digit inflation that flared in the 1970s .
He was chairman of the U.S. central bank between 1979 and 1987 , before handing the reins over to Alan Greenspan , and oversaw a sharp increase in interest rates to quell the price pressures .

Volcker was asked by a member of the audience if the massive infusion of liquidity by the Federal Reserve could lead to inflation or stagflation .
“ It ’s not going to be a problem in the short run .
Inflation does n’t flourish in the face of recession , ” he said .
“ It ’s something we have to worry about when we get out of this recession . ”
The United States has announced various measures to combat a credit crisis that emanated from the U.S. housing market and which has spread globally .
U.S. authorities are expected to announce plans later on Tuesday to pump $ 250 billion into the country ’s banks following similar concerted measures in Europe to revive money markets and stave off a global recession .
“ I have been around for a while .
I have seen a lot of crises but I have never seen anything quite like this one , ” Volcker said .
“ This crisis is an exception .
I do n’t think we can escape damage to the real economy . ”

Every day the Beastie Boy known as MCA , who spent years rapping about girls and parties and the five boroughs , goes to work in an office .
Sure , it ’s a cool one : the former headquarters of the Benjamin Moore paint company , it is a loftlike space filled with surfboards , skateboards , flea market paintings and his fellow Beastie Mike D. ’s records ; the attitude is dot - com casual .
In this atmosphere of dudes , MCA has become the Boss .
Of course , it ’s been a long time since MCA , born Adam Yauch , was known only as a hip - hop artist .
In the 1990s he and his band mates founded an indie record label , Grand Royal , and a related magazine ; both eventually folded .
Under the name Nathanial Hörnblowér , he has directed many of the Beastie Boys ’ music videos and their 2006 concert film , which was shot by fans .
This year , under his own name , he released “ Gunnin ’ for That # 1 Spot , ” a documentary about high school basketball players .
Now , despite some formidable odds , he is pursuing his cinematic interests with a new division of his company , Oscilloscope , which acquires , produces and distributes independent movies .
Its next release , “ Flow , ” a documentary about global water problems , opens Friday .
Also on the schedule is “ Wendy and Lucy , ” a Cannes favorite starring Michelle Williams that will screen at the New York Film Festival on Sept. 27 and 28 and is scheduled to open Dec. 10 .
WELLAND , Ont.–NDP
Leader Jack Layton 's campaign travelled from Windsor to Welland yesterday , home to thousands of lost jobs in Ontario 's disappearing manufacturing heartland .
" We are going to be travelling right up the 401 through the communities that are being so hard hit by this manufacturing jobs crisis , " he said earlier in Windsor , which has the highest unemployment level in Ontario at more than 9 per cent .
Layton said communities along Highway 401 throughout the Golden Horseshoe are hurting like they have never before .
He visited seven communities – Windsor , Essex , St. Thomas , London , Welland - Thorold , Hamilton , and Guelph – in 16 hours .
" When you lose a good middle - class job , you are losing a lot , " Layton said in Thorold .
Nearby Welland is still reeling from the announcement last month that John Deere is closing its plant at the end of February , throwing some 800 employees out of work .
" In these difficult times you 've got to have leadership that understands the personal stories of Canadians , " he told reporters in Thorold after accusing Harper of not caring about the 400,000 manufacturing jobs that , he says , have disappeared .
" He ( Harper ) has no comprehension of what hundreds of thousands of them are going through , that they are losing their well - paid jobs and now can't make ends meet at the end of the month ... what planet is he living on ? "
Layton told supporters in hard - hit St. Thomas he has looked into the eyes of too many workers who have lost their good - paying factory jobs , in some cases after decades .
Some 2,000 CAW members recently marched through the streets to protest jobs lost there and across the country .
According to newspaper reports , over the past few years some 4,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost – about 10 per cent of the city 's population .
Layton is spending the last day of the campaign travelling by bus in southern Ontario after logging 55,873 kilometres and visiting 48 cities while criss - crossing the country since Sept.

Voter Group Admits Mistakes , Defends Work Group says its efforts should n't be tainted by the fraudulent work of a few .
Oct. 14 , 2008  --
A prominent voters registration group admitted today that it had fired some of its workers for falsifying voter registrations , but said that it had helped authorities to identify the phony voter cards and that its efforts should n't be tainted by the fraudulent activities of a few workers .
The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) has come under fire for submitting applications of dead people , the name of a fast food restaurant and the entire roster of the Dallas Cowboys football team .
The incidences of fraud in the ACORN registrations have become embroiled in presidential politics .
The campaign of John McCain has tied the ACORN effort to Barack Obama , who once represented ACORN .
And because of the group 's focus on minority or low income voters , Republicans have long connected the group 's voter registration drives as benefiting Democrats .
" ACORN is tampering with America 's most precious right .
There has to be a full and complete investigation , " McCain said during a campaign stop in Florida .
" Given the extensive relationship between Barack Obama and ACORN , our campaign also feels that Sen. Obama has a responsibility to rein in ACORN 's efforts and to work aggressively against wide - scale voter fraud , " the McCain campaign said in a statement today .
Sarah Palin , McCain 's running mate , told Rush Limbaugh on his radio show today that " this ACORN stuff is unconscionable . "
Obama told reporters in Ohio that he is not connected to ACORN .
" First of all , my relationship to ACORN is pretty straightforward .
It 's probably 13 years ago when I was still practicing law , I represented ACORN and my partner in that representation was the U.S. Justice Department in having Illinois implement what was called the ' Motor Voter ' law , to make sure that people could go to DMVs and drivers ' license facilities to get registered , " Obama said .
" There is an ACORN organization in Chicago , " Obama said .
" They have been active .
As an elected official , I 've had interactions with them .
But they are not advising our campaign .
We 've got the best voter registration and turnout and volunteer operation in politics right now and we do n't need ACORN 's help . "
ACORN held a news conference today to answer its critics .
Kevin Whelan , a spokesman for the nationwide group , admitted that in some states some of its workers had " decided to pad their hours " and had sent in duplicative or faulty registrations but that the " vast , vast majority " of its workers did a " great job . "
" There is no evidence that these false registrations led to false attempts to cast a ballot , " Whelan said .
Whelan said that ACORN tries to independently verify applications and that by state law " and good judgment " it turns over all its applications to election workers , even those it has flagged as potentially problematic .
Some of those registration cards have become the focus of fraud investigations in Nevada , Connecticut , Missouri and at least five other states .
Election officials in Ohio and North Carolina also recently questioned the group 's voter forms .
The group claims to have about 13,000 workers that have registered 1.3 million citizens to become voters in 2007 and 2008 , but it could not immediately provide the number of workers it had fired in connection to the collection of faulty voter registration .
Election workers in Lake County , Ind. , have turned up at least 2,000 registration cards they say are fraudulent and clog the system .
John Curley , chairman of the Lake County Republicans , said ACORN " is bringing in massive amounts of registrations that are mostly phony . "
One application was delivered in August and signed by a Jimmy Johns of 10839 Broadway .
The application is signed and dated , but calls to the phone number listed on the application reveal that it is for a Jimmy Johns restaurant .
A waiter at the restaurant said there was no Jimmy Johns at that address , adding , " It 's a huge chain of restaurants . "
Curley also provided an application for one Levy McIntosh of Gary , Ind .
He said McIntosh is dead and provided a reporter with the death certificate on file with the same address listed on the voter application .
The date of birth on the two different forms varies by two years .
But ACORN and other voting registration groups fought back forcefully today .
" By raising the issue of voter fraud , " said Miles Rapoport of the voting rights group Demos , " a serious disservice is being done to the election process itself . "
Rapoport claims that Republicans are using the issue to " divert attention " from other voting issues such as untrained workers , absentee voting problems and machines that are n't working correctly .
The issue of voter fraud has long divided down party lines .
Some claim that voter fraud is not at all a significant problem because there have been few convictions of voter impersonation .
Dan Tokaji , an election law expert at Moritz College of Law , said , " You 'd have to be a complete idiot .
It 's high risk , low reward . "
Tokaji says that voter fraud is " rare " and that Republicans are " trying to use the ACORN story " to raise fears of fraud and " make it more difficult for people to vote . "
But Heather Heidelbaugh , a Republican lawyer based out of Pennsylvania , says that Democrats often limit the definition of voter fraud to voter impersonation .
" The broader definition of voter fraud includes voter registration and absentee ballots . "
" I do n't think voter impersonation is a rampant problem , " she said .
" It would be very difficult to walk into a voting place and impersonate someone . "
But she says that it bothers her when people say voter fraud does n't exist .
" I bristle when I hear that it does n't exist , " she said .
" If ACORN or groups like them flood election division offices with thousands of fraudulent registrations , each one of them has to be checked and it means the chances are that a valid registration wo n't be processed because of time restraints .
Therefore the legitimate voter would be denied the ability to vote . "

The process makes water bead on any surface Almost any surface or fabric can be made waterproof but remain breathable thanks to a former military technology .
The process was originally developed to ensure soldiers ' clothing remained impermeable to chemical weapons .
Shoe maker Hi-Tec has signed a deal with the developers of the process to use the technology to waterproof many of its shoes .
The first commercially available shoes treated with the process were shown off in London this week .
Chemical coat
The technology was funded by the Ministry of Defence and developed at its Defence Science and Technology Laboratory for making military clothing resistant to nerve agents .
The process - dubbed ion-mask by its inventors - works using a chemical based on the element fluorine .
In a closed chamber , the chemical is vaporised and attaches , molecule by molecule , to all the fibres in a fabric .
The chemical makes the surface " hydrophobic " or water - repelling , so that instead of water spreading out it forms droplets on the surface .
The chemical coating covers just the fibres , rather than forming a " skin " across the whole surface , as with currently available waterproofing treatments .
That means the spaces between fibres remain open and the fabric is still breathable .
" The normal way in which you 'd make a shoe waterproof is put a membrane inside the shoe ; Gore - Tex is a well - known example , " says Ian Robins , business development director of P2i , the company marketing the process .
" That 's effectively putting a plastic bag inside the shoe .
No water gets inside your shoe , but at the same time that reduces the breathability both in terms of sweat and of heat escaping . "
Treated materials stay cleaner too
Shoe fabric made with the ion-mask process was tested for breathability in an air - flow test , outperforming commercial waterproof fabrics such as Gore - Tex by more than a factor of 100 , P2i claims .
The shoes were also subjected to flexing and wear tests , maintaining their breathable waterproof properties even after 100,000 flexes .
The fabrics are also inherently stain - resistant and easier to clean , says P2i .
Dr Robins says coating a pair of shoes using the ion-mask process requires just a tenth of a gram of the fluorine compound , and costs in the region of a few dollars - significantly less than the cost of integrating membranes like Gore - Tex into a pair of shoes .
The process can easily be applied to any garments or any material , and Dr Robins suggests that it might also become the basis for a separate after - purchase service business , like dry cleaning .
It can also be used to waterproof outdoor gear .
High Street outdoor equipment retailer Millets , owned by Black 's Leisure Group , will be stocking the men's Hi-Tec ion -mask shoes in 75 stores .
" This could change waterproof footwear as we know it , " says Michelle Swan , a senior footwear buyer at Black's .
She said the company would keep an eye on the " revolutionary " technology and perhaps use it in other areas of its business .

An extinct Galapagos tortoise species could walk again , scientists believe .
Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers report finding relatives of Geochelone elephantopus alive and well .
Cross - breeding these living tortoises might re-create the extinct species - though it could take a century .
The distribution of related tortoises between the islands was one of the pieces of evidence Charles Darwin used in formulating his theory of evolution .
But of 15 known Galapagos species , four have since gone extinct - elephantopus less than two decades after Darwin visited the island .
The islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted in a quite marvellous manner , by very closely related species
Charles Darwin
On the Origin of Species Now , according to Gisella Caccone from Yale University in New Haven , US , there is a chance that its former island home of Floreana could one day feel its footsteps again .
" We might need three or four generations to do this , " she told BBC News .
" But in theory it could be done , and I think it 's pretty exciting to bring back from the dead a genome that we thought was gone . "
Whalers ' bounty
When HMS Beagle visited the Galapagos in 1835 , Darwin noted that many of the islands were home to giant tortoises that shared many features , yet were distinct from island to island .
The vice - governor of the archipelago told the naturalist that he could identify which island a tortoise came from , just by its appearance .
Yale 's Nikos Poulakakis examines a museum specimen of elephantopus Darwin later surmised that the animals had been carried to the Galapagos from mainland South America , where similar species could be found .
As with other groups of animals , he believed that once a group of tortoises reached an island , they would then maintain a relatively isolated existence , and populations on the various islands would evolve in subtly different ways .
" Thus the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted , as I have elsewhere shown , in a quite marvellous manner , by very closely related species ; so that the inhabitants of each separate island , though mostly distinct , are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world , " he noted in his masterwork On the Origin of Species .
But he also saw at first hand that some of the islands were being depleted of their marvellous inhabitants by whaling ships , which would cart the tortoises away to be killed and eaten at a later date .
Dr Caccone believes that about 250,000 tortoises may have been removed in this way .
Floreana , as a relatively low - lying island where the wildlife was therefore relatively easy to hunt , was depleted more than most , leading to the disappearance of elephantopus .
The biggest island of all , Isabela , was less ravaged .
And around one of its volcanoes , researchers found a group of animals that did not look like the others .
Snail 's pace Now , genetic analysis shows they are close to the Floreana lineage .
The likely explanation is that sometimes , whaling vessels would find they had picked up more tortoises than they needed , and so would jettison the excess animals in shallow water as they returned through the archipelago .
So some of the Floreana tortoises made it to Isabela , where their genes have - albeit slowly , for these animals take about 25 years to produce a new generation - mixed with those of other species .
Finding the relatives is one thing ; but using their genetic heritage to bring back the extinct Floreana species is quite another .
The Yale team plans next to mount a more exhaustive survey of the Volcano Wolf region of Isabela to identify more individuals carrying elephantopus genes .
" Then we would have to look at individuals of interest , and genotype them and maybe use marker - assisted selection to help the process along , " said Dr Caccone .
Marker - assisted selection involves choosing which individuals to cross according to which versions they carry of which genes , so taking away some of the randomness involved in conventional cross-breeding .
But the long intervals between generations mean that even if the project does start , it will not be concluding any time soon .
A century ahead would be a fair bet .

The talks broke up in angry recriminations , according to accounts provided by a participant and others who were briefed on the session , and were followed by dueling news conferences and interviews rife with partisan finger - pointing .
Friday morning , on CBS ’s “ The Early Show , ” Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts , the lead Democratic negotiator , said the bailout had been derailed by internal Republican politics .
“ I did n’t know I was going to be the referee for an internal G.O.P. ideological civil war , ” Mr. Frank said , according to The A.P. Thursday , in the Roosevelt Room after the session , the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , literally bent down on one knee as he pleaded with Nancy Pelosi , the House Speaker , not to “ blow it up ” by withdrawing her party ’s support for the package over what Ms. Pelosi derided as a Republican betrayal .
“ I did n’t know you were Catholic , ” Ms. Pelosi said , a wry reference to Mr. Paulson ’s kneeling , according to someone who observed the exchange .
She went on : “ It ’s not me blowing this up , it ’s the Republicans . ”
Mr. Paulson sighed .
“ I know .
I know . ”
It was the very outcome the White House had said it intended to avoid , with partisan presidential politics appearing to trample what had been exceedingly delicate Congressional negotiations .
Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate banking committee , denounced the session as “ a rescue plan for John McCain , ” and proclaimed it a waste of precious hours that could have been spent negotiating .
But a top aide to Mr. Boehner said it was Democrats who had done the political posturing .
The aide , Kevin Smith , said Republicans revolted , in part , because they were chafing at what they saw as an attempt by Democrats to jam through an agreement on the bailout early Thursday and deny Mr. McCain an opportunity to participate in the agreement .

MINNEAPOLIS ( Reuters ) - Al Franken , a comedian and former liberal radio talk show host , won the Democratic nomination on Tuesday to run for a U.S. Senate seat from Minnesota .
In the November election , he will face incumbent Republican Sen. Norm Coleman and the Independence Party ’s Dean Barkley , who also won their nominating contests , according to returns from the state ’s primary election .
Franken , who once starred on the late - night sketch comedy program “ Saturday Night Live , ” outran six opponents , taking 66 percent of the vote , with more than half the returns counted .
Coleman had only token opposition .
Barkley , who was appointed briefly to the U.S. Senate by former third - party Gov. Jesse Ventura after Democratic Sen .
Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash in 2002 , topped a field of seven candidates .
Minnesota is one of several battleground states as Democrats try to maintain or expand their slim control over the U.S. Senate .

The U.S. military is being assigned to do the job law enforcement did in Saint Paul during the RNC : suppress dissent and squelch freedom of expression .
Last year we heard about the counterintuitive observation that DNA repair mutants ( which exhibit premature aging and shortened lifespans ) have significant phenotypic and transcriptional overlap with genetically dwarfed or calorie restricted ( CR ) animals ( which exhibit delayed aging and extended longevity ) .
The interpretation of those surprising results : Both DNA repair deficiency and CR cause organisms to divert resources away from reproduction and growth , and toward maintenance and repair .
( It just happens to be fruitless for the DNA repair mutants , since they ’re dumping energy into a compromised pathway . )
Chalk one up for the disposable soma theory of aging .
Now , a follow - up paper from ( basically ) the same research group compares age - related transcriptional changes between mice aging normally , prematurely or slowly .
The study , which includes data from multiple organ systems across the entire lifespan , confirms and expands on the observation that progeria and extended lifespan share common phenotypic features .
From Schumacher et al. :
Delayed and Accelerated Aging Share Common Longevity Assurance Mechanisms
Mutant dwarf and calorie - restricted mice benefit from healthy aging and unusually long lifespan .
In contrast , mouse models for DNA repair - deficient progeroid syndromes age and die prematurely .
To identify mechanisms that regulate mammalian longevity , we quantified the parallels between the genome - wide liver expression profiles of mice with those two extremes of lifespan .
Contrary to expectation , we find significant , genome - wide expression associations between the progeroid and long - lived mice .
Subsequent analysis of significantly over - represented biological processes revealed suppression of the endocrine and energy pathways with increased stress responses in both delayed and premature aging .
To test the relevance of these processes in natural aging , we compared the transcriptomes of liver , lung , kidney , and spleen over the entire murine adult lifespan and subsequently confirmed these findings on an independent aging cohort .
The majority of genes showed similar expression changes in all four organs , indicating a systemic transcriptional response with aging .
This systemic response included the same biological processes that are triggered in progeroid and long - lived mice .
However , on a genome - wide scale , transcriptomes of naturally aged mice showed a strong association to progeroid but not to long - lived mice .
Thus , endocrine and metabolic changes are indicative of “ survival ” responses to genotoxic stress or starvation , whereas genome - wide associations in gene expression with natural aging are indicative of biological age , which may thus delineate pro- and anti-aging effects of treatments aimed at health - span extension .
Those last two sentences are very important , in that they address a critical issue in studies of transcription ( indeed of any phenotype ) as it changes with age .
Given the observation that expression of gene X ( or hormone Z ) changes with age , one must next ask :
How do we know whether this change reflects a causative feature of aging , a defensive response to another age - related change , a passive response of no great import , an epiphenomenon , or an artifact of the experimental system ?
( I ’ve discussed this concern before , in the context of age - specific regulation of micro- RNAs . )
The authors would argue that the changes that are common to both progeroid and long - lived animals represent true protective / defensive responses to age - related stresses ( according to the same logic that underlies the interpretation of the earlier work , discussed above ) .
In contrast , those features shared between natural aging and progeria — of which there are far more — are signs of deterioration and decrepitude , and thus reflect age - related decline .
This logic is powerful : Having distinguished between these two classes of age - related transcriptional change , we ’re far better equipped to start meaningfully measuring biological age .
February 27 , 2008 , was a bad day for renewable energy .
A cold front moved through West Texas , and the winds died in the evening just as electricity demand was peaking .
Generation from wind power in the region rapidly plummeted from 1.7 gigawatts to only 300 megawatts ( 1 megawatt is enough to power about 250 average - size houses ) .
The sudden loss of electricity supply forced grid operators to cut power to some offices and factories for several hours to prevent statewide blackouts .
By the next day everything was back to normal , but the Texas event highlights a huge , rarely discussed challenge to the adoption of wind and solar power on a large scale .
Unlike fossil fuel plants , wind turbines and photovoltaic cells cannot be switched on and off at will :
The wind blows when it blows and the sun shines when it shines , regardless of demand .
Even though Texas relies on wind for just over 3 percent of its electricity , that is enough to inject uncertainty into the state ’s power supplies .
The problem is sure to grow more acute as states and utilities press for the expanded use of zero- carbon energy .
Wind is the fastest - growing power source in the United States , solar is small but also building rapidly , and California is gearing up to source 20 percent of its power from renewables by 2017 .
Experts reckon that when wind power provides a significant portion of the electricity supply ( with “ significant ” defined as about 10 percent of grid capacity ) , some form of energy storage will be essential to keeping the grid stable .
“ Without storage , renewables will find it hard to make it big , ” says Imre Gyuk , manager of energy systems research at the U.S. Department of Energy .
Fortunately , there is a promising solution on the horizon : an obscure piece of technology known as the vanadium redox flow battery .
This unusual battery was invented more than 20 years ago by Maria Skyllas - Kazacos , a tenacious professor of electro­chemistry at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia .
The vanadium battery has a marvelous advantage over lithium - ion and most other types of batteries .
It can absorb and release huge amounts of electricity at the drop of a hat and do so over and over , making it ideal for smoothing out the flow from wind turbines and solar cells .
Skyllas - Kazacos ’s invention , in short , could be the thing that saves renewable energy ’s bacon .
To the engineers who maintain the electrical grid , one of the greatest virtues of a power supply is predictability , and that is exactly why renewable energy gives them the willies .
Nuclear - and fossil fuel–powered plants produce electricity that is , in industry speak , “ dispatchable ” ; that means it can be controlled from second to second to keep the grid balanced , so the amount of energy being put into the wires exactly matches demand .
If the grid goes out of balance , power surges can damage transmission lines and equipment .
Generators are therefore designed to protect themselves by going off - line if the grid becomes unstable .
Sometimes this can amplify a small fluctuation into a cascading disaster , which is what happened in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada in August 2003 , plunging 50 million people into a blackout .
Unless the reliability of renewable energy sources can be improved , as these sources contribute more and more electricity to the grid , engineers will have an increasingly difficult time keeping the system balanced .
This raises the specter of more blackouts , which nobody would tolerate .
“ We want to make renewables truly dispatchable so we can deliver given amounts of electricity at a given time , ” Gyuk says .
The way to make renewables more reliable is to store the excess electricity generated during times of plenty ( when there are high winds , for instance , or strong sun ) and release it later to match the actual demand .
Utilities have been using various storage techniques for decades .
Hydroelectric plants , for instance , often draw on reservoirs to generate additional electricity at peak times , and then pump some of the water back uphill in off - peak periods .
Compressed air is another , less common form of large - scale energy storage .
It can be pumped into underground cavities and tapped later .
These technologies have been suggested as ways of storing renewable energy , but both approaches rely on unusual geographical conditions .
“ For most of us right now , the real key to effective storage is batteries , ” says Jim Kelly , senior vice president of transmission and distribution at Southern California Edison .
Specifically , what is needed is a battery that can store enough energy to pull an entire power station through a rough patch , can be charged and discharged over and over , and can release large amounts of electricity at a moment ’s notice .
Several promising battery technologies are already in early - stage commercialization , but the vanadium battery may have the edge in terms of scalability and economy .
Like the battery in your cell phone or car , vanadium batteries are rechargeable , but chemically and structurally they go their own way .
A vanadium battery consists of three main components : a stack where the electricity is generated and two tanks that hold liquid electrolytes .
An electrolyte is any substance containing atoms or molecules that have positive or negative electrical charges .
These charged atoms or molecules are known as ions , and the amount of charge on an ion is known as its oxidation state .
In a battery , electrolytes are used as an energy storage medium .
When two electrolytes , each containing ions with different oxidation states , are allowed to exchange charges , the result is an electric current .
The technical term for this kind of charge exchange is a redox reaction , which is why the vanadium battery is formally known as the vanadium redox battery .
A traditional battery , such as the familiar AA dry cell , holds electrolytes in its own sealed container .
But the vanadium battery is a flow system — that is , liquid electrolytes are pumped from external tanks into the stack , where the electricity - generating redox reaction takes place .
Want to store more power ?
Use bigger tanks .
The bigger the tanks , the more energy - rich electrolytes they can store .
The downside is that flow batteries tend to be big .
It takes a flow battery the size of a refrigerator , incorporating a 160 - gallon tank of electrolytes , to store 20,000 * watt - hours of electricity , enough to power a full - size HDTV for about three days .
This is because the energy density in the liquid electrolytes is relatively low compared with that of the chemicals in lithium - ion batteries .
( Energy density is a measure of the amount of energy that can be extracted from a given volume or mass of a battery . )
For this reason , flow batteries are unlikely to be found in mobile applications , like laptops or electric cars .
In those cases the battery of choice remains lithium - ion , which has an energy density five times that of vanadium .
For large - scale energy storage , the rules are very different .
Typical rechargeable batteries are unsuitable because it is difficult to get a lot of energy out of them quickly ; when the grid is on the verge of crashing , you want an energy infusion now .
Ordinary rechargeables also wear out easily .
A typical laptop battery will die after a few hundred charge - discharge cycles .
In contrast , flow batteries can be charged and discharged many thousands of times .
A vanadium battery generates electricity in a stack , where electrolytes with different oxidation states ( indicated by the numbers ) are allowed to react via a central membrane , so that V ( +5 ) becomes V ( +4 ) and V ( + 2 ) becomes V ( +3 ) .
Bigger tanksallow more electricity to be stored .

The vanadium battery ’s indefatigable nature echoes that of its creator , Skyllas - Kazacos , a single - minded researcher whose no -nonsense manner is frequently punctuated by an unexpected easy laugh .
Her path to the vanadium battery began quite by accident in 1978 at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill , New Jersey , where she was a member of the technical staff .
She had applied to work on solar energy .
At the time , Bell Labs was developing liquid - junction photovoltaics ( a type of solar cell that employs liquid electrolytes ) , which seemed like a nice fit for her electrochemical training .
But the director of the lab ’s battery section picked up her job application first and liked what he saw .
Much to her surprise , when Skyllas - Kazacos arrived she was assigned to do research on batteries , which she had never worked on before .
Her serendipitous experience in batteries was put to good use five years later after her return to Sydney , where she had grown up after immigrating with her family from Greece in 1954 .
She took a position at the University of New South Wales .
A colleague there asked her to co-supervise a student who wanted to investigate ways of storing solar energy .
The project sounded interesting , so she agreed .
Skyllas - Kazacos started her research by building on the foundational work on flow batteries done by NASA in the mid-1970s .
The space agency ’s scientists recognized that flow batteries could store solar power on a spacecraft , but they gave up on them after hitting a snag known as cross-contamination .
When two liquid electrolytes made of different substances are separated by a membrane , sooner or later the membrane is permeated and the two substances mix , rendering the battery useless .
The early NASA flow batteries , which used iron and chromium , quickly ran down as a result .
“ We thought the way to solve this problem was to find an element that could be used on both sides , ” Skyllas - Kazacos says .
Technically , cross-contamination would still occur , but with essentially the same substance doing double duty , the problem would be moot .
The key was to pick an element that could exist in a variety of electrical , or oxidation , states .
Skyllas - Kazacos chose vanadium , a soft , bright white , relatively abundant metal named for Vanadis , the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and youth .
Vanadium has four oxidation states , known as V ( + 2 ) , V ( +3 ) , V ( +4 ) , and V ( +5 ) ; in each state the element carries a different amount of electric charge .
Often oxidation states are hard to tell apart , but in this case nature was kind : V ( +2 ) is purple , V ( +3 ) green , V ( +4 ) blue , and V ( +5 ) yellow .
Simply having different oxidation states is not enough to make an element work for a liquid battery .
The element has to be soluble , too .
NASA had considered and rejected vanadium because the technical literature insisted that the solubility — and hence energy density — of the useful V ( +5 ) form of the element was extremely low .
Skyllas - Kazacos recognized , however , that just because something appears in print does not necessarily mean it is true .
Previous studies had started by leaving a compound of vanadium , vanadium pentoxide , to dissolve in solution .
This was a very slow process that could take days , and it never produced more than a tiny amount of V ( + 5 ) in solution .
Skyllas - Kazacos approached the problem from a less direct route .
“ I started off with a highly soluble form , V ( +4 ) , then oxidized it up to produce a supersaturated solution of V ( +5 ) .
I found that I could get much higher concentrations .
From then on it became clear that the battery would actually work . ”
In 1986 came a major milestone : Her university filed for a patent on the Skyllas - Kazacos vanadium battery .
But proving the concept turned out to be the easy part .
“ We thought we would take the device to a certain level , and then some industry group would come and take it off our hands , ” Skyllas - Kazacos says with her laugh .
“ What we did n’t realize was that the task was enormous .
We had to develop the membranes , the conducting plastic for the electrodes , the structures , the materials , the designs , the control systems — everything ! ”
In 1987 Agnew Clough , an Australian vanadium mining company , took out a license on the technology .
But nothing came of the deal .
The vanadium battery finally got its first chance to shine in 1991 , when Kashima - Kita Electric Power , a Mitsubishi subsidiary located north of Tokyo , took out a new license on the technology .
Kashima - Kita powers its generators with Venezuelan pitch , a fuel rich in vanadium .
Skyllas - Kazacos ’s battery was a perfect fit .
Here was a technology that allowed the company to recycle the vanadium from its soot and flatten out fluctuations in demand for its electricity at the same time .
The world ’s first large - scale vanadium battery went into operation in 1995 , able to deliver 200 kilowatts for four hours — enough to power about 100 homes .
It was a success , but Kashima - Kita sold the license and did n’t build another .
The buyer , Sumitomo Electric Industries , a giant Osaka - based company , had been working on NASA - style iron - chromium flow batteries since the early 1980s .
Things looked up for Skyllas - Kazacos ’s invention when Sumitomo switched to vanadium and licensed the technology in 1997 .
Three years later Sumitomo began selling vanadium batteries , including a 1.5 - megawatt model that provides backup power to a Japanese liquid crystal display factory .
By maintaining power during blackouts and thus preventing production losses , the battery reportedly paid for itself in six months .
Sumitomo has since demonstrated vanadium technology in at least 15 other implementations , including a 170 - kilowatt battery at a wind farm in Hokkaido .
All are located in Japan , their development subsidized by the government .
Sumitomo does n’t sell outside Japan , possibly due to the battery ’s high manufacturing cost .
One company is now taking up the vanadium banner worldwide : VRB Power Systems , a Vancouver , British Columbia , start - up that bought most of the early intellectual property rights to the technology .
The company is targeting the market for hybrid systems used to power remote , off - grid telecom applications .
“ In places like Africa , cell phone towers are typically powered by little putt - putt diesel engines that run 24/7 , ” VRB CEO Tim Hennessy says .
By adding a vanadium battery to the system , one can run the diesel generator while charging the battery , turn the diesel off , run the battery , then repeat the cycle nonstop .
“ The beauty of the battery is that you can cycle it as many times as you like , ” Hennessy says .
“ The electrolyte does n’t wear out . ”
VRB has installed 5 - kilowatt batteries at two sites in Kenya .
Hennessy claims that these can produce “ at least a 50 percent reduction in the burning of diesel fuel , plus the diesels will need less maintenance and last much longer .
It promises to make a huge difference to our customers ’ operating expenses . ”
The firm ’s other recent sales include a 20 - kilowatt system , worth $ 300,000 , that will deliver nine hours of backup power for an undisclosed major telecom company in Sacramento , California .
These customers are learning firsthand what Skyllas - Kazacos learned two decades ago .
The vanadium battery really works .
For all of vanadium ’s promise , it still faces skeptics — including , surprisingly , some in the wind - power business who think the energy storage problem is not such a big deal .
One big sticking point is price .
Vanadium batteries currently cost about $ 500 per kilowatt - hour .
So to run a city of 250,000 for 24 hours off a vanadium battery , the price tag would come to $ 2.4 billion .
“ Storage is not needed for wind , and it is unlikely to be cost effective in the next decade , ” argues Rob Gramlich , policy director of the American Wind Energy Association .
Gramlich points out that a recent U.S. Department of Energy report , “ 20 % Wind Energy by 2030 , ” hardly mentions storage .
He notes , too , that Denmark , the world ’s most enthusiastic user of wind power , gets by without storage .
How do the Danes do it ?
The grid in western Denmark is strongly interconnected with those of Norway , Sweden , and Germany , which act as giant energy sponges for their neighbor .
They sop up cheap surplus power from Denmark when the wind is blowing and return expensive hydroelectric power during peak periods .
The result is that , although 17 percent of the electricity the Danes generate comes from wind , they use only 7 or 8 percent , according to Hugh Sharman of Incoteco , a Denmark - based energy consultancy and development company whose clients include VRB .
The rest is exported .
That situation will not be sustainable if the countries add more renewable power — and the Danes propose building another 4.5 gigawatts ’ worth of offshore wind farms .
That leaves two ways of meeting electricity demand when the wind drops .
Either build lots of small , fast - acting , fossil - fueled backup turbines , or go for storage .
As the price of natural gas soars , battery storage is rapidly becoming a more economically appealing option .
Researchers at the Riso National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy in Roskilde , Denmark , are currently evaluating a 15 - kilowatt VRB battery .
Cost is not the only obstacle that the vanadium battery has to overcome .
Reliability may also be an issue , following the shutdown last year of a vanadium battery showcase , a 200 - kilowatt backup system that was installed in 2003 at a wind farm on King Island , off the northern coast of Tasmania .
A problem with the plant ’s battery ( which was not supplied by VRB ) caused the electrolyte to overheat , damaging the stack .
Still , other demonstration vanadium batteries , such as a 250 - kilowatt installation at Castle Rock , Utah , have been operating reliably for years .
One vote of confidence comes from China .
A group led by Huamin Zhang at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in northern China has finished testing 2- , 5 - , and 10 - kilowatt vanadium battery modules and is currently evaluating a 100 - kilowatt system .
Vanadium “ will have a potential market in China with the increasing development of renewable energy supported by the Chinese government , ” Zhang wrote in an e-mail message .
“ Furthermore , large - scale energy storage systems are strongly needed in China [ as backup during ] frequent natural disasters ” such as the recent Sichuan earthquake .
The greatest challenge to the vanadium battery may come from other advanced battery technologies , most seriously from sodium - sulfur batteries made by the Japanese ceramic specialist NGK Insulators .
Though less scalable , sodium - sulfur has attracted investors because it is a more mature technology .
Installations include the town of Rokkasho in northern Japan , where 34 megawatts of sodium - sulfur storage backs up 51 megawatts of wind turbines .
In the end , the vanadium battery has some uniquely appealing traits that may make it the best partner for renewable energy — not just for giant wind farms , but also for small - scale turbines and solar cells that bring renewable power directly into consumers ’ homes .
Currently , sodium - sulfur technology does n’t work well at sizes below 1 megawatt .
For smaller applications , such as regulating the flow of electricity from a house ’s solar panels , vanadium - based systems look more cost - effective .
They can be fit to more modest demands by using smaller tanks .
These smaller applications are where Skyllas - Kazacos is currently focusing her efforts .
Three years ago she , along with her husband Michael and sons Nick and George , founded V - Fuel to develop and commercialize a second - generation vanadium battery .
The impetus to found V - Fuel came when the University of New South Wales sold the rights to first - generation vanadium battery technology to VRB Power Systems .
Two years later , with nothing left to develop , her battery lab — which at its height had 18 members — closed .
Yet people kept contacting Skyllas - Kazacos about vanadium batteries , and she kept thinking up ideas for a better version .
In 2005 , at age 54 , her husband wanted to retire .
She told him , “ No , you can ’t — we ’re starting again ! ”
“ I could see so many opportunities , ” Skyllas - Kazacos says , “ but a lot of this interest was n’t translating into real sales because the cost was just too expensive . ”
The key to cutting cost , she notes , is finding a replacement for the flow battery ’s most expensive part , the membrane .
Following a worldwide search for a suitable material , V - Fuel designed a polymer membrane that Skyllas - Kazacos claims is durable and less than half the price of conventional materials .
A second challenge is making a smaller battery , one that does not need a warehouse to store electrolyte tanks .
To do this , Skyllas - Kazacos has found an electrolyte that allows more vanadium to dissolve , thus doubling the energy storage density .
Atop a bench in V - Fuel ’s cramped workshop in Sydney sits a prototype 5 - kilowatt battery stack .
The size of a filing - cabinet drawer , the stack is designed to be rack - mounted above a square block consisting of two electrolyte tanks .
The resultant package would be compact enough to fit in a household closet .
Configured as part of a home - based generation system , it could absorb power from rooftop solar panels and discharge electricity during peak periods .
Skyllas - Kazacos estimates that such a consumer - use vanadium battery might eventually sell for around $ 5,000 .
At that price it could pay for itself in a few years .
So the vanadium battery may play a big role both invisibly at the electric utility and very visibly in the home , smoothing out Mother Nature ’s rough edges so that renewable power works just as well as coal or natural gas .
Stabilizing a future national grid that draws the majority of its power from renewable sources may seem like a tall order for a technology that delivers megawatts , not gigawatts , of power as it is used today , but some industry insiders are confident batteries can rise to the challenge .
“ At this point , [ a 1.2 - megawatt battery ] is fairly large - scale , but we are at the front end of this curve , ” Jim Kelly of Southern California Edison says .
“ Five years from now that will seem so trivial .
It ’s like comparing the first personal computer you had with the ones we have today .
You look back and laugh .
I think we ’ll see that same thing happen with the battery industry .
We are taking baby steps , in part because the industry is not mature , the technology winners have not been determined , and the costs are still high .
But these are all the things you expect as a revolution happens . ”

We cannot recall when there were lower expectations for a candidate than the ones that preceded Sarah Palin ’s appearance in Thursday night ’s vice - presidential debate with Joseph Biden .
After a series of stumbling interviews that raised serious doubts even among conservatives about her fitness to serve as vice president , Ms. Palin had to do little more than say one or two sensible things and avoid an election - defining gaffe .
By that standard , but only by that standard , the governor of Alaska did well .
But Ms. Palin never really got beyond her talking points in 90 minutes , mostly repeating clichés and tired attack lines and energetically refusing to answer far too many questions .
Senator Biden did well , avoiding one of his own infamous gaffes , while showing a clear grasp of the big picture and the details .
He left Ms. Palin way behind on most issues , especially foreign policy and national security , where she just seemed lost .
It was in those moments that her lack of experience  two terms as mayor of a tiny Anchorage suburb and less than two years as governor  was most painfully evident .
Asked about Israel , Ms. Palin reeled off her support for “ a two - state solution , building our embassy also in Jerusalem , those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish with this peace - seeking nation . ”
Asked about the possible use of nuclear weapons , she declared “ nuclear weaponry , of course , would be the be-all , end - all of just too many people and too many parts of our planet . ”
On Iraq , all she had to offer was the false accusation that Barack Obama wants to surrender .
The Bridge to Nowhere argument is n't going much of anywhere .
Despite significant evidence to the contrary , the McCain campaign continues to assert that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin told the federal government " thanks but no thanks " to the now - famous bridge to an island in her home state .
The McCain campaign released a television advertisement Monday ...

Sarah Palin ’s Alaska has been called the “ Paul Revere of global warming . ”
That ’s because the sharp impacts the state has been feeling , including the just - announced near - record melting of Arctic sea ice this summer , are a warning of what the rest of us will soon be feeling .
But even as these impacts have become evident ( and notwithstanding her equivocal , unconvincing comments about climate change in her recent interview with ABC ’s Charlie Gibson ) , Palin has remained in a state of denial .
If she should ever ascend to the presidency , we would be right back where we started from with a leader who believes in her guts , like George W. Bush , that humans can do no wrong to the planet .
And that fantasy could ultimately lead to a truly scary future .
The harm is already vividly apparent in Alaska .
Winter temperatures there have soared by as much as 5 to 7 degrees F over the past 50 years , bringing a host of environmental changes .
As I ’m writing this on September 16 , the National Snow and Ice Data Center has announced that sea ice in the Arctic Ocean off the Alaskan coast reached its second lowest extent on record , dropping to almost a million acres below the 1979 to 2000 average minimum .
As the increasingly ice - free coast is left vulnerable to storm surges , and permafrost continues its dramatic meltdown , Alaskan towns like Shishmaref are slipping into the Arctic Ocean .
Away from the coasts , fire has been consuming ever more acreage throughout the boreal forests of North America , including Alaska , with the average area burned each year doubling since 1970 .
In 2004 alone , 6.6 million acres of Alaskan forest burned , an area the size of Massachusetts , making it the worst Alaskan fire season on record .
And the fires did n’t stop .
The very next year , another 4.6 million acres went up in smoke .
Between 2004 and 2005 , fully one quarter of all the forests in northeastern Alaska were consumed .
Trees in Sarah Palin ’s state also are succumbing to another onslaught brought on in part by warming temperatures : voracious beetles .
Four million acres of mature spruce in south - central Alaska have been killed by bark beetles — the world ’s largest recorded outbreak .
In the southeastern portion of the state , warming temperatures also are implicated in a massive die - off of 500,000 acres of yellow cedar — possibly the most economically valuable tree of the Tongass National Forest .
Meanwhile , more than 10,000 ponds in Alaska have either shrunk or disappeared completely since the 1950s , according to research by scientists at the University of Alaska Fairbanks .
These changes , the researchers concluded , may trigger a cascade of harm to plants and animals , including reductions in waterfowl species .
Of course , the overwhelming majority of scientists attribute the warming that ’s triggering these changes to our emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat - trapping greenhouse gases .
As the 2007 assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change puts it , “ Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations . ”
James
White , director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado , is more blunt : “ The basic physics here are so sound and so simple that the notion we could increase CO2 , methane , and nitrous oxide and not change the climate is so utterly bizarre that it is laughable .
And it amazes me that people get away with it . ”
With her state ’s changing environment sounding the alarm about global warming , what has Sarah Palin had to say about it ?
Not long ago , she told the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner that , “ I ’m not an Al Gore doom - and - gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity . ”
She was a little more circumspect in an interview with Newsmax when John McCain picked her as his running mate , but her message was exactly the same : “ A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state , because of our location .
I ’m not one , though , who would attribute it to being man-made , ” she said .
“ If I were a citizen of Alaska I would be really pissed off that the governor is saying this , ” Jim White says .
“ It ’s as if a group is roaming around Alaska shooting people .
We know who is doing it , yet we claim we do n’t know why people are showing up with bullets in their heads . ”
Just two weeks after denying the reality of global warming , Palin backpedaled awkwardly in her interview with Charlie Gibson on ABC , in an apparent attempt to bring her views more into line with Senator McCain ’s : “ I believe that man ’s activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming , climate change . ”
Our activities can contribute to the issue of global warming ?
It seems that Palin cannot bring herself to say unambiguously that we are causing global warming , period .
She may be able to see Russia from Alaska , but she evidently remains blind to the role humans are playing in the burning of her state ’s forests , the dwindling of its ponds , the melting of its permafrost , and the shrinking of its glaciers and sea ice .
According to White , the record of ancient climate changes shows us where we may be headed in the long term if we continue to avoid grappling with the challenge of global warming .
White and other paleoclimatologists increasingly offer the example of the Pliocene Epoch , which ended 1.8 million years ago .
Temperatures in the Arctic at that time were as much as 20 degrees warmer than they are today .
Trees were growing all the way up to the edge of the Arctic Ocean .
That may sound benign , but consider that sea level probably was 75 feet higher than it is today , according to White .
“ That ’s basically good bye to Florida . ”
Why was it so warm ?
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere likely was as high or perhaps a little higher than it is today .
But that alone ca n’t account for the extreme Arctic warmth .
Scientists believe a phenomenon known as albedo may have played a major role .
Ice and snow on the surface of the ocean and on land in the Arctic reflect much of the sun ’s incoming energy back into space , helping to reinforce cold temperatures .
As greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere , and temperatures thereby warm , ice begins to melt , allowing sunlight to be absorbed by dark sea water and the land surface .
This , in turn , enhances warming .
In the Pliocene , this process is hypothesized to have gained more and more momentum , laying the Arctic Ocean bare , uncovering a significant amount of land in Greenland , and ultimately leading to the dramatically warmer temperatures of that epoch .
Could that happen again , but this time with us as the driving force ?
White thinks so .
Roughly half of the Arctic Ocean now is free of ice in summertime , and scientists believe it could all be gone in just a few years .
That could produce even more warming , and more melting , in a vicious cycle .
Other impacts , such as warming of soils in the Arctic tundra , could enhance the warming even further .
According to White , tundra soils contain more carbon than all the fossil fuels on Earth .
Right now , this carbon is essentially frozen in place .
But there are some worrying signs that as the Arctic warms , some of the carbon is beginning to flood into the atmosphere .
In the long run , if enough of Greenland were to melt “ we could go from a few degrees warming to 20 degrees of warming , and from 1 meter of sea level rise to 25 meters , ” White says .
No one knows for sure how much melting in Greenland would be required .
And the process could take well more than 100 years to play out .
But this is where we could be headed if we follow Palin ’s lead and fail to recognize how big an impact we human beings have on the planet .
The animosity that she and her fellow global warming skeptics have shown toward climate science may be rooted in a downright unbiblical fantasy : the idea that human beings could not possibly change the planet in a profound way .
These critics seem to have missed the message in the Bible that many of them profess to cherish — the message that God gave us dominion over the Earth .
“ This is one of the most important moments in human history ever , ” White argues .
“ We ’re going from being just an occupant of the planet to being the dominator of the planet .
That switch is happening right now .
And it ’s one of the biggies .
We ’ve sought dominion over this planet , and now we ’ve got it . ”

This current financial crisis is a major way - station on the way to the collapse of the American empire .
The first important sign was 9/11 , with the most heavily - armed nation in the world shown to be vulnerable to a handful of hijackers .
And now , another sign : both major parties rushing to get an agreement to spend $ 700 bn of taxpayers ' money to pour down the drain of huge financial institutions which are notable for two characteristics : incompetence and greed .
There is a much better solution to the current financial crisis .
But it requires discarding what has been conventional " wisdom " for too long : that government intervention in the economy ( " big government " ) must be avoided like the plague , because the " free market " will guide the economy towards growth and justice .
Let 's face a historical truth : we have never had a " free market " , we have always had government intervention in the economy , and indeed that intervention has been welcomed by the captains of finance and industry .
They had no quarrel with " big government " when it served their needs .
It started way back , when the founding fathers met in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft the constitution .
The first big bail - out was the decision of the new government to redeem for full value the almost worthless bonds held by speculators .
And this role of big government , supporting the interests of the business classes , continued all through the nation 's history .
The rationale for taking $ 700bn from the taxpayers to subsidise huge financial institutions is that somehow that wealth will trickle down to the people who need it .
This has never worked .
The alternative is simple and powerful .
Take that huge sum of money and give it directly to the people who need it .
Let the government declare a moratorium on foreclosures and give aid to homeowners to help them pay off their mortgages .
Create a federal jobs programme to guarantee work to people who want and need jobs and for whom " the free market " has not come through .
We have a historic and successful precedent .
Roosevelt 's New Deal put millions of people to work , rebuilding the nation 's infrastructure , and , defying the cries of " socialism " , established social security .
That can be carried further , with " health security " – free health care – for all .
All that will take more than $ 700 bn .
But the money is there .
In the $ 600 bn for the military budget , once we decide we will no longer be a war - making nation .
And in the swollen bank accounts of the super - rich , by taxing vigorously both their income and their wealth .
When the cry goes up , whether from Republicans or Democrats , that this must not be done because it is " big government " , the citizenry should just laugh .
And then agitate and organise on behalf of what the Declaration of Independence promised : that it is the responsibility of government to ensure the equal right of all to " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness " .
Only such a bold approach can save the nation – not as an empire , but as a democracy .

An early plea for
investment banker welfare
Advertisement
Jim Cramer , a popular financial program TV host in the US , had a bit of a breakdown on camera last year ( August 2007 )
Because he made his reputation by histrionics and grandstanding , it did n't hurt him among his audience .
Cramer claimed to be concerned for the fate of millions of Americans who were saddled with predatory real estate loans in recent years .
Maybe he actually cares about the thousands of home owners who will be hurt by this insanity .
Maybe .
But clearly , the folks that Cramer demonstrated real concern for in this tirade were his friends who work for hedge funds and investment banks : " People are losing their jobs ! " he cried .
Pardon me if I do n't shed a tear for the crooks who 've collected seven figure bonuses each year for turning our financial system into a casino .
Here 's what I have to say to the bankers who are crying now :
" You put it all on red and it came up black .
Tough shit .
Stop sniveling from the back of your limousines and houses in Hamptons and get a life .
Why should the people who actually work for a living and add real value to the economy reduce their already - reduced standard of living further to bail you out ? "
BoFA is buying about $ 44 billion of Merrill 's common shares , as well as $ 6 billion of options , convertibles , and restricted stock units .

Deserted : 100 + Abandoned Buildings , Places and Property
What is it about abandoned property and places , frozen in time , that makes them seem more real than any other representation of history we encounter ?
From individual structures to entire abandoned towns and cities , abandonments large and small inspire the imagination and tell us things about the past in a visceral way .
Capturing moments in time , deserted cities , towns , buildings and other abandoned property can be powerfully evocative .
Many people break laws , trespass on property and risk life and limb to explore and photograph abandoned places .
7 Abandoned Wonders of the World ( and Part Two ) : From New York to Chernobyl , Taiwan to Siberia , these collections cover everything from individual deserted buildings to abandoned islands and entire communities around the world .
And the reasons for their abandonment ?
Everything from changing industrial economies and social structures to lack of government funds and nuclear disasters .
7 Abandoned Wonders of America ( and Part Two and Part Three ) :
It seems somehow less surprising when we hear about abandoned places in foreign countries with a long history of political , economic and social turmoil .
What is somewhat more shocking is how many abandonments can be found in a country like the United States of America .
The desertion of some of these speaks to changes in American society , such as the abandonment of military bases or the neglect for former psychiatric institutions .
7 Abandoned Wonders of Europe : While American abandonments have impressive stories to tell many European abandonments are even more impressive .
Some of them date back to the days when the United States was in its infancy or are tied to political parties or historic battles the likes of which were never seen across the pond .
From beautiful churches to gritty industrial factories each one of these structures tells a story about the history of the European country in which it can be found .
7 Abandoned Wonders of the Former Soviet Union ( and Part Two ) :
It is truly amazing what the Soviets have abandoned at various stages of history .
In some cases they have left entire airfields and ship yards to go to seed , or evacuated entire towns due to changing economic goals within the country .
No other place in the world has such physically enormous and technologically impressive abandoned buildings , vehicles and places .
Infamous Abandonments from Famous Films :
Have you ever wondered where your favorite eerie scenes from thrillers like 12 Monkeys or The Abyss were filmed ?
In many cases the abandoned locations used as stage sets and backdrops for these movies are as impressive as the films themselves .
From abandoned industrial complexes to deserted nuclear reactors here are some of the most infamous abandonments used in film .
Amazing Abandoned Missile Silos : Believe it or not , there are a great many missile silos in the United States and elsewhere in the world you can visit , break into or even buy .
Some people play it safe and take the guided tours , others enter without permission and at potentially grave personal risk and still others have purchased silos and converted them into strange dream homes and other impressive spaces .
Beautiful Abandoned
Theaters :
Once a place of gathering an empty theater volume can be a vast and ominous space , a spectacle of a much different kind than it was created to be .
Here are various theaters around the world of different kinds and in different stages of desertion and disrepair , some of which are arguably more complexly beautiful now as they fade than when they were fully functional .
DALLAS , Texas ( CNN ) --
Teachers and parents in Dallas , Texas , are angry about new grading policies that they say are dumbing down the district and pushing students through the system who have n't earned it .
Students who fail a test in Dallas this year get to retake it , with the failed score tossed out .
One of the most contentious of the policies allows a student who fails a test to retake it , with the lower score being tossed out .
" Instead of setting high expectations and the high standards and holding them to that , we seem to be wanting to lower the bar and give them an excuse not to succeed , " said Dale Kaiser , president of the National Education Association , the teachers union .
Dallas Independent School District officials refused multiple interview requests from CNN .
But in interviews with CNN affiliates and in documents outlining the grading policy , district officials say the goal of the grading system is to emphasize learning , not failure .
Watch a free ride or a second chance ? »
" This is not about giving anybody any sort of free ride .
What this is about is giving students a second chance to be successful , " John Dahlander , a spokesman for the school district , told CNN - affiliate WFAA .
The policy allowing failed test scores to be thrown out is just one of several changes to the grading policy that went into effect at the start of this school year .
Other grading policies include :
• For elementary and middle school students , only homework grades " that raise a student 's average " will be recorded .
• Students must be given one opportunity to turn in homework assignments that were n't finished on time .
• Parents must be contacted before a teacher records a zero in the grade book .
" I think it 's ridiculous , " said parent Bobbie Wilhite .
" It 's tough out there once you get out of high school .
We 're already namby - pamby enough for our kids . "
The new policies were put in place because Dallas has one of the highest dropout rates in the state of Texas .
A small committee of administrators and teachers wrote the new grading policy .
The goal , they say , is to keep kids in school and prevent them from getting discouraged and dropping out .
" What we 're really interested in is ' Are the children learning ? ' and if they 're not , we need intervention immediately .
This system does that , " said Jerome Garza , a district school board trustee .
But teachers and parents say students who fail to perform or turn homework in on time need to learn there are consequences for such behavior .
They worry this new system will create an atmosphere of mediocrity .
Kaiser , with the teachers union , says the district should not be afraid of setting the educational bar high .
" If you just lower expectations of them and tell them we 'll let you slide and give you an excuse not to be successful , then by all means they will be unsuccessful .
But if you say ' Here 's the bar , you 've got to come get it , ' they 'll find ways to come and get it , " Kaiser said .

Robertson : Nuke strikes in US after the election Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday October 2 , 2008
Print This Email This Christian Broadcasting Network co-founder Pat Robertson , in a new update to his Web site , states that , " we have between 75 and 120 days before the Middle East starts spinning out of control . "
The 700 Club host is convinced that Israel will attack Iran 's nuclear energy facilities shortly after the US presidential election , triggering a series of " dramatic events " that conclude only once " God has rained fire on the islands of the sea and on the invading force coming against Israel . "
In 2005 , Robertson called on the US government to assassinate Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez , dismissing the murder as , " a whole lot cheaper than starting a war . "
And , going back further , Robertson has opined that American judges pose a greater threat than terrorists , and that Hurricane Katrina was due to legalized abortion .
Robertson also hypothesized that the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 were " deserved . "
As recently as February , Robertson disclosed that the 700 Club 's producer uses cocaine .
He then mustered a muddled explanation of how Bolivian President Evo Morales supplies his producer 's personal stock .
" His off - the - wall predictions and bizarre statements tar all fundamental Christians with an extreme brush , " said Rob Boston with Americans United for Separation of Church and State , in a published report .
" I guess he believes he has a direct pipeline to God .
Given the number of false predictions he 's given , I might question who 's at the other end of that pipeline . "
" The Western powers have left Israel no choice but to strike Iranian nuclear facilities now , " said Robertson in his latest polemic .
" However , it seems to me , after consultation with Chris Mitchell ( our CBN News Jerusalem Bureau Chief ) , that Israel will not want to commence actions against Iran until after the United States elections have taken place .
In my opinion , Israel will be forced to make a preemptive strike against the Iranian nuclear reactors by air or submarine - launched cruise missiles during the brief period between the U.S. elections and the inauguration of a new U.S. president . "
Another Robertson favorite :
Thanks to a " miracle " health shake sold on his Web site , 78 - year - old Robertson was able to leg press over 2,000 lbs .
Or , so he claims .
Robertson 's letter , from www.patrobertson.com, is as follows :
Dear Friend ,
I am writing to you with a sense of grave urgency and a special call to prayer .
Here is the situation :
Russias vicious dismemberment of the tiny nation of Georgia is the beginning of an unfolding sequence of Russian aggression .
At present , pipelines from Siberia that run through Russia supply the majority of natural gas and oil used by Western Europe and Ukraine .
A pipeline from the Caspian Sea has been bringing one million barrels a day of non-Russian oil through Georgia to Turkey and the Mediterranean Sea .
Russia wants to control all of those vital pipelines .
Tbilisi , the capital of Georgia , is only 578 miles from Baghdad , the capital of Iraq .
Russia has helped neighboring Iran build its two aggressive nuclear facilities .
Georgia and Iraq are now sandwiched between the dictatorships of Russia and Iran .
The Russian leader , Vladimir Putin , seems to want to dominate Caspian oil and Persian Gulf oil to add to Russias own enormous supplies of oil and gas .
If he succeeds , Russia will gain a stronghold over the economies of most of the world and can then act to bring America to its knees .
Against that backdrop , consider what is happening in Iran .
That nation is under the domination of a fanatical group of Shiite Muslim clerics .
The president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is a fervent believer in the Mahdi , a mythical messiah figure who , according to his belief , will come to make the entire world Muslim , but only after a period of worldwide chaos and destruction during which all the Jews will be killed .
Iran , despite warnings from the United Nations , is on an accelerated course to build nuclear facilities and an atomic bomb .
The Iranians recently test fired an improved intermediate - range ballistic missile , the Shahab - 3 , that is capable of carrying nuclear warheads to hit Israel , Iraq , and most of Europe .
Ahmadinejad has repeatedly expressed a desire to use nuclear weapons to annihilate the nation of Israel .
He has declared that the threat of nuclear retaliation from Israel against Iran does not concern him because tens of millions of Iranian deaths will merely hasten the coming of the Mahdi .
In the 1930s , Adolf Hitler made clear his diabolic plan .
Early on , the Allied Powers , France and Great Britain could have stopped Hitler but they scoffed at his pretensions .
In 1945 , only after World War II and 50 million tragic deaths , did the free world recognize the cost of its indifference to the clear warnings from Hitlers own speeches and published writings .
In 2008 , the nation of Israel does not have the luxury of ignoring the ravings of a fanatic who soon will possess nuclear bombs with a will to use them .
The Western powers want to talk and negotiate with Russia and Iran , but talk is futile .
If Russia moves again to crush a neighbor or enter the Middle East , and if Iran develops an atomic bomb , time for talk will be over .
The Western powers have left Israel no choice but to strike Iranian nuclear facilities now .
However , it seems to me , after consultation with Chris Mitchell ( our CBN News Jerusalem Bureau Chief ) , that Israel will not want to commence actions against Iran until after the United States elections have taken place .
In my opinion , Israel will be forced to make a preemptive strike against the Iranian nuclear reactors by air or submarine - launched cruise missiles during the brief period between the U.S. elections and the inauguration of a new U.S. president .
But here is the downside for Israel .
In Lebanon , on Israels northern border , the radical group known as Hezbollah has , along with Iranian help , completely rearmed and now possesses as many as 40,000 rockets targeting Israel .
To the south of Israel , in Gaza , another Iranian client , Hamas , is armed to the teeth and longing for an opportunity to strike Israel .
Of course , any Israeli strike against the nuclear facilities of Iran will trigger a counter blow from Iran and possibly Syria .
But these are not the only dangers .
Would Russia then consider hostilities ( such as I have outlined ) the excuse to enter the fight on trumped - up reasons in order to further its ultimate aim of controlling Middle East oil ?
As the potential conflict spreads , oil terminals would be engulfed in smoke and flames .
The Strait of Hormuz would be blocked , and with it 40 percent of the worlds oil .
The industries of the world would face severe energy shortages and the economies of both America and the European Union would face a devastating depression .
What if the United States decided to oppose the Russian expansion ?
The Russians have enough long - range nuclear - tipped ballistic missiles aimed at the United States to annihilate all of our cities .
Would we be willing to play a nuclear game of chicken with Russia to save Israel ?
Probably not .
Would the United States risk war with Russia over Middle East oil ?
Perhaps , but unlikely .
If we act , it will be ugly .
If we dont act , our economy could either be crippled or faced with continually escalating exactions demanded by Russia for oil .
About 2600 years ago , God gave the Prophet Ezekiel a description of an invasion of Israel after the Jews had been regathered to the Promised Land from all over the world in the latter days .
Ezekiel wrote of an invasion force led by Russia that would include Iran and  Cush ,  which is Sudan .
The other parties described by Ezekiel that constituted the invading force could include some of the Muslim nations in the former Soviet Caucasus region and possibly Turkey .
According to Ezekiel 38:12 , they would come seeking plunder and loot .
What greater plunder than the oil riches of the Persian Gulf ?
Will this unfold all at once ?
It s difficult to say .
But what is clear is this :
The Israeli strike against Iran will be the trigger .
From then on , dramatic events will follow in quick succession .
It all will conclude when God has rained fire on the islands of the sea and on the invading force coming against Israel .
Where will the United States be in all of this conflict ?
According to Ezekiel , the young lions of Tarshish will be questioning the Russians about their aggression  questioning , but not acting to stop it .
Who are these young lions of Tarshish ? 
Tarshish was the region beyond Cadiz in Spain .
In antiquity , explorers from Tarshish came to Ireland , then across the ocean to North America , traveling the Mississippi River as far as the present - day site of Davenport , Iowa .
I believe the term young lions of Tarshish refers to England and the United States of America .
According to Ezekiel , when the Middle East trouble begins , the young lions of Tarshish will warn Russia and Iran , but refuse to act .
We will suffer grave economic damage , but will not engage in military action to stop the conflict .
However , we may not be spared nuclear strikes against coastal cities .
In conclusion , it is my opinion that we have between 75 and 120 days before the Middle East starts spinning out of control .
If there was ever a time for fervent prayer , it is now .
Prayer can change the course of history !
The Bible says ,  Seek righteousness , seek humility .
that you may be hid in the day of the Lords wrath .  the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
The believing prayers of tens of thousands of Gods people can change the hearts of the leaders of Russia and Iran .
God can cause situations to arise which will save Israel .
He is Almighty .
With God all things are possible !
With that in mind , I urge you to fervently seek Gods intervention in the following areas :
Pray that Gods mighty angels would surround and protect our nation in these perilous times ;
Pray for unity among the body of Christ as we intercede for our nation and our world ;
Pray that Americas leadership will seek godly wisdom as they face critical events in the weeks and months ahead ;
Pray for the Holy Spirit to sweep across the globe , preparing hearts to accept Jesus and enter Gods Kingdom before tragic events unfold ;
Pray for God to change the hearts of leaders in Russia , Iran , and other nations who wish to do harm to Israel .
Hopefully , our Lord will intervene and head off the disaster that seems to be approaching .
Let us pray together .
With God all things are possible !
God bless you .
I remain ...
I guess if we 're talking crazy it 's good that it 's from one crazy person to another .
John Madden was on Adam Schein's , Sirius radio show , and the former Raiders ' Coach had this to say about his former employer .
Via PFT ....
“ People say , ‘ Why did he have that press conference and why did he go through everything ? ’
I think that he just heard so many things that he wanted to just straighten them out .
And it was one of things , he was going to be damned if he did and damned if he did n’t .
If he did n’t have a press conference they were going to say , ‘ Why did n’t you come out ?
Why did n’t you talk to the media ?
Why did n’t you show yourself ? ’
And then if he does [ have a press conference ] , ‘ Why do you have to air all of your laundry in public ? ’
In that situation there was probably no right way to do it and if you want to criticize him and the Raiders , then either way that he chose he ’s going to be criticized anyway . ”
As to the press conference , Madden had two observations .
“ One , he was making a coaching change and that announcement and that was one part of it , ” Madden said .
“ And then I think all the things that he ’s been living with the last maybe six months and hearing and not reacting to , he reacted to .
That ’s what I think .
So I think it was a double agenda .
One , a coaching change and , one , let ’s get some things straight that have been said the last six months that I ’ve been completely quiet about . ”
Finally , Madden addressed whether the situation in Oakland can be repaired .
“ I think it is fixable , ” Madden said .
“ Anytime you have an organization and an owner that wants to win as badly as Al Davis wants to win , and will spend the money to win , I do n’t think you have as many barriers as you think .
Those are easy .
The ones that would be tough is where you did n’t have any good players and you had an owner or an organization that did n’t want to spend any money to get good players . ”
Do you think that the Raiders may have had a mind erasing machine back in the day ?
I know Madden loves Al Davis , and that he owes his career to him , but that was a pretty egregious step around there .
Oh and no .... the Raiders situation is not fixable .
Sorry Raider fans .... just jump ship now .
John Madden On Al Davis ( Pro Football Talk )
MEMORIAL services are being held across America today to mark the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington , DC , which claimed nearly 3,000 lives in 2001 .
Al - Qaeda , an Islamist terrorist group , was responsible for the attacks , though not everyone agrees .
In a recent poll of 16,000 people in 17 countries , only in nine did a majority of respondents say al - Qaeda or Osama bin Laden , its leader , were behind the attacks .
Overall some 46 % said the group was to blame , with Kenyans and Nigerians most convinced .
Alarmingly , 23 % of Germans subscribe to the conspiracy theory that the American government plotted the attack .
In the Middle East , many point to Israel .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government on Sunday seized control of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , launching what could be its biggest federal bailout ever , in a bid to support the U.S. housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence .
Officials were concerned mounting losses at the two companies , which own or guarantee almost half of the country ’s $ 12 trillion in outstanding home mortgage debt , was sapping their vitality and threatening to undermine them at a time other sources of housing finance have largely run dry .
“ Our economy and our markets will not recover until the bulk of this housing correction is behind us , ” U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said at a news conference .
“ Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are critical to turning the corner on housing . ”
The two companies , publicly traded but also serving a government mission to support housing , were put in a conservatorship that allows their stock to keep trading but puts common shareholders last in any claims .
Their top executives were ousted .
Freddie Mac chief executive Richard Syron and Fannie Mae ’s CEO , Daniel Mudd , were replaced by David Moffett , a former top official at US Bancorp and Herb Allison , formerly with Merrill Lynch and pension fund TIAA - CREF .
In addition , the U.S. Treasury will immediately take a $ 1 billion equity stake in each company in the form of senior preferred stock and if needed could inject up to $ 100 billion into each firm .
The government ’s senior preferreds stock would rank above both existing preferred and common shares and will carry warrants that could give the government an ownership stake of 79.9 percent .
Treasury also set up a program under which it would buy mortgage - backed securities currently held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump fresh funds into the mortgage market .
It said it would begin buying MBS later this month , and it would have authority to make such purchases through December 31 , 2009 .
Paulson said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were so large that “ a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in our financial markets here at home and around the globe . ”
Several analysts said the move should help instill some confidence in shaky credit markets and lower mortgage costs .
“ The government had to do something to eliminate uncertainty , ” said Peter Goldman , a principal with Front Barnett Associates in Chicago .
“ Anything that eliminates uncertainty in the credit markets is a good thing . ”
The Treasury Department said the plan to shore up the finances of the two government - sponsored enterprises , which have $ 1.6 trillion in debt outstanding , should not cost U.S. taxpayers money in the long run and could even return cash to the government coffers eventually .
The companies have suffered combined losses of nearly $ 14 billion in the last four quarters and large holders of their debt , including overseas central banks , have begun to show signs of increasing nervousness over their financial health .

Worries over their shrinking capital position led their regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency , to place them in conservatorship .
“ As house prices , earnings and capital have continued to deteriorate , their ability to fulfill their mission has deteriorated , ” FHFA Director James Lockhart told the news conference .
“ They have been unable to provide needed stability to the market . ”
He said the companies lacked sufficient capital to continue taking losses while supporting the housing market at the same time .

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement that he “ strongly ” endorsed the action .
“ These necessary steps will help to strengthen the U.S. housing market and promote stability in our financial markets , ” he said .
As part of the plan , FHFA will operate the companies until they are stabilized and the Treasury will extend financing to the companies , as well as to the Federal Home Loan Banks , through a new lending facility until December 31 , 2009 , if needed .
In addition to the senior preferred stake Treasury is taking in the companies , it will immediately receive warrants for the purchase of some common stock .
The stock of the two companies has fallen more than 90 percent in the past year and in recent months foreign investors have pared their holdings of the companies ’ securities .
Paulson had briefed both Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama and Republican contender Sen. John McCain earlier in the weekend .
Both candidates indicated they would support the plan , but wanted to ensure taxpayers were safeguarded and shareholders and management took a hit .
The United States government spends upward of $ 86 billion a year on grants , loans , work aid , and tax benefits for college students .
But the patchwork system is a barrier to many who are academically qualified for college , say a group of policy experts and higher - education professionals who laid out their recommendations in a report Sept. 18 .
The " piecemeal , rickety financial aid system " needs an overhaul , according to by the Rethinking Student Aid study group .
The College Board , a nonprofit association in New York , convened the group two years ago .
" There 's a growing recognition that the federal student aid system is simply too complicated , " says Sandy Baum , the report 's co-author and an economics professor at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs , N.Y .
" We 're seeing proposals in Congress ; we 're seeing the Department of Education talk about simplification … .
People are really ready to do something more dramatic to the system . "
The goal is to increase access to college and persistence through graduation , particularly among students from low - and moderate - income backgrounds .
A variety of business and education groups have been sounding the alarm in recent years , concerned that if the US fails to generate more college graduates , it 's at risk of falling behind economically as other nations step up their education levels .
Among the group 's recommendations to simplify aid and make it more transparent :
• Eliminate the complex Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) .
Tax information would be supplied by the IRS to the Department of Education to determine eligibility for Pell Grants , the main form of federal grants .
Families receiving income - based public benefits would qualify for maximum grants without needing tax data .
• Increase Pell Grants based on the annual consumer price index , base the grants on family size and adjusted gross income , and notify families in advance about what amount of aid their child could expect if enrolled in college .
• Combine the myriad education tax credits and deductions into a single credit , and let students spend some of it on nontuition expenses .
" There 's no question [ that eliminating FAFSA ] would encourage college attendance among our lowest - income families , " says Tom Parker , dean of admissions at Amherst College in Massachusetts .
" Every year we are not able to award aid to some families because they simply have not filled the forms out , in spite of our doing everything we can to encourage them , and that 's a real tragedy . "
There have long been calls for simplifying FAFSA , but they 've been met with resistance , partly because of the fear that some families would hide assets and get aid they do n't deserve .
But to Mr. Parker , that risk is " overwhelmed by the good it would do the vast majority of families . "
The group also wants to ease loan burdens .
About two - thirds of students at four - year colleges take out loans , and on average they graduate nearly $ 20,000 in debt , according to the Project on Student Debt in Berkeley , Calif .
Rather than a 10 - year mortgage style repayment plan for loans , payments should gradually increase , the report notes , since most people 's income grows over time .
It would also defer payments for people making less than 150 percent of the poverty rate .
And it would cap payments in any given year at 15 percent of the graduate 's income above that amount .
This would strengthen an income - based repayment option recently enacted by Congress .
Currently most federal loan subsidies allow students to defer interest and payments until after college , but they have to qualify up front based on income level .
By eliminating those subsidies , applying for a loan would be simplified and the government would save an estimated $ 8 billion , which could be directed to the new repayment subsidies and larger need - based grants , Ms. Baum , the economics professor says .
Some of the proposals require certain trade - offs that will spark debate – including the loss in assets reporting , the loss of loan subsidies during the years people are in school , and tying Pell Grants to inflation , which would basically make them an entitlement , says Terry Hartle , a senior vice president of the American Council on Education , a higher education research and advocacy group in Washington .
" The challenges of implementing these ideas are much more substantial than the report lets on , but … this is a very good time to talk in broad terms about federal student aid , … how effectively it works , and how it can be improved . "
To give low - income families the incentive to start planning early for college , the group also calls for creating savings accounts for families that would qualify for Pell Grants .
This would be a counterpart to the tax benefits that higher - income families enjoy through popular 529 college savings plans .
Costs would depend on various factors , but if the accounts started at age 12 , for instance , and the government put in 10 percent of the Pell Grant the family would qualify for each year , the estimated cost would be about $ 3 billion a year .
To encourage schools to help low - and moderate - income students reach graduation , the group recommends incentive grants for colleges .
While 40 percent of low - income students start college , only 12 percent earn a bachelor 's degree by age 24 , compared with 73 percent of their higher - income peers , according to The Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education in Washington .
What a brave and fearless , fiscal reformer .
Palin regularly used the “ per diem ” food expenses of eating at home as well as the travel expenses for the family , including the kids .
Heck , why should they pay for anything when the state can foot the bill ?
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has billed taxpayers for 312 nights spent in her own home during her first 19 months in office , charging a “ per diem ” allowance intended to cover meals and incidental expenses while traveling on state business .
The governor also has charged the state for travel expenses to take her children on official out - of - town missions .
And her husband , Todd , has billed the state for expenses and a daily allowance for trips he makes on official business for his wife .
Palin , who earns $ 125,000 a year , claimed and received $ 16,951 as her allowance , which officials say was permitted because her official “ duty station ” is Juneau , according to an analysis of her travel documents by The Washington Post .
The governor ’s daughters and husband charged the state $ 43,490 to travel , and many of the trips were between their house in Wasilla and Juneau , the capital city 600 miles away , the documents show .
Will poll workers have enough help despite pandemic ?
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese police arrested a human rights campaigner in the country ’s southwest for “ possession of state secrets ” after he offered help to parents of children killed in the region ’s massive earthquake , his family said .
Huang Qi was detained in quake - hit Sichuan province on June 10 , and on Friday police told his mother of his formal arrest on the secrets charge , his wife Zeng Li said by phone on Saturday .
Police in the Wuhou area of Sichuan ’s provincial capital Chengdu , where Huang was arrested , said they had no knowledge of the case .
But his arrest appeared related to his support for parents whose children died in the May 12 quake , when many schools crumbled , raising accusations of shoddy building and lax safety checks , said his wife and rights groups .
“ The police did n’t say why , but we think it was because of when he went to help in the quake area with food and money and met many parents who ’d lost children , ” she said .
Huang ’s contacts with foreign journalists may also have brought official wrath , Zeng said .
China is readying to hold the Beijing Olympic Games , and Communist Party authorities have demanded sweeping steps to stifle protests and dissent ahead of the event .
Sichuan authorities have sought to silence protests and collective grieving by the parents , whose complaints initially drew widespread domestic media attention .
The quake killed about 70,000 people , with thousands still counted as missing and mostly likely dead .
The Olympic torch will pass through quake - hit areas days before the Games open on Aug 8 .
Huang has not been allowed to see his lawyer or family , said Zeng .
Human rights groups have said vague state secrets and subversion charges are often used to silence dissidents .
“ Huang has been arrested solely for peaceful expression of opinion , ” said the Chinese Human Rights Defenders group in an emailed statement .
Huang , 45 , has run his own Tianwang Human Rights Center and a Web site ( www.64tianwang.com) critical of the Communist Party 's restrictions on political rights .
He was convicted in 2003 of “ inciting subversion of state power ” and released from jail in 2005 .
I was reminded this morning that Mario Manningham , a wide receiver who played for Michigan was rumored to have scored a 6 ( out of 50 ) on the Wonderlic , an intelligence test administered in some occupations ( and now pro football ) to check the mental capability of job candidates .
Intelligence tests are strange beasts , but after watching my niece working on similar problems — for fun — during her summer vacation last week , the tests caught my eye more than when I first heard about it .
Manningham was once a promising undergrad receiver for U of M , but has in recent years proven himself to be a knucklehead , loafing through plays and most recently making headlines for marijuana use and an interview on Sirius radio described as “ … arrogant and defensive .
When asked about the balls he dropped in big spots , he responded , ‘ What about the ball I caught ? ’ ”
So while an exceptionally low score on a standardized test might suggest dyslexia , the guy ’s an egotistical bonehead even without mitigating factors .
Most people do n’t associate brains with football , but in recent years teams have begun to use a Wonderlic test while scouting , which consists of 50 questions to be completed in 12 minutes .
Many of the questions are multiple choice , but the time is certainly a factor when completing the tests .
A score of 10 is considered “ literate ” , while 20 is said to coincide with average intelligence ( an IQ of 100 , though now we ’re comparing one somewhat arbitrary numerically scored intelligence test with another ) .
In another interesting twist , the test is also administered to players the day of the NFL combine — which means they first spend the day running , jumping , benching , interviewing , and lots of other - ings , before they sit down and take an intelligence test .
It ’s a bit like a medical student running a half marathon before taking the boards .
Wonderlic himself says that basically , the scores decrease as you move further away from the ball , which is interesting but unsurprising .
It ’s sort of obvious that a quarterback needs to be on the smarter side , but I was curious to see what this actually looked like .
Using this table as a guide , I then grabbed this diagram from Wikipedia showing a typical formation in a football game .
I cleaned up the design of the diagram a bit and replaced the positions with their scores :
Offense is shown in blue , defense in red .
You can see the quarterback with a 24 , the center ( over 6 feet and around 300 lbs. ) averaging higher at 25 , and the outside linemen even a little higher .
Presumably this is because the outside linemen need to mentally quick ( as well as tough ) to read the defense and respond to it .
Those are the wide receivers ( idiot loud mouths ) with the 17s on the outside .
( For people not familiar with American Football , the offense and defense are made up of totally separate sets of players .
I once showed this piece to a group who stared at me blankly , wondering how someone 's IQ could change mid-game . )
To make the diagram a bit clearer , I scaled each position based on its score :
That ’s a little better since you can see the huddle around the ball and where the brains need to be for the system of protection around it .
With the proportion , I no longer need the numbers , so I ’ve switched back to using the initials for each position ’s title :
( Do n’t tell Tufte that I ’ve used the radius , not the proportional area , of the circle as the value for each ellipse !
A cardinal sin that I ’m using in this case to improve proportion and clarify a point . )
I ’ll also happily point out that the linemen for the Patriots all score above average for their position :
Player Position Year Score Matt Light left tackle 2001 29 Logan Mankins left guard 2005 25 Dan Koppen center 2003 28 Stephen Neal right guard 2001 31 Nick Kaczur right tackle 2005 29
A position - by - position image for a team would be interesting , but I ’ve already spent too much time thinking about this .
The Patriots are rumored to be heavy on brains , with Green Bay at the other end of the spectrum .
An ESPN writeup about the test ( and testing in general ) can be found here , along with a sample test here .
One odd press release from Wonderlic even compares scores per NFL position with private sector job titles .
For instance , a middle linebacker scores like a hospital orderly , while an offensive tackle is closer to a marketing executive .
Fullbacks and halfbacks share the lower end with dock hands and material handlers .
During the run-up to Super Bowl XXXII in 1998 , one reporter even dug up the Wonderlic scores for the Broncos and Packers , showing Denver with an average score of 20.4 compared to Green Bay ’s 19.6 .
As defending champions , the Packers were favored but wound up losing 31 - 24 .
Nobody cited test scores in the post - game coverage .
Although tentatively scheduled for November , WordPress 2.7 looks to be as big of a release since WordPress 2.5 , perhaps even bigger .
Before reading the rest of this post , please keep in mind that what you see in the following screenshots is by no means a representation of the final product .
Also keep in mind that WordPress 2.7 should not be used on a live blog as 2.7 is no where near stable .
What you see here is not necessarily what you ’ll get .
This post will highlight WordPress 2.7 at its current stage of development .
Please keep this in mind as you read through the post and make comments .
Also , click on any of the thumbnails to see the full size of the image .
Back End User Interface :
Right from the get go , you ’ll notice that just about every facet of the dashboard has been changed .
There is now a left hand side navigational column .
This column is displayed no matter which part of the administration panel you are viewing .
From what I have read on the WP - Hackers mailing list , the decision to go with a side column for navigation was to cut down on the amount of vertical scrolling .
This will also allow plugin authors more room to use the top navigation column .
After using this version of WordPress , I have noticed that I do n’t scroll up or down as much as I used to .
One thing worthy of noting is that , when a navigational item contains child elements , clicking on the parent initiates a smooth drop down animation .
While this means some elements of the administration area will require an extra mouse click , I do n’t find it to be that big of a deal .
I imagine if people raise a ruckus about this , the team may decide to initiate the drop down effect during a mouse over .
Although this feature was not available in this prototype , each content block within the dashboard contains an edit link .
I ’m not sure if these will be drag and drop- able like Widgets but at least you ’ll be able to edit their contents or configure them .
Speaking of the dashboard , you ’ll notice in the screenshot that there is a new block labeled QuickPress .
QuickPress is a quick and easy way to publish posts .
Although in this iteration , it does not give you the chance to attach a category .
So far , it seems to me as though QuickPress could serve to be a quick and easy draft manager / creator .
On the left hand side , we have a box labeled InBox .
Again , I am not sure what the plans are for this area of the dashboard .
Any details for this feature are speculative at this point .
However , I think it would be pretty cool if it served as a private messaging area .
A simple way to contact other WordPress site administrators .
Sure , we could use email or IM to accomplish this goal , but doing it from within WordPress sounds pretty good to me .
As an aside , the black headers for the various blocks in the dashboard appear more stylish to me versus the light blue colored ones in the current implementation .
Before we move on , we need to acknowledge the WordPress admin bar at the top of the administration area .
This bar looks and works similar to the way in which the WordPress.com admin bar works .
My Account acts as a profile link as it takes you directly to your account profile .
New Post takes you straight to the Write Panel and of course , you can see how many new comments you have in the moderation queue which will take you to the comment management panel when clicked on .
Last but not least , it is important to notice that some of the naming conventions have changed in terms of navigation .
For example , Templates have taken the place of Design .
There is also a brand new menu item called Utilities .
So far , this link houses the following items : InBox , Tags , Categories , Link Categories , Users , Import , and Export .
This addition seems pretty logical to me .
Instead of clicking on the Management tab where you would then gain access to manage content , there is now a parent navigational menu item called Content .
Underneath of this element you ’ll find links for Posts , Comments , Media Library , Links , and Pages .
I ’ve had discussions with a few people already about why the change from Design to Template has taken place as I do n’t understand why it has changed .
Templates seem like they would be a good fit underneath Design .
Now , we have the possibility of Themes showing up underneath Templates .
The Write Panel :
The Write Panel in WordPress 2.7 has gone through an overhaul as well .
I think you ’ll really enjoy the fact that drag and drop elements are back .
You can now drag elements to the sidebar or to the bottom of the panel .
I am thoroughly excited for this element alone .
We can now configure the write panel so it is best suited for our needs instead of using a static configuration .
There is a cool new tab on the right - hand sidebar called settings .
If you click on this tab , you ’ll be able to select which elements are displayed and which ones are hidden .
An extra bonus in terms of configuring the write panel !
Not only can you configure the layout to your liking , you can even exclude the non used items from showing up .
With todays average monitor resolutions being as big as they are , these two changes to the write panel may end the need for vertical scrolling .
This was a major complaint with the WordPress 2.5 write panel .
Here is what the Write Panel looks like with all of the settings turned off :
One last thing about the write panel that I noticed .
Instead of the add media buttons that are present within todays WordPress write panel , this version showcases a single Add Media button .
For now , this only supports the addition of images into posts but I imagine the other media functionality will be added before its release .
Another item worthy of mentioning is that the Publish tab now includes an additional option that will allow you to stick a post to the front page .
Subsequent posts will be published underneath of this sticky post until the sticky option item is unchecked .
Even More Plugin Goodness :
Browsing and installing plugins from the respository looks to become even more convenient now that you can do both from the WordPress back end .
WordPress 2.7 essentially brings all of the features of the plugin repository and makes them accessible in the back end .
The plugin installation area presents you with a myriad of different ways in which to search the respository for plugins .
For example , you can search by Term , Tag , or Author .
I tested the search function by selecting Term and then looking for WP Ajax Edit Comments which is a plugin written by our own Ronald Huereca .
The search was fast but did n’t show the plugin I searched for as the first result .
In fact , the plugin was listed on page four at the bottom .
This is a good example as to why the Plugin repository search needs to be improved .
There is no reason why a plugin should not be listed as the first result if you type in its exact name into the search field .
Each search result provides a version number , rating , description and an install link .
When I clicked on the install link , the detailed plugin information page opened in a Lightbox sort of fashion providing me with a button from which to install from .
Clicking the install link from the detailed information page will initiate the download of the plugin .
The plugin will automatically be unpacked and installed into WordPress .
This is what a successful plugin installation screen looks like in 2.7 .
If the plugin was installed successfully , the only thing you ’ll have left to do is activate and then configure it .
Although this is great for end users , plugin authors will be pleased to know that they will be able to upload plugins to the repository from the WordPress back end .
The Upload Plugin feature in the backend will allow the uploading of plugin archives to your own site while installing them directly from the zip file .
This feature was not present in the prototype version but it appears as though the uploading will utilize SwfUpload if available and will unzip .zip packages .
The whole idea of being able to install and upgrade plugins automatically from within WordPress is cool but to see it become a reality is awesome .
We can thank the team for building a quality plugin repository API for allowing much of this to happen .
I have a feeling that the theme repository and the back end of WordPress will end up going down a similar route with a future version of WordPress .
More Image Settings :
Within the Miscellaneous section of settings , there are now a few more options for customizing the display of images within posts .
You can now configure a large image size , default image size , default image alignment , and default image links .
Very nice , time saving options .
Plugin Users / Authors :
If you happen to test WordPress 2.7 either on a live site or a local install , please check to see which plugins you have installed work or break with the new version .
Then , add your results to the WordPress 2.7 Plugin Compatibility page within the Codex .
Note to contributors :
Please include the version number of the plugin you tested .
This will help both WordPress users and plugin developers determine what needs to be addressed .
Make This The Best Release Ever :
There are a number of ways in which you can help make this the best release of WordPress thus far .
First , there are the mailing lists which you can subscribe and participate in .
WP - Testers Mailing List –
You can download the pre-releases of WordPress and test them , so that the WordPress developers can fix problems before the new version is made available to the public .
If you would like to get involved in this effort , join this mailing list , where new releases are announced and discussed .
WP - Hackers Mailing List –
All contributions , ideas and suggestions are welcome at the mailing list .
Sometimes , requests are also made on the list asking for the help of volunteers to assist in the improvement and development of specific functionality .
Occasionally there are also bug days on the #wordpress - bugs IRC channel .
You can read about what happens in a bug day in WordPress Bug Hunts , and subscribe to either the wp - hackers or wp - testers mailing list to find out when they happen .
Also , bookmark this Codex page dedicated to WordPress 2.7 .
It will be updated as the day of release gets closer .
Conclusion :
Considering WordPress 2.5 was released not too long ago , seeing another User Interface design in the administration panel frustrated me a little at first .
I was just beginning to get used to the way the 2.5 admin area looks and feels .
However , I must admit that the more I use this new design , the more I enjoy using it .
There might be a few users who are upset with the left hand navigation column being displayed on every page .
I know I was , especially on the Write panel where I felt squeezed in .
However , after using the test version for a little while , I am actually starting to appreciate the vertical navigational column as I do n’t need to scroll my mouse wheel up and down as much as I used to .
The re-introduction of drag and drop elements within the Write panel is a huge sigh of relief .
Overall , I really like what I ’ve seen thus far in this very , very early build of WordPress 2.7 .
There is still a lot of time before 2.7 is released .
Things can and probably will change from now until then but as of right now , things are looking really good .
Back in January 2007 , Greg Kroah - Hartman , the Linux kernel hacker and Novell / SUSE employee , issued an open offer to device manufacturers .
" The Linux kernel community , " he wrote , " is offering all companies free Linux driver development .
No longer do you have to suffer through all of the different examples in the Linux Device Driver Kit , or pick through the thousands of example drivers in the Linux kernel source tree trying to determine which one is the closest to what you need to do . "
" All that is needed is some kind of specification that describes how your device works , or the email address of an engineer that is willing to answer questions every once in a while .
A few sample devices might be good to have so that debugging does n't have to be done by email , but if necessary , that can be done . "
" In return , you will receive a complete and working Linux driver that is added to the main Linux kernel source tree .
The driver will be written by some of the members of the Linux kernel developer community ( over 1500 strong and growing ) .
This driver will then be automatically included in all Linux distributions , including the " enterprise " ones .
It will be automatically kept up to date and working through all Linux kernel API changes .
This driver will work with all of the different CPU types supported by Linux , the largest number of CPU types supported by any operating system ever before in the history of computing . "
Following is a transcript of President Bush 's address to the nation Wednesday evening , as recorded by by CQ Transcriptions :
Good evening .
This is an extraordinary period for America 's economy .
Over the past few weeks , many Americans have felt anxiety about their finances and their future .
I understand their worry and their frustration .
We 've seen triple - digit swings in the stock market .
Major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse , and some have failed .
As uncertainty has grown , many banks have restricted lending , credit markets have frozen , and families and businesses have found it harder to borrow money .
We 're in the midst of a serious financial crisis , and the federal government is responding with decisive action .
We boosted confidence in money market mutual funds and acted to prevent major investors from intentionally driving down stocks for their own personal gain .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- A Democratic state representative in Alaska asked state troopers Wednesday to investigate possible witness tampering in a legislative investigation of Gov. Sarah Palin 's decision to fire the state 's public safety commissioner .
A state representative wants authorities to get involved in a legislative probe involving Gov. Sarah Palin .
Since Palin became Sen. John McCain 's running mate , at least three witnesses have declined to cooperate despite receiving subpoenas in the investigation , Rep. Les Gara said Wednesday in a letter to the director of the Alaska State Troopers .
The McCain campaign dismissed Gara 's letter and reiterated its position that Palin will cooperate with a state Personnel Board investigation instead of the legislative probe , which the campaign has described as being " tainted " with partisan politics .
" This is nothing more than an absurd political maneuver from a partisan Democrat working with the Obama campaign , " McCain spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said in a statement .
" As the independent Personnel Board investigation begins under the leadership of a respected former prosecutor -- who is a registered Democrat -- it appears that Obama partisans are fearful that their opportunity to drag Sarah Palin through a politicized kangaroo court may be slipping from their grasp .... "
Gara told CNN on Wednesday that he would like state troopers to determine whether anyone violated Alaska law by discouraging someone from cooperating with the legislative investigation .
" Until Gov. Palin was appointed to the McCain ticket , everybody was fine with proceeding with the investigation , " he said .
" Then , the McCain campaign sent up 30 people to the state and , all of a sudden , people are not participating in the investigation . "
In his letter , Gara asked troopers to investigate possible " criminal witness tampering , " saying that it 's possible that " certain persons " induced witnesses not to cooperate with the legislative investigation , which was authorized by a bipartisan vote before Palin joined McCain 's ticket .
Gara " is not alleging that a particular person has engaged in witness tampering " but noted that " certain staff for the McCain campaign came to Alaska in an effort to block " the legislative investigation .
He noted that two McCain staffers " have held multiple press conferences in Anchorage to block the investigation . "
Gara praised Obama in a letter , dated January 30 , that is published on the Web site of The Juneau Empire , a newspaper in Alaska 's capital .
His letter urged Democrats to vote for Obama in Alaska 's Democratic primary on February 5 .
Walt Monegan , the state 's former public safety commissioner , says he was sacked after he refused to fire the governor 's ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper who was involved in an acrimonious divorce from Palin 's sister .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing .
Her advisers have said that Monegan was fired for insubordination after he continued to press for funding for projects the governor opposed .
Monegan has vehemently denied charges of insubordination and has told CNN that he was a " team player " who never did anything without approval .
The Legislature 's inquiry is scheduled to be completed by October 10 .
State Sen. Hollis French , who is managing the probe , has been under fire since a September 2 interview with ABC News in which he said the inquiry could lead to an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket .
All About Sarah Palin • Alaska
With the nationalisation of Fannie and Freddie , comrades Bush , Paulson and Bernanke started transforming the US into the USSRA ( United Socialist State Republic of America ) .
This transformation of the US into a country where there is socialism for the rich , the well - connected and Wall Street ( ie , where profits are privatised and losses are socialised ) continues today with the nationalisation of AIG .
This latest action on AIG follows a variety of many other policy actions that imply a massive – and often flawed – government intervention in the financial markets and the economy : the bail - out of the Bear Stearns creditors ; the bail - out of Fannie and Freddie ; the use of the Fed balance sheet ( hundreds of billions of safe US Treasuries swapped for junk , toxic , illiquid private securities ) ; the use of the other GSEs ( the Federal Home Loan Bank system ) to provide hundreds of billions of dollars of " liquidity " to distressed , illiquid and insolvent mortgage lenders ; the use of the SEC to manipulate the stock market ( through restrictions on short sales ) .
Then there 's the use of the US Treasury to manipulate the mortgage market , the creation of a whole host of new bail - out facilities to prop and rescue banks and , for the first time since the Great Depression , to bail out non -bank financial institutions .
This is the biggest and most socialist government intervention in economic affairs since the formation of the Soviet Union and Communist China .
So foreign investors are now welcome to the USSRA ( the United Socialist State Republic of America ) where they can earn fat spreads relative to Treasuries on agency debt and never face any credit risks ( not even the subordinated debt - holders who made a fortune yesterday as those claims were also made whole ) .
Like scores of evangelists and hypocrites and moralists who spew and praise family values and pretend to be holier than thou and are then regularly caught cheating or found to be perverts , these Bush hypocrites who spewed for years the glory of unfettered Wild West laissez - faire jungle capitalism allowed the biggest debt bubble ever to fester without any control , and have caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
They are are now forced to perform the biggest government intervention and nationalisations in the recent history of humanity , all for the benefit of the rich and the well connected .
So Comrades Bush and Paulson and Bernanke will rightly pass to the history books as a troika of Bolsheviks who turned the USA into the USSRA .
Zealots of any religion are always pests that cause havoc with their inflexible fanaticism – but they usually do n't run the biggest economy in the world .
These laissez faire voodoo - economics zealots in charge of the USA have now caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression and the nastiest economic crisis in decades .

stops bywithto discuss his new movie “ ” directed byand based on the memoirs of .
Check out the clip from DeNiro ’s appearance here and catch the premiere of “ What Just Happened ” when it opens October 17th 2008 .
Unlike John McCain , who as Rob reported “ gave Main Street the finger , ” Barack Obama actually is concerned about how the proposed Bush bailout affects real Americans .
And , Obama actually talked to reporters and took questions about it today :
“ Yesterday , the President said that Congress should pass this proposal to ease the crisis on Wall Street without significant changes or improvements , ” the Illinois senator told reporters , arguing that everyone has a stake in solving the crisis to protect the jobs and the life savings of millions .
“ Given that fact , the President ’s stubborn inflexibility is both unacceptable and disturbingly familiar .
This is not the time for my - way - or - the - highway intransigence from anybody involved . ”
Obama is right .
This is classic Bush .
But , the response ca n’t be the same as always .
Bush is sitting at the White House expecting the Democrats to cave , like they have in the past .
Read this post from Markos and ask yourself :
What is the rush ?
And , why should George Bush be driving this debate ?
As we are witnessing , the conservative movement is in shambles now and the only thing they can do is spew racist hatred out into the world and hope it sticks to their audience in droves .
And how is the conservative right going to make sure race is all you can think of when you think of the name Obama ?
How about by making the case that blacks in general are lazy , angry , and engaged in a 3 decades old plot to train black children as militants against the US ?
It 's those scary black terrorists again .
Do n't think anyone would actually SAY that ?
Think again .
Listen to it in Rush Limbaugh 's own words .
It 's hard to cut out much of his racist diatribe so the full transcript will appear under the fold .
Limbaugh :
We know that technological advancement is going along at light speed .
And yet during this period of time , whether it be the last 57 years or be it the last 20 years , it seems that a majority of the black population has remained angry , frustrated , and behind .
They 've been left behind .
They are acting like they 've been left behind , and of course we 've heard that this is because of racism , natural systemic institutional racism in America , that we are unfair , that this country is just horrible and rotten .
... The federal government became the father .
The father did n't have to hang around in order for the kids to be okay , depending on how you define okay .
But as you study more and more of this ACORN stuff , you find that it has been part of an entire movement that has been going on for two , maybe three decades , right under our noses .
We thought that it was just liberal welfare policies and all that that kept blacks from progressing while other minorities grew and prospered , but no , it is these wackos from Bill Ayers to Jeremiah Wright to other anti-American Afrocentric black liberation theologists with ACORN , and Barack Obama is smack dab in the middle of it , they have been training young black kids to hate , hate , hate this country , and they trained their parents before that to hate , hate , hate this country .
It was a movement .
It was a Bill Ayers , anti-capitalist , anti-American educational movement .
ACORN is how it was implemented , right under our noses .
It has been a movement , it has been a religion , and Obama and Jeremiah Wright and William Ayers were all up to their big ears in it .
A C&Ler emailed and said :
They 're desperate .
And they can't say it themselves , so they hire people who can .
Rush , in this particular break , had just finished with a nice chat with the person who accused Barack Obama of " pallin ' around with terrorists . "
And he went from that conversation ... to his little theory about Black Madrassas out to rise up and kill us all .
Does it get any sicker ?
I 'm afraid it might with them .
The influence of right wing hate radio has never been more evident than what we have been witnessing now .
And it will get worse , much worse .
These talkies like Limbaugh are giving their listeners permission to engage in violent acts .
It 's out in the open , on display right before our eyes .

How to Select a Little Girl's Swimsuit
By eHow Fashion , Style & Personal Care Editor
It may seem like it would n't take much thought to select a swimsuit for a little girl .
However , there are several factors that come into play for little girls and their swimsuits .
They need to be comfortable , maintenance - free and provide adequate coverage .
Read on to learn more .
Instructions
Difficulty : Easy
Step1
Check for comfort and fit .
When selecting a swimsuit for your little girl , it 's important to try the suit on her .
Let her move in it in the dressing room .
If it 's restrictive in the dressing room , it 's not going to be comfortable on the beach .
In the same sense , if the straps are continually dropping off of her shoulders , the suit is not going to be comfortable , either .
Step2
Determine the fabric - type and read the care instructions .
If a suit is going to require hand washing or special treatment , then it 's not going to be a very practical suit for the summer .
White or light - colored suits get dirty easier when going to the beach .
Darker colored suits endure stains better .
However , darker suits tend to fade out more in the sun .
A suit devoid of lots of accessories or trim will wash better , too .
Step3
Ensure proper coverage of the suit .
If the suit is continually slipping or falling in the chest or bottom areas , it 's not going to provide adequate coverage .
Additionally , if your child is extra sensitive to the sun , a one - piece suit will be better than a two - piece suit .
Some suits come with " extras " such as a cover - up or a sarong .
These suits are always good because they provide extra coverage .
Step4
Check the lining .
Every little girl 's swimsuit should include a lining in the crotch area .
Little girls are just as susceptible to yeast infections as adults and need a good lining in the bottoms of their swimsuits , too .
Months into the credit crisis , McCain openly admitted that “ economics is not something I ’ve understood ” which is remarkable , though he suggested the economy would be a key issue in this election .
Months later , McCain went on to suggest that his answer to the Wall Street meltdown was “ less regulation and lower taxes ” as if that strategy had actually worked .
Now that Wall Street is crumbling as a result of McCain ’s poor judgment in economy policies , McCain sees which way the wind is blowing and decides to suddenly endorse more regulation .
So which McCain will show up tomorrow ?
Even I ’m confused after listening to his flailing and now pandering on the campaign trail .
McCain is parsing his words hoping that some will think he actually wants regulation , when in fact he does n’t .
He wants to change the model but he does n’t want to change the actual regulation .
To McCain and his close friend and UBS employee Phil Gramm , the government needs to stay away from business .
Let business be business , if you will .
That said , the second business goes south , Gramm is at the front of the line asking for more corporate welfare so that regular Americans can foot the bill for radical gambling by Wall Street CEOs .

WASHINGTON -- President Bush made a blunt appeal for passage of his financial rescue plan , saying " our entire economy is in danger " from market problems , and warning that the nation could experience " financial panic " and ultimately " a long and painful recession " if Congress does n't move quickly .
The president tried to defuse widespread criticism of the $ 700 billion plan as a bailout of Wall Street , telling Americans in a prime - time televised address that the program " is aimed at preserving America 's overall economy , " not individual ...

Few Americans had ever heard of a SOFA until earlier this year , when the Internet lit up with a revelation many observers of US foreign policy had long predicted .
Despite repeated claims to the contrary , US officials were pressing the Iraqi government to accept an indefinite US military presence , including — and here was the shocker — up to 58 American bases on Iraqi turf .
The term SOFA , shorthand for Status of Forces Agreement , was suddenly all over the news .
The countries have been bargaining feverishly over this and a related pact called a Strategic Framework Agreement .
The separate pacts have been conflated and confused by foreign policy experts and critics alike .
The SOFA provides the legal basis for the presence and operations of US military forces .
The framework is a more sweeping — albeit nonbinding — deal that addresses all aspects of the bilateral relationship between Iraq and the United States , including the control of bases , communication between Iraqi and US security forces , and the biggest question :
How long ?
In drafts of the framework , negotiators have referred to “ time horizons ” for troop withdrawal .
Tricky semantics , right ?
You do n’t have to be a naturalist to realize that a horizon never gets any closer to the observer .
These agreements are needed to replace the 2003 UN Security Council mandate , set to expire at year ’s end , that authorized the multinational military presence in Iraq .
Enacted without meaningful Iraqi participation , it in essence says that Iraq is sovereign , that the military occupation is a temporary partnership with Iraqi forces , that elections will be held and a democratic transition commence , and that the “ multinational ” military force will “ take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq . ”
A 2007 extension of this mandate was vigorously opposed by the fledgling Iraqi parliament , which appealed directly ( and futilely ) to the Security Council after Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki requested the extension without parliament ’s approval .
The ongoing negotiations are the Bush administration ’s last chance to revive its battered Middle East legacy .
While the UN mandate could technically be reextended , Iraq indicated previously that the 2007 extension would be the last .
To request another would make the Iraqi government appear weak , demonstrate that it is n’t in charge , and by extension — literally — concede to the world that the Bush Iraq policy has failed .
But what the administration requested was no ordinary Status of Forces Agreement .
It “ may be unique from other SOFAs concluded by the United States in that it may contain authorization by the host government … for US forces to engage in military operations , ” notes the Congressional Research Service .
That ’s a crucial distinction , according to critics of the US policy in Iraq .
In effect , US negotiators were using the SOFA process , which needs no congressional approval , in a quiet attempt to enact a mutual defense treaty without Senate ratification , as the US Constitution requires .
As Douglas Macgregor , a retired Army colonel and now military expert , told a congressional subcommittee in February , the administration should not “ pretend that a major US defense commitment , internal and external to Iraq , is a matter for resolution inside a SOFA . ”
The administration ’s struggle to hammer out the future of the US military in Iraq has proved enlightening , at least .
Perhaps for the first time ever , the American public is getting a front - row seat to how its government negotiates empire .
In short , a SOFA sets the ground rules .
Everywhere the United States military goes , it negotiates a Status of Forces Agreement and related accords that lay out rights and responsibilities of the US and its host , and specify the criminal and civil jurisdiction to which US personnel are accountable .
At the end of the Cold War , the United States had SOFAs with about 40 nations .
Today , it has more than 100 such agreements , including at least 10 that are classified , according to the Congressional Research Service .
The pacts range from somewhat vague to highly detailed .
Agreements with nations like Bangladesh and Botswana for short - term deployments have run as short as a single page , while the SOFA with Germany is a 200 - page supplemental to the NATO SOFA , dwarfing that comparatively slim 13 - page document with a dizzying catalogue of detail , down to where the mail will be delivered , and by whom .
Counting the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan , more than half a million US soldiers , sailors , Marines , national guardsmen , and other uniformed men and women are deployed around the world .
What happens when one of them does something illegal is the most commonly addressed issue , and one of the biggest points of contention in the US - host relationship .
The Pentagon views SOFAs as essential to protect US troops from being tried and convicted in foreign courts , whose idea of justice can differ substantially from the system Americans are familiar with .
In Japan , for instance , after a criminal investigation and arrest , the police often conduct lengthy interrogations that lead to guilty pleas , expressions of remorse , and lighter sentences .
There are no jury trials in Japan , and mounting a robust or aggressive defense is viewed as tantamount to admitting guilt .
Even in other Western democracies , standard legal proceedings would seem strange to even the casual Law and Order fan .
In France , the judge participates in the criminal investigation ( even going to the crime scene with the accused on occasion ) and directs the lines of questioning throughout the trial .
While the prosecutor and defense attorney are key figures in American courts , they play only a supporting role in the French system .
In any case , these bilateral agreements almost always favor the United States .
For example , the SOFA between the United States and Mongolia declares that “ criminal offenses against the laws of Mongolia committed by a member of the US armed forces shall be referred to appropriate US authorities for investigation and disposition . ”
Mongolian officials can request a waiver of US jurisdiction , but American officials need not comply :
The pact states only that they must give “ sympathetic consideration ” to such requests .
( What does the United States want with Mongolia , anyway ?
Location !
For the last seven years American troops have conducted the Pentagon ’s “ Khan Quest ” exercise alongside Mongolian and other regional forces — and conveniently close to Mongolia ’s next - door neighbors , Russia to the north and China to the south .
This year , the exercises , tentatively scheduled to begin shortly after the close of the Beijing Olympics , will include soldiers from Bangladesh , Tonga , South Korea , Brunei , Sri Lanka , Indonesia , and Cambodia . )
Even if a SOFA is n’t explicit , the legal protections are in there , often as a single sentence like “ US personnel are to be afforded status equivalent to that accorded to the administrative and technical staff of the US embassy . ”
Translation : diplomatic immunity .
The Pentagon also negotiates immunity for its personnel via the American Service - Members Protection Act.
Passed by Congress in 2002 , it bans US military assistance for any country that has n’t signed a so - called Article 98 agreement , in which the country promises not to hand over US personnel to the International Criminal Court .
The act had an immediate impact : Military aid and training assistance to 35 countries was suspended in 2003 , after they failed to comply by the deadline , and the ICC — established the previous year to prosecute crimes against humanity , such as genocide and ethnic cleansing — commenced its work weakened by US meddling .
These protections , while good for the grunts , can lead to tensions with America ’s closest allies .
In Japan — where the US has maintained a huge military presence ever since World War II — the SOFA has allowed soldiers responsible for egregious crimes against civilians to walk free .
Some 20,000 US military personnel — half of all those deployed to Japan — are stationed on Okinawa , an island at Japan ’s southern tip .
In 2003 — fed up with years of stonewalling , inaction , and a string of violent crimes against young Okinawan women — the prefecture ’s governor , Keiichi Inamine , presented visiting Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld with a petition demanding a SOFA review that would give Japan a greater say in criminal prosecution .
Bucking diplomatic niceties , Inamine invited the press to the meeting , and included statistics about the crimes carried out against his constituents : 5,157 offenses by US troops , civilian defense personnel , and their dependents over a 30 - year period , including 533 murders and rapes .
According to Chalmers Johnson , a retired CIA analyst and distinguished expert on Japan and China ( see “ America ’s Unwelcome Advances “ ) , the Okinawa governor stressed that the situation was continuing to get worse , with the number of crimes climbing every year .
It ’s not just individual soldiers who get away with lawbreaking ; the Pentagon itself has largely gotten a free pass .
Starting in the late 1990s , decades of military pollution led South Korea to renegotiate its SOFA with the United States as the countries were conducting talks to return some US - held bases to the Koreans ; the revised version includes procedures for dealing with environmental devastation .
But an analysis by the environmental group Green Korea United concluded that the new rules are too weak and muddled to be of much use .
For example , it noted , the amended SOFA establishes procedures for Korean access to the US bases .
But when a 2002 Korean investigation determined that oil leaking into a subway station was coming from the nearby Yongsan base , US military investigators denied it , and would not let their Korean counterparts on base to verify the claim .
Despite America ’s periodic disputes with these and other major base - hosting allies — including Italy and Germany — the SOFAs governing the relationships were at least posted online for perusal by the strong - hearted and sharp - eyed .
And though weak , unfair , and / or the products of coercion , provisions by which the host nation may seek to prosecute US personnel have at least been tried , tested , and applied .
This is n’t the case in many corners of the globe .
Consider America ’s SOFAs with the Middle Eastern nations of Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates , as well as Malaysia , Somalia , and Kenya .
All of these pacts remain classified .
And the Congressional Research Service ’s revelation that at least 10 classified SOFAs exist means there are at least 3 others so secret that we do n’t even know who the host nations are .
Throughout the Middle East , governments go to great lengths to keep any US military presence under wraps .
During the lead - up to the 2003 Iraq invasion , for example , thousands of US special operations forces were stationed in Jordan — whose government publicly opposes the war , enjoyed close diplomatic and economic ties with Saddam Hussein , and is just autocratic enough to imagine it could hide a substantial US presence from its citizens .
Negotiating a SOFA can be tricky for such nations , whose governments walk a fine line .
But to the world , the West , and particularly to Washington , they must appear fully on board with the war on terror .
And , depending on their strategic importance to the US , they may be rewarded greatly for such cooperation .
In 2002 , Jordan , which borders Iraq , accepted $ 100 million in American foreign military financing ; the following year , after King Abdullah II opened his realm to US Special Forces , the assistance spiked to $ 604 million — it has since leveled off at an elevated $ 200 - plus million per year .
To deal with subjects or citizens resentful of any US military presence , one solution is to simply deny it — and that ’s a lot easier in places like Jordan , where the government severely curtails press freedoms and public speech .
Keeping SOFA negotiations quiet has not been an option in Iraq .
These maneuverings , as well as the strategic framework talks , have been carefully watched and well publicized .
That ’s how the United States wanted it , at least initially .
But US negotiators have tried to cram all sorts of contentious issues into the SOFA — the most noxious to Iraqis being the demand ( since withdrawn ) that private military contractors , not just US troops , enjoy immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law .
( The memory of Blackwater personnel taking out 17 civilians in a barrage of bullets last fall may well have hardened the resolve of Iraqi negotiators on that point . )
In April , a draft of the security framework , marked “ sensitive ” and citing the still - incomplete SOFA , unleashed a storm of public criticism , not the least of which came from Iraqi legislators .
America would work with Iraq ’s political and military forces , the draft stated , “ to enable them to protect Iraq and its people and to deter foreign aggression . ”
The highest priority , it noted , is “ combating al Qaida ” along with other “ terrorist groups and outlaw groups . ”
Despite this seemingly endless task , the framework ’s authors repeatedly restated the administration ’s claim ( see “ What Permanent Iraq Presence ? “ ) that the US presence is temporary and at the “ request and invitation of the sovereign Iraqi government . ”
The document also proposed that US forces could “ conduct military operations ” and “ detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security . ”
This seemed a problematic allowance , given that the US has preemptively detained and held tens of thousands of Iraqis , some for more than a year , without charges .
( More than 19,000 were still in US custody as of May 2007 . )
In June , Iraqi politicians told Western journalists that the United States ’ wish list for long - term occupation was even more ambitious .
It included 58 US bases ( down from an earlier request for 200 ) , control of Iraqi airspace , and legal immunity for soldiers and civilian contractors .
And , despite claims to the contrary by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , the American proposals went far beyond other long - term US security pacts in that they limited neither the size of the US force nor the types of weapons it could deploy .
In response to assertions that its proposals effectively constituted a treaty for the protection of Iraq , the administration merely stressed that the strategic framework is a nonbinding understanding .
In Iraq , however , these proposals have unified the fractious Iraqi parliament in a way few other issues have , with a multiethnic , multiparty coalition emerging to block both the SOFA and the strategic framework .
The future options are limited and lousy from the perspective of a Bush administration intent on securing its legacy .
Option one : Negotiate a SOFA and strategic framework that is acceptable both to the Iraqis and the US Congress , thus guaranteeing it will fall short of a robust justification for an ongoing US occupation .
Option two : Extend the Security Council mandate and risk derision of Iraqi “ sovereignty ” and an undermining of the notion of US - Iraqi cooperation .
Option three : Cobble together a Memorandum of Understanding that will cover everybody ’s behind until the next president settles into the Oval Office .
In August , the negotiators showed their cards once again .
The Bush administration seems to be pursuing the first option , softening its stance somewhat on key Iraqi demands .
A final draft includes the creation of a US - Iraqi committee that would vet US security operations ( including the detention of Iraqis ) , and details the circumstances — including suggested dates and numbers — under which American combat forces would begin to leave .
However , Iraqi and US negotiators conceded that the agreement is temporary , conditioned on marked improvements in the security situation , and subject to approval from a still - wary Iraqi parliament .
If this round of negotiations fails , option three seems like the White House ’s path of least resistance .
Just give that MOU a grand title and go back to Crawford , leaving the pesky details , and an ongoing war , for the next guy to sort out .
Mini Kin Juices Gadgets with Wind Power
September 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Most small renewable energy chargers rely on solar power or more recently , kinetic energy .
The Mini Kin takes a different approach — wind power .
The device just requires a small breeze to start generating energy .
Unfortunately , there are n’t any more details available on the device right now , but it will be available soon on I Want One of Those for $ 55 .
It ’s the perfect alternative for when you ’re feeling lazy and do n’t want to run around with your kinetic energy charger or when the sun has been hiding from sight .
Here in windy San Francisco , at least , it seems like the most reasonable option for a portable alternative energy device .

Snails , crabs , insect larvae - the shores of rivers and lakes are populated by thousands of small animals that play an important role in the food chain of the freshwater ecosystem .
They eat the leaves , among other things , which fall into the water , and so keep the waters clean .
Up to 10,000 organisms can be found on a square meter of water bottom , of which a lot are also terrestrial insect larvae .
Scientists call the whole group macrozoobenthos - these are all invertebrates living on the bottom and still visible with naked eyes .
Researchers at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries ( IGB ) now study the impact that ship - induced waves can have on these small animals .
The larva of Calopteryx splendens , a dragonfly , crawls on a stone in shallow water .
Then operates Friederike Gabel the wave machine .
A wave , comparable to that of a sport boat , runs along the three - metre - long canal .
The larva is washed out - " detached " say the researchers - and paddle around several minutes helplessly in the water until it found again the " solid ground " under its feet .
“ If they stay suspended in the water , the larvae take the risk to be eaten " explains F. Gabel , a specialist of the effect of waves on invertebrates .
In addition , the larva spent energy to fix them back , which has negative effects on their growth and reproduction .
The researchers fear that ship - induced waves increase larval mortality and subsequently biodiversity , which would have a long - term effect on the ecological quality of rivers and lakes .
Using an experimental set up , they have defined in laboratory for which threshold of wave strength the animals will be washed out from their standing place .
They found that the more complex was the structure of the habitat , less massive was the detachment .
" The impact of waves is the lowest , when the shore is covert with tree roots , " explains F. Gabel .
Even dense reed belts would provide a sufficient protection against the power of the waves to the animals .
On the contrary , the detachment is maximal on sand and stones .
Complex habitats reduce the impact of waves since they offer better hiding place and fixing possibilities for the animals , explains F. Gabel .
The researchers have now begun to collect samples in natural habitat .
They want to determine the long - term impact of ship - induced waves on the invertebrates inhabiting the shore .
They survey different locations of the River Havel and compare shore sections differently exposed to ship - induced wave intensity .
We are not against the ship traffic , stresses F. Gabel , however there is a need to find simple measures to protect the shores .
" As a result of our investigations we could make recommendations for water management , such as the design of the shores or , that ships in certain areas should pass by far away from the shore or should lower their speed " said the scientist .
The results are now published in the journal Freshwater Biology ( 2008 , 53 , 1567 -1578 ) .
He added : " I tried to ignore it but when we had a break in the filming I said to him , ' John , the old moustache is coming off . "
He said , " Oh God , I thought that might happen . "
As noted in yesterday 's Midday Open Thread :
The ladies of Heart have contacted the McCain / Palin campaign and asked them to immediately cease and desist from using their song " Barracuda . "
Unfortunately for the Wilson sisters , " as the song is licensed for public performance under a blanket fee , " and since the McCain campaign paid those fees to use the song , there is nothing Heart can do about its use .
But there is a bright side to this story .
Roger Fisher , the band 's former guitarist and co-writer of the song said that :
...he strongly endorsed the Democratic ticket , and would donate a portion of royalties he receives from the Republicans ' airing of " Barracuda " to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama .
" With my contribution to Obama 's campaign , the Republicans are now supporting Obama , " he said .
Rock on .
Ranger Cupples was also described as a perfectionist and " a shining star of his platoon " .
" Due to his high level of intellect he was a natural choice to learn the Pashtu language .
" From the moment he arrived in Afghanistan , he set about using these skills to try and help the people and keep his comrades safe and out of harms way . "
Donald Trump's Exceptional Parenting Advice
Millionaire , billionaire or whatever he may be called at the moment , real estate tycoonknows how to raise smart kids .
Just ask him , he will tell you .
The Apprentice star spoke with momlogic.com and talked about some of his fabulous children .
Don Jr. , Eric , and Ivanka work very hard while other celebrity kids are out partying and getting into trouble .
Donald attributes this to setting an example for his children .
His other two children , Tiffany and Barron are still children and therefore not yet able to prove their worth in Trump 's eyes - but they better be taking in this advice if they know what 's good for them .
Here are a few tips on how he says that you can raise " kick ass kids . "
1 . Be an example .
Children watch - they will emulate what they see .
2 . Set high standards .
Challenge is good , and accomplishment creates healthy self - respect .
3 . Stress the importance of education , it 's the foundation for success .
These are all great tips .
Now just a thought , and this is my opinion only - Do you think Trump was around at all when these children grew up to be intelligent individuals ?
No ... they were away at boarding school .
I think Trump is definitely a threat kind of guy and made it perfectly clear as these kids grew up that unless they made something of themselves they would get nothing ...zippo...nada .

Test tube experiments may help identify the most hazardous prion proteins .
Mixing up normal and infectious prions in test tubes can generate entirely new forms of infectious prion .

Infectious prion proteins from hamsters can change normal proteins from mice into new , infectious forms of prion - simply by mixing the proteins together in a test tube .
Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston suggest their discovery could be turned into a useful test for whether a given prion strain is transmissible from one species to another .
Prion proteins are responsible for Creutzfeld - Jakob disease and " mad cow " disease .
But they also found that when a prion jumps species , it produces a new kind of prion .
" This is very worrisome , " says Claudio Soto , who led the research , published in Cell1 .
" The universe of possible prions could be much larger than we thought . "
Normal prion protein , or PrP , is found throughout the body but is concentrated in the brain .
Its exact role is not known , although it has been linked to cell signalling2 , metal - ion transport3 , and blood - cell manufacture4 .
The protein can adopt malformed shapes that cause disease .
Those proteins , which are resistant to degradation , bind and convert normal protein to their troublesome conformation .
Over time , the diseased protein builds up and forms fibrils in the brain , causing neurodegeneration and ultimately death .
Generally , prions are limited to a specific host and a few related species .
But prions sometimes cross the species barrier to infect new hosts .
Notably , prions from cows have hopped to humans , causing disease in 208 people , mostly in the UK .
Now , scientists wonder if the prion - induced chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) , which afflicts elk and deer in the US , could jump to humans .
Since prion diseases have long dormant periods , the fact that there are no human cases of CWD does n't necessarily indicate that people wo n't develop symptoms in the future .
Jump the barrier
" At this point , we cannot predict the species barrier just by looking at the sequence " of the prion protein , Soto says .
But his laboratory has developed a test - tube method , analogous to the polymerase chain reaction for DNA , to amplify prions5 .
Their protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( PMCA ) protocol starts with a minute amount of prion protein and an excess of normal PrP from healthy brain extract .
Over repeated cycles of incubation ( allowing the proteins to interact ) and sonication ( to break those interactions and allow the malformed prions to access other normal protein ) , the process makes more and more infectious protein .
In the current study , Soto and his colleagues show that the technique allows hamster prions to convert mouse proteins , and vice versa .
Although prion infections can pass between hamsters and mice in vivo , the process takes years and only some animals develop disease .
" Here , we crossed the barrier between hamsters and mice in a couple of weeks in vitro , " Soto says .
" In our technology , it 's actually more efficient than real life . "
" It is exciting and interesting that a well - characterized , naturally occurring species barrier to prion infection can be breached without mutation of the PrP sequence , " says biochemist Surachai Supattapone , who researches prions at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover , New Hampshire , and was not involved in the study .
" It is also interesting that the newly produced prions display novel strain properties , because this observation is consistent with the idea that naturally occurring prion strains might arise as a result of cross-species transmission . "
Whereas PrP has one healthy conformation , there are multiple possible shapes that cause health problems .
In the study , the new prions caused disease within different time frames , affected different areas of the brain , and showed different resistance to protein - digesting enzymes compared with the original strains .
This suggests that new kinds of prion , with potentially differing characteristics , can be born every time a misfolded prion protein lands in a new species .
Soto and his group are now turning their attention to other species - to - species transitions .
They are particularly interested in which prions can infect humans , an experiment that can only be done in a test tube .
" Can we convert human normal prion protein with , for example , deer protein ? "
Soto asks .
That would indicate CWD has potential to infect people .
Soto expects to release data on the deer - to - human transmission possibilities " soon " .
Old gods will stir and be appeased .
They awake and shake off dust of ages , ready to tear the earth asunder and inspire their faithful .
Leveling the land to ease the rise of civilization , calling down fire from the heavens or using other miracles to spur forward Progress , their will be done .
It was the year of our lord 1993 when I first bore witness to Peter Molyneux 's firstborn god game , Populous .
I was only 10 years old when I ascended the stairs to the upstairs den of my friend Jon 's house .
There was the common altar you 'd find at all my friends ' houses : a Super Nintendo and a television .
The lights were off and Jon had muted the game music in favor of the Smashing Pumpkins .
He was furiously working to manage the tiny figures walking about and occasionally warring against each other .
I asked what they were accomplishing , and he explained he was trying to increase the population of his faithful .
As I looked on , the truth sank in .
He was playing god .
A rather malevolent one , too , considering he was supposed to be a " good " deity destroying the other , " evil " god 's followers .
I should n't have been surprised .
He was competitive , a fantastic chess player ( I only beat him once ) , obsessed with politics , and loved strategy games .
He was the perfect candidate for virtual omnipotence .
I tried my hand at godhood and was swiftly annihilated , but the seed had been sown .
Long before that afternoon , I remember reading a Sunday Calvin and Hobbes comic that opens with Calvin imagining himself a god .
He wills the fabric of existence into shape .
He forges a universe from nothing and creates life from the void .
He calls himself one of the " old gods " and demands ritual sacrifices while hurling fire and brimstone .
This Miltonic scene shifts to his parents encouraged by him playing with Tinkertoys .
His father says , " He 's creating whole worlds over there ! "
The message is clear :
With the right tools , we can all play god .
A good god game should inspire in us the desire to shape worlds - and to break them .
Populous was a fine start .
You used your powers as a supreme being to level the land for your followers , boosting their faith in you as you went .
You guided and shaped their world while interfering or inspiring with various miracles .
Simultaneously the other god was doing the same ( and faster ) .
While expanding your people 's hold on the world you attempted to gain ground against the other god and incite a digital crusade .
In those days though , Jon and I attended a Christian school that took a hands - off approach to games and other media .
School officials left it up to the parents to decide what was appropriate for their kids .
Being younger , I had missed out on most of the birth pangs of the god game genre with Utopia , though by junior high school my friends and I were familiar with the SimCity series and console games like ActRaiser .
My parents allowed me to play most simulation games under the auspices of them being educational ; they even righteously applauded these time sinks .
Populous was OK to play because it was considered to have the religious content of an average game of checkers .
Somehow the tiny stable of god games had mercifully slipped below the radar of videogame controversy .
Government probe launched after details of one million bank customers found on computer sold on eBay
The eBay computer scandal which saw the loss of personal data on a million bank customers is to be investigated by the Information Commissioner .
The firms involved - the Royal Bank of Scotland , NatWest and American
Express - have also promised to launch probes .
The Mail revealed today that the data was found on a second - hand computer sold for £ 35 in an eBay auction .
' A thief 's treasure chest ' : Andrew Chapman with the hard disk drive he bought on eBay containing the private bank details of more than a million people
It had belonged to Graphic Data , which stores financial information for organisations at its archive in Shoeburyness , Essex .
A spokesman for Mail Source , which owns Graphic Data , put the situation down to an ' honest mistake ' .
She added : ' We know which employee took the server and sold it , but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared .
' We want to stress that this is an isolated incident and we are investigating how the server was removed and sold .
' This is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again . '
The Mail Source employee sold the computer to Andrew Chapman , a 56 - year - old IT manager from Oxford .
It held account numbers , phone numbers , signatures and other personal details , none of which are thought to have been handed to any third parties .
RBS , NatWest and American Express are expected to contact customers once they have analysed the data at risk .
The Information Commissioner 's Office is investigating an apparent breach of the Data Protection Act .
A spokesman said : ' A data breach is very serious .
Our investigation will look at the circumstances of how this happened , and we will be seeking an urgent explanation from Graphic Data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring . '
American Express said it was working ' as a matter of priority ' to establish which of its card holders could have been affected .
A spokesman said : ' We have strict guidelines for suppliers around the security of information .
We are currently working as a matter of priority to establish exactly what data is impacted and identify the card members who may be affected . '
An RBS spokesman said : ' We take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with Graphic Data as a matter of urgency . '
The computer and a second server sold with it to Mr Chapman were tonight returned to Graphic Data .
Identity fraud is one of the fastest growing areas of crime in Britain and Home Office figures show it costs the economy £ 1.3 billion a year .
But Marc Kirby , an IT lecturer at Cranfield University , said today that some firms did not realise how hard it was to delete computer files .
' You ca n't escape leaving a data trail in the 21st century , and it will only get worse , ' he warned .
' People think they have deleted emails or documents but it is usually very easy to retrieve them .
' In most circumstances you can buy software on the internet for £ 25 that will retrieve almost anything , unless the computer has been totally wiped or the hard drive is destroyed . '
Case study
As someone with a limit of more than £ 20,000 on his credit card , Christopher Tomlins was shocked to learn that NatWest has lost the information that could give anyone access to his account .
When told about the breach by the Daily Mail , Mr Tomlins , 32 , said : ' It is like they have given my house keys to a stranger and then said , " Help yourself " . '
Mr Tomlins 's personal information is revealed in a photograph of an application for a NatWest ' black ' credit card he made on April 14 , 2005 .
The completed application form contains his name , address , date of birth , mobile phone number and home phone number .
It also reveals his mother 's maiden name , signature , annual income , bank account number , bank sort code and the 16 - digit number of the credit card he was granted .
Mr Tomlins , who runs his own lighting company in Ealing , West London , said : ' I am amazed that NatWest have let this information get out .
If the company looking after the information was getting rid of the computer , they should have destroyed the hard drive . '
Mr Tomlins 's details were contained on one of 227 photographs of separate credit card application forms found on just one of 32 computer files containing NatWest card information .

Controlling Light With Sound : New Liquid Camera Lens as Simple as Water and Vibration
New miniature image - capturing technology powered by water , sound , and surface tension could lead to smarter and lighter cameras in everything from cell phones and automobiles to autonomous robots and miniature spy planes .
Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute have designed and tested an adaptive liquid lens that captures 250 pictures per second and requires considerably less energy to operate than competing technologies .
The lens is made up of a pair of water droplets , which vibrate back and forth upon exposure to a high - frequency sound , and in turn change the focus of the lens .
By using imaging software to automatically capture in - focus frames and discard any out of focus frames , the researchers can create streaming images from lightweight , low - cost , high - fidelity miniature cameras .
“ The lens is easy to manipulate , with very little energy , and it ’s almost always in focus — no matter how close or far away it is from an object , ” said project leader Amir H. Hirsa , professor and associate department head for graduate studies in the Department of Mechanical , Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering at Rensselaer .
“ There is no need for high voltages or other exotic activation mechanisms , which means this new lens may be used and integrated into any number of different applications and devices . ”
Results of the study were detailed in the paper “ Fast focusing using a pinned - contact oscillating liquid lens , ” which was released online this week and will be the cover story of the October issue of the journal Nature Photonics .
The issue also features an interview with Hirsa .
Most current methods for manipulating liquid lenses involve changing the size and shape of the area where the liquid contacts a surface , in order to bring an image into focus .
This takes both time and valuable energy .
Hirsa said a key feature of his new technique is that the water stays in constant , unchanging contact with the surface , thus requiring less energy to manipulate .
To do this , his new method couples two droplets of water through a cylindrical hole .
When exposed to certain frequencies of sound , the device exploits inertia and water ’s natural surface tension and becomes an oscillator , or something akin to a small pendulum : the water droplets resonate back and forth with great speed and a spring - like force .
Researchers can control the rate of these oscillations by exposing the droplets to different sound frequencies .
By passing light through these droplets , the device is transformed into a miniature camera lens .
As the water droplets move back and forth through the cylinder , the lens moves in and out of focus , depending on how close it is to the object .
The images are captured electronically , and software can be used to automatically edit out any unfocused frames , leaving the user with a stream of clear , focused video .
“ The great benefit of this new device is that you can create a new optical system from a liquid lens and a small speaker , ” Hirsa said .
“ No one has done this before . ”
The size of the droplets is the key to how fast they oscillate .
Hirsa said that with small enough apertures and properly selected liquid volumes , he should be able to create a lens that oscillates as fast as 100,000 times per second — and still be able to effectively capture those images .
Hirsa says he anticipates interest in his new device from cell phone manufacturers , who are constantly seeking new ways to improve the performance of their devices and outpace their competitors in terms of lighter weight , more energy efficient phones .
He also envisions small , lightweight , liquid lens cameras being integrated into a new generation of unmanned and micro air vehicles used for defense and homeland security applications .
Hirsa co-authored the paper with Carlos A. Lopez , who earned his doctorate at Rensselaer and now works for Intel Corp . ’s research and development lab in Mexico .
Hirsa and Lopez have filed a provisionary patent on this new technology .
Funding for the project was awarded by the U.S. National Science Foundation .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China , embroiled in a tainted milk scandal that has made thousand of infants sick , said it took product safety very seriously , especially where children were concerned , after a new report about faulty Chinese - made cribs .
New York - based Delta Enterprises recalled on Monday almost 1.6 million cribs made in China , Indonesia and Taiwan after it said two babies died .
It did not give details .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said he had no information on the cribs but urged consumers and producers to report faulty products .
“ I can say the Chinese government takes product safety very seriously , especially when it comes to children ’s products , ” he told a news conference , adding that China would act on any complaints .
The China National Furniture Association told Reuters it was not aware of the recall , but said Chinese companies may not be the ones to blame .
“ It ’s not clear which side should take responsibility , ” said association deputy director - general Zhu Changling .
“ It ’s possible that the safety risks lay in the designs or standards made by clients , while Chinese companies were just following up . ”
The crib recall is one of the largest in U.S. history and follows another recall of 2,000 cribs , also made in China , which was issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday .
It comes about a year after a massive recall of Chinese toys tainted with lead and sold by Mattel Inc .
More recently , milk contaminated with melamine killed at least four children and prompted Chinese - made products to be pulled from shelves around the world .
Tens of thousands of children fell ill with kidney stones .
In what may be the most Orwellian comment in history , President Bush just stated : " Bank buyout needed to preserve free market " .
The US Government is to spend up to $ 250 billion buying direct stakes in banks and other financial institutions under a controversial emergency plan which President Bush insisted today was " not intended to take over the free market but to preserve it " .
It 's A Brave New World
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson Jr. told nine leading bankers they would have to accept government investment for the good of the U.S. financial system .
It 's a brave new world .
I 'm also waiting for word as to when the implanting of chips in newborns is done ' for the good of the country ' .

One Does Not Take Over Free Markets To Save Them

The results of the latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll was just released , and these poll results confirm what three other national polls this week have shown , this race is a dead heat .
So far this week , we have seen the ABC , CNN , CBS , and now the NBC poll all show this race as a tie .
Interestingly , the most the selection of Sarah Palin as McCain ’s running mate , and the Republican convention was able to do is tie this race up against Obama .
Palin has helped with the base , but when the question was asked , how will Palin affect your vote for McCain , 34 % said she would make them more likely to vote for McCain , 24 % said that she would make them less likely to vote for McCain , and 40 % said that it makes no difference .
I think the media is greatly overstating the Palin impact outside of the Republican Party .

What Palin has done is shore up the Republican base .
Enthusiasm for McCain ’s candidacy has jumped 20 % in the past month from 12 % to 34 % .
The problem is that Obama also gained enthusiasm among Democrats .
He has gone from 46 % of his supporters calling themselves very enthusiastic about his candidacy to 55 % .
Democrats are still much more excited about this election than Republicans are .
The other pieces of good news for Obama is that he is now even with McCain as 90 % of each party now support their respective candidates .
Last month 52 % of Clinton supporters said that they supported Obama , but the Palin pick seems to have driven more of them to Obama because 60 % of self - identified Clinton supporters are with Obama now .
Twenty percent of Clinton supporters said that Palin would make them more likely to vote for McCain , but 31 % said that she makes them less likely to support McCain .
Seventy four percent of those surveyed believe that McCain would closely follow Bush ’s policies and only 35 % believe that McCain is the candidate to bring about change .
There is actually good news all though this poll for Obama .
His approval / disapproval rating has swung up three points since last month and Obama cut three points off of the idea that Obama is a risky choice for president .
Obama gained three points with men , but McCain 10 points among women , especially white women .
This is a revealing poll in the respect that it tells us a lot about the shifting dynamics in this campaign .
It will be interesting to see what happens after the novelty of Palin wears off .
The critical polls will come after the first presidential debate .
It looks like Palin alone wo n’t be enough to carry McCain to victory .
This race will still come down to the presidential candidates , and those three debates will likely determine who the next president of the United States is .
Full poll results here
On my first post that surreal morning when I awoke to the news of Sarah Palin ’s unlikely choice as VP candidate , before I had even made a cup of coffee , or rubbed the sleep out of my eyes , I said , “ Did n’t McCain hire a fact checker ? ”
Was she vetted ….at all ?
It ’s been over 48 hours , and now …. seriously …was she vetted at all ?
The possibility that the answer is no , is almost inconceivable .
But we Alaskans have found out that background checks are sometimes optional when hiring important government officials .
Just look at Palin ’s unlikely and inappropriate choice of Chuck Koppto replace Dept. of Public Safety Chief , Walt Monegan , the center of the “ Troopergate ” controversy .
As soon as Kopp appeared before the public …. literally on day one , something smelled fishy .
The revelation of a previous sexual harassment charge and subsequent reprimand and reassignment reared its ugly head .
And Alaskans were left asking ourselves , “ Did n’t Palin vet this guy ? ”
If she did , obviously not well enough .
Kopp ’s explanation , after his now iconic denial , “ I am not a sex harasser ! ” was that no one had asked him , so he did n’t volunteer the information … figuring that everyone already knew .
So , is it possible that since no one askedSarah Palin if she was in the middle of an ongoing ethics investigation , she just did n’t feel obligated to volunteer that information ?
I mean , no one ASKed her if she was , or what the investigation might find , or if there were any other skeletons in her closet that might come out and start dancing in front of the national media .
I mean all you ’d have to do is read the Anchorage Daily News and there it all is .
They obviously knew and it did n’t bother THEM … so …. why mention it ?
And sitting in the private jet , flying out to accept the nomination , did she think “ Oooo .
It ’ll sound really good if I said I stopped that Bridge to Nowhere !
I ’ll say THAT .
No one will check , I bet . ”
Because , now , a scant two days after the nomination , the “ gates ” are already starting to swing open : Troopergate , Bridgegate , and now Babygate .
Babygate ?
I ’ve stayed away from this one because , frankly , I do n’t know anything for sure , and I do n’t want to speculate about the smarmiest of ‘ gates ’ yet .
I ’ll leave that to the professionals at the National Enquirer .
The rumors , though , say one of two things : either Sarah ’s new baby is actually NOT her baby at all , but her 17 - year old daughter Bristol ’s baby , or the new baby is hers , but Bristol , a senior in high school is now pregnant .
Ugh , either way .
If the first case is true , then the grandma governor has been perpetrating a blatant lie on her constituents , and now the world .
If the second is true , then what 44 - year old woman in her right mind would have travelled so late in her pregnancy and after her water broke and labor had begun , delivered a speech in Texas , boarded an Alaska Airlines flight with a stop - over in Seattle and bypassed the two main Anchorage Hospitals that are minutes from the airport to deliver in the local hospital near her home , almost an hour away by car .
In either case , bad judgement .
But now the cleanup crew has started .
Palin ’s praise of the Obama energy plan that was on her website ?
Scrubbed .
Photos on the website during the time period she was supposedly to have been pregnant ?
Allegedly scrubbed too .
John McCain ’s organized vetting team ?
Supposedly on their way to Alaska right now .
( Note to McCain staffers : Vet FIRST … it works out better that way . )
The National Enquirer ?
Supposedly all over this already .
Photos of the pregnant ( or not ) Palin are circulating everywhere .
One thing is certain , the rumor mill has started , and there ’s no getting this toothpaste back in the tube .
And if it ’s true that Palin did not undergo a vetting process , then what are we all to think of a presidential candidate , the oldest ever , with a history of cancer , choosing a running mate he had spoken to only once before offering her the nomination , and not even vetting this candidate ?
If this is true , then the choice was not ‘ bold ’ or ‘ exciting ’ or ‘ a maverick choosing a maverick ’ .
It demonstrates not just poor judgement , but recklessness .
Keep watching because the Palin onion is going to be peeled in the national media in the coming weeks , layer by agonizing layer .
Welcome to Veepgate .
UPDATE : Press releases of Palin ’s response to Obama ’s energy plan still available HERE ( Hat tip to Clever Else )
Republican Convention News
With the danger from hurricane Gustav past , the Republican National Convention is back on track .
Yesterday President Bush addressed the delegates by video from the White House .
He praised John McCain as a courageous and forceful leader who always puts country ahead of party .
Bush turned his frequent disagreements with McCain into a plus , saying : " He 's not afraid to tell you when he disagrees .
Believe me , I know . "
For example , McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts twice , calling them irresponsible .
Immediately after Bush spoke , a video about Ronald Reagan was shown , praising him as another great and fearless leader .
The attack dog role fell to former Tennessee senator and short - lived candidate Fred Thompson .
He began by talking about McCain 's long imprisonment in North Vietnam as a POW and his status as a great American hero .
Then he lit into Barack Obama , calling him the most liberal , most inexperienced nominee ever to run for President .
Thompson was chosen to speak not because he he is a rising star in the Republican Party ( he ran one of the worst campaigns in memory ) , but because he , like Lieberman , is a close personal friend of McCain 's dating from the time they served together in the Senate .
McCain puts up with campaign professionals like Steve Schmidt , who is de facto running his campaign , but the people he really trusts are his close personal and political friends ( like Joe Lieberman and Thompson ) , who in private no doubt give him the unvarnished truth , something hired hands are probably hesitant to do , given his volcanic temper .
Independent Democrat and 2000 Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman also spoke .
Lieberman said that McCain was willing to buck his party and work with the Democrats when he thought that was in the best interests of the country .
He said McCain 's long history of bipartisanship would make him an effective President because he could work with the Democrats and get things done .
He said McCain is a maverick and will do what is best for the country and let the chips fall where they may .
McCain and Lieberman have been close personal friends for many years .
Politics makes for strange bedfellows it is said , sometimes literally .
The strangest political couple is probably James Carville , a top Democratic strategist , and Mary Matalin , a top Republican strategist , who are married to each other .
Both are immensely passionate about politics and defeating the other party .
It is said that at home they do n't talk politics because they so violently disagree with each other about it .
Lieberman and McCain agree on the war in Iraq but do n't really agree on much else , but they clearly like and respect each other .
All in all , the convention is back on track , but Tuesday was just to get everyone warmed up .
The real action starts tonight with a speech from Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin .
More below , but first a bit of background material .
Is Palin the Best Qualified Potential Veep ?
For the first half of this year , whenever John McCain was asked what qualities he would look for in a potential Vice President he always said he wanted the most qualified person in the country to be available for the presidency should the need arise .
This is without a doubt a very strong answer and he was often praised for putting the country ahead of political expediency .
Now that his choice is known , some people ( although not McCain personally ) have added it is executive experience that counts , something that neither Barack Obama nor Joe Biden has any of .
Taking executive experience as the benchmark , who might he have chosen ?
The obvious pool is sitting Republican governors , of whom there are 22 , one of whom ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) is ineligible because he is foreign born .
An interesting question is then how does Sarah Palin rank in executive experience compared to the 21 eligible Republican governors .
The answer is given in the table below : she ranks 17th .
If executive experience were indeed the criterion McCain really valued most , then Gov. John Hoeven ( R - ND ) or Gov. Rick Perry ( R - TX ) would have been the top choices , with 2819 and 2813 days of experience as governor , respectively .
If he insisted that the job be given to a woman , then Gov. Linda Lingle ( R - HI ) comes in next .

Now suppose the experience does not have to be executive ( something McCain himself has none of ) .
This opens the pool to the 49 sitting Republican senators at the very least .
If we remove McCain , Cuba - born Mel Martinez , and the other Arizona senator Jon Kyl ( although he would be allowed if the Arizona electors voted for McCain / Biden ) there are 46 left .
With 639 days of experience as of today , Palin ranks behind 43 eligible Republican senators
If we consider the pool of eligible Republican governors and Republican senators there are 59 who have more experience than she does .
And of course , if the pool is expanded to include former Republican governors and senators and current and former Republican members of the House , the pool becomes several hundred and it is still likely that Palin would rank near the very bottom of the list in terms of experience .
The data seems to point to the conclusion that McCain really does n't believe experience is so important a qualification since he skipped over a large number of more experienced Republicans in making his choice .
Palin Will Speak Tonight Sarah Palin will address the convention and the nation tonight .
With the above information as background , it is pretty clear she cannot tout her long experience as her primary qualification to be a heartbeat away from the presidency , something Joe Biden can certainly do .
But working for her is the fact that she is still largely a blank page .
People do n't know much about her and are eager to learn more .
Tonight is her big chance .
Will she emphasize her strong opposition to abortion -- even in the case of rape and incest -- something the delegates will love but many independent women will not like at all ?
Will she emphasize her support for drilling for oil in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge -- something John McCain opposes ?
Since she has all of five days ' experience on the national stage , there is a good chance that McCain 's speechwriter , Mark Salter , will write her speech and she will just read it from the TelePrompter .
Monday Rasmussen ran a poll asking about Palin .
The first question asked if she was the right choice .
The results were evenly split : 39 % yes , 39 % no , with the rest undecided .
Then he asked if she was ready to be President .
Here 29 % said yes and 48 % said no .
Surprisingly women were less impressed with her than men as 32 % of the men thought she was ready to be President and only 26 % of the women did .
Partisan identification played a big role here , with 60 % of the Republicans saying she is ready to be President and 74 % of the Democrats saying she is not ready .
Today 's Polls
We have no state polls today but there are several noteworthy national polls .
Here are the results .
Pollster Obama McCain Leader ARG 49 % 43 % Obama +6 % CBS 48 % 40 % Obama +8 % Gallup 50 % 43 % Obama +7 % Gallup tracking 50 % 42 % Obama +8 % Hotline 48 % 39 % Obama +9 % Rasmussen tracking 48 % 43 % Obama +5 %
It is clear that Obama got a substantial bounce from his convention , as expected .
It is also expected that McCain will get one from his convention .
Usually , the two bounces tend to cancel out .
We 'll know that next week .
We have one House poll today , in the open seat in AL - 02 being vacated by Republican Terry Everett .
The district is R+13 and sure enough , the Republican candidate is way ahead .

Confessions Of A Guilty Editor
I have a confession to make .
Although I work in a lab filled with the latest hardware , my workstation still consists of a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor .
Sure , it features Hyper - Threading , but the chip is six years old .
Why am I still using it ?
Because it runs on a platform that has given me nary a problem .
It ’s stable , fast enough in Vista to drive four monitors with 15 different windows open at any given time , and remarkably quiet in its little Shuttle box .
But everyone has their limits , and after six years , it ’s definitely time to move on .
As I considered the pieces for my next PC , I first contemplated an affordable quad - core box based on Intel ’s Q9300 or AMD ’s Phenom X4 9850 BE .
No — I ’d rather see how low I could go on the system ’s thermal footprint while still achieving reasonable performance .
And then it hit me .
Do I really need a quad - core processor ?
Is the software I run really benefiting from the extra complexity ?
Could I not get more horsepower from dual - core chip ?
After all , it ’d still be a tremendous upgrade from that 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 .
In the interest of full disclosure , my workstation does n’t touch gaming — nor could it , sporting Nvidia ’s Quadro NVS 440 .
For entertainment I turn to a dual - processor Xeon - based machine that ca n’t be run after 10:00 PM for fear of a noise complaint from the neighbors .
Nevertheless , I have to imagine that there are plenty of enthusiasts out there with a solid little desktop sputtering along doing menial productivity - type tasks .
So let ’s take a look at what it means to upgrade to an affordable configuration with modern components as I build my next six - year system .
The Contenders
There are actually several strong platforms available right now that ’d be perfect foundations for a basic workstation upgrade .
From AMD , the 780G and 790GX both help save money through capable integrated graphics cores .
Nvidia ’s GeForce 8200 does the same thing .
Intel ’s P45 chipset looks to be a strong contender if you do n’t mind spending some money on an add - in video card .
However , we ’re focusing on two specific chipsets here : AMD ’s 740G and Intel ’s G45 .
They are n’t meant to go head - to - head — if they were , we could tell you the performance outcome right now .
Rather , the former gives us an ultra- affordable entry point for exploring platform performance , while the latter kicks things up a notch with more current technology .
Is the 740G enough ?
Where are our bottlenecks when we make price the priority ?
Is Intel ’s G45 finally up to snuff with regard to graphics ?
Most important , do you really need a quad - core CPU or will one of today ’s dual - core chips serve up enough muscle to stand the test of time ?

Victims of blackmail never imagine that they would find themselves on the wrong end of a video camera .
And that some stranger in a far - off land would demand money to prevent exposure .
Victims have no clue about the threats , stress , and potential destruction about to rear its ugly head .
If you play online and do not protect your identity , you risk losing everything .
The rule of thumb is , if it is too good to be true , it is .
Ask yourself , why me ?
Why is this super - hot model looking lady chatting with me , and want to see my goods ?
Am I all that ?
Or , is this too good to be true ?
Both men and women fall victim to sextortion , although in different schemes .
Women start off in an online romance scam , then they are extorted .
Blackmailers snare men easily , and quickly , it is like shooting fish in a barrel .
So , before you go digital hunting , have rules , and create boundaries .
Understand that the one you connect with is an unidentified stranger .
Which means you have no clue if they are man , woman , blackmailer , or romance scammer .
Yeah , I know their profile reads ; they work in a gym , are a psych major , and loves puppies .
They even have a Facebook profile to prove it .
I bet dollars to doughnuts ; the Facebook profile does not have a family member that shares the same surname .
Creating fake accounts are a piece of cake .
Victims are blinded by the photos , and desperately want them to be real .
For some , it is the closest they will ever get to having something intimate with someone so beautiful .
The downfall is the instant gratification , I want it , and I want it now .
Wake up , man ; it is a profile photo and nothing more .
So slow your roll and play private detective .
If your child were chatting online , you would be laying down some law , and knocking some sense into their head .
Why not the same for you ?
You are an adult , have n't you figured out everything is an illusion .
Websites like Adult Friend Finder , Seeking , and Ashley Madison supposedly caters to discretion ; if you believe that I will be more than happy to sell you a bridge .
There is no discretion on the internet or websites where you are looking to hook up and have sex .
Do you think the site owners screen users and confirm identities ?
That is a big fat no !
The best place to locate a big fish victim is on a site of discretion .
There is an automatic assumption that the potential victim has something hide , be it a wife or a professional reputation .
Many blackmailers hunt doctors , lawyers , financiers , and such .
They got the big bucks .
That 's not to say the everyday guy does not get snagged .
The face value problem is when you click on a profile photo , and you say to yourself , yeah , this is the one .
Your imagination runs wild .
Instead of saying to yourself , hmm , this could be a fake profile I should be cautious , you press or slide to connect .
There is a reply , you chat a bit and leave the app .
Perhaps to Skype , Google Hangouts , WhatsApp , or SMS .
The mighty question is , are any of these connected to your identity ?
For example , does Skype have your name in the profile ?
Did you open Google Hangouts with your real email address ?
Is that email address floating around online and can identify you ?
What about WhatsApp , is your profile photo , your face ?
One could easily upload your picture to Yandex or TinEye and find your Linked In or company website profile .
Giving a mobile phone number to a stranger is the big - time killer .
If that mobile is in your name , a scammer can search a five - dollar database and get the goods .
I ’m not advocating cheating , but if you are playing online , make sure the information you share does not connect to you , your spouse , or work .
Blackmail can reach beyond the victim and destroy their family and get them fired .
I guess you can say blackmail is a family affair .
While chatting , the blackmailer is slowly seducing and extracting personal data .
What city do you live in , what type of work do you do , do you have children , what are their names , and are you married ?
Bingo , a dossier is created .
You will receive a few hot photos , reciprocation is expected .
If you do , you are bagged and tagged .
Such is the simplicity of sextortion .
How do you identify if you are chatting with a blackmailer ?
YOU DON'T !
YOU SIMPLY DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO AN UNIDENTIFIED STRANGER OR SEND NUDE PHOTOS OR GO LIVE ON VIDEO !
PETER HITCHENS : How the Left censored the blindingly obvious truth about rape
A State agency has been forced to reverse a decision to cut compensation to rape victims who were drunk
Women who get drunk are more likely to be raped than women who do not get drunk .
No , this does not excuse rape .
Men who take advantage of women by raping them , drunk or sober , should be severely punished for this wicked , treacherous action , however stupid the victim may have been .
But it does mean that a rape victim who was drunk deserves less sympathy .
Simple , is n’t it ?
You can hate rape and want it punished , while still recognising that a woman who , say , goes back to a man ’s home after several Bacardi Breezers was being a bit dim .
Yet a wave of hysterical ultra-feminist propaganda has this week forced a State agency to reverse a perfectly sensible decision to cut compensation to rape victims who were drunk .
Personally , I ’m not sure where all this ‘ compensation ’ came from .
It used to be grudgingly paid out .
Now it flows in tens of millions ( £ 200 million last year ) from the taxpayers ’ pockets into the hands of the wronged .
I suspect it is the result of the almost total failure of the criminal justice system to prevent crime , catch culprits or punish them when caught .
Instead of offering justice , the state provides a cheque .
So I suppose we must resign ourselves to the fact that a growing slice of our taxes will be handed over to victims of unsolved rapes , while rape itself increases – the inevitable result of the collapse of sexual morality .
But I can not see why women who ignore the wisdom of the ages , and make themselves more likely to be victims by drinking too much , should get the same size cheque as women who are raped despite acting responsibly .
Someone called Bridget Prentice , a one - time teacher who now has the banana republic title of Justice Minister , actually said last week that ‘ a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption ’ .
This is flatly untrue and she must know it is .
Of course she is culpable , just as she would be culpable if she crashed a car and injured someone while drunk , or stepped out into the traffic while drunk and was run over .
Getting drunk is not something that happens to you .
It is something you do .
Nor is being drunk – which makes you miss danger signals , make bad judgments , lose consciousness in unsafe places and then lose your memory , too – comparable with ‘ dressing provocatively ’ as the feminist thought police would like to pretend .
If women want to dress provocatively , then they should be free to do so , and I say thanks a lot to those who do .
Our society is based on self - restraint .
We can be provoked and still behave ourselves .
We do not need to compel women to dress like bats , as many Muslim countries do , so as to curb the unchained passions of hot - blooded menfolk .
All the above is a statement of the blindingly obvious .
Yet , in the main forums of public opinion , such views are becoming harder and harder to express because of the unreasoning storm of fury that will follow .
The collapse of the Tory party into the arms of Leftism has made this much worse , particularly on the BBC , which no longer feels any duty to give airtime to social and moral conservatives .
Devastation : Thousands of Georgians have paid a terrible price for their president 's wilful , unhinged actions
Will someone send this sabre - rattling twit a history book
I like Georgia .
I like Georgians and their superb hospitality .
I have several times travelled to that beautiful country .
But I would n’t lift a finger to save it from the Russians .
What cause would we be serving ?
Democracy ?
Ha ha .
This Olympically corrupt statelet is not a law - governed democracy .
President Mikheil Saakashvili ’s nauseatingly named Rose Revolution was a putsch achieved by an orchestrated mob , followed by an election so shamelessly one - sided that our supposed hero got 96 per cent of the vote .
The only excuse for this was that previous elections had been rigged , too , which of course they had .
American - trained he may be , but his opponents and critics fall victim to blatantly Soviet - style methods of intimidation .
He is also adept at bombastic propaganda .
Do we really want young men from the Midlands of England and the Lowlands of Scotland fighting and dying for years to come to save this dubious creature from his own unhinged , wilful conflict with the Kremlin ?
You might think not , but David Cameron is all for it .
In an amazing demonstration of unfitness for office , the Tory leader last week wrote one of the daftest articles I have ever seen .
He wants Georgia to be allowed into Nato , so committing this country to come to Georgia ’s defence if it is attacked .
He wants to do the same for Ukraine .
Will someone send this man an atlas and a history book ?
When will our political class stop trying to grow hairs on their teenage chests by starting wars and deploying forces we no longer have ?
Why should we get entangled in this ?
What business is it of ours if Russia wants friends and allies on its borders , rather than a weird Nato alliance , kept on life - support long after it triumphantly achieved its purpose .
What is Nato for now ?
Does anybody know ?
If they know , will they say ?
No doubt some half - educated twerp will now accuse me of appeasement .
There is certainly plentiful appeasement going on now – of the Provisional IRA and of the European Union .
But Britain has no interests in following American adventures in the Caucasus , let alone taking sides over the dangerous future of Ukraine .
Vladimir Putin is not Hitler – or Stalin .
As for Neville Chamberlain , the stupidest thing he ever did was to promise to defend Poland , when he knew we could n’t and would n’t do so .
When our bluff was called we were dragged by an unstable , rackety ally into a war we were n’t ready for and very nearly lost .
Who plays that part today ?
Welcome to Nowhereville , West Midlands
Officials in Birmingham are in trouble for printing a picture of the wrong Birmingham ( the one in Alabama ) on a recycling leaflet .
I ca n’t see it ’s such a big mistake .
Both city skylines are almost identical masses of cuboid blocks , and I have often wondered if Birmingham ’s city fathers were determined to turn the place into a copy of a North American burg , hideous freeways and all .
All too many British cities are going the same way , characterless nowherevilles , their old distinctive domes and spires overpowered by graceless geometric lumps .
• With A - level pass rates now resembling the results of a North Korean referendum , do I really still need to point out that these exams have been devalued ?
I sense the professional liars who claimed for years that all was well have now given up .
About time .
But who will repair the damage they did ?
• BBC reporter Colin Blane was describing , with some awe , the release of Sea Eagles into the wild somewhere in Scotland .
He began by saying the eagles were 15 yards away , then suddenly revised this to 15 metres .
Why ?
The BBC deny the existence of any instructions to its staff to go metric .
But faced with a Freedom of Information
Act request for details , they claim the Act does n’t apply to such things .
A Day ’s Work , Four Days ’ Pay
Work rules at the Long Island Rail Road allow employees to increase their daily pay by accumulating “ penalty payments . ”
The Office of the Inspector General found that on 662 occasions in 2004 , employees received at least three days of pay for one day of work .
Wow .
Even the Associated Press is turning on McCain .
That ’s how bad it is .
The latest analysis by Charles Babington is brutal .
Without actually calling McCain a “ liar , ” Babington repeatedly makes it clear that McCain a liar .
And , worse , McCain is an unrepentant liar .
There is no honor in being a liar .
McCain is not honorable anymore :
The “ Straight Talk Express ” has detoured into doublespeak .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain , a self - proclaimed tell - it - like - it - is maverick , keeps saying his running mate , Sarah Palin , killed the federally funded Bridge to Nowhere when , in fact , she pulled her support only after the project became a political embarrassment .
He accuses Democrat Barack Obama of calling Palin a pig , which did not happen .
He says Obama would raise nearly everyone ’s taxes , when independent groups say 80 percent of families would get tax cuts instead .
Even in a political culture accustomed to truth - stretching , McCain ’s skirting of facts has stood out this week .
It has infuriated and flustered Obama ’s campaign , and campaign pros are watching to see how much voters disregard news reports noting factual holes in the claims .
McCain ’s persistence in pushing dubious claims is all the more notable because many political insiders consider him one of the greatest living victims of underhanded campaigning .
Locked in a tight race with George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 , McCain was rocked in South Carolina by a whisper campaign claiming he had fathered an illegitimate black child and was mentally unstable .
Shaken by the experience , McCain denounced less - than - truthful campaigning .
Vowing to live up to his “ straight talk ” motto , he apologized for his reluctance to criticize the flying of the Confederate flag at South Carolina ’s state Capitol in a bid for votes .
When the so - called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacked the military record of Democrat and fellow Navy officer John Kerry in 2004 , McCain called the ads “ dishonest and dishonorable . ”
Now , top aides to McCain include Steve Schmidt , who has close ties to Karl Rove , Bush ’s premier political adviser in 2000 .
I just got back from the Welcome Home Sarah Palin rally .
Still figuring out how to process through the entire experience .
The first noticeable change in downtown Anchorage was the police cars on every corner .
I decided to park a distance away and walk to the convention center .
There was a small but discernable pattern of people wending their way in the same direction .
I figured they were all on the way to the rally .
They were .
I approached the Den’aina Center and saw the t- shirt vendors out on the sidewalk .
I readied my camera and headed in .
A man in a suit stepped in front of me and said , “ This is just like the airport . ”
I had no idea what he was talking about .
Then I saw the line and realized they ’d be checking my bags when I entered .
I remembered I had an Obama button on my camera strap , and I quickly took it off and stuffed it in my wallet .
I passed the check , and realized how many secret service guys were around .
They were n’t hard to spot .
Suits , glasses and wires sticking out of their ears .
It almost made me chuckle .
If they really wanted to be ‘ secret ’ that was n’t the way to do it .
I walked in to the large “ Eklutna Room ” where the rally was to be held .
More TV cameras than I have ever seen in my life were set up on risers all around the room .
The room itself , when filled to capacity , holds 5000 people .
I tried to eyeball it , and I ’d guess there were 1000 or so there .
Everyone was pushed into the center of the room where the podium was set up .
I arrived about 45 minutes before it started so I ’d get a decent spot .
Bad plan .
I ended up getting stuck between a guy on my left who kept spontaneously bellowing “ WOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ” at the top of his lungs about 18 inches away from my ear .
On my right , the current Mrs. Alaska 2008 .
How do I know ?
She was wearing her sash .
Next to her was an espresso - fueled couple who kept initiating chants of U - S - A ! U - S - A ! , and “ Gimme an S ! Gimme an A !
Gimme an R ! ” … you get the idea .
There were little girls with signs that said ‘ I [ heart ] Sarah ’ , and people wearing t- shirts with disturbing images of pit bulls in lipstick , and “ Hottest Governor in the Coolest State ” , and most of them were women .
Hockey jerseys were also popular .
Part of me wanted to ask everyone if they knew what the McCain - Palin platform actually WAS .
But , I kept quiet .
Being there by myself was odd .
I was just starting to feel really really alone , when they started the motivational music .
And you ’ll never guess .
Bruce Springsteen !
It was like a voice of sanity filling the whole room , and it made me smile .
I ’m sure he would n’t be thrilled that his music was being used in this context , and would probably be as bewildered as me at the choice of “ Born to Run ” , but at that moment I did n’t care .
It was a little gift from the universe .
I will be forever grateful to ‘ the Boss ’ for being my little piece of musical driftwood , in a big churning sea of right wing rhetoric .
Then came the pledge of allegiance .
A teenage boy in front of me said , “ What ’re you a communist ? ” and smacked his brother ’s arm so he ’d put it over his heart .
A small group behind me yelled “ UNDER GOD ” louder than the rest of the pledge .
More chants of U - S - A .
After the invocation , came Lt. Governor Sean Parnell , and Sarah Palin herself .
And of course the crowd went wild .
Her speech was Alaska focused , and she was definitely talking to the ‘ home crowd ’ .
She even made me laugh once , talking about how the secret service motorcade wanted lattes and she told them there was a coffee stand on every corner ( which there is ) , and they parked the cars and got out to place the order at the little window .
If you ’re in Alaska , you get why this is funny .
For those of you ‘ outside ’ , the little window is a drive up .
After the Alaska references , came oil talk , and chants of Drill Baby Drill ( initiated by the group on my right ) , followed by WOOOOOOOOing ( by the guy on my left ) .
She did n’t talk long , but the crowd seemed to think it was “ worth the wait ” .
After the speech , she worked her way through the crowd shaking hands .
I was pretty close , and maybe got a picture that ’s usable .
Then I was overcome with the irresistible urge to flee .
So I did .
Outside , in the crisp autumn morning , I took a big deep breath .
Across the street were two guys holding up a sheet , criticizing Palin ’s stance on the Iraq war .
One of them was talking to someone with a microphone .
I crossed the street , looked at the other guy and gave him a big ‘ thumbs up ’ .
He looked completely surprised , as he probably saw me coming from the rally , but quickly flashed a big grateful smile .
And the day has only begun …
Next stop , the “ Alaska Women Reject Palin ” rally .
Mental whiplash awaits .
As expected , Tina Fey showed up last night on “ Saturday Night Live ” as Gov. Sarah Palin .
She and Amy Poehler , who reprised her impersonation of Senator Hillary Clinton , shared a lectern in the opening sketch in what was the first show of the new season .
Senator Barack Obama , who had been scheduled as a guest , canceled because of the devastation of Hurricane Ike .
Ms. Palin , who was unknown to most of the country when she was named two weeks ago to the Republican ticket , had been instantly pegged as a Tina - Fey look - alike .
And indeed , Ms. Fey had the glasses and hair thing going already when she appeared last night , a dead ringer for the Alaska governor ; she added a pitch - perfect flat prairie accent to complete the package .
The political world has paid attention to SNL ’s take on campaigns because of its track record in crystallizing the candidates ’ foibles and capturing the zeitgeist , as it did during the primaries earlier this year when it portrayed the media as swooning for Mr. Obama .
Last night , Ms. Fey played Ms. Palin as someone not - so - naïve , with sex appeal , while Ms. Poehler played Mrs. Clinton as droll — and really annoyed that Ms. Palin had ascended so easily to the vice presidential nomination while Mrs. Clinton had strived so hard for the Democratic presidential nomination and failed to reach it .
The premise for their sharing the stage , as the Fey / Palin character described it , was “ to address the now very ugly role that sexism is playing in the campaign . ”
The Poehler / Clinton character added : “ — an issue which I am frankly surprised to hear people suddenly care about . ”
Their exchanges suggested that Ms. Palin lacked Mrs. Clinton ’s substance .
When the Clinton character mentioned diplomacy and foreign policy , the Palin character blurted out : “ And I can see Russia from my house ! ”
This got a big laugh though it was not much altered from an actual statement that the real Ms. Palin made the other night in an interview with ABC News .
When she was asked what insight she had gained from Alaska ’s proximity to Russia , she responded : “ You can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska . ”
But back to the sketch .
At another point Ms. Fey ’s Palin character marveled : “ Just look at how far we ’ve come .
Hillary Clinton , who came so close to the White House .
And me , Sarah Palin , who is even closer .
Can you believe it , Hillary ? ”
Ms. Poehler ’s Clinton character responded : “ I cannot ! ”
She then erupted about the unfairness of it all .
“ I scratched and clawed through mud and barbed wire , ” she said , “ and you just glided in on a dog sled wearing your pageant sash and your Tina Fey glasses . ”
As she spoke , the Palin character mugged for the audience and posed like a beauty queen .
Ms. Palin then said that anyone could be president , “ all you have to do is want it . ”
That brought a bit of hysterical laughter from Mrs. Clinton .
“ You know , Sarah , ” she said , “ looking back , if I could change one thing , I probably should have wanted it more . ”
Ms. Palin then asked the media to be “ vigilant for sexist behavior . ”
Mrs. Clinton quickly put in : “ – although it is never sexist to question a female politician ’s credentials . ”
She concluded : “ I invite the media to grow a pair and if you can ’t , I will lend you mine . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. stocks and the dollar turned higher on Tuesday as investors bet the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to calm worries related to insurer AIG , the latest company to be squeezed by a global credit crisis .
Wall Street fell prey to speculation about a possible rescue of American International Group after disappointing quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc failed to lift the deep gloom over financial markets .
Talk of a possible U.S. interest rate cut later in the day kept investors on edge a day after the U.S. government failed to provide a lifeline to Lehman Brothers , forcing an icon of Wall Street to file for bankruptcy protection .
Central banks flooded money markets with cash to encourage bank lending amid widespread credit concerns , while government debt prices jumped on heightened fears about global finances .
Yields on the 30 - year U.S. Treasury bonds fell below 4 percent for the first time since the early 1960s .
Bund futures rallied more than a full point to as high as 116.13 , its strongest level since mid-April .
Oil fell more than 4 percent to a seven - month low on rising concern that market turmoil will further undermine demand and send investors into safer havens .
Reports that U.S. oil infrastructure had escaped major damage from Hurricane Ike helped push crude prices down .
U.S. stocks briefly turned positive and European shares pared losses after CNBC television , citing sources familiar with the matter , said a government role in an AIG bailout was being discussed but that no resolution had been reached .
Sentiment brightened on hopes the Fed would cut interest rates to calm turbulent financial markets .
Fed policy - makers were set to make an announcement at the end of a scheduled meeting at 2:15 p.m. ( 7:15 p.m. British time ) .

“ I do n’t think an interest rate cut is really necessary , but what they say is damn important , ” said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany , New York .
“ What ’s important is some statement to the effect that the Federal Reserve stands prepared to exercise its lender - of - last - resort function to bring stability to the financial markets . ”
Shortly before 1 p.m. , the Dow Jones industrial average was up 23.53 points , or 0.22 percent , at 10,941.04 .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index was up 1.66 points , or 0.14 percent , at 1,194.36 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.76 points , or 0.08 percent , at 2,181.67 .
Shares of AIG were down 35 percent at $ 3.09 , having been down as much as 68 percent earlier , following a slide of more than 60 percent on Monday .
European shares fell to their lowest close since May 2005 as investors grew more jittery about AIG ’s fate and commodity stocks tracked sharply lower metal and oil prices .
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European companies closed 2.5 percent lower at 1,091.50 points , after a 3.6 percent tumble on Monday .
It is down about 28 percent so far this year .
“ Europe is just a residual on what is going on in the U.S .
All eyes are on AIG and whether they can drum up the money tonight to keep them from going bankrupt , ” said Philip Lawlor , chief portfolio strategist at Nomura .
In Europe , banks were the top negative weight on the index , with top British mortgage lender HBOS down almost 22 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland down around 10 percent .
Tame readings on U.S. consumer prices in September and tumbling oil prices helped assuage inflation worries and reinforced the view that Fed policy - makers will turn their focus to the market turmoil .

The benchmark 10 - year U.S. Treasury note rose 5/32 to yield 3.39 percent .
The 30 - year U.S. Treasury bond rose 12/32 to yield 4.02 percent .
The dollar rose against major currencies , with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.68 percent at 79.017 .
Against the yen , the dollar was down 0.41 percent at 104.96 .
Analysts said that despite much of the bad news originating in the United States , the dollar benefited from the widespread financial jitters as investors , particularly those from the United States , became increasingly keen to send money back home for safety .
“ I expect the dollar ’s upswing to continue .
The major driver behind this is a massive repatriation of foreign - based U.S. investments including those from foreign funds , ” said Adam Fazio , a senior currency strategist , at CIBC World Markets in New York .
The euro was down 0.81 percent at $ 1.4149 .
U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 5.1 percent to $ 90.82 a barrel .
Gold earlier fell nearly 2 percent alongside a sharp drop in oil , turned higher , then fell again .
Spot gold prices fell $ 9.20 to $ 777.00 an ounce .
Gold normally gains on safe - haven buying during financial crises , but portfolio managers have been selling assets across the board after Leman ’s bankruptcy filing .
Platinum slipped more than 9 percent to its lowest level since October 2006 as a weakening global economy hit demand from auto makers .
Platinum has lost half its value in the last six months from a record high of $ 2,290 an ounce in March .
Russia ’s stock exchange suspended trade for one hour , with the MICEX index off 16.6 percent in the sharpest one - day percentage drop since the 1998 financial crisis , Reuters data showed .
Liquidity fears drove the plunge , an exchange official said .
Asian shares plunged overnight , hit by a wave of selling in the financial sector .
Tokyo ’s Nikkei share average slumped 4.95 percent to its lowest level in three years .
Japan ’s top three lenders plunged , with No. 2 Mizuho Financial Group and No. 3 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group losing about 10 percent , their worst daily percentage drops in nearly five years .
the Japanese market had been closed on Monday for a holiday .
MSCI ’s index of Asia - Pacific stocks outside Japan fell 4.8 percent to the lowest level since August 2006 .
It is now down 44 percent from a peak last October .

The Firestarter Team says ;
Linux security does not have to be complex , and simplicity does not have to mean sacrificing power .
Irrespective of the operating system , intrusion is one of the key concerns for computers connected to a network .
Black hats and white hats have always had a tug - of - war over intrusion detection techniques .
Firewalls , as a matter of fact provide a resistance to this , if not a fool proof protection .
Firewalls may be a hardware device or a software program used to filter information coming from within or outside the outside network into your private network or your workstation .
Firewall may not be the best and the sole way to be secured on a network , but does act like the first cover against most of the network based attacks .
While hunting out for a firewall application to safe guard my Linux installation , I came across a good firewall named Firestarter for Linux .
It has an intuitive graphical interface which allows you to configure the firewall in Linux using built in IPtables / IPchains utilities .
Firestarter is a powerful and user friendly firewall beneficial for both Linux desktop users and System Administrators .
We shall check out the installation configuration of Firestarter on your Linux machine to help shield your data .
To do a terminal install , fire the run pop -up and type : $ sudo apt - get install firestarter
If things go fine , you ’ll have Firestarter installed in few keystrokes .
You may do the same using any of the alternative ways to install an application , discussed previously in one of my articles .
Setting up Firestarter
Go to System > Administrator >
Firestarter ( for Ubuntu )
It will allow you to setup your initial configuration when you run the Firestarter for the very first time .
Initial steps consist of detection of network devices and selection of one .
You also get an option of enabling dial out for modem users and that for for IP address assigned via DHCP .
Do check your routers ’ setting if you are using DHCP to assign local address .
After checking all the options according to your need , click forward , you ’ll be asked for Internet connection sharing .
Enable it if your system is on a network .
Select the device type – hub / switch .
Save your settings .
Get back to the main application window which consists of three tabs – Status , Events & Policy .
The status indicator shows whether the Firestarter is active , disabled or locked .
Event shows the list of attempted connections that it has blocked .
The entries listed in red should be focused .
You can visualize the rules for your firewall in the Policy window .
It also allows you to create your own policies including options to enable or disable inbound / outbound traffic .
These rules can be applied on hosts / ports .
There are primarily 3 inbound policy groups :
Allow connections from hosts -
It will allow the traffic from the host which can be predefined by the user as a trusted source .
Allow service -
It consist of two parameters – service and target .
User can enter a name manually or Firestarter will try to determine the service name itself .
The target maybe : Anyone , LAN clients , or a user specified IP , host / network .
Forward service -
It is only active if the Internet Connection Sharing is enabled .
Permissive mode allows the user to specify rules that limit outbound connections .
Restrictive mode permits you to specify which connections are allowed to have outbound communication .
In order to experience some advanced features , you may go to Preferences .
Firestarter does n’t really affect your work real - estate as you can minimize it to the system tray by exiting the application and it will notify you by turning its icon to red when a suspicious block alert is encountered .
ICMP filtering provides a way to send simple messages containing information or errors .
Options like Echo Request and Echo Reply tells how your firewall handles pings .
To block incoming pings , click on Echo reply .
Traceroute prevents your machine from being traced via trace route .
Tos filtering allows you to set priority on the use of network traffic .
Overall , Firestarter happens to be a great firewall for most users .
Do check it out !

It appears at least one ideologue is beginning to realize the role he played in the current financial crisis :
Christopher Cox , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a longtime proponent of deregulation , acknowledged on Friday that the voluntary supervisory program of Wall Street ’s largest investment banks had contributed to the global financial crisis and abruptly shut the program down .
wow .
“ The last six months have made it abundantly clear that voluntary regulation does not work , ” Mr. Cox said in a statement .
The program “ was fundamentally flawed from the beginning , because investment banks could opt in or out of supervision voluntarily , ” he added .
“ The fact that investment bank holding companies could withdraw from this voluntary supervision at their discretion diminished the perceived mandate ” of the program , and “ weakened its effectiveness . ”
wow again .
Unfortunately , Cox is also the guy that John McCain , champion de-regulator , wants fired .
I suppose that makes sense .
Admitting mistakes is not the Republican way .
Ask the president , who did n’t include a single word in his speech this week to indicate that perhaps his and his party ’s adherence to an ideology that has consistently failed and ruined the economy may have played a role .
They say those who forget history are doomed to repeat it and unfortunately , they are correct in this situation :
In 1999 , the lawmakers adopted the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which broke down the Depression - era restrictions between investment banks and commercial banks .
As part of a political compromise , the law gave the commission the authority to regulate the securities and brokerage operations of the investment banks , but not their holding companies .
In 1999 the Republican - controlled congress ( of which John McCain was a part ) got rid of a law that was created after the Great Depression to prevent the country from ever having problems like that again .
So what happened ?
Shit fell apart again , that ’s what happened .
And what ’s the fix ?
Facing the worst financial crisis since the Depression , Mr. Cox has begun in recent weeks to call for greater government involvement in the markets .
He has imposed restraints on short - sellers , market speculators who borrow stock and then sell it in the hope that it will decline .
Hmm .
Kind of makes you wonder why McCain wants this guy fired …
I ’d like to think the laissez - faire right wing have learned their lesson this time , but unlike the Republicans , I am a student of history and history has shown that the party of corporate apologists will be back out there in no time calling for less government oversight and complaining that it ’s the constant regulation that ’s hampering the economy .
Let ’s hope the American people ’s memory is not as short - term .
I put together some benchmarks for the three main Rails fulltext search solutions : Sphinx / Ultrasphinx , Ferret / acts_as_ferret , and Solr / acts_as_solr .
The book Advanced Rails Recipes was a big help in getting Ferret and Solr running quickly .
dataset
The dataset is the entire KJV Bible , indexed by verse and also by book .
This gives us 31,102 smallish records and 66 large ones .
Ferret and Solr both use a Ruby method for loading the per-book contents ( since they traverse a Rails association ) , while Sphinx ( with Ultrasphinx ) uses : concatenate to generate a GROUP_CONCAT MySQL query .
You can checkout or browse the benchmark app yourself from here .
Especially note the model configurations .
The app should be runnable ; the migrations include the dataset load .
performance results
These results exercise some basic queries of varying sizes .
Some things are not covered ; I may update the benches in the future for facet , filter , phrase , and operator usage .
I search 300 times each for a common short word in verses , the same word in books , the same word in all classes , then a rare pair of words in all classes , and finally a very rare long phrase in all classes .
All engines were configured for no stopwords .
$ INDEX=1 rake benchmark Sphinx user system total real reindex 0.000000 0.010000 2.310000 ( 8.323945 ) verse : god 1.090000 0.160000 1.250000 ( 31.020551 ) verse : god: no_ar 0.720000 0.080000 0.800000 ( 27.364780 ) book : god 0.980000 0.100000 1.080000 ( 26.839016 ) all : god 0.970000 0.100000 1.070000 ( 20.297412 ) all : calves 1.030000 0.110000 1.140000 ( 22.806805 ) all : moreover 0.980000 0.120000 1.100000 ( 27.763920 ) result counts : [ 3595 , 64 , 3659 , 5 , 2 ] index size : 7.6 M total memory usage in kb : {:virtual = >35356 , :total =>35688 , :real = >332}

The horrible Ferret performance for “ all: god ” happened consistently .
The log suggests that it does not use any kind of limit in multi - model search in order to ensure the relevance order is correct .
This is a big fail .
The “ real ” column times for Sphinx and Solr are the same , which suggests that the bulk of it is socket overhead .
The dataset is too small for the actual query time to have an effect .
However , it looks like Ferret is reusing the socket ( via DRb ) which is a point in its favor .
Sphinx currently does not support persistent connections .
It is important to realize this does not mean that Ferret is fastest overall .
It means that Ferret is fastest for small datasets where the constant socket overhead dwarfs the logarithmic actual lookup overhead .
Do note that the “ total ” time spent ( e.g. , time spent in Ruby , instead of waiting on IO ) is much lower for Sphinx than for Solr .
It would help the benchmark validity to run many query containers in parallel on separate machines , and to use a much larger dataset .
Other people ’s benchmarks suggest that Sphinx starts to scale really well as query volume increases .
Solr is likely to be within the same order of magnitude .
quality results
An extremely crude evaluation of search quality : which result set for the word “ God ” has the word repeated the most times in the records ?
# Sphinx Ultrasphinx :: Search.new(:class_names => ' Verse ' , : query => " God " , : per_page => 10).run.map(&:content ) .join ( " " ) .split ( " " ) . select{|s | s[/god/i]}.size => 45 # Solr Verse.find_by_solr( " God " , : limit => 10 ).docs.map(&:content ) .join ( " " ) . split ( " " ) .select{|s | s[/god/i]}.size => 30 # Ferret Verse.find_by_contents ( " God " , : limit => 10 ) .map( &: content ) .join ( " " ) . split ( " " ) .select{|s | s[/god/i]}.size => 26
Not much , but it ’s something .
thoughts on usage
It ’s interesting how similar the acts_as_ferret and acts_as_solr query interfaces are , and how different Ultrasphinx ’s is .
Multi - model search is an afterthought in Ferret and Solr , and it shows .
( No other Rails Sphinx plugin supports multi- model search . )
The configuration interfaces are pretty similar until you start to get into engine - specific stuff like Ultrasphinx ’s : association_sql , or Ferret ’s analysis modules .
Solr has its scary schema.xml but acts_as_solr hides that from you .
Ultrasphinx has some initialization annoyances which acts_as_solr does n’t suffer from .
Ferret acted weird alongside Ultrasphinx unless I specifically required some acts_as_ferret files in environment.rb .
Ferret also will index your entire table when you first reference the constant , which was a big surprise .
In general Ferret is overly coupled .
Solr is better and acts_as_solr does an especially nice job of hiding the Java from you .
I did n’t test any faceting ability .
Solr probably has the best facet implementation .
Ferret does n’t seem to support facets at all .
on coupling
Ferret is unstable under load , and due to its very tight coupling , takes down your Rails containers along with it .
Solr is pretty stable , but suffers from the opposite problem — if something goes wrong in a Rails container , and a record callback does n’t fire , that record will never get indexed .
Sphinx avoids both these problems because it integrates through the database , not through the application .
This is what databases are for .
Sphinx is incredibly stable , but even if something happens to it , the loose coupling means that the only thing that fails in your app is search .
And since it does n’t rely on container callbacks , your index is always correct .
This is the main reason I wrote Ultrasphinx .
Both Solr and Ferret are too slow to reindex on a regular basis .
They could be much , much faster if they did n’t have to roundtrip every record through Ruby , but that ’s how they ’re designed .
Takeaway lesson — be deliberate about your integration points .
Chile has been awarded the Guinness World Record for the largest swimming pool on the planet .
This gigantic lagoon is located in the resort of San Alfonso del Mar in Algarrobo city , on the southern coast of Chile .
The Guiness Book of World Records has named it the largest pool in the world .
How big is it ?
– over a kilometer long ( 3,323 feet ) , covering 20 acres and containing 250,000 cubic meters of water .

What do all these words have in common ?
Someone , somewhere , is using them with a disclaimer like " I know it 's not a real word ... "
There 's no good reason for the " not a real word " stigma .
They all look like English words : they 're written in the roman alphabet , without numbers or funny symbols .
They 're all easily pronounced -- not a qwrtlg or a gxrch in the group .
From a purely functional point of view , they act like words : relationshippy in the sentence " Just come to the conclusion that boys do n't like talking about relationshippy things " behaves in exactly the same way that an adjective like girly would .
And funner in the sentence " I do n't know a better person or a funner person to be around -- I love you , Mom , " hinders the understanding of the reader not a jot .
We all get that the writer really , really loves her mom , and changing funner to " more fun " would n't improve their relationship -- or that heartfelt tribute -- one bit .
But if all these words look wordish , sound wordish , and act wordish , why are they all hedged about with the namby - pamby " I know it 's not a real word " disclaimers ?
( Note : wordish is a perfectly good word . )
We all know that there are words that no one can complain about ( when was the last time you heard a grammar rant about apple or Tuesday or fair ? ) and words that almost everyone finds offensive ( no need to print them in a newspaper ) .
What we do n't have a firm grasp on is the acceptability of a wide range of other words , especially words we 've hung affixes on .
Redness is OK , but what about grossness ?
Heroism is fine , but what about thespianism ?
We have similar problems with words that have undergone a shift in function or part of speech ( " shopping at thrift store " becoming thrifting , anonymous becoming verbed as anonymize ) , nonstandard forms ( funner , huger , interestinger ) , and , of course , any slang words someone has n't personally heard or used ( chillaxing , wackaloon ) .
What does a word have to do to be a " real word " ?
Being in a dictionary is n't enough ( since territorialism , dancey , noirish , anonymized , bestest , and yes , wordish are all in the Oxford English Dictionary ) .
Does it have to be recognized by your spellchecker ?
Mine was happy with territorialism , delegator , and , surprisingly , huger .
Being frequent is n't enough : funner is slightly more frequent in a two - billion - word corpus of web English than interrobang , and no one says interrobang ( a combination of the exclamation point and the question mark ) is n't a " real word . "
Being standard is n't enough : anonymized is a perfectly reasonable way to say " made anonymous , " and has been for at least a quarter - century .
In a printed book ?
All of the words in the above list are in printed works .
( Some of them are even in the titles of printed works . )
Whenever I see " not a real word " used to stigmatize what is ( usually ) a perfectly cromulent word , I wonder why the writer felt the need to hang a big sign reading " I am not confident about my writing " on it .
What do they imagine the penalty is for using an " unreal " word ?
A ticket from the Dictionary Police ?
The revocation ( as the joke goes ) of your poetic license ?
A public shaming by William Safire ?
The irony is that most of these words , without the disclaimer , would pass unnoticed by the majority of readers .
( In case you noticed cromulent , that was invented in the 1990s for " The Simpsons . " )
Writers who hedge their use of unfamiliar , infrequent , or informal words with " I know that 's not a real word , " hoping to distance themselves from criticism , run the risk of creating doubt where perhaps none would have naturally arisen .
Furthermore , those same writers are giving up one of their inalienable rights as English speakers : the right to create new words as they see fit .
Part of the joy and pleasure of English is its boundless creativity : I can describe a new machine as bicyclish , I can say that I 'm vitamining myself to stave off a cold , I can complain that someone is the smilingest person I 've ever seen , and I can decide , out of the blue , that fetch is now the word I want to use to mean " cool . "
By the same token , readers and listeners can decide to adopt or ignore any of these uses or forms .
So , please , leave off the " not a real word " apologia .
A far better ( and dare I say , funner ) technique is to jump in with both feet and use whatever word strikes your fancy .
Instead of being defensive , demand that any who dare to quibble over your use prove that your word is , in fact , not a word .
In short , if it seems wordish , use it .
No apologies necessary .

BEIJING --
Tens of thousands of taxi drivers in Beijing have a tool that could become part of China 's all - out security campaign for the Olympic Games .
Their vehicles have microphones -- installed ostensibly for driver safety -- that can be used to listen to passengers remotely .
The tiny listening devices , which are connected to a global positioning system able to track a cab 's location by satellite , have been installed in almost all of the city 's 70,000 taxis over the past three years , taxi drivers and industry officials say .

Sony is adding rumble support to the PSP , in a roundabout way , courtesy of the DualShock 3 .
Using the new " PSP Plus " feature in games like Resistance : Retribution , owners of both the PSP and PlayStation 3 will be able to forego the portable platform 's analog nub for a better control experience .
By plugging in your AV - output capable PSP ( 2000 and 3000 models ) and connecting the PSP to the PS3 via USB , you 'll be able to switch on PSP Plus control through Resistance 2 .
Doing so adds DualShock 3 control support , letting you play PSP games on your television with a PS3 controller .
It disables aim assist in Resistance : Retribution and lets the player alter their control layout to take advantage of the PS3 controller 's extra inputs .
The option requires that gamers have a copy of Resistance 2 in their PS3s , but will not require a firmware update for either the PSP or PS3 .

Simpson has been found guilty of 12 charges of armed robbery , conspiracy to kidnap and assault with a deadly weapon by a court in the US city of Las Vegas .
The former US football star and actor was accused of robbing two dealers of sports memorabilia in 2007 .
The armed robbery charges carry a mandatory jail sentence , and kidnapping carries a possible life term .
Simpson , 61 , who denied the charges , was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his former wife and her friend .
That was dubbed " the trial of the century " .

The charges in the latest trial centred on an incident in the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas in September 2007 .
Simpson was accused - and convicted - of kidnapping two sports memorabilia dealers and holding them in the hotel .
The former National Football League running back seized the pair in an attempt to reclaim items in their possession related to his sporting career , which Simpson claimed still belonged to him .
Handcuffed
Asked by reporters on his way into court for the latest verdict , which was read late on Friday night local time , Simpson said he was prepared for the judgement .
" You gotta be ready , " the former Buffalo Bills star running back told journalists .

Inside the court both Simpson and his accomplice , Clarence Stewart , were found guilty on all charges by the Las Vegas jury .
Simpson blew out his cheeks and nodded as the verdicts were read out .
He was then led away with his hands cuffed by police .
He will be sentenced in December .
The judge refused to grant him bail pending sentencing .
In his previous trial , Simpson was accused of murdering his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994 .
The not - guilty verdict - exactly 13 years ago - shocked many in the US .
Mr Simpson was later found liable for the deaths in a civil case and ordered to pay $ 33.5 m ( £ 19 m ) to Mr Goldman 's family .

What are these ?
Wall Street 's reluctance to the plan came to a head during an emergency meeting Friday night when officials from the Federal Reserve asked members of Wall Street 's biggest firms , including Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan , John Mack of Morgan Stanley and John Thain of Merrill Lynch to play a role in the bailout of Lehman .
Negotiations continued Saturday with top government officials present , including Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox and New York Federal Reserve President Tim Geithner , but sources said a deal seemed unlikely before Sunday .
Sources would not say whether there had been progress , only that all sides were still talking .
But government officials had been insisting a deal get done by Sunday .
Given the complexity of any deal , it seemed likely the parties would take whatever extra time was available .
The ongoing session harkened to a deal in 1998 , when the big Wall Street firms chipped in billions of dollars in capital to save the troubled hedge fund Long Term Capital Management .
But times have changed .
In 1998 , Wall Street was flushed with cash as the dotcom boom fueled underwriting revenues .
Right now , Wall Street is in the middle of one of its most protracted profit droughts in years .
Compounding the street problems , the LTCM bailout was an isolated incident .
In addition to Lehman other Wall Street firms , such as Merrill Lynch , have soured real estate loans on their books and may have suffered a similar loss of investor confidence as Lehman has in recent days , forcing the firm 's CEO Dick Fuld to begin scouring the financial world for a white - knight buyer .
Troubled insurer American International Group has hired JP Morgan to raise additional capital and is raising funds from other sources in an effort to prevent a possible ratings dowgrade because if its troubled balance sheet .
AIG may have to raise $ 20 billion or more to solve its problems in a plan that could be put together this weekend as well , CNBC has learned
On Friday night , after the government finished out what one person with knowledge of the discussion described as the Fed 's " LTCM Plan , " an executive in the room pointedly asked , " What happens when there 's another one ? "
People with knowledge of the matter say the government provided no real answer other than to point out what they 've been saying for the past three days as Lehman began to implode and look for buyers :
There will be no government bailout of the firm , and if the street doesnt do something to help in the process , such as buying Lehman 's bad assets , a deal to sell the good part of Lehman will be difficult to complete .
If Lehman is not sold , most analysts conclude it will likely be forced to file bankruptcy possibly as early as the end of this weekend .
A bankruptcy filing could be catastrophic for the markets , given the size of Lehman 's balance sheet .
Billions of dollars in trades would effectively be frozen , something that would almost certainly cause massive selling of stocks .

People with knowledge of Friday 's meeting said the situation remains fluid and Wall Street may ultimately back the plan under continued press from government officials and fear that if the Lehman deal doesnt happen , the markets will tank .
On Saturday afternoon , officials at the major Wall Street firms were all working as the Federal Reserve and the Treasury continued to search for a way sell Lehman and prevent a market meltdown .
Potential bidders for Lehman include Bank of America , Barclays PLC and HSBC .
Private equity is interested in Lehman 's Nueberger Berman asset management unit .
A major roadblock , however , is Lehman 's $ 40 billion in troubled real estate and subprime assets on its books .
Bidders do n't want to purchase Lehman and its bad debt , particularly without government assistance .
That 's why the Fed and the Treasury have pushed the LTCM plan :
If Wall Street buys the illiquid debt , it could bail out Lehman and possibly make money once the real estate market comes back .
The problem for the street however is that they fear the rolling financial crisis could claim other victims .
One executive at major Wall Street firm said the Federal Reserve might have to guarantee a government bailout of the next firm to implode for the Wall Street firms to agree to the plan .

As has become painfully clear since 9/11 , intelligence is only as good as the worldview of the person receiving it .
The team of former intelligence professionals who have come together to advise Barack Obama describe a candidate who they believe is open - minded and intellectually inclined to absorb information — not just the recognized current threats ( terrorism , Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , a resurgent and more belligerent Russia ) , but the ones on the horizon ( nuclear terrorism , water wars , climate change and the conflicts it could generate ) .
But they also are urging him to rethink the architecture of the intelligence community to grapple with both current and emerging threats , and to do away with the Bush administration ’s legacy of excessive secrecy and its tendency to view complex international challenges in black - and - white terms .
“ The world is a very complicated place and there are not always easy solutions to a lot of the problems out there , ” says John Brennan , a top Obama intelligence advisor and former senior CIA official who co-founded the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and the National Counterterrorism Center , a post - 9/11 effort to integrate the US government ’s terror threat intelligence .
“ If you look at the world in black and white , you miss a lot of the subtleties out there .
‘ Either with us or against ’ — the world is not divided into good and evil a lot of time .
Despite America ’s military might , a lot of these problems do not lend themselves to kinetic solutions ” — i.e. the use of force .
And world dynamics are likely to get more complicated and nuanced , not less , by 2025 .
An intelligence forecast being prepared by the US intelligence community for the next president “ envisions a steady decline in US dominance in the coming decades , as the world is reshaped by globalization , battered by climate change , and destabilized by regional upheavals over shortages of food , water and energy , ” according to the Washington Post .
Obama himself articulated his approach to intelligence in a speech in July .
“ It ’s time to update our national security strategy to stay one step ahead of the terrorists , ” Obama said at Indiana ’s Purdue University .
“ It ’s time to look ahead — at the dangers of today and tomorrow rather than those of yesterday . ”
But even though matters such as politicized intelligence , torture , domestic surveillance , and preventing terror attacks are among the most controversial issues of the Bush legacy , intelligence has remained largely a stealth topic in the presidential campaign .
Intelligence advisers to Obama say the topic ’s relative absence may actually be appropriate : “ This is not an issue for the campaign , ” says one former White House official now advising Obama .
Adds a former senior CIA operations officer who is also a member of the campaign ’s intelligence working group :
“ The only way we can correct it is to have a bipartisan , national interest audit of what it ’s currently doing , figure out what works , and make the best recommendations and implement them .
And you do n’t want to see this pitfall the election . ”
Aside from Brennan , the campaign ’s intelligence working group ( which is coordinated by former National Security Council official Rand Beers ) spans a range of national security professionals who have served in senior leadership , operational and legal positions in the National Security Council , CIA , and defense intelligence agencies , including many who served both Republican and Democratic administrations .
Among them : Former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin , former senior CIA operations officers Art Brown and Jack DeVine , retired Ltn. Gen. Claudia Kennedy , retired Ltn. Gen. and former head of the Defense Human Intelligence Service Donald Kerrick , former CIA lawyer and special advisor to the CIA director Kenneth Levitt , former CIA general counsel Jeff Smith , former CIA Near East division chief Robert Richer , and former CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson .
Former CIA lawyer and Clinton - era NSC official Mary McCarthy has stepped back from her previous role coordinating the group due to private sector work demands .
One participant described the group ’s priorities for a prospective Obama administration to me this way : “ The intelligence community is a complete mess .
Intelligence reform — try to fix it .
Improve morale .
CIA is dysfunctional .
Rectify a lot of stuff that was done by executive order in secrecy , and bring more transparency .
Better protection of civil liberties .
Improve oversight of CIA on these activities . ”
Meanwhile , national security experts in the McCain camp characterize their candidate as a Washington veteran who does n’t need a working group to advise him on the issues .
“ John has been in town for three plus decades , ” says Gary Schmitt , a former executive director of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board who occasionally contributes advice to the McCain campaign .
“ McCain is his own guy and he has been his own guy .
McCain can pick up the phone and call [ former deputy secretary of state ]
Rich Armitage whenever he wants . ”
But some of Obama ’s intelligence advisors say their experience with the recent administration has shown that leaders who think they already know it all can lead to disaster .
“ Old man Bush was a great guy , ” says one veteran intelligence officer now supporting Obama , who requested anonymity .
“ He was truly interested and sensitive to intelligence .
But this Bush administration has done terrible damage to the intelligence business .
They have operated a perpetual campaign , treated intelligence as a political tool , and never fully appreciated why it must be non-partisan and objective and ca n’t be tampered with . ”
“ It ’s time , ” he continued , “ for a very serious change . ”

If you do any hardcore WordPress coding , then you ’re probably aware of Custom Fields and the unlimited possibilities they offer you as a WordPress designer or developer .
For instance , I use custom fields as a means of attaching a feature image and thumbnail to posts in my Proximity News Theme .
But , they can be a bit cumbersome to use throughout your theme because of the ridiculous amount of code that it takes just to pull the data out and display it .
Conventionally , here ’s how you would pull the data from a custom field where the key = image and use the value of that field as the “ src ” value in an IMG tag :
<? php $ image = get_post_meta( $ post ->ID , ' image ' , TRUE ) ; ?> <? php if ( $image ) { ?>< img src= " <? php echo $ image ; ? > " alt = " Alt Text " /><? php } ?>
Putting the value from the custom field into a variable definitely cuts down on the amount of code you have to write , but by utilizing a simple PHP function , we can make using custom fields even easier !
Open up your theme ’s functions .
php file and paste the following code somewhere between PHP tags :
function get_custom_field ( $key , $ echo = FALSE ) { global $ post ; $ custom_field = get_post_meta( $ post -> ID , $ key , true ) ; if ( $echo == FALSE ) return $ custom_field ; echo $ custom_field ; }
Now , when you want to get the value of the custom field , you simply use the function in your theme files like so :
<?php get_custom_field ( ' image ' , TRUE ) ; ?>
Using the “ TRUE ” value makes sure that the function actually echos the value , rather than just returning it .
But if for some reason , you need to use the value of the custom field ( for instance , to store in a variable ) , then you can return the value instead of echoing it like so :
<?php get_custom_field ( 'image ' , FALSE ) ; ?>
Also , you could change the value of the $ echo varialble in the function declaration to TRUE if you would like the default for the function to be to echo the value , rather than return it .
It ’s really up to your preferences .
Now , let ’s take it one step further .
Let ’s recycle some code from our get_custom_field function and use it in a function that will check to see if that custom field has a value — and if it does , then to use that value , along with the proper IMG tags to output an image , including width and height specifications :
function image_attachment ( $key , $ width , $ height ) { global $ post ; $ custom_field = get_post_meta( $ post ->ID , $ key , true ) ; if ( $custom_field ) { // if the user set a custom field echo ' < img src= " '.$custom_field . ' " alt= " " width= " '.$ width . ' " height= " '. $ height . ' " />' ; } else { // else , return return ; } }
Then , just use the function in your theme files .
This example would echo the image with a width and height of 100px :
<?php image_attachment ( ' image ' , 100 , 100 ) ; ?>
Cool , huh ? 🙂
Feel free to experiment with the many , many opportunities these kinds of shortcuts can bring you .
NPUC 08 Yahoo !
is now using real - time automated algorithms to select news stories on its famous front page , claiming a 25 to 30 per cent increase in click through rate - and millions of dollars in additional yearly revenue .
In other words , Yahoo !
is making more money than ever from shameless celebrity gossip .
Senior research scientist Deepak Agarwal unveiled the new system this morning at NPUC 08 , an IBM - sponsored conference dedicated to all things AI .
A small step on the long road to true artificial intelligence , the system sprung from a Yahoo !
Research project dubbed the Content Optimization Knowledge Engine .
Agarwal calls it Coke for short , and his fellow researchers are affectionately known as Cokeheads .
" This is a project we started about a year ago , " Agarwal told his audience of AI obsessives at IBM ’s Almaden Research Center .
" The goal was to use data mining and machine learning to optimize the content shown to users on web portals , and a version of the system is now in production on the Yahoo ! front page . "
Agarwal would n’t tell us when the system actually went live .
Clearly , he ’s been told not to speak with the press – or at least The Register .
But during his prepared speech , he said the company ran preliminary tests for " several months . "
As they have for years , real live editors still choose the pool of stories for the Yahoo !
home page .
But on the page ’s main news tab ( the " Featured " tab ) , automated algorithms decide which of these stories get placed where – and how long they stay there .
And each decision is made with an eye towards click through rate .
Yahoo ! does AI ( kinda )
Based on the Kalman algorithm – a filtering method first developed in the early 60s – the system determines story placement by analyzing millions upon millions of user clicks as they happen .
Agarwal and his team considered a method that juggled stories based solely on their characteristics – is it a Britney Spears story , say , or a Paris Hilton ?
– but they soon realized they could deliver a bigger click boost if they tracked the clicks themselves .
" We track user responses , " Agarwal said , " and then we respond ourselves - in real - time . "
Yes , Agarwal says this has improved click through rates by nearly a third .
And yes , with extra clicks delivering extra ads , this translates to several millions in extra revenue .
Naturally , Agarwal hopes to bring the system to other parts of the Yahoo ! portal .
But even on that tiny Featured tab – which holds only four stories – the technology has some growing up to do .
Agarwal and crew hope to boost click through rates even further by personalizing article placement for each user .
But at the moment , this does n’t quite fly .
Personalization still loses out to raw click analysis .
Agarwal suspects this has something to do with the fact that real live editors are still selecting the initial pool of stories .
They ’re intent on fingering stories that appeal to everyone , the theory goes , so personalization is n't as personal as it could be .
As Agarwal described Yahoo !'s new click optimizer , he was closely watched by John McCarthy , one of the AI pioneers who organized the seminal Dartmouth Summer Research Conference on Artificial Intelligence back in the summer of 1956 .
And when the speech was over , McCarthy spoke up from the auditorium 's front row .
" I 'm a little puzzled , " he said .
" What does this have to do with AI ? "
OK , the Yahoo ! news page still relies on editors .
And even the automated bit ends up making some rather simple choices .
But in making those choices , it 's already beating human thinkers .
And there 's more work on the way .
" Over the past 50 years , we 've lowered the bar for what we consider AI , " Stephan Nusser , senior manager of the User - Focused Systems research group at Almaden and the conference 's MC , told us .
" We have to start with AI that 's practical . " ®
I wanted to plot some simple bar charts recently and I fell on Gruff once again .
Since the examples there did n't have any info about bar charts it took me some time ( ok - five with ten minutes : D ) to find out that you can use them just like line charts but here are some examples anyway :
A very simple bar chart :
Ok , let 's see something more advanced now :
And now a bar chart with most of the options changed :
For even more options you can check Gruff : : Base documentation or the whole Gruff API Have fun :)
( Note : I have updated this posting with some more info on what I am looking for )
Since I make a little bit of money every month in advertising off this blog , I thought I 'd put some of this money to good use .
I 've been trying very hard to use vim as my editor for day - to - day use .
Previously , amidst lots of waffling , I had settled on TextMate for my day - to - day work .
Awesome editor , nice and lightweight and full of the cool features I needed .
There were two features that were stopping me from totally switching over .
First one was Cmd - T inside a project , which allows you to search through your project doing a fuzzy search for files that match your search string .
Awesome , awesome feature .
Cuts down on the browsing using the project drawer that I tended to do .
That particular hurdle has been fixed thanks to Jamis Buck ( of Capistrano and 37 Signals ) through his FuzzyFinderTextmate plugin .
It 's extends the fuzzyfinder.vim plugin with a little bit of Ruby .
Does the trick , but you have to do a little jiggering to get it to recognize new files .
An argument for another day I guess .
The second one is the also - awesome ' Find In Project ' feature in Textmate , which searches through all your files looking for matches for the string ( or regex if you 're up to it ) inside those files , then providing you with a list of files that you can open .
I 'm wanting functionality similar to how the fuzzyfindertextmate plugin referenced above works , but for searching inside files .
I am aware of how : vimgrep and : grep work ( thanks to those who pointed it out ) , but I do not like how the quickfix window works , as I want a dropdown list of the files that contain what was found so I can open them .
Again , very similar as to how the FuzzyFinderTextmate plugin works .
So , I am offering $ 100 of my own ill - gotten advertising revenue ( payable via PayPal ) to the person who comes up with the solution I like the best that actually works .
If you do n't want the money , I can donate it to the charity of your choice as long as they will take PayPal as well .
I know * someone * out there can figure this out .
I 'll give you until American Thanksgiving to come up with a solution .
Please post your suggestions in the comments , but please realize that all comments are moderated and off - topic ones will definitely be sent to / dev/null

In Alaska , it ’s against the law for a governor to advocate for or against a ballot measure .
But that did n’t matter much to Sarah Palin .
At an August 20th press conference a reporter asked Palin her opinion of Measure 4 , known as the Clean Water Initiative , which would have imposed new restrictions on mining companies .
Fishermen worried that a proposal to build one of the world ’s largest open - pit gold mines at the headwaters of one of the Alaska ’s most productive salmon streams could wreck the famed Bristol Bay ( which is also the namesake of Palin ’s pregnant daughter ) .
With the measure to restrict the mine coming down to a squeaker at the polls , this is what Palin said : “ Let me take my governor ’s hat off just for a minute here and tell you , personally , Prop 4 — I vote no on that . ”
Her nod - and - wink endorsement was immediately seized by mining companies to create this ad , which ran in papers around the state as part of an $ 8 million media campaign–one of the most expensive ballot measure ad blitzes in Alaska history .
Six days later , the Clean Water Initiative was voted down .
Clearly , Palin ’s comments violated the spirit of Alaska ’s law .
And this was n’t the only way she pushed legal boundaries to support her friends in the mining industry .
Palin ’s Department of Natural Resources had published a primer on Measure 4 on its website that environmentalists complained was entirely negative and improperly echoed the mining industry ’s concerns .
On August 24th , just three days before voters weighed in on the initiative , the state ’s Public Offices Commission finally ruled that the enviros were right and ordered the website to undergo changes .
There are weird echoes of the Bush / Cheney war over executive power here .
Appearing on Fox last night , Sarah Palin told Sean Hannity a heartwarming story of how she asked her teenage daughters for their opinion before accepting the vp offer .
" So ask the girls what they thought and they ’re like , ‘ Absolutely , let ’s do this , Mom , ’ ” Palin recounted of her daughters , Bristol and Willow .
Yet , according to the campaign - provided timeline of how Palin 's selection came about , her kids only found out the big news after they were spirited from Alaska to Ohio for the announcement .
" While there , Governor Palin 's children , who had been told they were going to Ohio to celebrate their parents ' wedding anniversary , were told for the first time that their mother would be a nominee for Vice President of the United States of America , " said the official timeline , as released by McCain 's campaign last month .
Todd Palin , in a separate interview with
Fox this week , also said the kids were not told about the decision until after they left Alaska .
Asked about the discrepancy , Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said : " She asked the girls to vote once they arrived in Ohio . "
When it was noted that , that would have been after the decision had already been made , Schmitt said Palin was still in Arizona at the time .
This , of course , does n't change the fact that the children were already in Ohio for the express purpose of announcing he news .
By itself , the tale is a small thing .
Perhaps Palin was more running it by them then asking them .
But why , when many of her policy - related statements are coming under question , would Palin embroider something that is so easily proven untrue ?
Al Gore was roasted in 2000 for his exaggerations , and the pattern of them gave Republicans a brutal frame to use against him .
With these sorts of stories , Palin is giving Democrats the same sort of ammunition .

There ’s a rising tide on the rivers of blood
But if the answer is n’t violence , neither is your silence – Pop Will Eat Itself , “ Ich Bin Ein Auslander ”
When all is said and done , nothing communicates the racism and knee - buckling stupidity of all - too - wide swaths of our nation quite like video .
So if you do n’t trust me to tell the truth about these folks , maybe you ’ll trust their own words .
Here , for your copying - and - pasting convenience , is a transcription of some of what you just heard :
“ I ’m afraid if he wins , the blacks will take over .
He ’s not a Christian !
This is a Christian nation !
What is our country gonna end up like ? ”
“ When you got a Nigger running for president , you need a first stringer .
He ’s definitely a second stringer . ”
“ He seems like a sheep – or a wolf in sheep ’s clothing to be honest with you .
And I believe Palin – she ’s filled with the Holy Spirit , and I believe she ’s gonna bring honesty and integrity to the White House . ”
“ He ’s related to a known terrorist , for one . ”
“ He is friends with a terrorist of this country ! ” “ He must support terrorists !
You know , uh , if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it must be a duck .
And that to me is Obama . ”
“ Just the whole , Muslim thing , and everything , and everybody ’s still kinda – a lot of people have forgotten about 9/11 , but …
I dunno , it ’s just kinda… a little unnerving . ”
“ Obama and his wife , I ’m concerned that they could be anti-white .
That he might hide that . ”
“ I do n’t like the fact that he thinks us white people are trash … because we ’re not ! ”
As I always told my writing students : show , do n’t tell .
Clearing a Low Bar
Welcome to a state where the politics of hate
Shout loud in the crowd “ Watch
them beat us all down . ”
At this point , I ’m trying to imagine what I can add that is n’t superfluous .
That racism still exists , in tragic amounts , is n’t a revelation to anyone with more than six or seven functioning brain cells , although being confronted anew with this kind of evidence is still jarring .
What ’s different , though , is what I said back in June .
Make no mistake , in the coming months you ’re going to see the ugliest artillery that our nation ’s drooling , inbred hatemongers have at their disposal .
The looming prospect of a nigra in the White House is going to bring the vermin out of the woodwork , out from under their rocks and out into the light .
It ’s going to incite the well - heeled country club elite to crank up the meme machine with every sort of subtle , codemongering dogwhistle it can manufacture .
The truly ignorant and hateful are going to be liquored up on rhetorical bile of the lowest sort and those who live further up the social ladder are going to be provided with a variety of messages that let them vote white without having to admit to themselves that they ’re fundamentally just like the snuff - suckers in the trailer park across the tracks .
This is a good thing .
Let me say that again : this is a good thing .
It ’s a good thing because we ’ll never defeat an enemy that can safely hide from scrutiny .
This is a disease that ’s only going to be cured with copious amounts of very bright light .
We will not fear your mask .
Because what we believe in does n’t need to hide .
In this election campaign , let ’s invite the Klan and its fellow hate groups out into the light .
Let ’s get their hoods off of them .
Let ’s show all their videos .
Let ’s make sure that everybody gets to read their brochures and visit their Web sites .
Let ’s hand the microphone to their most eloquent speakers and stand aside .
Let ’s get them front and center and make sure America sees , in all its slack - jawed , toothless glory , precisely what racism looks like .
…
And above all , when we hear racist code masquerading as legitimate , issues - based messaging , let ’s not be afraid to say “ excuse me , but will you take off your hood ? ”
It ’s decision time , and I ’m ready for a referendum on hate .
How about you ?
Regardless of what happens on Election Day , we wo n’t have triumphed finally and completely over ignorance .
Our culture is , at its very core , anti-intellectual and frighteningly tolerant of the willfully stupid .
We fetishize shallowness and vote on whether or not we ’d like to have a beer with the candidate .
We mock “ elites , ” sort of .
We ’re too thick to recognize real elitism when we see it , but we can be relentless in our abuse of those born to meager means who , through little but their own intelligence and hard work , rise up to make something of themselves .
Our ability for self - deception is unmatched in the entire civilized world .
But an Obama victory ( which looks more likely by the day ) would nonetheless mark a milestone : we would have arrived at a point where a man of non-white ( or half non-white , as the case may be ) heritage can be elected to our highest office .
As my colleague Whythawk has observed , that actually says something pretty good about America , given how few of our fellow industrialized nations can say the same .
“ We suck less , ” though , is n’t the sort of shining - city - on - the - hill standard America has traditionally prided itself on setting ( even if only rhetorically ) , and while being the first to clear a very low bar is something to note , it ’s not something to get too puffed up over .
This is especially true when we have millions of citizens howling for the corpse of Barack Obama .
It ’s especially true when our media institutions ignore the filthiness happening right before their eyes .
It ’s especially true when these disgusting public spectacles are funded by a hyper - rich power elite that ’s willing to spend whatever it takes to keep us ignorant and at each other ’s throats .
As for the premise that McCain is no racist , well … racist is as racist does , do n’t you think ?
He got his back up at the suggestion that he was somehow like George Wallace , but in what conceivable way is that charge less fair and valid than the slanders his campaign has slung in Obama ’s direction ?
And why should we taken seriously McCain ’s late - to - the - dance attempts to rein in the hate that ’s been committed in his name ?
His actions in recent years have made clear that he ’s willing to do whatever it takes to win the White House , Bob Dolizing himself to a degree that Dole himself could hardly have imagined .
Tack this way on the advice of advisers , pander to the Right to shore up the base , let Karl Rove bully you out of your VP preference , let slip the dogs of Race War …
Why would I or you or any other thinking American regard this as anything besides a tactical maneuver driven by research showing that undecided voters are turned off by it ?
None of Us Are Free
In “ None of Us Are Free ” ( written by Barry Mann , Brenda Russell and Cynthia Weil ) , Solomon Burke sings
None of us are free .
None of us are free .
None of us are free , one of us is chained .
None of us are free .
Clearly , large portions of America remain chained .
Our Cracker Problem persists , and what ought to be most disconcerting is that it not only exists in the heart of Georgia , in Outback Ohio , in pro-America Virginia or in a Republican Women ’s club in California .
It not only thrives in the minds of elderly whites who preferred Jim Crow to Martin Luther King .
It ’s not only alive and well in organizations like Stormfront and the League of the South .
No , the problem is that racism , racemongering and race - baiting are alive and well at the very highest , most public levels of our democracy : our presidential election process .
And it was put there , on full display , and sanctioned by one of the only two parties that ever really stands a chance in any national election .
On November 4th , let ’s hope for an epic thrashing of those who seek to profit by trading in hate and ignorance .
Let ’s further hope that those who ca n’t and wo n’t evolve get the message loud and clear : crawl back underneath your rocks and remain quiet until it ’s finally your time to die .
But whatever we do , let ’s not confuse winning a battle with winning the war .
Our Cracker Problem will be with us for awhile longer , and November 5th will be the beginning , not the end .
And when they come to ethnically cleanse me
Will you speak out ?
Will you defend me ?
Or laugh through a glass
eye as they rape our lives
Trampled underfoot by the Right on the rise …

Scientific evidence has long suggested that moderate drinking offers some protection against heart disease , certain types of stroke and some forms of cancer .
But new research shows that stopping drinking -- including at moderate levels -- may lead to health problems including depression and a reduced capacity of the brain to produce new neurons , a process called neurogenesis .
The findings from the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill appear online in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology .
" Our research in an animal model establishes a causal link between abstinence from alcohol drinking and depression , " said study senior author Clyde W. Hodge , Ph.D. , professor of psychiatry and pharmacology in the UNC School of Medicine .
" In mice that voluntarily drank alcohol for 28 days , depression - like behavior was evident 14 days after termination of alcohol drinking .
This suggests that people who stop drinking may experience negative mood states days or weeks after the alcohol has cleared their systems , "
The mice were tested for depression - like behavior using a widely recognized method called the Porsolt Swim Test .
The mice are placed inside a beaker filled with water and allowed to swim for six minutes .
Mice are good swimmers and have no problem completing this task .
The amount of time they spend immobile ( floating and not swimming ) is measured as an index of despair or depression - like behavior .
The more time a mouse spends immobile , the more " depressed " it is thought to be .
" This research provides the first evidence that long - term abstinence from moderate alcohol drinking -- rather than drinking per se -- leads to a negative mood state , depression , " Hodge said .

The study also found that the emergence of depression was associated with a profound reduction in the number of neural stem cells ( cells that will become neurons ) and in the number of new neurons in a brain region known as the hippocampus .
This brain region is critical for normal learning and memory , and recent studies show that the development of neurons in the hippocampus may regulate mood , Hodge said .
According to the researcher , the negative mood state in mice may represent depression in humans and appears to be linked to a diminished capacity of the brain to form new neurons .
" Thus , people who drink moderate alcohol socially , or for potential health benefits , may experience negative mood or diminished cognitive abilities due to a loss of the brain 's ability to form new neurons , " he said .
But the study also found that treatment with an antidepressant drug during 14 days of abstinence prevented the development of depression and restored the capability of the brain to produce new cells .
" Treatment with antidepressant drugs may help people who suffer from both alcoholism and depression by restoring the brain 's ability to form new neurons , " Hodge said .
" Moreover , this research provides an animal model of alcohol - related depression with which we can begin to fully understand the neurobiology underlying co-occurring alcoholism and depression , and thereby develop successful treatment options .
At this point it appears that blunted neurogenesis may underlie the effects of abstinence from alcohol drinking on mood , but understanding the mechanisms by which this occurs is a key challenge for future research . "
Several co-authors , all from UNC , also contributed to the study : Jennie R. Stevenson , neurobiology graduate student ; Jason P. Schroeder , Ph.D. , and Kimberly Nixon , Ph.D. , research associates with the Bowles Center ; Joyce Besheer , Ph.D. , assistant professor of psychiatry ; and Fulton T Crews , Ph.D. , director of the Bowles Center and professor of psychiatry and pharmacology .
The research was supported by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ( a component of the National Institutes of Health ) and by the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Lehman Brothers has finally announced a path to raising capital .
But after Tuesday 's 45 % plunge in its stock price , it 's unclear if Wall Street will let chief executive officer Richard Fuld carry out the plan .
Lehman's ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) stock was down about 2 % late Wednesday morning after the company said it would slash its dividend , look for a buyer of the majority of its Neuberger Berman investment management unit and spin off part of its commercial real estate business .
Shares are trading at their lowest point in 10 years , having plummeted nearly 90 % so far this year .
And by the way , the company lost $ 3.9 billion in the third quarter .
So now , the natural question that needs to be asked is this :
On the heels of the Treasury Department 's takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , does the government now have to step in and bailout Lehman as well .
Unfortunately , it may have no choice .
The Federal Reserve set a dangerous precedent in March when it helped engineer the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) by agreeing to guarantee $ 29 billion in potential losses .
Since then , several Fed members , most notably chief Ben Bernanke , have gone out of their way to defend the action , arguing that Bear Stearns simply was too big to fail .
The repercussions of allowing Bear to collapse could have been catastrophic .
So if Bear was determined to be too big to fail , is n't it likely the Fed would think Lehman is as well ?
Probably .
That 's because Lehman , the fourth - largest investment bank , is bigger than Bear , which was the fifth - largest at the time it nearly imploded .
What 's more , Lehman , a bond - trading powerhouse , is even a bigger player in the mortgage - backed securities market than Bear was .
So the Fed could easily argue that letting Lehman go under could create even more chaos in the already volatile credit markets .
Yes , Fuld wants to keep the bank independent by taking a piecemeal approach to breaking up the company .
But the market may not let him do so .
And until Lehman actually announces that it has , in fact , raised a substantial amount of capital , it 's likely that there will be continued pressure on the stock .
If Lehman 's stock falls further , it 's reasonable to think that some financial institution would take a gamble on buying the company , especially if it could get Lehman through a " takeunder " just as JPMorgan did with Bear .
Some analysts have tossed out investment manager BlackRock ( BLK , Fortune 500 ) , British bank HSBC ( HBC ) and private equity firm Blackstone ( BX ) as potential bidders .
But why would any of them agree to take on all the risk without some assurance from the Fed ?
After all , that 's exactly what JPMorgan got in the Bear deal .
Do n't get me wrong .
I do n't like the notion of big Wall Street firms getting saved after making irresponsible , reckless decisions .
In what 's supposed to be a free market , companies should be allowed to fail .
But the Fed has already opened Pandora 's box .
It 's too late now to say that Lehman should be left to wither away to nothing while Bear was allowed to escape that fate .
To be sure , if one of the three aforementioned firms were to try and buy Lehman and wanted the Fed 's help , this would be more complicated than the JPMorgan takeover .
BlackRock and Blackstone are n't banks .
And HSBC is not a U.S. - headquartered institution .
Still , Bernanke and Fed vice chairman Tim Geithner have demonstrated a remarkable willingness to be flexible and creative in dealing with the credit crunch .
So if they wanted to help someone buy Lehman , one would think they would find a way to get it done .
Like it or not , the age of the bailout is in full swing .
Activist , poet , and musician Saul Williams is catching gruff from fans for allowing Nike to use his song “ List of Demands ” in commercials .
Williams wrote an open letter defending the use of the song .
I received a lot of questions from some about why I would allow my song ‘ List of Demands ’ to be used in a Nike campaign .
Ironically , half of the people now reading this post never heard of me until that commercial aired .
That , indeed , was one of my reasons for allowing it .
A small circle of poets and conscious do - gooders are not enough to effect the change necessary to shift our planet in peril .
We must enlist people from all walks of life , people not accustomed to questioning the norm , people who may simply want to dance uninterrupted without message or slogan .
I see no glory in ‘ preaching to the converted ’ .
I think there ’s an interesting point here :
To create change , you need to reach out to those who do n’t already agree with you .
If you ’re just having agreeable conversations with likeminded people , you ’re probably not actually accomplishing much in the way of fostering change .
Today marks the 20th anniversary of the publication of Salman Rushdie 's novel , The Satanic Verses .
At the time , extracts from the novel were circulated by some Islamic organisations to mosques and Islamic societies across the country to help acquaint British Muslims with its contents .
I was in my second year at university and could not comprehend why someone like Rushdie , who had been brought up in a Muslim family , would write a provocative novel that he must have known would cause offence to millions of people .
Why constantly refer to the Prophet Muhammad as Mahound , the old medieval name for the devil ?
And to have a group of prostitutes in a brothel to take on the names of the prophet 's wives in order to better arouse their clients – what was Rushdie thinking ?
There can be no real doubt that Rushdie was aware that his book would spark a huge controversy .
A clearly tongue - in - cheek passage in The Satanic Verses has a character being told , " Your blasphemy , Salman , ca n't be forgiven … to set your words against the word of God . "
We are all familiar with what happened next .
A series of demonstrations were organised calling for the book to be withdrawn from circulation – you may recall that the then Tory government had tried to do the same with Peter Wright 's Spycatcher just a couple of years previously .
There were a couple of infamous book - burnings .
Some Muslim organisations called for the blasphemy law to be extended to cover more than just the Anglican faith .
The protests against the book soon spread to Muslim majority countries .
Then came Feb 14 1989 and Ayatollah Khomeini 's dramatic intervention from Iran calling upon Muslims everywhere to kill Rushdie for the crime of insulting the prophet .
Just over a year ago , I wrote a Cif piece arguing that it was time to admit that those of us who had called for the book to be banned or pulped were wrong .
Utterly wrong .
It was understandable why many regarded and still do regard passages in The Satanic Verses to be so offensive , but that could not be used as a justification to try and prevent others from reading the book .
My piece got a mixed reaction from the Muslims I spoke to .
Some agreed that the episode had been a disaster while others strongly disagreed with me and did not accept that a novelist should have the " right to offend " .
I tried to explain that the right to offend did not imply that one agreed with what was being said – it was just that the writer should not be prevented from doing so as long as he was not breaking any laws .
This year I decided to send an email to members of one national Muslim organisation asking them for their own views on the matter .
Here are excerpts from some of the responses that I received :
You cannot force people to respect you and it has resulted in the exact opposite reaction with all sorts of people lining up to insult and lampoon the prophet , Islam , the Qur'an and Muslims generally in the last two decades since .
I was 16 years old at the time and was perplexed over the issue .
I knew that Rushdie had written an offensive book , but I found the Muslim protestors ' response somewhat offensive too .
The late Zaki Badawi was right all along to say he would offer his home as a sanctuary for his fellow citizen Salman when the death penalty and its bounty was declared ...
I think years later , many of us who would admit to having hurled abuse at Badawi then , have relearned and rethought about loyalty , citizenship , freedom and social responsibility .
It may be notable that I did not receive a single response arguing that the protestors were right to have called for The Satanic Verses to be pulped or withdrawn .
Is this rethinking now widespread amongst British Muslims ?
Yes , my impression is that it certainly is with many now accepting that the Satanic Verses affair served to create ( and for others reinforce ) the unfortunate view that Muslims were backward , anti-intellectual , prone to violence and saw themselves as being somehow above the law .
In a 1990 essay entitled " In Good Faith " , Rushdie tried to explain his reasons behind writing the Satanic Verses .
Rushdie argued that he and his book had been consistently misrepresented but also asked :
What is freedom of expression ?
Without the freedom to offend , it ceases to exist .
Without the freedom to challenge , even to satirise all orthodoxies , including religious orthodoxies , it ceases to exist .
Language and the imagination cannot be imprisoned , or art will die , and with it , a little of what makes us human .
It is painful to admit it , but on the need to uphold the freedom to offend , Rushdie was right .
The consequences of not doing so should be apparent by now to Muslims above all .
Earlier this year , the leader of the far right Dutch Freedom Party , Geert Wilders , called for the Qur'an to be banned because he found some passages in the book offensive .
And there 's the rub .
Who is to decide what is offensive or not ?
What may be offensive to me may be just harmless fun to you and vice versa .
Some months back I had dinner with a well - known British columnist who has some rather strident views about immigration and Islam .
I asked him outright what it was that so annoyed him about Islam and he said it was what he viewed as the seemingly constant attempts by Muslims to try and restrict freedoms .
And regrettably , like it or not , that is the image too many people now have of Muslims .
Last month a fresh controversy broke out over the proposed publication of the novel , Jewel of Medina , which is said to be about the Prophet Muhammad 's relationship with his youngest wife , Aisha .
The book has been described as a " soft - porn " novel and is now due to be published by Gibson Square in the UK next month .
Already emails are being circulated calling on British Muslim organisations to mobilise to try and stop its publication .
Will they try and do so ?
I really hope that appropriate lessons have been learned from the Satanic Verses affair and that British Muslims do not take the bait .
As per Islamic tradition , I have spent this month of Ramadan re-reading and studying the Qur'an .
It is an unfailingly joyous experience .
Every time I read it I marvel at the achievements of the Prophet Muhammad .
He was the restorer of a pristine monotheism , blessedly free from the confusing Christian doctrine of the trinity and the narrow Hebrew tribalism of Judaism .
His revolution in Arabia changed the course of human history and launched the Arabs on to the world stage for the first time .
The point I am trying to make is that his achievements are by no means diminished simply because of the writings of Rushdie or the Jewel of Medina author , Sherry Jones .
The Qur'an records the prophet being vilified as a " madman " and a " sorcerer " by his pagan opponents .
The Qur'an consoled the prophet against these taunts and urged him to be patient while assuring him that " soon you will see and they will see which of you is afflicted with madness " ( chapter 68 , verses 5 - 6 ) .
Let Rushdie , Jones and co write as they please .
Muslims are likewise at liberty to use those very same freedoms to promote their own understanding of the mission of the Prophet Muhammad .
So what will happen when the Jewel of Medina is published next month ?
If the views articulated by my correspondents now constitute the majority view amongst British Muslims then that would be a hopeful sign .
An anonymous member of the Legion of Doom calls a member of the Masters of Deception a " nigger " - and in the loose - knit hacker underground , nothing is the same again .
The whole story starts in 1989 , months before the Martin Luther King Day crash of AT&T , months before Mark Abene and Paul Stira even know each other 's names .
The whole mess , which will grow into a world - class electronic gang war fought by hackers from New York City to Texas , starts back before Paul even knows what a switch is .
If you want to trace it to one night , to one single instant when you can say the whole story really begins , you will see this image :
Paul in the dark , peering into a garbage dumpster .
The early summer evening is warm on his skin when Paul Stira , 19 , leans over the edge of the dumpster as far as he can .
This is one way to become a computer hacker .
It 's the way Paul has chosen .
He tries to snare one of the five or six invitingly swollen bags that sit in the bottom of the dumpster .
It 's not enough to be 6 feet tall , because Paul still can't reach the bags , not until his stomach becomes the fulcrum for his body and his feet actually leave solid earth .
He dangles , the blood rushes to his head , he gets dizzy .
And yet there 's nowhere he'd rather be than here , climbing around in this dark alley in a dumpster full of phone company trash , looking for computer printouts .
He came for the documents .
But he also came for adventure .
Right after scarfing down a quick supper earlier in the evening , Paul mumbled goodbye to his mom , who was still getting used to the fact that his dad had all of a sudden died .
Then he hopped a bus to the end of the line .
He got off in Jamaica , Queens , at Parsons Boulevard and Hillside Avenue , an intersection in a neighborhood hot with bodegas , bars , and beeper - rental joints .
He stood for a while , afloat in the dwindling stream of commuters flowing from the subway .
And then , a black Supra full of teenagers pulled up to the curb , and the dark - eyed guy driving checked him out , smiled .
Paul got in .
" Let 's go trashing , " somebody in the back seat said .
" There 's a C.O. in Astoria . "
Paul finds it cool to be talking in a kind of hackers ' code .
The word " trashing " means climbing around in garbage , where you hope to find computer printouts that list secret passwords and logons .
And C.O. , as everybody in the Supra knows , means central office .
As in New York Telephone 's central office , in Astoria , Queens .
Somebody broke out the Ballantines and the Olde English 800s , and Paul took one .
He knew only one of the other guys in the car - his best friend , who calls himself Hac .
Until tonight , Paul had never physically met the driver , Eli Ladopoulos .
But he had known him by his handle : Acid Phreak .
They reach Astoria , and even the building itself thrills Paul : this big , filthy , red - brick monster takes up most of the block .
Across the front , chiseled over the door , it reads " Telephone Building . "
Like on a board game or something .
Does the park across the street have a big sign that says " Park " over it ?
No way .
This building was built back when there was only one telephone company , Ma Bell .
They sidle up to it .
There are bars on all the two - story windows and through them , a vast , loftlike , fluorescent - washed space .
Imagine a library , hushed and eerie , but instead of books , all the shelves are filled from floor to ceiling with rack after rack of circuit boards .
That 's called the frame .
There are even rolling ladders , with signs that read , " Caution .
Look up before climbing . "
Like what kind of doofus would n't look up before climbing ?
Upstairs in the building , connected to all those wires , is the switch .
The switch is the biggest computer you ever saw , and its job is to control every phone line in Astoria .
When a phone - company customer in an apartment over the Tae Kwon
Do martial arts studio on 31st Street wants to order a pizza from around the corner , the phone call travels on copper cables to the switch , which funnels it to the pizza parlor 's line .
Multiply that by a couple - hundred thousand lines in this part of Queens , and millions of phone calls a day , and you see what we 're dealing with .
Now , if you or your friends knew how to program a switch , or even knew a password to log on to a switch , you could start exploring .
Go deep enough , learn your way around , and you could be pretty powerful .
Because then , you could control everybody 's phone service .
You could create an unbillable number for yourself or your friends .
You could listen in on phone calls .
And best of all , you 'd really know how all this fabulously complex electronic circuitry works .
That kind of omnipotence is beyond the ethical reach of the CEO of New York Telephone .
But maybe not beyond the reach of some teenage hacker tenacious enough to scrounge around in the garbage until he finds a password .
This alone makes the trip worthwhile .
For a carload of teenage hackers , the opportunity to gawk through the big plate - glass windows at the matrix of electronic circuitry is better than being Dorothy at the gates to the Emerald City .
These teenagers are not central casting 's idea of computer nerds .
Not a plastic pocket protector in the bunch , nobody squinting myopically through thick lenses .
In fact , no one here wears glasses , and Paul and Hac , at least , are as muscled as the first - string running backs who graduated with them from high school last year .
If they were n't so jumpy , they could toss around the 30 - pound bags like Nerf balls .
Look at Paul - he 's the pale silent one .
He 's always quiet in a crowd .
Because he 's a big kid , his silence is intimidating , whether he means it to be or not , as he stands staring with flat , Slavic eyes .
Those eyes take in everything and return nothing .
Eli is his physical opposite .
He 's the one the girls like , the hip - hop guy , the cool one .
Eli has a slow smile that starts like a conspiracy and spreads up to his eyes and pulls you in .
His eyes are black as blueberries .
His hair is as black as his eyes .
This is Paul 's first time trashing , and frankly , if you knew him , you 'd be shocked to see him here .
He is , after all , the valedictorian of Thomas A. Edison High School 's class of 1988 .
Winner of the all - city computer - programming competition .
A boy with a future .
They start going through the garbage .
Paul hoists a bag over his shoulder , over his head , and hands it up to Hac .
Then Hac hands it down to the sidewalk .
That 's the routine , with Eli playing lookout on the street below .
But just as Hac 's about to hand off the final bag , a man comes out of the telephone building and pauses a second longer than he should .
Then he gets into a car , rolls down the windows , and just sits there .
The boys freeze .
" What 's he doing ? " Paul whispers .
" I do n't know .
He 's just sitting in his car . "
Paul and Hac stand there , crazed alley cats , backs high , ears cupped , tensed on tiptoes .
And then the worst happens .
In the distance , they hear a siren .
It 's not an ambulance , whose aural signature Paul would recognize .
But it 's definitely a siren , and it 's getting louder .
Closer .
It 's a banshee now , and it 's just around the corner , and Paul , for one , has had it with the dumpster diving .
He climbs over the fence , as fast as he can , and follows a retreating Hac to the sidewalk .
The siren 's just about upon them , and they dash madly across the street , bags in tow , past the guy who 's sitting in the car , now wide - eyed , watching the kids come leaping over the fence .
Their sneakers hit pavement , and with barely a second to spare , they dive into a dark , safe spot in the park .
Just as a fire truck blazes past .
They look at one another , their hearts pound .
They can see the outline of the Triborough Bridge through the leafy trees .
The green and white lights along its suspension beckon like a distant Ferris wheel , and it's an adventure again .
They kneel on the handball court and rip the sacks open , and paper printouts spill like entrails .
The night is hot and the streets are hopping and you can probably even see stars .
They do n't look up .
A few days later , Eli and Paul have n't given up ; they 're in need of an expert who can help them really navigate the phone system 's computers .
Eli says , " I know this guy .... "
But it turns out that Eli is not talking about just any guy .
This is the dude .
Eli's talking about Phiber Optik , says he 's even encountered Phiber while roaming through cyberspace .
Eli's never met him in person ( but then , who has ? ) , but Eli knows enough about Phiber Optik to know that he 's the man with the answers .
He 's in the Legion of Doom , is n't he ?
He 's the gang 's phone guy , for god 's sake .
The Legion 's exploits are legendary .
The Legion is rumored to know how to break into ongoing phone calls .
The Legion is rumored to have hidden its own private bulletin boards inside corporate computer systems .
The Legion 's archives are rumored to be the repository for the best technical information in the underground .
Paul does n't know anybody in the Legion of Doom , does n't even know who 's in it - though he 's heard of the gang founded by a notorious hacker named Lex Luthor .
Eli says that if Phiber Optik got into the Legion of Doom , then Phiber Optik must be good .
You have to be a little brave to even suggest calling a guy like that .
You have to be pretty sure of yourself , not afraid at all that the guy is going to hang up on you , or worse , listen to what you say and then ridicule you .
You have to have a lot of confidence in yourself .
" Let 's call him , " Eli says .
Paul says OK .
What do you want ? " the voice demands .
" I'm Phiber Optik of the LOD . "
If you heard it , you 'd think it was the Wizard of Oz himself , standing behind his curtain and making steam hiss and fires roar .
Phiber Optik of the LOD .
Both Paul and Eli hear it , the outrage in the thunderous voice that has answered the phone .
Now , Eli once " met " Phiber Optik on a bulletin board .
But that 's little comfort now , not with a real live member of the Legion of Doom on the other end of the phone , thundering and aggressive .
A guy like that does n't like you , he can turn you into a toad - or at least turn your home phone into a pay phone .
Every hacker has heard the stories , heard of some poor rodent whose mom picks up the phone in the kitchen to call Linda next door and instead of a reassuring tone hears the recording , " Please deposit 25 cents . "
Explain that to your mom .
Not that Phiber 's response is totally unexpected .
How does he know that he's not talking to a couple of lame wannabes on the phone ?
He gets these calls all the time .
Ever since word spread that he's in the Legion of Doom , his phone number has been disseminated in the underground .
What do Eli and Paul want of Phiber ?
It 's obvious .
They heard he was the dude who was into phone company switches .
But that 's the simple answer .
They really want much more , do n't they ?
They want him to teach them not only about the phone system , but also about all the sophisticated computers he 's cracked , about the rare commands he can type , about the way his mind works .
They want what any two boys with a little knowledge and a great curiosity want .
They want a leader to show them the way .
Phiber loves to teach .
" You want to get together ? " he asks .
And Paul thinks ,
Who is this guy ?
They soon learn Phiber 's real name : Mark Abene .
There are wannabe cyber gangs , and then there are real cyber gangs , whose members crow and scrawl their proud graffiti over electronic bulletin boards .
No gang is more real , more revered , than the Legion of Doom .
Its founder is the legendary Lex Luthor - a mysterious leader who lives somewhere in the South .
His protégé is a brash Texan tyro , who uses the handle Erik Bloodaxe , a name infinitely more memorable than his given name , Chris Goggans .
The Legion of Doom is the best of the best from the 50 states .
How does one become a member ?
It is n't like you have to prick your finger and swap blood with Chris Goggans .
Gang members on the electronic frontier do n't live in the same state , would n't recognize each other if they were standing shoulder to shoulder on the bus .
Here 's how Mark Abene got into the Legion of Doom in the first place .
Although Mark swears he never spoke to Chris before joining LOD , here 's how Chris remembers it ( Mark , typically , says Chris is all wrong ) : one day a few months ago , down in Texas where he was a college student , Chris noticed that Mark Abene had started signing his postings , " Phiber Optik of the LOD . "
And Chris thought ,
Who is this kid ?
He immediately phoned north .
" Hi , is this Mark ? "
" Yeah . "
" This is Chris - Erik Bloodaxe , " said Chris .
" Why in the hell are you signing your name LOD ?
You 're not in LOD . "
Mark thought for a second , then said solidly , " I'm in LOD . "
" No one is in LOD unless we all vote on it , " corrected Chris , who explained the " rules , " among them the necessity of a unanimous vote .
Then , for some reason , the tone of the conversation shifted to what both teenagers really cared about : hacking the phone company .
And Chris realized that Mark really did know as much as people had been saying , maybe more .
This guy was good .
The actual vote came a few weeks later .
Mark was in .
Just like any schoolyard pack of boys born in the shadow of The Dirty Dozen , Hogan 's Heroes , and Mission Impossible , the LOD members all fancy themselves specialists in some dark art .
One kid might know how to make a wicked blue box , a device cobbled together from top - secret Radio Shack parts that simulates the tones of coins dropping into a pay phone .
Another might be an expert in programming Basic .
And Mark ?
He can trace the route of a phone call from New York to Paris , detailing in loving techno - babble each photonic hop .
He can describe , in detail , the different kinds of computers that run different aspects of the phone company 's business .
He knows the meaning of the phone system 's every English - language - mangling acronym : MIZAR , COSMOS , SAG , LMOS .
He can explain the phone system to anyone .
Indeed , he loves to , in eye - glazing , brain - fogging , overdosing detail .
And in 1989 , Mark has just turned 17 .
To tell the truth , a few members soon get a little sick of the new prodigy .
He is brash and has what some out - of - state members recognize as New York attitude .
And he does n't give a rat 's ass who thinks so .
If Phiber Optik graces a bulletin board with comments about this or that phone company secret , then other hackers spread the word : Phiber 's on .
This place is hot .
A crowd congregates .
The phone lines are all busy .
Hackers desperately call , using the redial feature , trying anything to get through , trying to get past a busy signal as implacable as any nightclub bouncer .
Phiber seems to revel in belittling blustery hackers who post misinformation .
He loves nothing better than trapping some nitwit who thinks COSMOS is some double - secret key to the phone company kingdom .
( Duh , the name sure sounds important , does n't it ? )
People are starting to notice .
Like Chris Goggans .
One day in 1989 , he and a friend , Dr. Who , are hanging out on a hot bulletin board called The Phoenix Project .
Who do they run across but Phiber Optik of the LOD , eviscerating some poor pretender .
And this was what Chris thought about Mark : a real arrogant , smart - ass punk .
Mark and Chris never settle their difference .
Mark gets kicked out of the Legion of Doom .
He has a disagreement with Chris , and Chris starts bad - mouthing him to the rest of the members of LOD .
Word of Mark 's expulsion leaks out , all over the underground .
How did it happen ?
Some kind of a fight .
Chris says
Mark screwed him out of some information , Mark says Chris does n't know what he 's talking about .
Who knows ?
But it 's posted on bulletin boards from here to Germany .
It 's the talk of the hacker élite : Phiber Optik got into a feud with Erik Bloodaxe , and to hear Erik Bloodaxe tell it , Phiber Optik lost .
Eli has been thinking .
Maybe the Legion of Doom is élite simply because it exists .
If it 's not the only gang out there in the underground , it 's certainly the only one that boasts a decade of history and dozens of members nationwide who answer to a Texas leader .
It 's the biggest .
It 's the baddest .
( That we know of so far . )
But if another group of hackers challenges the Legion 's superiority - well , who knows what might happen ?
There 's an idea he's had for awhile , it turns out , and one day in the summer of 1989 he tells Paul on the phone .
" MOD , " Eli says .
" Mod ? " Paul asks .
" M - O - D , " says Eli , spelling the letters out .
So what is it ?
" We should call ourselves MOD , " Eli says .
It 's like a joke .
It 's a finger in the eye of LOD .
He explains that it's an allusion to LOD , the Legion of Doom .
From L to M , the next iteration , the new " kewl dewds " of cyberspace .
The boys from New York are the opposite of the boys from Texas .
How better to define themselves ?
The boys from New York can figure out who they are simply by opposing the Legion of Doom and everything it stands for .
Mark will love it , right ?
Whatever it stands for .
That 's not important right now .
What is important , Eli says , is the joke : MOD .
It stands for nothing .
It stands for everything .
Masters of Disaster .
Mothers on Drugs . Masters of Deception .
The Masters of Deception do n't know it , but in the summer of 1989 they already face a threat far greater than the Legion of Doom .
By getting together in Eli's bedroom for late - night hacking sessions that lead to carousing in computers owned by the phone company , they have attracted the attention of two of the finest lawmen on the frontier of cyberspace : New York Telephone investigators Tom Kaiser and Fred Staples .
Kaiser , who has been monitoring some of the teenagers ' phones for months , awakens early one morning in August 1989 and thinks , Today could be the day that we nab the hackers .
He already feels the summer heat through his shirt as he leaves his house on Long Island to make an early train to Manhattan .
This morning he will tell the Feds about the case .
Having reserved the big conference room , Kaiser finds it full of phone company people and their invited guests - investigators from the New York Police Department special frauds unit and the US Secret Service .
Knowing that the technical aspect of the case might make it difficult for non-technicians to grasp , Kaiser and Staples explain the case in general terms .
" We may be coming to you with this case we have , and how should we do that ? "
Kaiser inquires .
" What have you got ? " asks one of the federal investigators .
" We have three hackers , " Kaiser says .
Mark , Paul , and Eli .
Many months will pass before anyone gets indicted .
There comes a time in any good history where the plot twists unexpectedly .
Life is moving along , developing its own routine and rhythm , when all of a sudden , something - or someone - intervenes , and the pace accelerates , faster , and faster still .
And the story hurtles off in a new direction .
One day , in the fall of 1989 , Eli is cruising the familiar territory of cyberspace and decides to check out reports about some hot hacker in Brooklyn .
The Brooklyn hacker calls himself Corrupt .
He 's rumored to be a specialist .
MOD can always use another specialist , and Corrupt supposedly knows more about the ubiquitous and powerful corporate computers called VAXEN ( the plural for VAX ) than the founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation .
Which would be some feat , considering that Digital manufactures the damn machines .
An expert who understands the intricacies and nuances of running VAX computers could really widen MOD 's power base .
A VAX master could help the other MOD boys navigate through some computers that for now seem tantalizingly obscure .
Not only is VAX a type of computer prized by hackers , who love the versatility and power of the machine , but VAXEN also are indispensable to universities , corporations , small companies , database archives , and libraries all over the country .
Oh yeah , and the government owns a lot of them , too .
The government keeps a lot of its secrets hidden on VAXEN .
And Corrupt can crack them .
Sign him up !
Now , there 's plenty that Eli does n't know about Corrupt .
He does n't know , for instance , that he lives with his mom in a third - floor walk - up apartment in Bedford - Stuyvesant ( that 's Bed - Stuy ; you 've heard of it as surely as you 've heard of Cabrini Green and East LA ) , one of New York 's toughest neighborhoods .
Eli does n't know that Corrupt will need no introduction whatsoever to the concept of MOD , because Corrupt is intimately acquainted with gangs .
Out in the real world , out on the streets where you measure distance with your feet instead of your modem , Corrupt used to belong to a gang called the Decepticons .
One thing Eli quickly learns : Corrupt 's real name is John Lee .
John Lee dials " 0 . "
It 's early 1990 now , and John Lee is in MOD .
The hacker leans against a bank of pay phones in the atrium of the soaring Citicorp building in midtown Manhattan .
He 's much too cool to check out his reflection in the plate - glass window of the Italian restaurant at the edge of the open space .
All around him , teenagers peck at phones like sparrows at a bird feeder , dialing and hanging up , trying random phone numbers .
About 50 teenagers are hanging out , swapping information on how to break into computer systems , forming energetic clusters .
Kids dial a number that someone said would connect to a New York Telephone switch .
The number worked last week .
The hackers had materialized out of nowhere at around 6 o'clock , just when the office drones fled the Citicorp building for the subway .
The kids come every few weeks , on the first Friday of the month .
No matter the season , they wear beat - up fatigue coats , baggy jeans , clunky - soled shoes , thick - thick black belts with square metal buckles weighing up to 5 pounds .
They sport peach - fuzz mustaches and slicked - back buzz cuts .
You can't miss them .
The gathering is their " meeting . "
John Lee 's induction into MOD is only natural , because of his intense thirst for computer conquests ; all he wants to do is penetrate new systems .
He 's learned so much about hacking and cracking in the one year since he got his modem that he 's caught up with the rest of the MOD pack .
He 'll do anything to get into a new computer .
He breaks into a network , then turns over the information to the other MOD members .
He 's the scout ; they chart the territory .
On the pay phone , John connects to an operator .
" Hey , I 'm up on a pole here , " he says , using his deepest , most authoritative , most adult voice .
If only the operator could see John , a tall , 20 - year - old black kid in stubby dreadlocks , white T - shirt , and khaki pants so baggy they could hold a friend .
He does n't look at all the part he 's playing - a white , middle - aged , tool - belted lineman doing a service check .
But he sounds the part .
And maybe that 's enough .
Just maybe the operator will fall for his smooth line of techno - babble and give him an open line .
" Yeah , I need - damn . "
Disconnected .
John hangs up .
Meanwhile down in Texas , the guys in the Legion of Doom are part of the mad rush of excited hackers who all jump onto one open phone line at once , crowding into a conversation like it's a rush - hour subway .
Chris ( aka Erik Bloodaxe ) and a friend named Scott Chasin have been friends since the mid-1980s , when they both were coincidentally logged onto a Midwestern - based under - ground BBS called World of Kryton .
Scott and Chris discovered they had a lot in common : both were babies conceived on the cusp of the 1970s , then raised in the secure style afforded the white middle class in Texas .
They share the same hobbies : both do conference bridges , as they call them .
The phone line used by the Legion of Doom belongs to - well , let 's say it has been temporarily liberated from a local phone company , allowing anarchic hackers to engage in huge transcontinental conference calls that bridge across this city , and through that state , as one kid after another gets onto the line .
If you are on the line , and you have three - way calling on your phone , you can invite a friend to join the conference call , too .
Simply hit the flash button that disconnects a call , then call your friend , then flash again .
Your friend is three - wayed in now .
And if he had three - way calling , he could recruit yet another caller to the conference .
These daisy - chains last for hours , for days , for marathon amounts of time that adults can't even imagine .
There is so much to say .
Bridges are a great way to get acquainted .
You can take a tour of the world on a bridge , talking to one hacker in Holland at the same time you converse with somebody in New York City .
In fact , a couple of mysterious New York newcomers named Corrupt and Outlaw brushed up against Texas kids pretty often during conferences .
Chris and Scott have never actually met the New York boys , but they 've heard of them .
Vaguely .
They 've heard that Corrupt and Outlaw come from a place they dismiss as the " inner - city ghetto , " but the New York boys seem to know their stuff .
One night in 1990 , on a bridge , about five or six hackers - all kids from Texas , you understand - are hanging out on the line .
What are they talking about ?
Random stuff .
Chris is n't on , or so he later claims .
Scott is on .
Suddenly , another voice calls in to the conference , joins the group in midsentence .
The unknown newcomer does not have an accent common to these parts .
" Yo , dis is Dope Fiend from MOD , " the newcomer says in distinctly non-white , non-middle class , non-Texan inflection .
One of the Texans ( who knows who ? ) takes umbrage .
" Get that nigger off the line ! "
The newcomer is silent .
In fact , the whole conference bridge is suddenly silent , all the chattering boys brought up hard and cold against the implacable word .
You might as well have slapped their faces .
Interminable seconds pass .
Who wants to fill that void ?
That 's it .
As simple as uttering one ugly word .
The racial epithet instantaneously moves northward over hundreds of miles of cable , ringing in the ear of John Lee , who sits at his Commie 64 in his Brooklyn bedroom way at the other end of the line .
That word hits John like a billy club .
" Get that nigger off the line ! "
Then the newcomer speaks with a different accent , and the words he says to the white boys from Texas are these : " Hi . This is Corrupt . "
Who had bleated that word ?
It 's immaterial at this point ; nothing will ever be the same again .
Not for Chris and Scott , not for the boys from MOD , not for the loose - knit community that makes up the hacker underground .
With that one word , war has been declared .
Chris Goggans is John Lee 's enemy - will be forever .
But at this point in mid-1990 and after the fateful confrontation , John does n't even know his nemesis by the name " Chris . "
He just knows Erik Bloodaxe .
But John has decided to make his enemy 's life miserable .
So first John must learn Erik Bloodaxe 's real name .
Chris is so notorious in the underground that it does n't take John long to get the information he needs .
And it 's a good thing , since you can't exactly call directory assistance in Texas and ask for a listing for a resident named Bloodaxe , as in " axe " with an " e . "
So John bypasses directory assistance altogether .
Instead he calls a Southwestern Bell computer , from there logs on to a switch and simply looks up Chris 's phone number for the three - bedroom , suburban - type house he was renting in north Austin .
Then the calls start .
Sometimes John uses his street accent to harass Chris .
The phone calls are constant .
It does n't help to hang up .
The receiver is barely down before the phone rings again .
And again .
And again .
Chris has to take it off the hook , and leave it off the hook for hours .
Sometimes , when they prank Chris , the callers say , " Here , talk to your friend , " and then before Chris can hang up , he hears a click , and then Scott is on the line , too , three - wayed into the call against his will , and he 's saying , " Hello ?
Hello ?
Who is this ? "
In Chris 's mind , this type of harassment definitely falls into the category of Behavior That Is Unacceptable .
It 's the kind of harassment he could help prevent , in fact , if he were to open his own computer security firm .
He 's had the idea for such a company for a long time , but now the plan starts really taking shape .
He and Scott talk about the situation a lot , and they even come up with a name for the company they want to create .
Comsec Data Security is the full , stuffy name , but neither of them ever think of it in that formal way .
For Chris and Scott , the venture would always simply be known by a shortened name , Comsec .
One day during the winter of 1990 , Chris gets hold of a copy of The History of MOD , the " phile " written by Eli to commemorate the birth of MOD .
Chris feels he has been teased and provoked enough ; the MOD boys have logged into the Southwestern Bell switch that controls his phone service and switched his long - distance carrier from Sprint to AT&T .
Chris does n't know this has happened until he tries to dial long - distance .
He does n't hear the familiar click .
So then , of course , he has to call up the phone company .
Try explaining the situation to a clerk in the business office , and you 'll know why he 's so annoyed .
Chris figures that John is the one who switched his long - distance carrier on him .
He also believes , incorrectly , that John is the author of a manifesto the northern boys call The History of MOD .
So Chris gets hold of the Boswellian tale and decides to pull a little mischief .
Chris has an old computer program that will translate any file into a new " language . "
When he feeds The History of MOD to the program , out pops a " jived " version of the document .
The translation program simply searches for certain words or word forms , and replaces them with others .
In goes the original language : " In the early part of 1987 , there were numerous amounts of busts in the US and in New York in particular .... "
Out comes , " In de early part uh 1987 , dere wuz numerous amonts uh busts in de US and in New Yo'k in particular .... "
Using the jive program is the electronic equivalent of appearing in blackface - a crude , minstrel show in cyberspace : " Some nigga ' name Co'rupt , havin ' been real active befo'e , duz n't gots ' some so ' kin ' computa ' anymo'e and so ... sheeit , duh . "
Chris does n't consider himself a racist .
He has black friends at work , he says .
Ask him why he jived The History of MOD : he says it just seemed funny .
Hilarious , he says .
If you 're out to get someone , you 're going to do anything you can to make him mad , Chris says .
Anything .
He did n't have a translation program to turn the MOD boys ' prose into , say , a Lithuanian accent or something , he only had a jive program .
So what was he supposed to do ?
If you lived in the state of Texas , you 'd understand , Chris says wryly : " Down here , we all have boots and hats .
We all ride on the range . "
John sees a copy of Chris 's handiwork in early 1991 .
He 's sitting in front of a computer system that looks like it was cobbled together from junkyard parts .
He has a big old TV console for a monitor , a messed - up keyboard and his old Commie 64 , bandaged with electrical tape .
His computer is a street box , a guerrilla machine .
Grunge computing .
And there it is on the screen , The Jived History of MOD .
" De legacy uh de underground ' clandestine ' netwo'k continues and so's duz de war ( and ridiculing ) against all de self - proclaimed , so - called ' elite . ' "
John can't believe it at first ; it 's too outlandish .
He reads through it , slowly , amazed .
John finishes reading , then sits for a minute , staring at the screen , staring away from the screen - just kind of staring .
And he thinks ,
This guy really does n't like me .
This is aimed right at me , and only me .
Comsec opens its doors in May 1991 , and the partners quickly make themselves at home in the airy Houston headquarters .
Comsec has a huge vaulted ceiling with skylights and faux gas lights in the two corridors .
Some days , Comsec 's founders skateboard down the long empty halls of the vast space and roll around in chairs .
Chris is living in the back of the building , in an apartment with a big , white - bellied alley cat named Spud .
But there is a problem .
Comsec has zero clients .
The officers of Comsec hold weekly staff meetings , which they all attend .
They decide to distribute press releases advertising the availability of their security services .
But to whom ?
As professed ex-hackers , they compile a list of likely clients .
They scan the " philes " on underground bulletin boards to find the names of businesses whose computers have been infiltrated , then call the companies to offer their services .
The press releases do the job , because in June 1991 , less than a month after Comsec 's official début , Time runs a story about the hackers .
The very next day the office phone starts to ring .
And ring .
You can't buy advertising better than Time .
Comsec has clients !
One , a consultant representing the telecommunications industry , orders up some research on recent regional Bell company crashes .
The client pays US $ 5,000 up front .
Of course , the publicity in Time has another effect .
Up north , the MOD boys are reading the stories .
John Lee has an ingenious idea for pranking the Texans .
Why did n't he think of it before ?
He puts his plan into action during that long , hot summer of 1991 .
It keeps his mind off the lack of air conditioning in the brownstone apartment on Kosciusko Street .
His plan is to spy , and it 's fairly simple .
John logs in to the Southwestern Bell switch that controls Comsec 's phone service in Houston .
Then John types commands to ask the switch if any of Comsec 's phone numbers are engaged .
If they are , then John will know that a conversation is underway right now .
A phone line is in use .
So he issues another command , just like an operator would , to seize control of the line that carries the call .
That easily , he splices himself into the ongoing conversation .
There 's a quiet click on the line , but it 's not the sort of noise you 'd notice unless you were waiting for it .
And no one at Comsec has any reason to believe that calls are being tapped .
John eavesdrops routinely .
That 's the way to find out what the enemy is up to , a way to anticipate the Texans 's every move before it is made .
So here 's John , listening in on Comsec 's lines one afternoon when the security firm gets a call from a world - famous hacker , Craig Neidorf .
It is safe to say that no hacker is more famous than Neidorf in 1991 .
That is because Neidorf beat the federal government at its own game a year earlier .
In the months since , his legal fight has become legend .
( And for years to come , wary prosecutors considering indicting hackers will caution one another to make sure their cases are airtight , so they can avoid " pulling another Neidorf . " )
The co-editor of the electronic magazine Phrack , Neidorf had gone on trial in Illinois in the summer of 1990 , charged with fraud .
The alleged crime : possessing and publishing a supposedly proprietary phone company document in an issue of Phrack .
The government argued that the information was worth thousands of dollars , based on estimates from the phone company .
But midway through the trial , the defense showed that the document 's so - called proprietary information was publicly available ; Bellcore sold the information to anyone who had $ 13 to pay for a technical article .
Stung , the federal prosecutors in Chicago dropped the charges before the case reached a jury .
Yes , Neidorf was a hero to some hackers .
But his notoriety also made him a target for any denizens of the underground determined to make a name for themselves in cyberspace .
Now in the middle of a workday in summer 1991 , Chris Goggans has answered the phone at Comsec and Neidorf is on the other end .
( John eavesdrops noiselessly . )
The phone call is just a friendly chat , but today Neidorf is frankly annoyed .
The problem is that anonymous callers have been phoning him at home and harassing him over the line .
He thinks he knows who is responsible , but he wants the prank calls to stop .
" Sounds like they 're doing stuff along similar lines to what they 're doing to us , " Chris responds .
" Someone just called up my dad 's house in Virginia , " Neidorf says .
Chris is not surprised , but he 's outraged on behalf of his friend .
He even has a theory about who might be behind the calls .
" Sounds like Corrupt , " Chris says , recounting his suspicions that John Lee has also been pranking him in Houston .
" It sounds like something he would do . "
At that moment , a second phone line rings in Houston , another incoming call for Comsec .
Chris asks Neidorf to hold on a minute , then answers the other line .
The voice on the second phone line says to Chris , " Yeah , that does sound like something I would do . "
Chris is so mad he can't think straight .
John Lee has been eavesdropping !
On Comsec 's private phone calls !
For how long ?
How often ?
What has he heard ?
What has he told his little friends up there in MOD ?
If this gets out , Comsec will be a laughingstock !
Would you hire a computer security company that can't keep its own phone lines secure ?
Chris calls the FBI , unaware that for months the government , relying on evidence of intrusions gathered by phone company investigators Kaiser and Staples , has been building its case against MOD .
Whether Chris 's calls affected the timing is not known , but the indictment against MOD is announced in July of 1992 .
The indictment has 11 counts and charges Mark , Paul , Eli , John , and another MOD member with illegal computer intrusion .
Each count is punishable by at least five years in jail .
Each count carries a maximum fine of $ 250,000 .
The case is so big , so sensational , so groundbreaking that the US Attorney himself calls a press conference in the lobby of St. Andrews Plaza , site of his Manhattan headquarters .
He wants to announce the indictment to the media .
It 's a little off - putting , the rows of folding chairs hastily arranged with their backs to the metal detector and the bullet - proof US Marshal 's booth .
A stream of New York 's finest - finest press corps , that is - slouches in and starts bitching for handouts .
The indictment is a 23 - page document dense with facts , counts , and legalese .
The press release that explains what the indictment is trying to say is eight pages long .
And then there are charts that Secret Service Agent Rick Harris arranges on an easel .
This was before Ross Perot , remember , and the charts are a novel idea .
The basic point the prosecution is trying to get across is the national scope of the computer intrusions .
" This is the crime of the future , " says US Attorney Otto Obermaier , a tall , patrician man in a dark suit .
He points a finger to underscore his distaste for computer crimes .
" The message that ought to be delivered from this indictment is that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated . "
The MOD members are being charged with the most widespread intrusions of the nation 's largest and most sensitive computer systems ever recorded .
The government has decided to make an example of these teen - agers from the outer boroughs .
The message , which is what Obermaier calls it , is zero tolerance .
If you 're a hacker thinking of following in the footsteps of the Masters of Deception , think again .
There is hardly room behind the podium for all the authorities trying to get a piece of this one .
There are the prosecutors .
Then there are the agents from the FBI and the Secret Service , and there are the investigators from the US Justice Department 's Computer Crime Unit .
Obermaier tells the press corps all about the crimes .
He tells them the boys ' intrusions have cost companies thousands of dollars in security personnel salaries and lost processing time .
But he does n't tell them that the dangerous hackers are , in effect , just a bunch of teenage boys who got to be friends because they shared a hobby .
The story makes the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw .
It 's the piece Brokaw ends with - a forward - tilting , something - to - think - about piece .
There 's a close - up of Mark teaching a computer class at the New School for Social Research in Greenwich Village .
The piece closes with Mark talking to the NBC reporter on a dark and rainy street .
Mark says that he 's definitely the victim of political persecution .
Had there been a trial , well , then the MOD conspiracy case could have set a precedent for the entire country , could have established a benchmark by which the government could track down other so - called computer criminals .
But there was n't a trial , because all the MOD boys had pleaded guilty over the course of the year .
They had all given up .
What was left after that ?
It was up to the prosecutors to recommend a certain sentence and up to the judge to mete it out .
The hackers who arrive at the Citicorp building on the first Friday of February 1994 wear heavy hiking boots , and thick - soled turf crunchers , and kicked - around , black - leather shoes that lace up , up , up their calves .
Of course , if it were July , they would n't be dressed any differently .
This is the uniform .
Tonight 's meeting is the first gathering in nearly five years at which no one from MOD is present - Mark , Paul , Eli , and John are all in prison .
Dozens of hackers are here , ranging in age from 14 to 40 , far more attendees than in the days of early 1989 .
The world has changed since that heady time when Mark and Eli and John somehow found each other , somehow coalesced .
In fact , it 's as if the rest of the world has caught up .
What the MOD boys did for fun - recreationally cruising across continents of wires - has become a national pastime .
" Net surfing " is a bigger fad than CB radio ever was , and people everywhere are buying their first computers and hooking up to online services that connect them to the world and one another .
My mom .
Your mom .
Every - body 's entranced .
So it 's no wonder that the new members of an eager generation are filling the Citicorp atrium .
Tonight , there 's a hole where Mark used to be , a spot by the pay phones where he liked to stand patiently while a group of respectful protégés would gather to ask him highly technical questions .
Tonight you will not see his familiar blue - and - white bandanna , you will not hear the boom - and - heave of his voice .
Tonight , Mark is far away .
He arrived at the gates of Pennsylvania 's Schuylkill County Prison late at night in January 1994 , right after a snowstorm , and was whisked inside before his friends could say goodbye .
He wo n't get out until November .
The sentencing judge said that Mark , by his actions , chose to be a messenger for the hacking community .
And so the judge said he had no recourse but to send a message back .
After six months of shock incarceration camp , John comes out thinner , more muscular , in fact in the best shape he 's ever been in .
In the fall of 1994 , he heads back to Brooklyn College , where he 's enrolled in the film - studies program .
He 's got lots of ideas for films he wants to make .
After doing time in federal prisons in Pennsylvania , Paul gets out in the spring of 1994 .
Mark is scheduled for release around Thanksgiving .
For both , their days of hacking turn out to be good job training :
Paul works for a company that traces missing persons through public databases .
Mark keeps the computer system running at Echo , a Manhattan - based online service .
Mark is so beloved among Echo 's computer users for his smooth and efficient troubleshooting that the Echoids set up a fund while he is in jail so they can buy him a new laptop after he gets out .
The Legion of Doom and Comsec are just memories now .
Comsec went out of business , and Chris Goggans is working for a large clone maker in Austin , researching advanced wireless networks .
With other LOD members , he 's also assembled thousands of messages - flames , gloats , electronic graffiti - from various élite bulletin boards in the 1980s and sells the collection through a company called LOD Communications .
He sells T - shirts , too : at the December 1992 Ho - Ho Con , a hackers convention in Houston , the T - shirts are emblazoned with " The Hacker War " across the chest , along with a map of the United States depicting Chris 's version of major battle sites , mostly Houston and Austin and New York .
On the back it reads : LOD 1 , MOD 0 .
And there 's a quote , attributed to Corrupt , which Chris says he got from a secret MOD database : " It 's not just winning that counts , but making sure that everyone else loses . "
Identities

BANGKOK  Thai and Cambodian soldiers exchanged rocket and rifle fire for about an hour on Wednesday in a confrontation at their border over a disputed 900 - year - old mountaintop temple , according to reports from the area .
At least two Cambodian soldiers were killed , the Cambodian foreign minister said .
Several hundred soldiers from both sides have faced each other at the border since July , when Unesco , the United Nations agency , approved Cambodia ’s request to have the temple named a World Heritage Site .
Foreign Minister Hor Namhong of Cambodia said two Cambodian soldiers had also been wounded .
A spokesman for the Thai Foreign Ministry said seven Thai paramilitary soldiers were wounded .
Ten
Thai soldiers surrendered to the Cambodians , according to news reports in the capital , Phnom Penh .
The two nations have made claims for decades over the temple , Preah Vihear , which stands at the lip of an escarpment on the border looking out over the mountains of northern Cambodia .
The beta version of the upcoming Ubuntu 8.10 ( codename Intrepid Ibex ) , which is scheduled for release in late October this year , arrived a few minutes ago and , as usual , we intend to keep you up - to - date with the latest changes in the Ubuntu 8.10 development .
Compared with the sixth alpha , which brought Firefox 3.0.2 , Samba 3.2 and GNOME 2.24 Beta 2 , this version comes with the final and stable GNOME 2.24 desktop , a brand new wallpaper , Firefox 3.0.3 , PAM authentication framework and a BBC plugin for Totem ( the default movie player in Ubuntu ) .
But first , let 's take a quick look at the included applications :
· Mozilla Firefox 3.0.3 · OpenOffice.org 2.4.1 · The GIMP 2.4.7 · F - Spot 0.4.4 · Pidgin 2.5.1 · Brasero 0.8.2 · Transmission 1.34 · Rhythmbox 0.11.6 · Ekiga 2.0.12 · Evolution 2.24.0 · Nautilus 2.24.0 · Vinagre 2.24.0
Under the hood :
· Kernel 2.6.27 - 4 ( based on Linux kernel 2.6.27 RC ) · X. Org 7.4 and X. Org Server 1.5 ( with automatic configuration for keyboard and mice ) · Network Manager 0.7 ( with 3G wireless support ) · Apache 2.2 · PostgreSQL 8.3 · PHP 5.2.6 · LTSP 5.1 · GCC 4.3.2 · glibc 2.8 · Python 2.5
For the Intrepid Ibex , the development team will prepare an unbelievable desktop , with amazing performance , that will work on mostly any computer ( be it a high - end workstation or an old and dusty Pentium III machine ) .
Another major feature planned for Ubuntu 8.10 is the ability to be connected to the Internet ( wireless connections ) wherever you go : " We want you to be able to move from the office , to the train , and home , staying connected all the way , " said Mark Shuttleworth .
In this beta , the development team introduces a new tool called pam - auth - update , which allows you to manage the PAM authentication configuration for both servers and workstations .
Moreover , the Ubuntu movie player , Totem , features another interesting plugin that will fetch digital content from BBC .
Here is the screenshot tour of this beta release of Ubuntu 8.10 :
As you can see from the above screenshots , there 's a brand new wallpaper and like it or not , this will be the default one for the final release of Ubuntu 8.10 .
The theme is still Human - Murrine and there 's no " Encrypt system " option in the Live Installer , but something did change in the installer ( again ) :
As I mentioned in the previous screenshot tour , the new GNOME 2.24 desktop brings a lot of fresh and interesting features .
Here are a few of them :
· You can now mount archives !
What is that ?
Let 's say for example that you do n't want to extract an archive , you just wanna take a peek inside it or copy just two files from there ... with a simple right click on the archive , you can select the ' Open with " Archive Mounter " ' option and voila ; · The system will automatically shut down in 60 seconds if you just hit the shutdown button .
I 've tested it and the system shuts down in 60 seconds ...
However , I do n't see any reason for this function , except that it 's somehow cool ; · Private ( encrypted ) Directory really works , but you have to work some " magic " in the terminal to set it up ! ; · The ' Create Archive ' window has some new features , such as " Password protection " , " Encryption " and " File Splitting " ; · The ' Extracting files from archive ' window has changed , and it will show you in real time what it does ; · New , cool and amazing desktop effects for you to play with !

Forget John McCain 's face - to - face encounters with Barack Obama , which wrap up Wednesday with their third and final debate .
Thursday evening is when we 'll find out just how thick McCain 's skin is .
That 's when he settles into the guest chair next to the TV star who has become his new , unrelenting nemesis -- David Letterman .
Chances are they 'll play nice .
But given the grief Letterman has been directing McCain 's way , the candidate surely will be entertaining less - than - friendly thoughts .
Promulgating a feud -- whether real or not -- is a tried - and - true technique for attracting attention on the talk show circuit .
One of the founding fathers of late - night television , Jack Paar ( at right ) , was a master at it .
Letterman , whose comedic persona long has included a crusty edge , embraced the role of spurned host after McCain canceled a scheduled " Late Show " appearance last month because of plans to hurry back to Washington -- but then remained in New York that night .
Since then , Letterman monologues have been littered with barbs aimed at McCain .
And that continued to be the case tonight , despite the the Republican 's effort to make amends and show up on the " Late Night " set Thursday .
The Times ' Matea Gold passes along , courtesy of CBS , some of Letterman 's latest lines :
You heard what happened at a rally yesterday .
Sarah Palin mistook some of her supporters for hecklers .
And you know , confusion happens in all walks of life .
For example , a few weeks ago , John McCain mistook her for a legitimate candidate .
...
And tomorrow night is the final presidential debate .
John McCain and Barack Obama .
And John McCain is going to take this opportunity to unveil his new campaign persona .
His new campaign personality , to really energize the last couple of weeks of the campaign -- Fighting Underdog .
Fighting Underdog . ...
And if that does n’t work , then he ’s going to go to Corrupt Bordertown Sheriff .
And if that does n’t work , Seen - it - All Bartender .
And then Priest Who Tries to Communicate with Martians .
And then the Alcoholic Safecracker .
And then the Maniacal Hunter Who ’s After Human Prey .
And then the Shifty Racetrack Vet .
And then the Retired Jewel Thief .
And then the Archaeologist Who Scoffs at the Mummy ’s Curse . ... I ’ll say one thing about John McCain -- the guy is an optimist .
He sees the glass as half full -- of his teeth .
And we 'll say one thing about Letterman :
He 's more than doing his part to maintain the disparity a study identified in the political targets of late - night jests .

Austria was shaken by a political earthquake yesterday when the neo - fascist right emerged from a general election as a contender to be the strongest political force in the country for the first time .
The combined forces of the extreme right took 29 % of the vote , with Jörg Haider almost tripling the share of his breakaway Movement for Austria 's Future to 11 % , while his successor as Freedom party leader , Heinz - Christian Strache , saw his party soar to 18 % .
The far right 's vote doubled compared with the last election in 2006 , putting it within less than a point of overtaking the poll victor , the social democrats .
The two big parties , which have run Austria since the second world war , slumped to their worst ever election toll .
The Christian democrats ( ÖVP ) , fared particularly poorly at around 26 % , down 8 % .
The social democrats ( SPÖ ) , under a new leader , Werner Faymann , took around 30 % and laid claim to the chancellorship .
The early election was triggered by the collapse in June of the coalition of social and Christian democrats after only 18 months .
The extreme - right profited from popular disillusion with the two big parties , which took months to form a " grand coalition " in 2006 and then spent the next 18 months paralysed by internal bickering .
The same situation may repeat itself now , with both parties under different leaders and struggling to justify legitimacy .
Faymann , the likely new chancellor , is a 48 - year - old from Vienna , who was supported by the main rightwing and fiercely anti-EU tabloid , Kronenzeitung , after he promised to put new EU treaties to a referendum in a country that matches Britain in Euro - scepticism .
The far - right triumph was greater than its breakthrough in 1999 when Haider 's Freedom party came second in a general election with 27 % of the vote and entered government , sparking a crisis that saw Austria isolated internationally .
Strache , who has been associated with neo -Nazi militants who deny the Holocaust , according to a court ruling , and who wants a new government ministry created to manage the deportation of immigrants , wound up his campaign at the weekend by calling Muslim women who wear the burqa " female ninjas " .
He talked of east European immigrants to Vienna as " European brothers who do n't want to be Islamised " , while another of his party leaders reminisced about the days when the kiosks on Vienna 's squares sold sausage and wiener schnitzel , rather than " the kebab joints selling falafel and couscous , or whatever you call that stuff " .
Last night Strache said he should be the new chancellor .
" Today , we are the winners of election night , " he said .
The only realistic options for forming a viable grouping are for another grand coalition or for Faymann to contemplate a coalition with Strache , a Viennese former dental technician who has supplanted Haider as the national extreme - right leader .
Senior social democrats said last night that they would not collaborate with the Freedom party .
Any such move would trigger a deeper crisis within the SPÖ .
Despite mustering around 30 % of the vote between them , Strache and Haider are sworn enemies and are unlikely to be able to work together .
Both men are fierce critics of the EU .

Hawaii has become the first state to require solar water heaters in new homes .
The bill was signed into law by Governor Linda Lingle , a Republican .
It requires the energy - saving systems in homes starting in 2010 .
It prohibits issuing building permits for single - family homes that do not have solar water heaters .
Hawaii relies on imported fossil fuels more than any other state , with about 90 percent of its energy sources coming from foreign countries , according to state data .
The new law prohibits issuing building permits for single - family homes that do not have solar water heaters .
Some exceptions will be allowed , such as forested areas where there are low amounts of sunshine .

State Sen. Gary Hooser , vice chairman of the Energy and Environment Committee , first introduced the measure five years ago when he said a barrel of oil cost just $ 40 .
Since then , the cost of oil has more than tripled .
â€ œItâ€™s abundantly clear that we need to take some serious action to protect Hawaii because weâ€™re so dependent on oil , â€  Hooser said .
â€ œIâ€™m very pleased the governor is recognizing the importance of this bill and the huge public benefits that come out of it.â€ 
January 2009 could bring Democrats a dominance over Washington that neither party has experienced since the Reagan years .
Dems could hit 60 Senate seats
The possibility that Democrats will build a muscular , 60 - seat Senate majority is looking increasing plausible , with new polls showing a powerful surge for the party ’s candidates in Minnesota , Kentucky and other states .
A poll out Friday shows Sen. Norm Coleman could now easily lose his Minnesota seat to comedian - turned - candidate Al Franken .
A Colorado race that initially looked like a nail - biter has now broken decisively for the Democrats .
A top official in the McCain camp told us Sen. Elizabeth Dole is virtually certain to lose in conservative North Carolina .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has seen his race tighten dangerously close over the past week — and Democrats are considering moving more money into the state very soon .
And there is even talk that Republican Sen.
Saxby Chambliss is beatable in conservative Georgia after backing the economic bailout package opposed by many voters .
“ Before the economic crisis , we had a number of races moving our way , ” said Matthew Miller , communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
“ But now we ’re seeing Republican numbers plummet . ” GOP officials largely agree .
Senate races do n’t grab national attention like the White House battle does .
But if these trends hold , the Senate outcome could be almost as important to Washington governance as the presidential winner will be .
It takes 60 votes to pass anything through the slow - moving Senate .
So the closer the Democrats get to the number , the more power they will have next year to put their stamp on the country .
Democrats say their candidates are benefiting from the wipeout on Wall Street with a single message in every region of the country : “ These are the Bush policies coming home to roost . ”
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , told Politico : “ Americans know that in economically difficult times , we need a change from George Bush ’s policies .
And incumbents who have voted for six years with Bush , up and down the line , are having a difficult time trying to convince the electorate that they ’ve changed their spots . "
The trends reflect the growing fear of among top Republicans that their prospects could crater on Nov. 4 , with Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) running weakly at the top of the ticket , President Bush as unpopular as ever and the economic crisis serving as a last - minute propellant for the change message of Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
With Republicans fearing the loss of 17 to 21 House seats , January 2009 could bring Democrats a dominance over Washington that neither party has experienced since the Reagan years .
Rebecca Fisher , communications director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee : “ Our tracking polls would pretty much dispute most of your premise since we are n’t seeing any drop due to bailout .
Our races have remained consistent throughout the country . ”
The current Senate lineup is 49 Democrats , 49 Republicans and two independents who caucus with Democrats .
Democrats need to pick up nine seats to hit 60 votes .
Republicans have been bracing for big losses , but it was n’t until the past few days that they have started to privately sound the alarms that the bottom could fall out on Election Day .
GOP Senate candidates are getting pounded by the same waves of public discontent over the economy and Bush that could sink McCain , and it shows in polls from coast to coast .
Republicans fully expect to lose Virginia and New Mexico .
They think there is a pretty strong chance that they also lose Colorado , Alaska , New Hampshire , Oregon and North Carolina .
This means everyone should keep their eyes on Minnesota , Kentucky , Mississippi and Georgia over the final month of this campaign to see if a wave is coming .
Several Republican strategists close to the White House said there is increasing fear among party leaders about a bloodbath .
But they added that they hope to keep losses to as few as five or six seats , rather than the nine that Democrats would need to gain to reach the magic number of 60 seats .
These strategists hope the Minnesota poll out Saturday overstates Franken ’s strength , because it was taken at the height of turmoil over the bailout bill that Bush finally signed Friday .
“ It reflects a lot of intense unhappiness that will fade as the market restores some equilibrium , ” a Republican official said .
But that same timing is very dangerous for Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - Ore. ) , because his state has mail voting with a heavy early vote , meaning he has less time to recover from angst about the Wall Street wipeout .
Republicans say they have become more optimistic in recent days about Sen. John Sununu ( R - N.H. ) , who had been considered one of the party 's most endangered incumbents .
Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) will certainly lose if he is convicted in a corruption trial now under way in Washington but will probably win if he is acquitted , the strategists said .
Top Republicans say they have no hope for Dole in North Carolina .
“ There ’s no point in even counting the votes , ” said a top McCain official .
Republicans said they hope to make up for one loss by persuading Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) to caucus with them .
He has campaigned vigorously for McCain , and Democratic Party leaders have vowed to punish him .
One indication of the Republicans ’ mood :
They ’re already looking past this grim election season .
“ 2010 looks pretty good for us to pick up three or four or five seats pretty easily , ” the McCain official said .

Many reasons are there for migration of business to a new web hosting service provider .
Cause differs from low disk space to miserable customer service or regular breakdowns of a server .
Selecting new web hosting service provider might appear overwhelming .
On the reality check , it 's not so .
This article delivers significant points in this perspective .
Choose a new web hosting provider
Anybody has to consider different aspects while choosing new web hosting provider .
These aspects include an operating system , uptime , bandwidth , disk space requirements and customer service .
Type of operating system ( OS )
It is better to implement the same OS while migrating from one web hosting provider to another .
Migration done will be hassle - free .
OS must not be changed , until and unless there is a valid reason .
If anybody is planning to take an option for new OS , the user must check the OS is being provided by new hosting service provider .
A database such as MySQL or Access is required by the website .
Both Linux and Windows are compatible with MySQL and Access is congenial with Windows only .
When anybody migrates to new OS these points are to be considered .
Disk space and Bandwidth
Bandwidth and disk space are very important features provided by new web hosting provider because speed is affected by former and data storage space are affected by latter .
Analyze whether higher bandwidth and disk space are offered at same cost by a new service provider .
A user has to execute analysis related to cost - benefit .
It will help to make a sensible decision .
Uptime
When user 's website is down then customers will get disturbed and site 's credibility will be impaired .
A web host will end up by losing hundreds and thousands .
New service will provide 100 % uptime , likely less .
Claims are to be verified surely .
When scheduled maintenance is executed check further during peak hours or non-peak hours .
At peak hours , business will like to lose significant revenue and traffic .
Customer service
While choosing new web hosting provider good customer service is important .
Check whether customer service is available always or not , means seven days a week .
They must use phone calls , live chat or SMS .
Faster communication is possible by these options .
A user has to visit the website of web hosting provider to check credibility .
Factors after zeroing on a web hosting provider
Make Back - up of website
Switching t
o new web hosting provider includes ensuring safe website from many hazards such as file loss including HTML files , applications , images , scripts , plugins and so on .
A user should make secure files by making a backup on a separate machine .
One can download all files by using FTP .
Configure email
Ensure to recheck email configuration after migration website to new web hosting provider .
No task leads to email service failure .
DNS propagation and changes
Transfer of new web hosting provider is not complete until updation of DNS and submitted to a new service provider .
Until new service provider assign a temporary IP address .
By this IP address , a user can check the functionality of a website .
Anybody has to ensure for domain name change as per requirement .
This is necessary for communication for a domain registrar .
They advise the procedure to change .
A task will be easy for a user by inbuilt tools of domain registrar .
Internal links should be checked
After completion of the transfer process , internal links should be checked using link checking tools .
All links have to work same as before transition .
Additionally , always check log files and errors and troubleshoot many issues .
Test new website
It is important to recheck the improper working of a website in detail .
Especially , check features of web pages includes forms , plugins , apps etc .
Cancel old account
Subsequent to closing all processes involved in the transition , a user needs to close the account by former web hosting provider .
It is more important to maintain live account backup option till accurate transition will happen .
To convey a message on web pages , requesting visitors must have patience during site downtime because of transition .
It will provide an impression of cause for concerned trouble and will enhance site credibility .
You have so many options when it wants to make online presence on a website .
Shared hosting is a conventional solution which is mostly used for SMBs .
In shared hosting , many websites reside on one web server connected to the Internet .
SiteGeek provides unbiased review and rating of web hosting providers .
When customer transfer domain to iPage , Domain.com automatically adds one year time .
New customers and existing clients can save up to 60 % on each migration of domain .
For transferring domain names customers have to check following points :-
Domains must be registered for at least 60 days and in unlocked status

Employees who take regular periods of long - term sick leave die earlier than their colleagues , a study by the British Medical Journal said today .
Researchers found that workers with more than one absence requiring a doctor 's note on their records were 66 per cent more likely to die prematurely .
And workers who had to stay off work because of psychiatric problems were two and a half more likely to die of cancer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Those who had to take time off because of circulatory disease were the most likely to die before their healthy colleagues .
Researchers found they had a four time higher chance of a premature death .
Workers taking time off as a result of psychiatric diseases were nearly twice as likely to die prematurely , and those who had time away from work for surgery were more than twice as likely .
But employees who suffered musculoskeletal diseases had no increased risk .
The University College London research , published by the BMJ , looked at the sickness records of 6,478 British civil servants .
Study leader Jenny Head told BBC
Online that the link between psychiatric illness and cancer could be due to depressed people failing to visit their doctor early enough .
" We did n't study the reason , but it might be people that tend to be depressed might be less likely to seek help from a doctor or being prone to depression could affect your cancer prognosis or depression might affect adherence to treatment . "
She added : " It would be useful for this information to be collected because we could identify groups with high risk of serious health problems " .

There is one reason most of us do n't learn how to invest , start a business , or even can our own food — we just do n't have the time to do those projects .
Between jobs that force us to work ever - longer hours , and growing duties at home , there never seem to be enough minutes in the day !
I wanted to go deeper , though , so I delved into research to answer two questions :
First , how do we actually use our time ?
And secondly , which activities could be cut down or outsourced to allow time for pursuits we really want ?
Immediately , I assumed that we could outsource housecleaning tasks to free up time for our passions .
I was right : we work on housework an average of 14.7 hours per week , or nearly 765 hours per year !
However , my triumphant post about outsourcing housecleaning work was met with one criticism : “ I simply do n't have the money to do that . ”
What activity , then , could be cut back without incurring a significant cost — and leave us enough time to start a business , make more money , or do something we have always wanted to do ?
I found the answer in a book called Time , Goods , and Well - Being , which uses “ time diaries ” to calculate how much time people are using .
Unfortunately , this book uses time diary studies from the mid-1970's .
But after reading it , I 'm not sure we are all that different today .
Breaking It Down
750 hours a year is 14.42 hours a week , or just over two hours a day .
Besides housework , “ market work ” ( the term the book uses to denote paid - for jobs ) , and sleeping , what activity consumes the most time ?
The answer shocked me :
It 's watching television .
Wait — do n't close this browser window yet !
I 'm not suggesting you give up TV .
I like “ American Idol ” and “ Heroes ” just as much as you do .
Instead , I merely suggest that you change a simple behavior pattern related to watching TV .
There are two types of TV watchers : those who turn on the TV and watch whatever is on , and those who turn on the TV to watch specific programs .
By moving yourself from the first category to the second , you can find 7 - 8 hours a week of extra time .
With that time , you can do those things you seem to continually be putting off :
starting a business
volunteering
taking cooking classes
With a simple investment of as little as $ 10 ( in an old VCR ) or a more high - tech DVR such as TiVo , you can free up hours a week .
( Not to mention that many DVRs allow you to fast - forward through commercials ! )
Once you make the investment in a VCR or TiVo ( consider it an investment in yourself — your time ) , thoughtfully consider which shows you most enjoy .
For instance , my TiVo is set to record every episode of Dr. Phil .
That would be 4 - 5 hours a week of watching Dr. Phil , except that I delete all the episodes I 'm not interested in .
That way I do n't have to worry about what I 've “ missed ” — I can see all of the shows the TiVo has recorded , pick the one I want to watch , watch it , and then turn the TV off !
By making this one simple change , you can free up hundreds of hours of free time a year .
By eventually going “ cold turkey ” , you could free up , on average , over 750 hours a year — enough to learn a foreign language , start a profitable business , or read enough books to make you more educated on a particular subject than 90 % of us .
After implementing this change , I found I watched enough less TV to cut my cable bill from a digital package to Limited Basic , saving me $ 50 / month and still allowing me to record network TV on my TiVo .
I 'm quite happy to have that $ 600 extra a year , but more importantly , I 'm happy to have my time back .
But I Enjoy TV …
Does TV really make you happy ?
There is evidence out there that it does n't .
In Bowling Alone , author Robert D. Putnam cites surveys that show that “ viewers consistently report that television viewing is less satisfying than other leisure activities and even than work . ”
How do you feel after watching a long series of TV shows ?
Chances are , you feel groggy , tired , and perhaps even grumpy .
Since television is mildly addictive , however , it 's hard to give up .
That 's why I do n't recommend going cold turkey .
Try eliminating one show you really do n't care about that much .
Then try strategic viewing — not watching every episode .
Finally , have a goal in mind for those extra hours .
Otherwise , you will easily slip back into watching more TV , since you wo n't have anything else to do .
Schedule dinners with your friends .
Sign up for a class .
Make a date to go to the library or walk outside .
Motivate yourself with a specific , measurable goal — perhaps to lose 10 pounds by the end of the year , or read 12 books in the next 12 months .
Whatever your passions are — this is your chance to let them shine !
What about the Internet ?
Many of you will be reading this right now and saying “ I do n't watch that much TV ! ”
But watch out : an Internet addiction can be just as bad .
Wandering aimlessly around online and watching videos is n't much better than watching TV .
What goals can you set while working online ?
Can you make some extra money ?
Learn HTML ?
Set up a website or blog and keep it going for 3 months ?
If you really want to start a business , or if you have a goal in mind , and you watch TV or surf the Internet mindlessly , you do have time to reach that goal — over 750 hours a year , in fact .
This life is your chance to better the world around you in some way .
What amazing creations can you make with that time ?
What will you do with your newfound 750 hours a year ?
J.D. 's note : I agree with Erica 100 % — you have the time and the knowledge and the resources to pursue your dreams .
All it takes is a few small changes .

The Mossad spy agency cancelled at the last minute a plan to capture notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele in Argentina in 1960 , a former top commander told AFP on Monday .
Rafi Eitan , who is now an Israeli cabinet minister , said the Mossad tracked down Mengele in Buenos Aires while planning the May 1960 capture of Adolf Eichmann , one of the main architects of the Holocaust .
" Mengele was living in Buenos Aires at the same time as Eichmann .
We discovered Eichmann first and we later found Mengele , " Eitan told AFP .
Eichmann Trial
The year silence was broken Ariana Melamed Although it was somewhat of a spectacle , the Eichmann trial allowed survivors to finally voice their cries , making Israelis realize that there are personal , horrible holocausts
The year silence was broken
The Mossad agents in Argentina headed by Eitan knew Mengele 's address and had taken pictures that determined " beyond any doubt " the identity of the former Nazi who had escaped to south America under a new name after World War II .
Several days after Eichmann was snatched and put in hiding in Argentina before being secretly transported to Israel , then - Mossad chief Issar Harel quickly put forward plans to catch Mengele , Eitan said .
" I opposed the plan and said that the two operations should not be carried out together because of the risk of losing Eichmann and because we did not have sufficient knowledge for the Mengele mission , " he said .
Harel agreed to scrap the plan until after Eichmann was brought to Israel , and both the Mossad chief and Eitan intended to return to capture the Angel of Death , said Eitan , now 82 .
But after the successful capture of Eichmann was made public , the mission was aborted .
" It was impossible to keep Eichmann a secret for long because too many people knew about it when we returned to Israel .
" After Eichmann , I returned to Argentina but Mengele was gone and we lost his tracks .
We continued searching in Brazil and Paraguay and were able to find him again and take his pictures .
But we were never able to put our hands on him . "
Mengele earned the nickname " Angel of Death " for his cruel human experiments and for sending tens of thousands of Jews and gypsies to gas chambers and crematoria at the Auschwitz death camp .
He died in Brazil in 1979 and his identity was later confirmed when his DNA was compared to that of his son in 1992 .
Eichmann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity by an Israeli court in 1961 .
He was hanged the following year .
Not the most practical and discrete things around , but surely very catchy and impressive .

Ah .
My first real Erlang effort presented for all to see – http://github.com/mmullis/erlang-macaddr.
It started with the goal of porting the macaddr gem for ruby .
This is all on R12B - 4 so keep that in mind .
Macaddr basically runs an os specific command like ifconfig or ipconfig and attempts to extract out the mac address information from the resulting spewage using a regular expression .
There ’s quite a few posts about how this is not available in Erlang and that the undocumented inet : ifget and inet : getiflist are not really portable .
I hope someone finds it useful .
Ok , so it ’s nothing hard in Ruby but Erlang ended up being more difficult .
Mostly due to the new re module not being quite the same .
I also had to break the code up a bit more in order to isolate different aspects .
I ’m not an Erlang guru either so there ’s probably some dumb code in there and optimizations needed .
Two things I learned in the process of dealing with the re module .
The first is that it is based on PCRE underneath .
To help in debugging , I built the PCRE packakge using the source which is tar . bz2 in the OTP release .
PCRE includes a program called pcretest that will let you run regexes with different data .
It ’s easy enough to figure out .
What you do is validate that PCRE is handling a regex the way you want , and then back up into Erlang .
The second thing I learned is that you have to escape ALL backslashed expressions / assertions so that they pass through Erlang unmodified and get to PCRE .
I was trying to use “ \b ” which is word boundary but it never made it down to PCRE correctly untill it hit me and I tried “ \\b ” .
Eureka !
( yes , one of my favorite shows ) .
The doc for re has a really small blurb in the replace function doc .
Too hidden for me so I sent a request to the erlang - bugs mailing list to make it really clear .
The real time consumer was that the regex that worked fine on windows and linux broke down on macos where there ’s a much longer sequence of “ nn : ” .
This resulted in the exporting of an internal function so I could test it more readily .
Overall , I think it took longer than I would like a small project to take but I ’m picky and wanted to make it reasonably complete with Makefile , eunit tests , git hosting on github , Readme , edoc , clean dialyzer , testing on 3 different platforms ( Linux , Windows Vista , and Mac OSX ) .
It should be a decent structure for my next project .
Digitalization is catapulting its way through the workforce , impacting every sector from security to marketing .
Yet , until recently , one sector has remained stoically the same : the oil industry .
Now , even one of America ’s oldest businesses is catching up with the hype .
But how can technology and oil work together for greater results ?
You might be surprised at the answers .
Analytics
The use of analytics may be one of the opportunities pro-digital fans are most excited about within the oil industry .
They have every reason to be excited : the amount of data oil industries must sift through continually grows , with the information today expected to double within two years .
Consequently , making sense of all the information is much easier with a business analyst , who can track , compare , store and manage the data to find patterns .
It even helps with model creations and maximum potential .
In making sense of this growing amount of information , the business thrives .
The Internet of Things
Having a network of mobile devices that can sync with each other , sharing and sending information , is a priceless addition to the oil and gas industry if it ’s initiated properly .
Today ’s expectancies regarding the price of oil are forcing companies to reduce costs and increase efficiency .
IoT may be the answer .
With IoT , time , labor and communication are optimized .
Consider offshore projects .
They generate about two terabytes of time - sensitive data per day , which takes 12 days to get shared via satellite to a central repository .
Obviously , time is shortened considerably with the integration of IoT .
However , it also encourages remote positions , which cuts on - site labor costs .
Teams located around the world can work together online to prepare for a project , meaning on - site workers are only sent out when everything is prepared .
In fact , implementing IoT could increase the market value over $ 800 billion in the next ten years .
Machine Learning
It ’s one of the most frightening aspects of the digital age to many in the oil industry , but machine learning has the potential to affect just about everything in the sector .
Machine learning can let operators know how deep they need to drill and where , making it useful in oil well testing and even drilling itself .
Sensors can help guide the machinery when drilling horizontally , avoiding rocks that could damage equipment and other hazards .
Machines can even analyze issues to determine if they are false alarms , which saves time and money spent on engineering teams .
These are only a few ways the digital age affects the machines , and it ’s easy to see how these changes affect everything else .
Robotics
Similar to machine learning , robotics eliminates the need for workers in dangerous situations .
The Iron Roughneck is one of the most popular robots in the industry .
It automates the steps for connecting drill pipes in ocean water and oil - bearing rock , drastically improving safety for works on the oil rig .
Although these robots eliminate jobs , their value in increasing efficiency and safety is beneficial to the oil and gas sectors .
Digital Growth in the Oil Industry
From using Cloud services to employing digital robotics , the oil industry can reap the advantages of the digital age .
But businesses are n’t the only ones making out like bandits .

Scientists are working on a special pill which might bring some of the advantages of exercise .
According to a report published in the journal Cell , the researchers in the United States have developed two possible pills that can apparently build muscles , increase the energy level and burn fat .
The tests performed on mice showed that these could run 44 percent further and scientists consider that the pills can have the same effect on people who did n't even move a muscle .
However , such breakthrough might raise concerns due to the fact that the pill could be misused in sport .
Taking this into consideration , the lead researcher Pr Ronald Evans , working at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , and the Salk Institute in California , came up with a test which could indentify the drug in the urine and blood .
Pr Evans says that the new pills could be helpful in combating muscle wasting diseases or serve well for people who are at risk of conditions , including diabetes .
The two pills , dubbed AICAR and GW1516 , have a certain effect on a " master gene " called PPAR - delta , which is able to monitor the activity of many other genes .
Thus , the adjustment of this gene could theoretically have an effect on body building and regulation .
By genetically modifying mice in order to increase the activity of the gene , scientists managed to develop a muscle which could burn more fat than sugar .
The same process led to the creation of " marathon mice " , who could run a longer distance on a treadmill .
Afterwards scientists decided to cause similar effects with the help of drugs , instead of using genetic modification .
The prototype was a pill dubbed GW1516 , which could again create the effect of " fat burning " .
However , it showed not alterations in exercise performance until scientists began training the mice using long treadmill sessions .
At the end of one of the series , scientists noticed that mice that were given the drug ran 77 percent longer than mice that trained without the pill .
The next step was the development of a drug called AICAR who had a somewhat different way of influencing the same muscle cell mechanism .
After taking the drug , the mice did n't need any exercises .
Being only four weeks on the drug , they were able to run 44 percent further on their treadmills .
According to Professor Evans , both drugs may someday serve a purpose in humans .
" If you like exercise , you like the idea of getting ' more bang for your buck ' .
If you do n't like exercise , you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill .
Almost no - one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise - for these people , if there was a way to mimic exercise , it would make the quality of exercise they do more efficient , " he said .
Colin Palmer , a professor of pharmacogenetics at the University of Dundee , claims that the idea of developing " fitness drugs " had proved controversial .
" It 's basically a drug that enhances training .
The thing that raises eyebrows is the concept of a drug that improves endurance training for sports professionals , " said Pr Palmer .

SAN FRANCISCO 
The world 's largest spam e-mail operator has been silenced .
Federal authorities say they 've shut down HerbalKing , a global spam gang responsible for billions of spam messages promoting prescription drugs , " male - enhancement " pills and diet pills .
On Tuesday , a federal court in Chicago , acting on a complaint from the Federal Trade Commission , ordered a halt to its operations , pending trial .
A federal judge said HerbalKing engaged in spamming and deceptive marketing .
Some anti-spam organizations , such as The Spamhaus Project , estimate up to one - third of the world 's spam e-mail came from the group during its heyday this year and last .
According to papers filed in federal court , Lance Atkinson , 26 , who lives in Australia , and Jody Smith of Texas oversaw a vast international operation under four companies they controlled : Inet Ventures , Tango Pay , Click Fusion and TwoBucks Trading .
The FTC alleges Atkinson and Smith are liable for spamming and all claims they have made about their advertised products .
Atkinson allegedly hired spammers from around the world and provided them with text and hyperlinks to websites for his companies .
The spammers were paid by commission , the FTC says .
The unwanted commercial e-mail promoting the websites was relayed via thousands of compromised PCs , often referred to as a botnet .
The spam gang included participants in the U.S. , Australia , New Zealand , China , India , Russia and Canada , according to the FTC .
In June 2005 , the FTC won a $ 2.2 million judgment against Atkinson and another business partner for running a similar spam affiliate program that marketed herbal products .
The shutdown is n't likely , however , to ease the crush of spam , says Paul Ferguson , an advanced threat researcher at computer - security vendor Trend Micro .
" Someone else will fill the void , " Ferguson says .
" While it 's great they caught these guys , the last time a major spam king was busted , the spam increased . "
The FTC says authorities closed the operation by working for months with law - enforcement authorities in Australia and New Zealand , and FBI offices in Chicago and St. Louis , says Steve Baker , director of the Midwest region for the FTC .
The FTC received more than 3 million consumer complaints about the group 's spam messages in the last several months , Baker says .

We level with you :
In the 21st century , there are many different approaches to opinion research : you can ring a respondent ’s home telephone and speak questions into a respondent ’s ear using live operators ; you can ring a respondent ’s home telephone and speak questions into a respondent ’s ear using recorded voice ; you can hand - dial a respondent ’s cell phone and speak questions into a respondent ’s ear ; you can text a single question to a respondent and wait for him to text you back ; you can walk through a neighborhood , ringing random doorbells ; you can stand on a busy street corner and intercept random passersby ; you can conduct a live , in - person focus group ; you can conduct a virtual focus - group , and / or you can interview respondents leveraging the power of the internet , showing respondents questions on their desktop , laptop , tablet , mobile phone , or other electronic device , and allowing respondents to respond at the time and place of their choosing .
Each of these methodologies has unique strengths .
Each of these methodologies has unique limitations .
Way too often , prospective clients come to SurveyUSA asking for a price - quote for a specific methodology .
Metaphorically , it ’s like being a physician and having a patient approach you and ask …
“ What would you charge to attach leeches to me and have them suck my blood ? ”
Who would you rather have as your research partner ?
A junior account exec who looks at the laminated card she was handed at the last company offsite and says , “ That will be $ 183.49 per leech ” … or a principal in a research firm who says , “ Forgive me , but can we talk about why you think that leeches are the right approach in today ’s world ? ”
To extend the metaphor , SurveyUSA often hears back , “ Well , we ’ve always used leeches in this kind of a situation , and it ’s important for us not to introduce a new variable into the equation . ”
SurveyUSA gets an “ F ” grade at holding our tongue .
We lose business when we level with our prospective clients and say , “ We think there may be a better approach than the one you are recommending . ”
That , we feel , is our obligation : to tell prospective clients what realistically is possible given your unique circumstances , your particular budget , and the realities of conducting research in an 8 - second attention - span world .
That is why SurveyUSA does not offer on our website a shopping cart where you click to order and click to pay .
With opinion research , every job is custom ; we choose not to pretend to warehouse our “ best - sellers ” in digital inventory .
Just as one would not use a soup spoon to paddle a canoe nor a butter knife to shovel snow , SurveyUSA will match you with the tool best suited to your project .
Let us level with you .
That ’s a key part of The SurveyUSA Way .
We confess we sometimes offend a prospective client by saying ,
“ That wo n’t work . ”
But we sleep better knowing we do n’t just go along for the ride when the client is headed in the wrong direction .

From forgotten scandals to " The Last Dick , " read the entire Daily Beast Farewell to Bush Chronicles .
Governor Ann Richards has the last laugh .
If only Ann Richards were around today to say , “ I told you so . ”
With the U.S. economy in meltdown mode , a campaign commercial made 14 years ago suddenly seems painfully prophetic .
In 1994 , when George W. Bush was challenging Ann Richards to become governor of Texas , she deployed the slogan “ Can we afford the business experience of George W. Bush ? ”
In a television commercial that became notorious in the race , she ticked off a list of failed companies Bush had been associated with — from Arbusto to Harken Energy — and concluded the companies ’ collective losses totaled $ 371.6 million .
Richards lost the election and Bush went on to become President of the world ’s largest economy .
But with the markets plunging , and a $ 700 billion government bailout underway , Richards , who passed away in 2006 , would have some new losses to add to her tally .
Here ’s a flashback to Richard ’s findings .

The George Bush Index of Economic Ruin
1. Caterair
As an M.B.A. from Harvard University , Bush was championing his record as a businessman in his race against Richards , since the only political experience he had was a failed Congressional campaign in 1978 , and some stints as an adviser to his father .
Richard ’s commercial bashing his business record was timely because Caterair , an airline catering company , had just announced it was near bankruptcy — and Bush had sat on its board of directors for five years .
Caterair was bought out by an Arlington , Texas - based competitor .
2. Arbusto
In 1977 , after finishing Harvard , Bush used $ 17,000 remaining in his educational fund set up by his parents to found an oil company in Midland , Texas named Arbusto ( that ’s Spanish for bush ) .
His uncle Jonathan Bush , a Manhattan - based stockbroker who described his recently - graduated nephew as “ an absolute star , ” sent a bevy of successful businessmen to invest in Bush ’s company — Lewis B. Lehrman , George L. Ball , William H. Draper , John D. Macomber , Russell S. Reynolds .
But despite being located in the Oil Patch , one of the most oil - rich areas of Texas if not the nation , Bush hit nothing but dry wells , losing millions .
Soon people started calling Arbusto El Busto .
3. Bush Exploration
Sensitive to such jokes — and intent on capitalizing on his family ’s name now that his father had become vice president under Ronald Reagan — Bush changed his company ’s name to Bush Exploration .
In 1982 , in what The New York Times called “ the biggest miscalculation of his business career , ” Bush decided to take his company public .
The offering was a disaster , raising a mere $ 1.1 million of an announced $ 6 million .
“ I really realized I had made somewhat of a strategic error , ” Bush said at the time .
4. Spectrum 7
Bush Exploration continued to flounder , so in 1984 Bush merged his company with Spectrum 7 Energy Corporation , a Cincinnati - based drilling concern .
That company flatlined as well , and when the oil market collapsed in 1986 — oil dropped below $ 10 a barrel — Spectrum 7 merged with Harken Energy .
Bush received 212,152 shares of Harken stock valued at $ 530,380 — all for running oil companies that , so far , had lost money for investors .
5. Harken Energy
After Bush ’s father was elected president in 1988 , some business came to Harken simply because Bush was who he was .
In 1990 , Harken received a contract to drill for oil in Bahrain , located in the Middle East on the Persian Gulf — a contract Harken got most likely because Bush ’s father was president .
Of the two wells Harken drilled in Bahrain , both came up dry .
“ Can you believe it ? ” a Texas political insider commented .
“ George W. goes to the Middle East and he can’t even hit oil there .
Midas he is not . ”
Maybe , but that did n’t keep Bush from making money for himself .
On June 22 , 1990 , Bush sold 212,140 shares of Harken stock at $ 4 a share for $ 848,560 — a mere eight days before a second quarter loss of $ 23.2 million was announced , which caused the stock price to drop to $ 2.37 a share .
Even though Bush served on the company ’s audit committee , he claimed he knew nothing about the looming bad quarterly report and was not guilty of insider trading .
6. The Texas Rangers
Bush sold the Harken stock so he could buy a small percentage — just 1.8 percent — of the Texas Rangers baseball team .
Despite his tiny ownership position , he was named a managing partner in part so he could be the “ face ” of the franchise for public relation purposes .
It was the first business in his career that ended up being successful .
He had little to do with the financial management of the team .
7. The U.S. Economy
During the Bush presidency , the national debt has more than doubled and the country has seen the worst financial crisis since The Great Depression .

Forget everything you knew about wrestling legend Jake " the Snake " Roberts -- all that appears to remain is Jake the Junkie .
Play video content
TMZ has obtained extremely disturbing footage of the former WWF superstar -- and former substance abuse rehab patient -- self - destructing during a live benefit event in Ohio over the weekend .
The footage shows a stumbling , overweight , rambling Roberts struggling to form a coherent sentence , while addressing the crowd moments before his match in the Firestorm Pro Wrestling league .
But the story behind the scenes is even more tragic .
According to several sources , the 53 - year - old legend was found passed out backstage moments before he was scheduled to perform .
We 're told when Snake was woken up , he was aggressive , violent and asking for " an 8 - ball . "
We 're also told nearly two dozen empty airplane bottles of vodka were found by his gear .
During the match , Roberts was clearly unable to perform , barely responding to the barrage of " fake blows " he received from the other wrestler , J.T. Lightning .
Around one minute into the match , Roberts ' opponent -- clearly frustrated with the situation -- whispers to the ref to end the fight .
Afterwards , Lightning grabbed the mic and told Roberts , " I 've wrestled drug addicts ... you are a piece of s**t , Snake .
You gypped these people .
F**k you . "
After the verbal assault , Jake pulled down the front of his pants and exposed his penis to the crowd .
Backstage , the madness continued .
People close to the situation tell us Snake broke his hand punching a wall , then ran into the street crying .
An ambulance and police were called to the scene , but Roberts , who refused medical treatment , was not arrested .

Outlook vs Gmail : Which One Is Right for You ?
Did you know that Outlook lets you know if you forgot to attach a file ?
Are you looking to explore the differences between the email providers of Outlook and Gmail ?
In this article , explore whether you should go with Outlook vs Gmail for the right email fit .
Read on to see the similarities , differences , and find out which will take your email services to new heights !
What Is Outlook ?
Outlook is an email program from Microsoft .
It allows you to send and receive emails .
You can now have Microsoft Outlook as a stand - alone option , or as a package .
What Is Gmail ?
Gmail is a free email service by Google .
They offer the option to automatically organize messages that are related to each other .
For Gmail to remain free , they do have ads .
They ’ll take a look at your messages , and show you ads based on them .
They promise that user information is protected and that the ads wo n’t be bothersome .
Searches
Do you ever find yourself needing to do a search within your inbox ?
Gmail will let you search through old emails while writing a new one .
The problem with Gmail in this respect is you wo n’t have dates , previews , and most of the subject you ’re searching for .
Unfortunately , you ca n’t change the size of your search bar , new message , or inbox to see them all at once .
Outlook offers a cleaner process .
It gives you a double panel option .
Even with the double panel option , your inbox still gets cut off at the top .
You have the option to switch your Outlook to a single - pane to look more like Gmail .
To do this , you ’ll go to settings and choose display settings .
Next , choose to hide the reading pane .
Design
When doing a comparison of designs , it ’s subjective .
Presently , Gmail ’s design is more attractive to many , and Outlook ’s a bit more dated .
Productivity
Whether for work or at the office , you want the option to cut down on clutter in your inbox .
Gmail offers different add-ins and extensions you can have to make sure your inbox is clutter - free .
Crystal Knows is an app that can tell you about someone ’s personality with public - data .
Right Inbox is an app that has everything from customizable templates to signature management .
Outlook email preview has many options as well .
One app is called Evernote .
This will help you with note - taking and saving time on projects .
Another option is FindTime .
This helps you find a time slot available for all attendees to attend a meeting .
Storage
Microsoft Outlook allows you 15 GB of free storage , and so does Gmail .
The free storage for Gmail includes both Google Drive and Gmail .
Google now offers unlimited storage of photos , but with certain limits .
You can always buy more storage as well .
Gmail does limit the size of an attachment though .
It also takes longer to upload an image .
With Gmail , you can only upload one photo at a time .
Since the images are shown as thumbnails , you can double - check that you ’re sending the correct images .
Spam Filters
Outlook ’s spam filtering does n’t seem as advanced as Gmail .
There are some features that it has that Gmail does n’t .
It has a feature called Sweep .
Sweep can delete emails , and block future messages from a certain person .
Gmail does a great job spam filtering .
It occasionally might let a spam email slip through .
It can normally detect unwanted emails that are n’t spam .
Ads shown will match your email content though .
The ads are normally placed into the promotions or social tabs so they do n’t interrupt your inbox viewing .
Calendar Integrations
When doing a comparison of Outlook versus Gmail , it ’s important to know that you ca n’t view your email and calendar side - by - side .
You do have the option to sync events with your calendar though .
The Outlook toolbar will bring you to a new window for your calendar .
Gmail will allow you to keep your inbox open .
It ’ll add a new tab or window for your calendar .
User Experience
If you ’re looking for a bigger font in emails , Gmail is the way to go .
Gmail also has a shading option with many of their templates .
When you read an email , a darker shade will appear on that message .
Unread emails will have their subject and sender in bold .
For Outlook , they ’ll have the subject and sender in blue .
While it ’s bolded , it ’s harder to see since the font is smaller .
For flagging an email , Outlook will highlight it yellow .
Gmail also has different flagging options .
In Gmail , you ca n’t search your inbox for the symbols .
It ’s easier to find a read email in Outlook than Gmail .
Security
Outlook lets you have a two - step authentication .
If you ’re logging in on a new device , Outlook will ask you for a security code .
Gmail also offers two - step authentication .
While they both offer it , Gmail had this feature much sooner than Outlook .
Outlook will show images but is now better at finding harmful messages .
Gmail has you take a few extra steps to view an image .
The Winner ?
The winner is entirely subjective and up to what you ’re looking for .
If you ’re looking for a sleek design with easy readability , go with Gmail .
If you ’re looking for easier access to viewing images in emails , go with Outlook .
A Brief Comparison of Outlook vs Gmail
After doing a comparison of Outlook vs Gmail , you should have a better idea of which is the right fit for you .

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have developed a " microscalpel " that targets individual cells while preserving other cells around the target area .
This microscalpel would allow surgeons to work on tissue one cell at a time , targeting disease while leaving healthy cells alive .
The device combines two technologies - a femtosecond laser and two - photon fluorescence microscopy - into a single miniaturized probe .
With the ability to target single cells in three - dimensional space , the probe can penetrate up to 250 micrometers per tissue .
According to mechanical engineering Assistant Professor Adela Ben - Yakar at The University of Texas at Austin , " You can remove a cell with high precision in 3 - D without damaging the cells above and below it , " she says .
" And you can see , with the same precision , what you are doing to guide your microsurgery . "
The top photo is of Adela Ben - Yakar , inventor of the " microscalpel " , at work in her lab .
The middle image is a ' before ' picture of a breast cancer cell and the last image is the ' after ' picture , where the cell was destroyed by the probe .
From the Utexas website : " Femtosecond lasers produce extremely brief , high - energy light pulses that sear a targeted cell so quickly and accurately the lasers ' heat has no time to escape and damage nearby healthy cells .
As a result , the medical community envisions the lasers ' use for more accurate destruction of many types of unhealthy material .
These include small tumors of the vocal cords , cancer cells left behind after the removal of solid tumors , individual cancer cells scattered throughout brain or other tissue and plaque in arteries . "
Surgery requiring high precision could benefit from this , such as destroying cancer cells scattered throughout the brain or operating on delicate tissue like vocal cords without damaging them .

You are working on your project in Haskell .
You notice the performance is not as great as it could be .
Here ’s what you can do , apart from writing more efficient Haskell code .
Profiling
First , of course , you have to profile your code to know what ’s really slow and not .
Using GHC , compile your program with - prof - auto - all .
$ ghc - O2 -- make Project.hs - prof - auto - all
Does n’t work ?
Then you probably have to recompile the extra libraries you ’re using ( perhaps from Hackage ) .
These libraries most certainly use the Cabal build system .
Pass -- enable - library - profiling to configure then build and install as usual .
$ cd / to / the / library / source $ runghc Setup.hs configure -- enable - library - profiling $ runghc Setup.hs build $ runghc Setup.hs install
Do n’t worry , this will not mess up the current installation , it will just add a special profiling version of the library next to the regular version .
You can now test your code .
$ Project +RTS -p
The GHC profiler is competent and can profile both time and space .
With -p , we ’re profiling time .
The output is a file , Project .
prof .
It has lots of interesting stuff in it , most importantly a list with the functions that take the most time .
In our fictional example , the profiler tells us the program spends most of its time in the function dctiv , the DCT - IV transform .
dctiv :: Int -> [ Double ] -> [ Double ] dctiv points input = ...
This is probably a typical function you want to write in a low level language .
It is used a lot , and is basically number crunching .
Of course , a Haskell wizard can probably whip up a DCT - IV with performance very close to C .
So we use the DCT - IV only because it 's simple to implement , not because it is a domain C solves better than Haskell .
Let ’s write C !
Most modern programming languages have facilities for invoking code written in other languages , and so does Haskell .
But we worry about that later ; let ’s write a small C library first .
#ifndef DCTIV_H # define DCTIV_H void dctiv ( int points , double * in , double * out ) ; #endif
void dctiv ( int points , double * in , double * out ) { /*
What this does is not really important , other than it does n't do side effects , and writes the output to out .
*/ int k , n ; double sum ; for ( k = 0 ; k < points ; k ++ ) { sum = 0.0 ; for ( n = 0 ; n < points ; n ++ ) sum += in [ n ] * cos (( PI / points ) * ( n + 0.5 ) * ( k + 0.5 ) ) ; out [ k ] = sum ; } }
Build an object file :
$ gcc - O2 -c dctiv.c
It ’s probably a good idea to write a small test program and see if the little C library behaves as expected .
$ gcc -o testprogram test .c dctiv.o
Let ’s write Haskell !
With C !
To use our C code from Haskell we ’re going to use the FFI – the Foreign Function Interface .
This is an addendum to the Haskell 98 standard .
Using FFI is quite pleasant , especially if we begin with pure Haskell code that we later port to C .
This means we can design the C code with purity in mind .
To use FFI , we have to tell the compiler via a pragma at the top of the source code .
We ’ll also use a bunch of libraries with functions useful for calling foreign code .
The top of the program will look like this :
> {-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-} > import Foreign .C.Types > import Foreign .
Ptr > import Foreign .
Marshal .
Array > import System .IO .
Unsafe
Foreign .C.Types and Foreign .
Ptr have functions for working with primitive C types and pointers .
Foreign .
Marshal .
Array is for converting between Haskell types and C arrays .
System .IO .
Unsafe is explained further below .
Next we ’re going to import a function from the compiled C library .
We ca n’t use the regular import keyword , instead we use foreign import , and tell Haskell which library we ’re interested in , the function we want to use , and what the function looks like :
> foreign import ccall " dctiv.h dctiv " > c_dctiv :: CInt -> > Ptr CDouble -> > Ptr CDouble -> > IO ()
Syntax aside the only weird stuff here is the last return value .
Our C function returns void , so using ( ) makes sense .
But what about the IO ?
The code will explicitly change regions of memory , and passing two identical pointers may not mean the contents of the pointers are the same .
The function c_dctiv is low level , and it does n’t look like the pure dctiv function we ’re replacing at all !
That ’s what we ’re going to fix now .
The purpose of the Foreign .
Marshal .
Array library is to convert between Haskell types and C arrays .
We ’re going to use three functions : withArray takes a Haskell list and writes it to memory , so it can be passed to C functions .
allocaArray temporarily allocates memory our C - code can write to .
peekArray takes some memory and returns a Haskell list .
Here ’s an intermediate function that calls c_dctiv for us .
> dctivIO :: Int -> [ CDouble ] -> IO [ CDouble ] -- 1 > dctivIO points input -- 2 > = withArray input $ \ cinput -> -- 3 > allocaArray points $ \ coutput -> -- 4 > do c_dctiv ( fromIntegral points ) cinput coutput -- 5 > peekArray points coutput -- 6
This function is short , and you can intuitively guess what it does by looking at what ’s passed to the C function .
The Marshal .
Array functions have funky types though , and the code looks slightly arcane .
Lets look at the type of withArray as an example to see what 's going on :
withArray :: Storable a => [ a ] -> ( Ptr a -> IO b ) ->
IO b
The Storable type class is meant for types that can be written to memory .
All C types are instances of Storable , which makes sense .
withArray takes a Haskell list [ a ] , writes it into memory , and then passes the pointer to this memory to a function which is executed .
allocaArray too does something with memory and passes it to another function , and these functions are chained together until we 're done with the foreign code .
In English , what dctivIO does is the following :
At line 3 , withArray takes the CDouble list as input and writes it to memory .
It passes the memory location to a new function , that extends all the way down line 6 .
In this function , the memory location is bound to cinput .
From now on we can treat cinput as a double *.
At line 4 , allocaArray allocates an array of points elements , which will hold the output .
The newly allocated array is passed to yet another function , where it gets bound to coutput when executed .
allocaArray will free the memory when it ’s done .
The last two lines form an IO block .
At line 5 we run our C function c_dctiv , not forgetting to convert our Int to a CInt .
The output of c_dctiv will be written to coutput .
The last line of the function simply returns a Haskell list ( in IO ) from the array coutput of length points .
dctivIO is a much more useful and Haskell - like function than the raw c_dctiv , but it ’s still not good enough .
We want something of type Int -> [ Double ] -> [ Double ] , not this hack with C- types and IO .
Despite the detail that memory is allocated within withArray , the C function dctiv is really pure .
It does n’t write to files , change state or anything ; it does the exact same thing like our pure Haskell version .
withArray et al does n’t know this though , and that ’s why we had to work in IO .
As we know dctiv does n’t really have any side effects , we can purify it using unsafePerformIO from System .
IO .
Unsafe , which has the magical type IO a -> a .
At the same time we add some code to convert between CDouble and Double .
> dctiv :: Int -> [ Double ] -> [ Double ] > dctiv points input = > let cinput = map realToFrac input > coutput = unsafePerformIO ( dctivIO points cinput ) > output = map realToFrac coutput > in output
And we ’re done .
As the Marshal .
Array - functions have to consume the input lists when they are written to memory , converting from the two Double types do no significant harm .
To compile this code , GHC has to know about the C library .
$ ghc - O2 dctiv . o -- make Project.hs
You can even test your code in GHCI , like this :
$ ghci Project .hs dctiv.o
Conclusion
The speed improvement of writing parts of a program in a low level language will of course depend on the task , and how good you are at writing efficient Haskell ( and C ) .
For some applications the speed up can be substantial , and learning the basics of FFI can be a good investment .
For more information about FFI and Profiling , here are some more in - depth resources :
The excellent Real World Haskell has chapters on both profiling and the FFI .
HaskellWiki has several articles on FFI and profiling .
There 's also the venerable documentation .
The victim in Johnnie ’s case , who was sexually assaulted in a park , mistakenly identified him in a photo lineup in which Johnnie was pictured shirtless , just as her attacker was .
What ’s more , the police sent her the photos in the mail – not exactly sound police procedure .
Johnnie maintained his innocence throughout his entire ordeal .
He went before the Texas parole board seven times , and seven times he refused to say he was guilty of the crime , even when it could have meant his release from prison .
As it turns out , Johnnie was at work pressing pants at a commercial laundry when the attack occurred , and he had time cards to back up his alibi .
But no one believed him – not the police , not the prosecutors , not the jury , not the judges who heard his appeals , and not the parole board – until post - conviction DNA testing proved his innocence .
During his incarceration , Johnnie wrote six letters to the Dallas District Attorney ’s office requesting DNA testing .
None of his letters were answered until Craig Watkins took over as District Attorney last year .
Once the DNA test was done , he was immediately excluded as the attacker – something that could have been done years earlier .
Thanks in part to Watkins ’ professionalism , Dallas County leads the nation with the most DNA exonerations .
There is a real price to be paid for delays like this .
In August , police in Michigan announced that they had identified the real perpetrator in a 1994 rape for which Ken Wyniemko had been wrongfully convicted and later exonerated .
But by the time the discovery was made the statute of limitations had run out , and the perpetrator could not be prosecuted .
Stories like Ken ’s are a real wake - up call to our criminal justice system .
My organization , The Justice Project , recently issued a series of recommendations to improve access to post - conviction DNA testing that should be adopted by every state in the country .
The recommendations include a requirement to preserve all biological evidence throughout a defendant ’s sentence ; to allow petitions for DNA testing regardless of a defendant ’s plea , confession or the nature of the crime ; and that states should pay for DNA testing and provide legal counsel for indigents who ca n’t afford to pay for it themselves .
To view these and other recommendations , please visit our website at www.thejusticeproject.org.
Delaying or denying access to post - conviction DNA testing for people with claims of innocence is simply wrong , and we should n’t tolerate a criminal justice system that refuses to use readily available technology to correct its mistakes .
We must take the necessary steps to make post - conviction DNA testing more accessible .
Ask Johnnie Lindsey .
He ’ll tell you it ’s worth it .
Kirk Noble Bloodsworth is the first person sentenced to death row in the United States to be exonerated by DNA evidence .
He is the program officer of The Justice Project , a nonpartisan organization that works to increase fairness and accuracy in the criminal justice system , with a focus on the capital punishment system .
Many people have a general familiarity to the obvious symptoms of stroke complications : paralysis , thinking and concentration deficits , speech problems , emotional difficulties , and daily living problems .
However , many are unaware of the possible pain complications .
A 29 year old stroke victim in the magazine Stroke Connection provided vivid detail of his stroke pain ,
Someone is ripping at my arm , hand , face and foot with razorblades constantly .
My fingers are made of metal worms that move constantly .
My arm and other bones are broken and sticking out of my skin …
I know that ’s difficult to imagine , but it ’s difficult to explain the evil , horrific , non - stop ripping , clawing , beating , burning , …on and on …and it never stops , even for one second , it ’s constant and will not stop and you endure it for the rest of your life !
This condition , central pain syndrome , is a neurological condition caused by damage to or dysfunction of the central nervous system ( CNS ) , which includes the brain , brainstem , and spinal cord .
It is characterized by sensory changes and nerve pain .
In addition to stroke , central pain syndrome can be seen with multiple sclerosis , tumors , epilepsy , brain or spinal cord trauma , or Parkinson ’s disease
Central pain syndrome is unexpected and bewildering to family members , caretakers , and even the stroke patient .
Before them is a limb with little motion that is supposed to be devoid of feeling , yet these very same extremities are transmitting intense sensation .
The pain is usually constant , may be moderate to severe in intensity , and is often made worse by touch , movement , emotions , and temperature changes , usually cold temperatures .
Individuals experience one or more types of pain sensations , the most prominent being burning .
Along with the burning may be pressing , lacerating , or aching pain ; sensations of “ pins and needles ” ; and brief , intolerable bursts of sharp pain similar to the pain caused by an exposed nerve .
Individuals may have numbness and burning in the areas affected by the pain , especially in the hands or the feet .
With the onset of the symptoms more than a month after the stroke , there is much confusion .
The symptoms may be misinterpreted as depression or a reaction to a life jarring event .
True enough , stroke is a life altering situation , but the pain described or experienced is real .
The increase in soldiers with traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has focused more attention and research on the condition .
Treatment at this time is limited .
It includes use of antidepressants , anticonvulsants , narcotics , and anti-arrhythmics .
The drug of first choice is the antidepressant amitriptyline .
Newer techniques such as vestibular stimulation ( introduction of water to the inner ear ) have shown promising results in pain relief .

Stiff cancellation fees are “ now more commonplace , ” said Scott Booker , the chief hotel expert at Hotels.com , the online hotel site of Expedia Inc .

“ As a consumer , you have to really look out for that kind of stuff , ” he said .
Mr. Booker said that hotels are looking to raise revenue with “ not just cancellation fees , but extra-person fees , resort fees , parking fees and Internet fees . ”
With more business trips likely to be canceled or modified at the last minute in the current uncertain economic climate , it is increasingly important to read the fine print .
Had I known that the St. Regis in Aspen confiscated the full two - day rate , I would simply have made a reservation elsewhere .
Years ago , after business travelers complained loudly about the proliferation of fees , many hotels reduced or eliminated some of them .
But that is changing again and extra fees are coming back , Mr. Booker said .
“ It ’s kind have been floating under the radar a bit because the spotlight has been on the airline industry , ” he said .
“ But it ’s definitely happening in the hotel business as well . ”
Mr. Booker said that 24 to 48 hours before check - in time is usually the deadline for canceling without charge at hotels that do charge a cancellation fee .
Hotels .com does business with about 70,000 hotels worldwide and , for those who book through the site , “ we will act as an advocate in your behalf ” in negotiating with a hotel over any disputed charge or fee , he said .
Joe Brancatelli , who publishes the business travel Web site Joe SentMe.com , said that some hotels had become more aggressive in adding extra charges .
“ Hotels saw the airlines getting away with it , and they ’re just doing what airlines do , ” he said .
Are you ready for one very sweet and complete optics package ?
For anyone who does astronomy outreach work , is interested in practicing binocular astronomy or is just looking for a great teaching tool , I ’ve got something you really need to take a look at … the Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit .
When I first spied the Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit I was researching for inexpensive binoculars to supply to our guests at the Observatory .
It is not uncommon during a public night or an outreach program to have a hundred or more guests and one or two pairs of binoculars does n’t go very far .
My goal was to find something a non-profit organization could afford , priced so that we could get several pairs , and geared towards performance so our guests were n’t disappointed with the view and our binocular astronomy program .
Since the introduction of the green laser pointer a few years ago , I quickly learned that even a novice ( right down to my four and five year old grandchildren ) can follow the visible beam to where you target it , to its end with binoculars .
Then the beam is switched off and the object is in the binoculars !
With a mind for safety , it ’s a simple and fun way to teach anyone to use binoculars for deep sky observing .
But the green laser was n’t what I was after …
It was the binoculars , was n’t it ?
Another aspect of the binocular astronomy classes we give is providing a monthly star chart to our guests that highlights a few objects for them to locate on their own .
It ’s just a simple handout – one I print out at home before any program and we stand around in the dark and share a red flashlight as I teach them how to read it and point out the marker stars with the green laser .
Yep .
We share the red flashlight …
A simple tool that should be in the hands of every single person that even remotely takes an interest in reading an astronomy chart outside at night …
And one that I just do n’t happen to have ten extra to pass around .
But the red flashlights was n’t what I was after …
It was the binoculars , was n’t it ?
So , back to basics .
I needed multiple pairs of binoculars that could withstand hard use and perform well .
After many years , and many pairs of personal binoculars , I ’d love to put Nikon , Oberwerk or Fujinons in every one ’s hands , but the reality check is not every one ’s hands are ready for these types of binoculars .
What I needed was something I knew from experience that could withstand being dropped , was water - proofed and provided an excellent view .
In that case , experience tells me Celestron and are great all - purpose astronomy binoculars 10×50 .
So , here I am … Staring at the Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit for $ 59 and then the reality check really comes home .
For this price I can order five …
And get five pairs of binoculars , five green laser pointers and five red flashlights …
All for about what five pairs of binoculars would cost !
Click .
Ordered .
After they arrived , it was time to put them to the test , eh ?
And now we ’re not just talking the “ Tammy Test ” we ’re talking about the multi-person , multi-use , how long will these kits hold up type of test .
Here ’s my first group – the Ohio Military Police .
There was n’t just three of them either – there were over three hundred .
Needless to say , not one of them had a problem using the binoculars or with focusing them .
Out of all of them that I interviewed , no one had issues with astigmatism on any of the binoculars and the lasers pointers and flashlights all performed equally well .
These tests were carried out over two days and those binoculars were used hard , folks …
No wimpy care , here .
On we go , eh ?
How about your average scout troop ?
Now we ’re talking young hands …
Hands that ca n’t be trusted on their own with the green lasers , but the leaders can .
In this case , we can easily do a presentation where we can point out constellations with the green lasers and responsible adults can also assist in the program by pointing out particular stars or objects for us to name .
By having several flashlights available , small groups of kids can work together with charts and adults at the same time to learn constellations on their own .
When it ’s time to practice astronomy , we use the same “ follow the beam ” trick , they learn and have a great time !
Still more ?
Then try thirty plus groups a year that look like this .
Wild teens and sometimes sedate adults who come here to learn about astronomy .
Telescopes are great and we share those , too .
But nothing takes the cake like having your own pair of binoculars in hand – or having a green laser to point at something when you have a question .
So , how did the Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit perform in all of these situations ?
The binoculars are still going strong , folks .
After all that use , not one single pair of them has shown any signs of a problem .
The red flashlights are all still working on the original batteries and so are the green lasers .
However , the green lasers are not extremely powerful and not very bright during situations like dusk or full Moon .
At the same time , compared to other lasers in my possession , they do a fine job and should not be discounted .
After all , the laser and flashlight are almost like getting them for free when you buy the binoculars !
In the long run the Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit is an exceptional bargain at $ 59 and one I highly recommend .
As a matter of a fact , I recommend it so much that OPT is even going to give one to a lucky Universe Today reader to keep so you can test it out yourself !
From now until October 7 , 2008 at 12:00 pm PDT you can send an email with the title of this review in the subject line and your name in the body of the email and Universe Today will randomly choose a winner to get your own Celestron Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit for free !
No matter where you live …
Put ’em to the test and see if you do n’t agree .
The Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit is an exceptionally rugged and good performing astronomy binocular and having a red flashlight and green laser is a huge bonus .
The Celestron 10X50 UpClose Binoculars and Green Laser Pointer Optics Kit were purchased for this review from OPT and a free kit will be provided to a randomly chosen winner by Oceanside Photo and Telescope .
It is also extremely easy to generate a war file from a rails project .
I should admit that there is about one hour learning curve before you get to that point while in groovy it is easier .
Competition between grails and rails / jruby frameworks only benefits the developers who are using those technologies .
At this stage I should say that rails is much more mature than grails .

You ’d be hard pressed to find a more humble , genuine top - level fighter than UFC lightweight contender Mac Danzig .

In all the talk about the vice - presidential debate , there was an issue that did not get much attention but kept nagging at us : Sarah Palin ’s description of the role and the responsibilities of the office for which she is running , vice president of the United States .
In Thursday night ’s debate , Ms. Palin was asked about the vice president ’s role in government .
She said she agreed with Dick Cheney that “ we have a lot of flexibility in there ” under the Constitution .
And she declared that she was “ thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president also , if that vice president so chose to exert it . ”
It is hard to tell from Ms. Palin ’s remarks whether she understands how profoundly Dick Cheney has reshaped the vice presidency  as part of a larger drive to free the executive branch from all checks and balances .
Nor did she seem to understand how much damage that has done to American democracy .
Mr. Cheney has shown what can happen when a vice president  a position that is easy to lampoon and overlook  is given free rein by the president and does not care about trampling on the Constitution .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The best test of whether the government ’s $ 700 billion check will be enough to save the U.S. economy is how much of that money flows back to consumers and companies .

Even if the government gets Congressional approval this week to buy bad debts off banks ’ books , satisfying some of their cash needs , the financial sector will still need to raise money -- and investors have n’t exactly been lining up to help .
Unless banks can find funding somewhere , they wo n’t be eager to resume lending , and that will leave the economy sputtering .
The good news is , outside of the financial sector , Corporate America is remarkably cash - rich with some $ 620 billion sitting on the books of large firms , so companies should be primed to spend once confidence is restored .
But household wealth has taken an unprecedented double hit from the real estate and stock market shocks , and it could be years before consumers feel flush again -- particularly if credit conditions remain tight .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson argued on Sunday that opening up federal coffers to Wall Street would benefit Main Street by preventing a deeper economic downturn .
“ Last week as the credit markets were frozen , the capital markets were frozen , we had a situation where American companies were n’t able to borrow money , ” Paulson said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” .
“ This could ultimately affect small banks , loans to businesses , loans to farmers , jobs , people ’s retirement . ”
U.S. companies have cut more than 550,000 jobs this year , sending the unemployment rate up to a five - year high of 6.1 percent in August .
Those figures are likely to worsen in the coming months , with or without a bailout .
The housing market is at the root of the year - long financial crisis , and some members of Congress -- expressing concern that Paulson was taking a roundabout route to helping homeowners -- are expected to push for more direct mortgage assistance when they hammer out terms of the bailout legislation this week .
“ I ’ve talked to Secretary Paulson , and I ’ve told him that while his plan is a foundation and we certainly have to do something , we need changes in it relating to housing , ” New York Sen. Charles Schumer said on Fox News Sunday .
Federal Reserve “ Chairman ( Ben ) Bernanke -- no less than he -- said if you do n’t solve the mortgage crisis , you ’re not going to solve the financial crisis .
We need to put the taxpayers first , ahead of bondholders , shareholders , executives , ” Schumer said .
Lawmakers and the administration will get the latest readings on the housing market this week as they hash out the Paulson proposal .
Sales of both new and existing homes likely fell in August , according to Reuters polling data , and the pace of transactions remains near the slowest in more than a decade .
HOUSE REPAIRS
Shoring up the housing market means ensuring that would - be buyers can get mortgages , and that means banks will have to find a way to keep lending .
Even before this latest bout of financial market unrest , a Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers showed that credit conditions were tightening , even for borrowers with good credit histories .
“ The U.S. banking system needs a lot more capital , ” said Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs .
“ Capital infusions are needed to avert a sharp contraction in lending . ”
Hatzius said three things needed to happen in order to resolve the crisis .
First , banks must figure out the true value of assets on their balances sheets ; then they must raise more capital ; and finally , home loans needed to be restructured .
The government ’s bailout plan in effect addresses the first point by establishing a price for hard - to - value assets , and Congress may tackle the third issue this week .
Raising more capital wo n’t be easy .
Lehman Brothers failed last week because it could n’t find investors .
Getting $ 700 billion in bad debts off banks ’ books will certainly help , but it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to convince investors that it is safe to put their money in financial firms .
If the government ’s money succeeds in helping Wall Street strike a healthy balance between fear and greed , U.S. companies are well - positioned to fund a strong recovery once they are confident that the economy is on the mend .
The Standard & Poor ’s industrials , a group of 368 large companies that excludes banks , insurers , utilities and transportation firms , held about $ 620 billion in cash and short - term securities as of June 30 , according to data compiled by S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt .
That was roughly the same amount that they had in March 2007 , before the financial market crisis mushroomed .
Since then , companies have cut back on dividend increases , share repurchases and expansion , essentially hoarding cash because of concern about the state of the economy .
“ They ’ve got money , ” Silverblatt said .
“ They ’re not spending it yet . ”
Ultrasonic waves focus to form a ' shape ' in air The power of ultrasonic waves has been harnessed to produce " virtual " objects in mid-air .
The field of haptics - integrating computing and the sense of touch - has been around for some time but has required gloves or mechanical devices to impart a sense of feeling .
Now , a team of Japanese researchers has developed a system that uses focused ultrasound to do the job .
Its inventors may soon commercialise the approach .
Sense and sensibility
With the expansion in multimedia on the web , our eyes and ears are flooded with sensory information , but the sense of touch has been largely left behind .
The popularity of vibrating gaming handsets has proven that it is a rich but untapped way to increase interaction .
Takayuki Iwamoto and colleagues from the University of Tokyo have now demonstrated a simple haptic device that employs a number of ultrasonic transducers , which emit ultrasound .
Sound is a pressure wave , meaning that as the inaudible sound waves from each of the transducers interfere , they can create a focal point that is perceived as a solid object .
The team 's prototype system includes a camera which tracks the position of a user 's hand and shifts the output from the transducers to move the focus around with the hand .
The result is a feeling of tracing the edge or surface of the virtual object .
At the moment , the system provides a small force only in the vertical dimension , but the team is improving the geometry of the array and the amount of power it can produce so that future devices will provide a stiffer feel and more contoured objects .
It 's great to have something that you can just walk up and use
Stephen Brewster Prof Iwamoto envisions marrying the approach with 3 - D modelling software and video games , and says that the team " received several proposals from industrial companies " when the prototype was demonstrated at a conference in California last month .
The system is " the first of its kind " , according to haptics researcher Stephen Brewster of the University of Glasgow .
" You can feel it with both hands , rather than having just a single point of contact , and multiple people can use it at the same time , " Prof Brewster says .
" The kinds of things we use are connected through mechanical arms or you 're wearing some kind of exoskeleton .
" It 's great to have something that you can just walk up and use and not need any other kind of hardware you have to hold or wear . "
The team is working to adjust how the transducers are driven in order to produce realistic textures as well as shapes .
However , the approach is limited in how much force it can produce , which in turn limits how hard or stiff the virtual objects can be .
Beyond a certain amount of force , the device could scatter enough ultrasound to risk ear damage .

What are these ?
Republican state legislators , at the behest of the McCain campaign , have now filed an emergency appeal with the Alaska Supreme Court trying to shutdown the ‘ Troopergate ’ investigation .
The plaintiffs ( echoing the Bush v. Gore decision ) claim “ the plaintiffs and Alaskans will suffer irreparable harm ” if the Branchflower report is released , as scheduled , next Friday , October 10th .
Bear in mind , the people in charge of the investigation moved the release date up so as not to have it released on the eve of the election .
That was the original schedule long before Palin was chosen as veep nominee .
And the GOP lawyers the McCain campaign sent to Alaska have succeeded in having almost all the parties connected to Palin refuse to cooperate with the investigation .
So it ’s not completely clear just what Branchflower is going to be able to come up with , either inculpating or exculpating .
But this is an opportunity to refocus our attention on something that has been lost in the nonstop coverage of Palin ’s campaign trail lies and botched interviews : her record in Alaska strongly suggests she lacks the character to be trusted with high office .
Though the troopergate scandal is tied narrowly to Palin ’s firing of Alaska ’s top cop , Walt Monegan , the heart of the story is about a private vendetta that Palin tried to settle using her new powers as the chief executive of the state of Alaska .
Thwarted in doing so , all evidence suggests she fired the public official who refused to execute her plan .
Nor is it the only example .
Both as mayor and governor , Palin has shown the tell - tale signs of a politician who hires cronies and fires or blackballs critics .
This part of Palin ’s record gets deep in the weeds .
So it ’s not as flashy as the boffo interviews or and irresistible as the straight - up lies she ’s been caught in .
But we need no closer example than the Bush administration to know that people like this are dangerous and corrosive to our public institutions .
As congressional leaders struggled to craft a bailout plan for the nation ’s troubled financial system Thursday , angry protesters mobbed Wall Street , telephones rang off the hook in House and Senate offices and a group of prominent economists sent off e-mail blasts critiquing the proposal .
Numerous opinion polls taken this week came to wildly varying conclusions about the level of support among Americans for the Bush administration ’s $ 700 - billion plan .
But the increasingly loud roar coming from all corners of the nation shows that the idea of a bailout has touched a particularly sensitive nerve among the public .
A spokesman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . ) said her five offices had doubled staffing to deal with the constantly ringing phones .
Through late Thursday , Feinstein ’s offices had received a total of 39,180 e-mails , calls and letters on the bailout , with the overwhelming majority of constituents against it .
The spokesman said the volume was as great as during the immigration debate and at key points during the war in Iraq .
Rep. Linda T. Sanchez ( D - Lakewood ) was also hearing it from her district , which includes parts of the city of Los Angeles and unincorporated L.A. County .
“ My constituents are telling me loud and clear that they are n’t convinced , ” she said in a statement .

Typical of the tone of such contacts , Sanchez ’s office said , was a missive from a constituent in Whittier : “ The bailout legislation is being rammed through Congress in a matter of days .
This is an illegal power grab by the White House and their richest friends on Wall Street . ”
“ It ’s getting really controversial , ” said Peter DeMarzo , a professor of finance at Stanford who was among 166 academics who signed a letter sent to House and Senate leaders calling on lawmakers not to rush deliberation on the plan .
Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) held a copy of the letter as he attended a meeting on the bailout negotiations at the White House .
Shelby cited the letter as support for his stance against the Bush plan .
DeMarzo and seven other faculty members organized an on -campus panel discussion Thursday night on the topic of the credit crisis and the bailout .
“ Everything is moving pretty fast and furious , ” he said .
Polls taken in recent days have found little consensus among the American people on the Bush plan , which would provide funds to purchase huge quantities of mortgage - backed securities and other bad debt from troubled financial firms .

A poll by Rasmussen Reports early in the week found that 44 % of Americans opposed the plan and 25 % supported it .
However , a USA Today / Gallup poll released Thursday showed more than 75 % favored congressional approval of the bailout .
A Bloomberg / Los Angeles Times poll conducted Sept. 19 through Monday showed 55 % opposed to government bailouts of private companies .
More than 1,000 protesters clogged the street in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday , bearing signs calling the bailout a “ class war crime . ”
A quartet dressed in business attire contrasted with the mob , holding up signs asking Congress to “ have a heart , save a hedge fund , ” as other demonstrators jeered and shouted obscenities at them .
But even where tempers were more subdued , opinions were in healthy supply .
At Los Angeles ’ Cobras and Matadors , a tony Westside restaurant , a group of six new students at UCLA ’s Anderson School of Business met Wednesday night to prepare for their first day of classes .
Over red wine , steak and churros , most of the group professed conservative views on fiscal issues , stressing individual responsibility .
Yet most everyone felt the plan had some merit .

Jadine Knox , an information technology analyst who aspires to use her MBA to start a career in construction , fashion or baking , called herself “ conflicted ” on the matter .
“ Seven hundred billion dollars works out to a lot of money for each person in this country , ” said Knox , who lives in Redondo Beach .
“ I do n’t see what the average person will get out of this . ”
Irene Rashkovan , who works for NBC Universal , finished off her glass and wrinkled her brow .
“ I do n’t think we have a choice but to do this bailout , ” she said .
“ It ’s not perfect , but we need these banks . ”
Jason DeMatteis , an engineer who bought a home north of Burbank in 2005 , guffawed .

“ You have to hold people responsible to some extent , ” he said .
“ I find it a very hard pill to swallow that I have to work my butt off to pay my mortgage and other people get bailed out . ”

Editor ’s note :
It should be obvious where this one will lead —
Ahmadinejad says the oil crisis is fake and high prices are the result of dollar devaluation .
Of course , this will give neocons inside and outside of the corporate media the excuse to proclaim all talk about high gas prices being the result of the devaluation of the dollar as little more than a conspiracy theory — and an antisemitic conspiracy theory to boot .
ISFAHAN , Iran ( Reuters ) –
The market is full of oil and the rising price trend is “ fake and imposed , ” Iran ’s president said on Tuesday , partly blaming a weak U.S. dollar which he said was being pushed lower on purpose .
“ At a time when the growth of consumption is lower than the growth of production and the market is full of oil , prices are rising and this trend is completely fake and imposed , ” President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech .
“ It is very clear that visible and invisible hands are controlling prices in a fake way with political and economic aims , ” he said when opening a meeting of the OPEC Fund for International Development in the central Iranian city of Isfahan .
Iran , the world ’s fourth - largest oil exporter , has repeatedly said the market is well - supplied with crude and blames rising prices on speculation , a weak U.S. currency and geopolitical factors .
“ As you know the decrease in the dollar ’s value and the increase in energy prices are two sides of the same coin which are being introduced as factors behind the recent instability , ” Ahmadinejad said .

Latest Bailout Plan Spin : Its a Money Maker !
Most people are unfamiliar with the evolution of financial management over the years .
It began as a clubby old boys network , who you knew mattered more than what you knew .
It evolved over time .
Starting in the late 1970s , retail stock brokerage became a telemarketing sales business .
Although that model is clearly changing , there is still trillions of assets under management today that got that way via the cold call .
The cold calling sales approach was developed and refined at Lehman Brothers ( perhaps their collapse was Karma ) .
It was encapsulated by a man named Martin D. Shafiroff , who wrote up , refined and perfected various phone techniques .
These include the straight line , the first trade , the trust close .
All of his various techniques were published in the book " Successful Telephone Selling in the ' 80s " and subsequent editions ( ' 90s , etc . )
Having worked on the Sell side for the first decade of my Wall Street career , I am intimately familiar with the various pitches the retail world uses to obtain clients and assets .
There is not a single retail broker of my acquaintance that does not have Shafiroff 's how - to on his bookshelf .
The reason I bring this up today is due to the latest sales pitch from various people , aggressively pushing the bailout plan .
The newest spin on the massively expensive plan is " Hey , its a jumbo money maker ! "
The spin reminds me of the classic retail stock jockey .
The guy has buried his clients in a series of bad trades , bad judgment , poor risk management -- all motivated by his self - interested , commission - generating trades .
The only way out of the money losing mess , pitches the broker , is a big , Hail Mary trade .
Sound familiar ?
This technique is one of the last ones in the the Shafiroff book .
Once an aggressive retail broker is upside down , the plea goes out for raising more money from the mark client .
" Believe me , I hate being under water more than you .
I pulled in some favors , this is the trade that makes it all back for us and then some .
I could even get in trouble telling you this , so do n't mention this to your pals .
This is the one -- but I need you to send in more capital so we can recoup the prior trades that went bad on us . "
I guess Paulson read the book in the early days of his career .
That line of bullshit is identical to what the public is now being fed .
A series of OpEds in the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal ( and who knows where else ) are all pushing the same nonsensical line :
The bailout plan is a big money maker :
Andy Kessler in the WSJ :
" My analysis suggests that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ( a former investment banker , no less , not a trader ) may pull off the mother of all trades , which could net a trillion dollars and maybe as much as $ 2.2 trillion -- yes , with a " t " -- for the United States Treasury ...
Now Mr. Paulson is pitching Congress for $ 700 billion or more to buy distressed loans and CDOs from the rest of Wall Street , injecting needed cash onto balance sheets so that normal loans for economic activity can be restored .
The trick is what price he will pay .
Better mortgages and CDOs are selling for 70 cents on the dollar .
But many are seriously distressed ( 15 - 25 cents on the dollar ) because they are the last to be paid in foreclosures .
These are what Wall Street wants to unload the quickest .
Firms will haggle , but eventually cave -- they need the cash .
I am figuring Mr. Paulson could wind up buying more than $ 2 trillion in notional value loans and home equity and CDOs for his $ 700 billion . "
Bill Gross ( who just volunteered to manage the bailout for free ) in the Washington Post :
" The extreme measures are extended government guarantees and the formation of an RTC - like holding company housed within the Treasury .
Critics call this a bailout of Wall Street ; in fact , it is anything but .
I estimate the average price of distressed mortgages that pass from " troubled financial institutions " to the Treasury at auction will be 65 cents on the dollar , representing a loss of one - third of the original purchase price to the seller , and a prospective yield of 10 to 15 percent to the Treasury .
Financed at 3 to 4 percent via the sale of Treasury bonds , the Treasury will therefore be in a position to earn a positive carry or yield spread of at least 7 to 8 percent .
Calls for appropriate oversight of this auction process are more than justified .
There are disinterested firms , some not even based on Wall Street , with the expertise to evaluate these complicated pools of mortgages and other assets to assure taxpayers that their money is being wisely invested .
My estimate of double - digit returns assumes lengthy ownership of the assets and is in turn dependent on the level of home foreclosures , but this program is , in fact , directed to prevent just that . "
Now , I have a few question for Messrs .
Kessler & Gross :
What does this say about the private sector ?
Why can't the all of the private equity funds , sovereign wealth funds , and enormous pools of capital do this themselves ?
There are trillions of dollars sitting around in cash , yet none of it that sees any value here ?
I guess that Hank Paulson , George Bush and Ben Bernanke -- all of whom have been been unequivocally , expensively , tyrannically wrong about the entire crisis from the beginning -- are smarter than both the markets , and all of the private equity pools , about this paper ?
Does that sound right to you ?
The guys who missed this from day one -- despite many many admonitions from many people -- only they see the value in this paper , whereas the smart guys who saw the shitstorm coming in advance , and bet against it , do n't ?
I am in the same camp as Michal Lewis , who writes at Bloomberg " the Treasury plan also creates this wonderful hidden opportunity for Goldman Sachs to make a killing , and thus preserve its bonus pool for a long time to come . "
Put me down as sympatico with Anatole Kaletsky , who writes in the London Times :
" Mr Paulson may be a former chairman of Goldman Sachs , but as US Treasury Secretary he does not know what he is doing .
His recent blunders , starting with the “ rescue ” of Fannie Mae , have triggered unintended consequences around the world , resulting in the death - spiral of financial values .
But last Friday Mr Paulson outdid even these Rumsfeldian achievements , when he demanded $ 700 billion from Congress for a “ comprehensive and fundamental ” solution to the global financial crisis , without apparently having any idea of what he would actually do . "
Agreed .
I have a 10 year bet for those folks now pushing the " Trust me , we will make it all back on this one trade " spin .
If you who think the Paulson plan is a money maker , a cash winner , and a net after - fees taxpayer surplus creator , put your money where your mouth is .
I bet you one million dollars , to the charity of the winner 's choice , that the current plan is ginormous money loser .
Any takers ?

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- President Bush said Saturday morning he 's confident that Congress will pass a bill aimed at protecting Americans ' financial security " very soon . "
In his regular Saturday radio address , Bush said there is widespread agreement on the principles of a plan to kick - start the credit markets .
The president also stressed the urgency of getting a plan done , saying " our entire economy is in danger . "
Negotiators from Congress and the administration are returning to talks Saturday with an eye toward finalizing a deal by Sunday .
Panic swept through the banking sector today despite attempts by the authorities to draw a line under the turmoil in the financial sector .
Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland slumped almost 20 % at one point while Lloyds TSB and HBOS were also sharply lower , as was Barclays .
The share prices of Lloyds and HBOS moved so sharply that the market appeared to suggest that the £ 12bn rescue takeover of HBOS might fail .
A 14 % fall in Lloyds TSB to 215.75 p meant that its offer for HBOS was worth 180 p a share .
But HBOS was trading 10 % lower at 155 p .
In more ordinary circumstances the share price of HBOS should be trading close to the offer price .
Royal Bank of Scotland was caught up in the uncertainty surrounding the partial privatisation of the Dutch - Belgian financial group Fortis , which has become the biggest continential European casualty of the credit crunch .
But analysts insisted the association was unfounded .
RBS , together with Fortis and Santander , bought the Dutch bank ABN Amro last year , leading to concerns that it was owed money by Fortis or would buy Fortis 's stake in RFS Holding - the company set up to handle the break up of ABN Amro .
Fortis was buying the retail banking assets of Fortis while RBS bought the investment banking arm .
But analysts at Cazenove stressed the reaction was overdone .
Addressing the concerns in turn , Cazenove said : " 1. Fortis has not paid for its share of ABN .
This is clear nonsense ... RBS is responsible to the Dutch regulator for ABN .
However the balance sheet of ABN is dominated by the businesses acquired by RBS and the addition of the retail / commercial bank operations make little difference to either risk or funding in our view .
" 2. RBS will buy the Fortis shareholding in RFS Holdings .
We regard the probability of RBS buying ABN 's retail / commercial bank as low . "
Analysts were mesmerised by the share price movement in Lloyds TSB and HBOS .
James Eden , banks analyst at Exane BNP Paribas , said : " What 's most remarkable is the HBOS share price which is at a 20 % discount to the Lloyds offer .
I 'm trying to be open minded about other surprises there might be .
Can you imagine Lloyds walking away from HBOS ?
I can't image they would .
The share price is telling you there is a chance of that happening .
It 's an example of the market being too afraid " .

WASHINGTON 
The homeowner assistance plan that Senator John McCain announced without detail in the presidential debate Tuesday night would allow millions of financially stretched Americans to refinance their mortgages with government help , but it would leave taxpayers to cover the losses , rather than the financial institutions that hold the original mortgages .
Mr. McCain said in the debate that the program would be expensive , and on Wednesday his chief economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , acknowledged that the liability would be borne directly by taxpayers .
Mr. McCain , who has made cutting government spending a centerpiece of his campaign , justified the costs on Tuesday night by saying that “ until we stabilize home values in America , we ’re never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy . ”
As Mr. Holtz - Eakin described it , the proposal would ensure that homeowners got direct and speedier help to stay in their residences before they faced foreclosure , so that Wall Street and financial institutions would not be the only direct beneficiaries of government aid .
The new loans would be 30 - year mortgages at fixed interest rates of just over 5 percent , he said .
The McCain campaign did not make clear what level of financial strain an applicant would have to show to qualify for the program .

Dell , Intel and their partners announced last week new technologies that represent major leaps forward for mobility .
The companies seem to have discovered the secret to making such bold leaps : Cut Microsoft out of the deal .
One technology involves enabling users to gain instant access to a laptop 's e-mail , browser and other basic functionality -- without booting Windows at all .
The second technology enables an Internet - based message to wake a Windows PC from sleep mode .
It 's useful both for VoIP applications and for anyone away from their PC who wants remote access .
These new technologies are perfect metaphors for what 's happening in the industry .
In both cases , Windows is asleep while Microsoft 's own partners give users what they really want .
Let 's have a look at the new technologies .
Dell Latitude ON
Dell announced this week a new feature called Latitude ON that enables the use of e-mail , Web surfing , basic PIM functionality and document reading -- all without booting Windows .
The idea is to enable basic use without having to wait for the main OS to boot , and also to extend battery life .
A more accurate name than " Latitude ON " would have been " Windows OFF . "
The codename was " BlackTop , " a combination of " BlackBerry " and " laptop . "
The original aim of the project was to give users the same basic functionality of a BlackBerry using their laptops ' full - size keyboard and screen .
What Dell is really doing here is building the equivalent of a secondary Asus Eee PC into a full - featured , full - size laptop .
The Latitude On feature uses a low - power Intel ARM processor , flash storage and Linux ( SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 ) separate from the laptop 's main CPU , hard drive and Windows operating system .
But unlike a subnotebook , the Latitude On system wo n't allow you to install applications .
It 's essentially a " cloud computing " device that depends on the Internet for much of its functionality .
the applications are made by Microsoft .
ON 's custom Web browser is based on Firefox .
E-mail , " diary " and contacts are , of course , non-Microsoft applications .
But some Microsoft data types are supported in one way or another .
The system , for example , includes viewers for Microsoft Office documents ( as well as for Adobe PDF documents ) .
The built - in organizer grabs the 100 most recent Outlook e-mail messages from the laptop 's cache and displays them .
If you use only the Latitude ON system , battery life lasts not hours but days , according to Dell .
ON is expected to hit in two months for just some of Dell 's laptops .
From a Microsoft perspective , Latitude ON represents a debacle comparable to the UMPC disaster .
Microsoft led a big push to drive sales of Vista - based Ultra - Mobile PCs , all of which failed catastrophically in the market , rejected by users in favor of first Linux - , then XP - based subnotebooks .
Now , it 's happening again .
Remember Windows Vista Sideshow ?
The feature was part of a broader effort by Microsoft to provide basic functionality on laptops while the main Windows OS was in sleep mode .
A tiny screen on the lid would display the UI .
Obviously that failed , and now partner Dell is delivering roughly similar but vastly superior functionality using Linux and other non-Microsoft software .
Intel Remote Wake
Intel introduced new technology Thursday called Remote Wake , a chipset and software development kit that enables a PC to be " awakened " over the Internet when in sleep mode .
Intel worked not with software giant Microsoft , but Silicon Valley VoIP startup JaJah to build the company 's software into the Intel chipset in some PCs .
The Intel - JaJah combination will enable you to dump your landline phone and use a PC - based VoIP phone without leaving your PC on all the time .
Other VoIP applications , such as Skype , can also take advantage of Remote Wake , but will need to be tweaked to support Remote Wake , then installed by the user .
Orb Networks , Cyberlink and Pando Networks are also Intel partners on Remote Wake .
Remote
Wake should also be useful beyond VoIP calls for things like remote , off - peak backups and for downloading media and other files .
Remote
Wake also makes PCs greener , because they do n't have to be left on all the time .
You can check out a demo on the Pando site .
Again , from Microsoft 's perspective , this is another disaster .
It could n't be more obvious that Microsoft and Intel should have partnered on this functionality 10 years ago .
Microsoft has been pushing Remote Desktop and its communications software for years .
But apparently it never occurred to anyone in Redmond that people might want to leave their PCs in sleep mode , then have them turn on for remote access or VoIP calls .
Based on all the information released so far , there is literally no downside ( other than marginal additional cost ) to either of these new offerings .
They both improve life dramatically for mobile users .
The usefulness of these technologies stands in stark contrast to Microsoft Windows ' ongoing slumber .
When is the last time Microsoft rolled out something that boosted mobility the way these new features do ?
The " old Microsoft " would have never allowed all this .
The company would have leveraged its multi-billion dollar labs to figure all this out first , then , coerced Intel , Dell and the rest of the industry into supporting it .
Now , Microsoft is on the sidelines while its closest partners innovate using companies that compete with Microsoft in the software marketplace .
When will Microsoft itself wake up from " sleep mode " ?

This week in Vienna , researchers demonstrated a working quantum key distribution ( QKD ) network , a feat that produced some good news and some bad news .
The good news is that Siemens is probably going to be selling this stuff in a year or so ; IT professionals , get ready to open your check books .
On the other hand , by doing such a demo , the researchers show that QKD has passed from the realm of science into engineering , and they illustrate the weakness of fundamental scientific research in Europe .
Quantum key distribution utilizes fundamental physics to encode information in such a way that eavesdroppers are automatically detected .
( More details on that process can be found in previous articles here at Ars Technica . )
The Vienna demonstration by the SECO - QC team does n't add anything new in the way of science , but it does represent something significant in terms of shifting from basic research to application .
The group demonstrated a robust , ready - for - commercialization set of quantum cryptography units .
These were already packaged into typical 19 - inch racks that use standard fiber optic and electronic interfaces .
In other words , all your encryption technology is right there , ready to go .
The demonstration unit is supposed to work with a variety of different encryption protocols .
Quantum encryption relies on entanglement ( again , see the articles linked above ) , and there is more than one way to entangle two photons .
Until now , every demonstration has been specific to a particular choice of entanglement .
The researchers behind this project , however , claim that their detection systems are agnostic and can cope with any choice of entanglement variables .
I would guess that banks — gotta keep that lack of capital a secret — and various government organizations will be interested in this technology and Siemens , along with some smaller partners , will be well - placed to extract an extra dollop of dollars in these hard economic times .
What bothers me a bit is that this is not science anymore .
It 's a great demonstration , and it is just the sort of thing that will open up an entirely new market .
But the science part ended a while ago .
This highlights the strengths and weaknesses of European research ; close collaboration with industry , partially funded by either national government or EU grants , can really speed progress toward real applications .
I like this approach , and I think the Europeans do this reasonably well .
The weakness is that the projects are structured in such a way that the academic results are not very interesting by the end of the project .
As a result , much of the work ends up in lower - ranked journals .
The two Nature papers and seven Physical Review Letters produced by the quantum encryption team sound pretty good until you count the number of academic institutions involved : 26 .
The EU is directing science to great commercial success , but it may pay the price for this focus by not allowing scientists to pursue really high - impact fundamental research .

Charles Murray is making college & education bloggers question if he ’s right when he claims college is a waste of time for most people , but once I made it past the provocative headline , I realized there ’s a lot of good ideas inside the article .
Essentially , Murray proposes extending the certification process used in accounting to all other common college majors .
Final exams would be standardized nationwide and would provide a useful and comparable metric for an individual ’s knowledge of that particular topic .
The particular advantage I see is that self - taught students might be able to skip years of tuition bills .
People will varied & overlapping areas of interest could demonstrate proficiency in all of them at once .
Cross - over specializations could help corporate hiring managers conceive of new potential roles inside their organizations and business model .
Of course , any suggestions of heavy tinkering in higher education prompts an inevitable debate about the nature and purpose of education .
I tend to agree with VillainousCompany : employment is n’t the only purpose of college – or even the main purpose .
I do n’t think a liberal arts degree would go away suddenly just because students could also choose to test test their way to achievements in specific topics .
But unfortunately , not all employers will give smart , hard - working grads a chance to learn about calculating mortgage risk unless those grads have specifically majored in one of the business degrees that probably never once mentioned actually calculating loan risks .
There ’s even a civic purpose for the liberal arts education – and this would n’t go away either if certifications became available for more liberal arts subjects .
What it does do is provide an alternative path for students who are primarily concerned with a means of achieving higher employability while allowing more new education models to compete – including my personal ( biased ) favorite , the self - motivated & independent student .
Murrey argues :
Certification tests will not get rid of the problems associated with differences in intellectual ability : People with high intellectual ability will still have an edge .
Graduates of prestigious colleges will still , on average , have higher certification scores than people who have taken online courses
What they will do , is allow students from local public universities compete on skill standardized skill assessments with students who who attended other colleges .
Students like myself with liberal arts degrees would be in a prime position to quickly and easily pick up multiple certifications thanks to the logic skills , study skills , and even test - taking skills learned in college .
I do n’t think there would be any sudden changes in the number of students enrolling in college – just another employment - based incentive to pick up books in subjects you did n’t major in .
Earlier this year , at a town - hall meeting at the Fantasy of Flight aircraft museum , in Polk City , Florida , Cindy McCain introduced her husband , the Republican Presidential nominee , with a speech about the nature of “ the man . ”
There are , she said , many things “ that make a great man , but being a good father and a good husband are most important to me . ”
She wore a tight black leather blazer over a black turtleneck , and her hair was styled stiffly in a ponytail .
“ I was working one day , one day a long , long time ago , in Bangladesh , ” McCain said .
“ I stumbled upon a little girl in Mother Teresa ’s orphanage , and she had a really bad cleft palate and she was sick and tiny and she was only ten weeks old .
And I got to know her a little bit , and I was with her for quite a while .
Mother Teresa — as only she could do at that time — prevailed upon me and said , You know , you can get help for her .
You could , you can get her out . . . and , being a tenacious woman , I thought , Yeah !
I can .
Sure . ”
“ If you look at Cindy , ” the co-founder of one of her charities says , “ she does crazy things in terms of most people ’s idea of normal . ”

McCain said that on the flight home from Bangkok she “ realized that this child had chosen me and I could not give her up . ”
But there was something even more remarkable : “ What you do n’t know about this story is I did n’t tell my husband . ”
McCain smiled mischievously as she said that , and several members of the audience tittered .
“ I landed in Phoenix , Arizona , with this baby in my arms , and in front of a thousand reporters and a whole lot of people he whispered down to me and said , ‘ Well , where ’s she going to go ? ’
And I said , ‘ I thought she ’d come to our house . ’
And he looked at her and he loved her just the way I have ever since .
And I think that says a great deal about the man . ”
McCain ’s account of bringing home a daughter without first informing her husband of her decision has become the core of the Cindy stump speech .
She revisits the narrative routinely in her brief but frequent campaign appearances , and the Republican National Committee offered a version of it in a video that was played before her speech at the Convention last week .
Almost every friend of the McCains with whom I spoke offered his or her own retelling of the tale .
It is fact and fable : last month , the Christian Science Monitor reported that Mother Teresa was not actually at that orphanage at the time of Cindy McCain ’s visit .
( The McCain campaign subsequently revised the story on its Web site . )
The story certainly helps to portray John McCain as openhearted and charitable .
But it also happens to reflect the nearly separate lives lived by the two McCains , and the peculiar defiance that is characteristic of Cindy — a woman who claims to pride herself on being traditional .
In her size - 0 St. John skirt suits , and with her lacquered coiffures , Cindy McCain appears pampered and brittle .
She was taken to a hospital with a sprained wrist after a fan shook her hand with too much gusto at a campaign event in Michigan last month .
Her movements are quick and sharp — birdlike — and she often seems skittish , wary - eyed , and fidgety , fussing with her nails or her BlackBerry .
McCain has said that she kept her phone with her at all times so that she would n’t miss a call from her son Jimmy , a marine , while he was in Iraq .
But he returned in mid-February , and the BlackBerry remains in his mother ’s hand much of the time .
She seems to be vigilant on behalf of all her children : Meghan , twenty - three , a recent Columbia graduate ; John Sidney IV , twenty - two , a senior at the U.S. Naval Academy ; Jimmy , twenty ; and Bridget , the daughter from Bangladesh , who is now seventeen .
At times , Cindy McCain seems to be channelling Nancy Reagan in her nervousness and her apparent conviction that without her protection harm will befall her family in the dangerous sphere of public life .
But McCain has unusual grit , too .
She has taken up race - car driving and flying , and she has a long history of going on charity missions to Third World countries .
According to her spokeswoman , Melissa Shuffield , McCain spends between two and three weeks a year travelling with Operation Smile , an organization that provides surgery for children with cleft palates , and the Halo Trust , a group that removes land mines from countries still riddled with unexploded ordnance .
Like her husband , however , she does not support an international ban on land mines .
“ As much as I know her , I do n’t get in any big political discussions with Cindy or intellectual discussions about poverty , ” Dr. Bill Magee , the co-founder of Operation Smile , said .
“ It ’s more like , What can we do for these kids today ?
People have a great time .
It brings together the risk - taker with the compassionate .
If you take a look at Cindy , she does crazy things in terms of most people ’s idea of normal . ”
Magee went on to talk about McCain ’s race - car driving , and offered his version of her decision to adopt Bridget : “ She ’s on the tarmac , she ’s got this impoverished black kid with a hole in the roof of her mouth , and John says , ‘ Fine ! ’
It ’s crazy . ”
When I travelled with the campaign in late spring , I asked the McCains , who were seated on the curved banquette at the back of the Straight Talk Express , how they imagined Cindy ’s role as First Lady might affect her humanitarian work .
“ I think some of her travels might be curtailed , ” Senator McCain , who was wearing a blue Navy baseball cap , replied .
“ She ’s been to Cambodia , where land mines are very dangerous , and no one knows exactly where they are , so that may be a little bit of a downside of her involvement . ”
Staring into the middle distance , as she often does , Cindy McCain proceeded to contradict her husband .
“ What I tell everyone is , regardless of whether we win or lose , I will continue to do what I do because it ’s so important to be an example , ” she said firmly .
“ To my own children , and also for other kids in the community .
Regardless of whether we win or lose . ”
“ Stop saying that , ” John McCain interrupted .
“ Say ‘ when we win , ’ ” Janet Huckabee instructed .
She and her husband , the former Arkansas governor and Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , were travelling with the campaign that day .
Cindy McCain gave a flicker of a smirk .
“ When we win , ” she said .
And she did n’t say anything more .
The streets of Phoenix sound as if they were named by a movie cowboy : Camelback , Copperhead , Buckeye .
The famously dry heat hurts your eyes and chaps your lips and makes you wonder about the sort of person who elects to endure it .
Cindy McCain “ is very strong and independent , ” Sharon Harper , who has been a friend and neighbor of McCain ’s for more than twenty years , told me .
Harper is a commercial real - estate developer in Phoenix , with whom Cindy has invested in two properties .
“ There ’s something very special about the West , ” she said .
“ There ’s a real tradition of independence here .
I do n’t know if you ’ve read Sandra Day O’Connor ’s book about growing up on the Lazy B? ” — an Arizona cattle ranch .
“ Cindy ’s that kind of woman .
People are supposed to be strong and independent growing up here ; it ’s an expectation . ”
McCain has a complex relationship with independence — a quality that many people attribute to her .
“ I ’m a stay - at - home mother , ” McCain told voters at a town - hall meeting in Peterborough , New Hampshire , in 1999 , when John McCain was running against George W. Bush , who was then governor of Texas .
“ I do n’t like labels , but , if there ’s a label for me , it would be ‘ traditional , ’ and I ’m very proud to be traditional . ’’
Last December , in an interview with the Arizona Republic , her home - town paper , she said , “ I think the American people truly still want a traditional family in the White House . ”
In that interview , she added that she was “ reluctant to get involved ” in this year ’s Presidential race because of the treatment that her family received in 2000 .
“ You can see the toe marks in the sand where I was brought on board , ” as she put it .
She was referring to what happened after McCain won the New Hampshire primary by a nineteen - point margin : the McCains were subjected to a smear campaign in the days leading up to the South Carolina primary .
Anonymous calls and “ push - polling , ” believed to be the inspiration of Karl Rove , convinced many voters there that Bridget was John McCain ’s illegitimate daughter .
Rove and the Bush campaign always denied involvement , but McCain lost , and Cindy McCain wept in front of reporters .

It ’s possible , though , that Cindy McCain ’s reluctance to enter this race also had to do with the fact that her family is not actually that traditional — far less traditional , in fact , than the Obamas .
Since childhood , McCain has been expected to embody certain pillars of conventional femininity : beauty , refinement , altruism , and an inclination to encourage the ambitious men in her life .
She is probably better suited to this particular formulation of public wifehood than the outspoken , muscular , and frankly powerful Michelle Obama .
But , if you watch her closely , from time to time you can see Cindy McCain slip out of character .
Cindy Lou Hensley was born in 1954 and grew up on North Central Avenue in Phoenix , a street lined with pepper trees and large adobe - style houses with salmon - or sand - colored stucco façades .
That street remained the axis of her life for fifty years .
The house at 7110 , where Cindy was brought up by her parents , James and Marguerite Hensley — and where , years later , she reared her own children — is a long , low ranch - style house , comparable in size to the small strip malls that are occupied by tanning salons and dry cleaners a few blocks to the south .
The house is imposing , with four bucking - horse statues around a fountain on the front lawn ( Cindy had horses of her own , which used to be stabled in the back yard ) , but it is not obvious that this was once the home of one of the richest men in Arizona .
“ When I was growing up and when Cindy was growing up , Phoenix was a small town , ” McCain ’s friend Betsey Bayless , the former Arizona secretary of state , who grew up in the same neighborhood , said .
“ Now the place has just exploded . ”
The Hensleys , she continued , “ were well known because they had a beer distributorship , but there was no such thing as being socially prominent — any business owner was as socially prominent as you get in small - town Phoenix . ”
James — whom everyone called Jim — and his brother Eugene Hensley built their wealth on alcohol .
After Jim returned from service as a bombardier in the Second World War , the brothers entered the wholesale liquor market and began operating two warehouses —
United Sales Company , in Phoenix , and United Distributors , Inc. , in Tucson — in partnership with Kemper Marley , Sr. , a Phoenix businessman .
( Police reportedly suspected Marley of having had a hand in the 1976 murder of Don Bolles , a reporter for the Arizona Republic who had written extensively about Marley ’s business and political machinations .
Marley died in 1990 . )
In 1948 , the Hensleys were convicted on federal conspiracy charges after filing more than twelve hundred fake invoices to cover up under - the - table sales of liquor to night clubs and bars throughout the state .
Eugene was sentenced to a year in prison , Jim to six months , but , with the help of their lawyer , a former mayor of Phoenix , Jim had his sentence suspended .
Despite his criminal conviction , in 1955 Jim Hensley was granted a liquor license to start an Anheuser - Busch distributorship , which he called Hensley & Company .
Hensley was the first Anheuser - Busch distributor to invest in refrigerated warehouses , which are now an industry standard .
“ Jim was always willing to take that first step that perhaps other businesses weren’t , ” Robert Delgado , the current C.E.O. of Hensley , told me .
Since 1975 , when Jim Hensley hired Delgado , the company has grown to be the third - largest Anheuser - Busch wholesale distributor in the nation , and the largest in Arizona , selling twenty - three million cases of beer a year .
“ Mr. Hensley acquired this business when Phoenix was a small town , ” Delgado said .
“ We ’ve had tremendous population growth in the fifty - three years since , and tremendous market - share growth . ”
Delgado said that Hensley now controls approximately sixty per cent of the Arizona beer market .
Jim Hensley , who died in 2000 , was “ the quintessential Western gentleman , ” in Delgado ’s opinion .
“ He was a cowboy , is a good description .
A guy who enjoyed horses , loved Arizona , loved everything about the West . ”
Oliver Harper , a doctor in Phoenix who is married to Cindy ’s friend Sharon Harper , remembers Hensley as “ the Gary Cooper type of larger - than - life , very manly guy . ”
( For many years , the McCains and the Harpers went on an annual family trip to Lake Powell , and the Harpers own the property that abuts the McCains ’ ranch in Cottonwood , near Sedona . )
“ Cindy would go on these wonderful vacations with Jim — they ’d go on these horse rides where you ’d be out and you ’d be packing overnight , and you ’d be twenty - five miles a day on a horse .
When we went to Africa together ” — in 1995 — “ I remember Cindy saying her father had taken her to the Mt. Kenya Safari Club years ago , when she was a little kid .
I think they did a lot of father - daughter stuff , the more adventurey , outdoorsy type of stuff , and Cindy loved that . ”
Cindy attended Central High , where she was the best - dressed girl in school , according to her senior yearbook .
In 1968 , she was named Junior Rodeo Queen of Arizona .
“ I could have been a brain surgeon at twelve and my father would not have been as proud of me , ” she told Vogue recently .
Her mother , Marguerite , nicknamed Smitty ( after her last name , Smith ) , was “ a very refined woman , ” according to Sharon Harper .
“ She was polite and always dressed in such a lovely way .
She taught Cindy impeccable manners . ”
At the University of Southern California — or the “ University of Spoiled Children , ” as her husband is fond of telling reporters —
Cindy pledged the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta , and graduated in 1978 , with a master ’s in education .
Her father gave her a Porsche as a graduation present .
She crashed it .
He replaced the Porsche with a gold Mercedes .
Many of McCain ’s friends noted that after graduation she took a low - paying job as a special - education teacher at Agua Fria High School , near Phoenix , rather than a more lucrative position at her father ’s company .
McCain , too , frequently refers to his wife ’s teaching background .
She worked at Agua Fria for just one year .
In 1979 , Cindy Hensley was on vacation with her parents in Honolulu when , as she has said , “ this awfully nice - looking Navy captain in dress whites ” started following her around at a cocktail party .
John McCain was eighteen years her senior , and a celebrity after five and a half years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese in Hanoi . *
Cindy was taken with this warrior — a different variety of cowboy .
“ Having a strong father , I wanted an older man , ” she told Harper ’s Bazaar recently .
And there he was .
Just over a year after that first meeting , they were married .
“ I think John very much saw her as reclaiming the life he had lost , ” McCain ’s friend Pete Lakeland told Robert Timberg , McCain ’s biographer .
“ Cindy stood for everything he did n’t have in prison .
This was the sweet , innocent , pure American dream . ”
Cindy Hensley also came with enormous wealth and useful connections .
When the couple met , John McCain was serving as the Navy ’s liaison to the U.S. Senate , and he was eager to give up the military — the world he was born into as the son and grandson of Navy admirals — and enter the realm of politics .
He signed his Navy discharge papers in 1981 , the day that his father was buried in Arlington National Cemetery .
Soon after he married Cindy , McCain began working for Hensley & Company as the vice - president of public affairs .
He was paid to travel around Arizona promoting the company ; in the process , he laid the groundwork for his first campaign .
John and Cindy McCain had signed a prenuptial agreement , but Cindy ’s assets were , from the beginning , crucial to her husband ’s success .
In 1982 , she received six hundred and thirty - nine thousand dollars from a Hensley subsidiary .
On the very day that John Rhodes , a fifteen - term Republican congressman , announced his retirement , the McCains bought a house in his congressional district .
McCain was elected to the Ninety - eighth Congress .
Today , the fortune at Cindy McCain ’s disposal has been estimated at a hundred million dollars , and , according to the Times , she owns ten houses .
In 1986 , after two terms in the House , McCain won the Senate seat that Barry Goldwater had relinquished .
For two years , Cindy McCain attempted to make a life with her husband in Washington .
But there were no wide - open spaces , there was no privacy , and the credentials that made Cindy prominent in Phoenix had no value in the capital .
She returned to Phoenix to bring up her family ; her husband joined them on weekends .
That has been the pattern of their lives ever since .
“ She was very much a mother — she always relished that designation , ” her friend Betsey Bayless told me .
“ She was always driving her carpool , up and down Central Avenue .
She really maintained the home fire . ”
Staying in Phoenix was also an assertion of Cindy McCain ’s determination to remain in her own territory .
She moved back into the house she ’d grown up in , her children went to private schools on Central Avenue , and the family attended the massive North Phoenix Baptist Church , just a few blocks down the road , an island in a sea of asphalt .

On an outrageously hot day in June , Pastor Dick Stafford was sitting in his office on the ground floor , amid the extensive collection of elephant statuettes that he amassed as a missionary in Africa and Southeast Asia .
“ It has no political statement , ” he said .
“ They have lifelong family relationships — we could learn a lot from elephants . ”
Stafford said that North Phoenix Baptist is “ very careful about not taking a partisan stance , ” and serves a diverse community .
“ We have some of the most expensive property straight up Central Avenue ; we have a large population of multifamily housing , heavy Hispanic population .
We ’re multiethnic , multiracial , multigenerational , and we want all that here in the church on Sunday . ”
( Cindy McCain was brought up as a Congregationalist .
John McCain ’s great - grandfather was an Episcopalian minister .
He has never been baptized . )
The majority of the congregation opposes abortion , and , of homosexuals , Stafford said , “ We would want to help a person who ’s struggling with any of those life issues find a healthy way to resolve it . ”
( When he was asked for an example of another such life issue , Stafford replied , “ Materialism . ” )
The memorial services of both Jim and Marguerite Hensley were held at North Phoenix Baptist .
“ Cindy ’s dad ’s service was quite large , because of his business connections , ” Stafford said .

The American military has depended on private contractors since sutlers sold paper , bacon , sugar , and other small luxuries to Continental Army troops during the Revolutionary War .
But the scale of the use of contractors in Iraq is unprecedented in US history , according to a new congressional report that may be the most thorough official account yet of the practice .
As of early 2008 , at least 190,000 private personnel were working on US - funded projects in the Iraq theater , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) survey found .
That means that for each uniformed member of the US military in the region , there was also a contract employee – a ratio of 1 to 1 .
" It is ... exceptional the degree to which the military 's currently relying on such contractors , " said CBO director Peter Orszag at an Aug. 12 press conference .
In the Korean conflict , the ratio was 2.5 uniformed personnel for each contractor .
In Vietnam , the comparable figure was 5 to 1 .
The Balkans conflict of the 1990s provided a glimpse of the future , as it also featured a 1 - to - 1 military - to - civilian worker ratio .
But in the Balkans , the overall deployment numbers " were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in Iraq , " Mr. Orszag said .
A number of factors are behind the Pentagon 's growing dependence on contractors , says the CBO report .
Reductions in the size of the post - cold war military mean that private firms now provide more and more of the logistical support needed to keep the armed services running , such as food supply and housekeeping services on bases .
In general , all US agencies in recent decades have outsourced more and more functions judged not inherently governmental .
In Iraq in particular , the ranks of contractors have been bolstered by the US decision to try to rebuild the country while hostilities were still under way .
The CBO estimates the total cost of these military contractor operations from 2003 through 2008 to be $ 100 billion .
That 's about 20 percent of all US funding for operations in Iraq .
Most of this money went for logistics support – food - service operation , fuel distribution , equipment maintenance , and procurement and property management .
Roughly $ 12 billion of the $ 100 billion total paid for private security contractors – the gun-toting guards of Blackwater and other paramilitary personnel providers .
The CBO looked at the cost of hiring private guards versus the cost of providing similar security with US military units .
Among the factors analysts took into consideration was that the Pentagon must pay and outfit multiple brigades to keep one in Iraq , due to deployment rotations .
The result was a tie , according to the CBO .
" The cost of having an Army contingent provide the same services as Blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself , " Orszag said .
The same holds true for more mundane logistical operations , says the CBO .
Hiring a private oil - truck driver for Iraq costs about as much as recruiting , training , and providing a uniformed equivalent .
However , critics of military outsourcing say the real problem is flexibility and command - and - control over private workers .
For instance , private guards have been loose cannons in Iraq , critics say .
A federal grand jury is investigating whether Blackwater guards acted illegally when they opened fire in a busy Baghdad intersection last September .
Among the most contentious issues in the status - of - forces agreement now being negotiated by the US and Iraqi governments is whether private guards will be subject to arrest and trial by Iraqi authorities .
" One of the key questions surrounding the government 's escalating use of military contractors is actually not whether they save the government client money or not ....
Rather , the crucial question that should be asked at the onset of any potential outsourcing is simple :
Should the task be done by a private company in the first place ? " wrote Peter Singer , director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative at the Brookings Institution , in an analysis earlier this year .
If earwigs , centipedes or spiders give you the creepy crawlies , quit while you 're ahead .
Otherwise , meet " Chan 's megastick " ( Phobaeticus chani ) .
Recently named the world 's longest living insect , the thin , bamboo - looking stick insect — best known for its camouflaging abilities to deter predators — was discovered in Southeast Asia 's island of Borneo .
Measuring approximately 22 inches long with its legs , or 14 inches just counting its body , megastick swiped away the title from its previous record holder of more than a century , Phobaeticus kirbyi— also a stick insect from Borneo — by almost an inch .
Further , scientists in England have confirmed it is a new species of stick insect , adding to the 3,000 known species of the bug mainly found in the tropics and subtropics .
McCain wants to raise taxes on every working American and make you pay taxes on your health benefits .
Wow .
From AP :
Barack Obama launched a multifaceted attack on presidential rival John McCain ’s health care proposal Saturday , elevating an issue that has been on the back burner in the White House race but remains a top concern for voters .
Obama planned to criticize McCain ’s plan to tax health care benefits as “ radical ” during an event in Newport News , Va. , while his campaign echoed the message in four new television ads , four separate mailers targeted to swing state voters , radio commercials and events in every battleground state .
The McCain plan would be a dramatic change to the way Americans get health insurance .
The Republican presidential nominee , who makes opposition to tax hikes a centerpiece of his campaign , has proposed to tax the health benefits that 156 million people get through the workplace as income .

Through it all , Sam kept training and got stronger .
He gained the discipline to work hard , even in a losing streak .
Especially in a losing streak , he told me .
“ You have to have something , or you ’ll just keep losing . ”
Experts suggest that this is the attitude that can turn bad experiences into profitable ones .
Christopher Peterson , a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan who has studied the effects of optimism and pessimism , said experts in his field try to help patients “ reframe things ” to see loss more positively .
That might mean encouraging them to take pride in getting through an awful experience , or saying “ you did n’t fail , you found something that did n’t work . ”
“ It does n’t mean turning people into a Pollyanna , ” he said .
Rather , it means reinforcing that “ there are some good lessons to be learned about what happens in life . ”
In Sam ’s high school wrestling career , he also learned that victories and losses are a part of the game .
When he first tried out for wrestling in eighth grade , he had a lot to learn  and many of the boys on his team had already gained years of experience , moves and strength .
Sam tried to quit one day , walking up to tell the coach as the team was boarding the bus for a meet .
“ Get on the bus , ” the coach barked .
Sam did .
His coach told him not to be discouraged .
“ The first couple of years will be like this , ” he said .
But , he added , “ you ’re going to do well . ”
By his senior year , Sam had transformed himself into a kid who won matches more often than he lost , even though his team lost more meets than it won .
When Sam got his first pin as a varsity player , after so many losses and so much frustration , his teammates leaped to their feet to hug him .
The cheer from the stands was deafening .
And stoic Sam smiled .
One of the biggest cheers Sam ever got during wrestling was , in fact , for a loss .
One night when he lost a match , there was a thunderous ovation .
I was clueless .
Another dad saw my confusion and asked , “ Do n’t you even know what he just did ? ”
Not only is Phil Gramm the guy who called Americans a “ nation of whiners ” for being concerned about the economy , and who said that the economy is fine and anyone who thinks otherwise is simply suffering from a “ mental recession . ”
But Phil Gramm is also one of the chief architects of the deregulation of Wall Street ( that John McCain supported ) , and which directly led to the current economic meltdown .
Read this transcript .
It ’s actually quite horrifying the degree to which McCain ’s spokesman is refusing to say that Gramm wo n’t be in McCain ’s cabinet .
Folks , there ’s a very real possibility that one of the architects of our current economic crisis will be appointed as John McCain ’s top guy to fix the same crisis .
The transcript follows the video :

DAVID SHUSTER : You can make it clear right now .
Can you assure that John McCain will not pick Phil Gramm as treasury secretary if John McCain wins this election ?
TUCKER BOUNDS :
He ’s not even an adviser on this campaign , David .
I do n’t know where these sorts of rumor mills come from –
DAVID SHUSTER :
Why do n’t you put them down and say that he ’s –
TUCKER BOUNDS : – but I think they come from the Obama campaign straight to you straight to a question on air .
DAVID SHUSTER : Well Tucker , you can make your point better .
Just say Phil Gramm – John McCain has told me Phil Gramm will not be treasury secretary under any circumstance in a McCain administration .
TUCKER BOUNDS :
It is an absurd thing to say .
It would be as if I was to say Franklin Raines is going to head up the Housing and Urban Development wing for Barack Obama .
DAVID SHUSTER : Right , but the difference , Tucker , is the Obama campaign says that ’ll never happen .
And I have yet to hear you say –
TUCKER BOUNDS :
If I were to make that accusation , David , you would call it a lie .
You ’d call it a lie .
And I ’m not making it , but Barack Obama is .
DAVID SHUSTER :
The difference is the Obama campaign will tell us flat out that he will not be part of an Obama administration .
And I still have n’t heard you say that Phil Gramm will not be part of a McCain administration .
TUCKER BOUNDS : I think it is inherently true .
He stepped down from this campaign .
He ’s not advising this campaign .
I mean , these are the sorts of absurdities that we ’re talking about and it ’s all because Barack Obama gets away with saying things that are n’t true and then people believe them to be some way based in fact .
It ’s absurd .
DAVID SHUSTER : Alright .
Tucker Bounds , spokesperson for the McCain campaign .
Bloomberg is reporting China 's Manufacturing Contracts for Second Month .
Manufacturing in China , the world 's fastest - growing major economy , contracted for a second straight month in August , according to a survey of purchasing managers .
The Purchasing Managers ' Index was a seasonally adjusted 48.4 , unchanged from July , the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in an e-mailed statement .
Since July , Chinese policy makers have put extra emphasis on sustaining the economy 's expansion rather than cooling inflation .
Growth has slowed for four quarters and Vice Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said last week that weakness in global demand will weigh on China 's exports for the rest of the year .
" This suggests economic growth will continue to slow , " said Sun Mingchun , an economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong .
The output index rose to 48.7 in August from 47.4 in July , while the index of new orders fell to 46 from 46.2 .
The index of export orders climbed to 48.4 from 46.7 .
The index of input prices dropped to 57.8 from 71.3 , " which may mean that producer prices have already reached a peak , " said Lehman 's Sun .
Global Hangover Hits China
Is China In Recession ?
While everyone points to economic trouble both here and in Europe , I have n't heard many talking about the Chinese economy .
I hear a lot about their stock market , but not much about the Chinese Purchasing Managers Index , which is plunging into negative ( contraction ) territory .
This is likely as much behind the fall in oil as Gustav not being as nasty as many think .
So the recession is now most likely global .
Stocks can stay bid for a while , but be careful , folks .
Prices are likely to be very technical and thin .
On other boards I am reading , many are anticipating a huge jump in oil and gas prices next week .
I do not know if that will happen , but I will offer the opinion that if it does not happen , or if it happens and prices quickly reverse lower , they will keep going a lot lower than most energy bulls think .
Short to intermediate term , it is highly likely that the slowing global economy will have far more effect on energy prices than peak oil .
October Crude Weekly
Since there is widespread agreement that the children of candidates should not become topics of campaign debate , it behooves us to note that the McCain campaign has almost singlehandedly made Sarah Palin ’s daughter a central figure in the Republican convention .
It was the McCain campaign that announced Palin ’s daughter ’s pregnancy .
That alone might be understandable since it appears a supermarket tabloid was about to print the story .
But it was the McCain campaign , entirely on its own , that dished up unsubstantiated claims about maternity tests and all sorts of other lurid nonsense that had never been seen in print anywhere .
And now the McCain campaign has staged a ceremonial laying - on - of - hands on the tarmac in St. Paul in which Sen.
McCain has given his official blessing to the young couple and embrace of Bristol ’s boyfriend Levi .
You can see brief video of the event here …
Let ’s be clear about what ’s happening here .
Overwhelmingly , reporters are pressing eminently reasonable questions — her role in troopergate , her lack of experience , her connections to the AIP , her history of earmarking and lobbyists , etc .
Meanwhile , the McCain campaign is going absolutely non-stop about Palin ’s daughter .
It is unmistakable .
Today MySpace is launching a new online music service that it hopes can chip away at iTunes ’ dominance in the music retail market .
The new initiative from MySpace has the backing of all four of the major music labels .
MySpace users , which number over 120 million worldwide , have previously been able to go to the MySpace page of their favorite artists and and stream a few pre-selected songs .
The new service , however , will allow users to freely stream songs from a much larger catalog of music with the option to then purchase them from Amazon .
Users will also be able to create playlists and share them with their online friends .
The Economics of MySpace Music
The site will be supported through advertisements , with big names like McDonalds and Toyota already on board .
But will MySpace be able to make any money off of this venture ?
According to a few sources , the record companies will be charging MySpace 1 cent for each streamed song .
So if a user streams 100 songs , MySpace will owe one dollar , and to make that money back , it will have to charge advertisers 1 dollar for every 100 page impressions ( which is obviously 10 dollars for every 1000 page impressions ) .
This is significant because it has been noted that MySpace , in the past , has only been able to charge advertisers 3 dollars for every 1000 page impression
Moreover , MySpace was only able to entice the big four record companies ( Sony BMG Music , Universal , Warner Music , and EMI ) to sign on board after offering them each an equity stake in the project , along with a cut of the ad revenue that the site generates .
Under such an agreement , it seems that there are too many pieces of the pie to be shared to allow any one party to make any significant amount of money through advertisements – but making money via ads might not actually be the primary goal for the companies involved .
The Apple Model
Keep in mind that Apple has sold over five billion songs through iTunes , yet it barely breaks even with the service .
Rather , Apple makes money via the iTunes storewhen consumers purchase iPods to listen to their downloaded iTunes tracks .
Similarly , its entirely possible that MySpace and the record labels have larger and more profitable objectives in mind as they prepare to launch the new site .
What MySpace is hoping for
MySpace would delight in anything that keeps users on the website for as long as possible .
Even more appealing , yet further down the road , is the idea that MySpace will be able to parlay their new music service into other related streams of revenue such as t- shirt and concert ticket sales .
MySpace might be banking on their new service evolving from a streaming music site into a one stop , full service music resource center for consumers .
What the record labels are hoping for
And as for the record labels , they really have nothing to lose and everything to gain with this partnership .
They ’re making money via ads , and also have an equity stake in the venture .
Also , as CD sales continue to decline , old school record executives are desperately seeking new ways to counteract the fact that consumers are becoming more and more comfortable with purchasing their media online .
The record companies are also eager to wrestle back some of the power they feel that they ’ve lost to Apple and iTunes .
If MySpace music takes off and becomes a big hit , it will give the record companies more leverage in future negotiations with Apple .
It ’s well known that the big record companies are n’t too happy with the fact that Apple refuses to charge more than .99 cents per song per download .
They would prefer to see Apple charge higher prices for newer songs and CD ’s than for old ones .
Will new features be enough ?
Many a service has tried to dethrone iTunes only to suffer a quick and painful defeat .
So while MySpace music obviously faces an uphill battle , it seems to be one of the most compelling challenges to iTunes to date .
One of the most intriguing features of MySpace music is that it will give users the option to create playlists of up to 100 songs , and listen to them all for free .
Typically , streaming music supported via ads does not allow users to pick exactly what song they can listen to , or will only make available a limited number of songs from each artist .
This seems to be one of the more attractive features of MySpace music , and with other niceties such as the ability to share playlists with people who are already your online friends , and the ability to search for relevant ringtones , will MySpace music actually cause a dent in Apple ’s armor ?
Take a look at the new MySpace music service here , and see for yourself if iTunes has finally met its match .
So the final results from the Lehman Brothers CDS auction are in , and they 're even uglier than expected .
Finally price is 8.625 cents on the dollar .
Be prepared for the perma-bulls to start saying that all the money made by those getting paid out will be poured back into equity and the credit markets and save us all .
And there are whiskey rivers on the Big Rock Candy Mountain .
This should result in another round of huge write - downs , and add paranoia to the market as everyone tries to guess who had the worst exposure to this disaster .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Online DVD rental pioneer Netflix Incon Thursday worked feverishly to fix the most severe outage in its history , as disc shipments to a third of its 8.4 million customers came to a halt due to a shipping system problem .
A DVD rental from Netflix is seen against the company 's website in Medford , Massachusetts in this July 25 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder / Files
Red mailers with the Netflix name have become ubiquitous for many Americans who pick films to watch on the Internet and then get DVDs in the mail , usually a day or two later .
Advertisements litter the Web with trial offers .
However , Netflix shipped no DVDs on Tuesday .
It shipped some on Wednesday but has shipped none so far on Thursday .
Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said the Los Gatos , California - based company would give credits to affected customers and was working “ feverishly ” to determine the cause of the outage and fix the problem .
Swasey said the disruption was not affecting its Watch Instantly Web streaming service , which it offers free to subscribers .
Netflix ’s stock was up 1.1 percent , or 34 cents , to $ 31.50 a share in afternoon trade .
It had been up more than 3 percent earlier in the day but gave back most of the gain after news of the shipping problems surfaced .
Cary Miller , a media executive and avid Netflix user who receives four or more discs in an average week , said he was not bothered by the disruption .
“ Netflix ’s service has been impeccable , ” said Miller .
“ I probably would n’t have noticed if they had n’t informed me . ”
It was the second time in Netflix ’s history it was unable to ship DVDs due to a technical glitch , said Swasey , adding that this outage was worse than one in March .
That was caused by an entirely different problem , which the company has since resolved , he said , without giving details .
In the previous outage , Netflix resumed shipping DVDs one day after a technological breakdown knocked out its site , and it offered 5 percent discounts on bills to members who did not receive DVDs on time .
“ This time , the site ’s been up but our shipping system is down .
It ’s worse than it was in March .
We ’re really backlogged , ” Swasey said .
NOTIFIES SUBSCRIBERS
Netflix sent e-mails to people who were due to receive discs and were unable to get them .
The e-mail included the following : “ We are sorry for any inconvenience this has caused .
If your DVD shipment is delayed , we will be issuing a credit to your account in the next few days .
You do n’t need to do anything .
The credit will be automatically applied to your next billing statement . ”
The company has put significant pressure on DVD rental king Blockbuster Inc , but it also faces challenges from online video providers like Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc .
Late last month , Netflix posted a better - than - expected second - quarter profit and raised its 2008 forecast , easing analysts ’ concerns about higher costs related to its move to spend more for Web - delivered content as it expands its streamed content service .
Wedbush Morgan Securities
Inc analyst Michael Pachter also gave the company high marks for good service and for disclosing the problem quickly and said he estimated the outage could cost Netflix about $ 3 million or 3 cents per share -- assuming it was resolved on Thursday .
“ These costs could be offset by savings elsewhere , either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing , ” Pachter said .
The Software Freedom Law Center , which provides legal help to the free and open - source software community , has released a detailed document that describes how users and vendors can ensure they are in compliance with the open - source GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
Initially , GPL compliance was enforced through informal means , such as bulletin board discussions , but as Linux 's profile grew in ensuing years , enforcement efforts became more organized and ultimately entered the courts , the report notes .
It need not go that far , according to authors Bradley Kuhn , Aaron Williamson and Karen Sandler .
" We have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be , for the most part , easily avoided , " they wrote .
" We hope to educate the community of commercial distributors , redistributors , and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place , and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs . "
Among the lengthy report 's tips is a caution not to rely on " build gurus . "
" Too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product , " it states .
" Such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues , but it also endangers GPL compliance , which requires you to provide build scripts . "
Companies should also closely watch their software purchases to ensure they are compliant with the GPL , according to the report .
" The companies we contact about GPL violations often respond with : ' We did n't know there was GPL 'd stuff in there , ' " it states .
" Integration of third - party proprietary software typically requires a formal arrangement and management / legal oversight before the developers incorporate the software .
By contrast , your developers often obtain and integrate FOSS without intervention .
The ease of acquisition , however , does not mean the oversight is any less necessary . "
Palin links Iraq , 9/11 RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Offers discredited theory even Bush has abandoned While Sarah Palin 's first sit - down interview with ABC's Charles Gibson is generating its share of headlines for demonstrating a lack of foreign policy chops on the Alaska Governor 's part , her statements to a group of troops deploying for Iraq may show she 's even more out of touch .
The Washington Post reports she linked the Iraq War , now in its sixth year , to the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , in an address on the anniversary of the attacks .
FORT WAINWRIGHT , Alaska , Sept. 11 -- Gov. Sarah Palin linked the war in Iraq with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , telling an Iraq - bound brigade of soldiers that included her son that they would " defend the innocent from the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans . "
The idea that the Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein helped al - Qaeda plan the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , a view once promoted by Bush administration officials , has since been rejected even by the president himself .
But it is widely agreed that militants allied with al - Qaeda have taken root in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion .
" America can never go back to that false sense of security that came before September 11 , 2001 , " she said at the deployment ceremony , which drew hundreds of military families who walked from their homes on the sprawling post to the airstrip where the service was held .

Around 50,000 British holidaymakers are stranded overseas after the collapse of one of the UK 's biggest tour operators .
XL Leisure Group has grounded its fleet of planes after failing to secure a multi-million pound rescue package .
An operation is now under way to get customers home from places like Florida and the Caribbean .
XL Airways provided flights to more than 50 destinations across Europe , Africa and the US .
Passengers yet to travel should make alternative arrangements , while those already on holiday will be brought home on flights arranged by the Civil Aviation Authority .
Customers who booked through four tour operators - The Really Great Holiday Company , Kosmar Holidays , Freedom Flights , and Aspire Holidays - are protected under the Air Travel Organiser 's Licenses ( Atol ) scheme .
But those who booked direct with an XL Group company are urged to contact Atol immediately .
A company statement said : ' The companies entered into administration having suffered as a result of volatile fuel prices , the economic downturn , and were unable to obtain further funding .
' The joint administrators cannot continue trading the business and therefore all flights operated by the companies have been immediately cancelled and the aircraft grounded .
' Going forward , the joint administrators are unlikely to be able to trade the business or operate the aircraft . '
XL 's demise is the latest blow to the British travel industry and follows the collapse of budget airline Zoom last month .
Thousands of transatlantic passengers were left stranded after flights to and from Canada and the US were grounded as it called in the administrators .
Zoom blamed its financial woes on a jump in fuel bills as a result of the high cost of oil .
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 22 - The State of the implementations
( none )
Note :
This lesson is long outdated , and preserved for historical interest only .
The best way to stay informed about various Perl 6 compilers is to follow the blogs at http://planetsix.perl.org/.
Perl 6 is a language specification , and multiple compilers are being written that aim to implement Perl 6 , and partially they already do .
Pugs is a Perl 6 compiler written in Haskell .
It was started by Audrey Tang , and she also did most of the work .
In terms of implemented features it might still be the most advanced implementation today ( May 2009 ) .
To build and test pugs , you have to install GHC 6.10.1 first , and then run
svn co http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs cd pugs perl Makefile .
PL make make test
That will install some Haskell dependencies locally and then build pugs .
For make test you might need to install some Perl 5 modules , which you can do with cpan Task :: Smoke .
Pugs has n't been developed during the last three years , except occasional clean - ups of the build system .
Since the specification is evolving and Pugs is not updated , it is slowly drifting into obsoleteness .
Pugs can parse most common constructs , implements object orientation , basic regexes , nearly ( ? ) all control structures , basic user defined operators and macros , many builtins , contexts ( except slice context ) , junctions , basic multi dispatch and the reduction meta operator - based on the syntax of three years past .
Rakudo is a parrot based compiler for Perl 6 .
The main architect is Patrick Michaud , many features were implemented by Jonathan Worthington .
It is hosted on github , you can find build instructions on http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo.
Rakudo development is very active , it 's the most active Perl 6 compiler today .
It passes a bit more than 17,000 tests from the official test suite ( July 2009 ) .
It implements most control structures , most syntaxes for number literals , interpolation of scalars and closures , chained operators , BEGIN - and END blocks , pointy blocks , named , optional and slurpy arguments , sophisticated multi dispatch , large parts of the object system , regexes and grammars , Junctions , generic types , parametric roles , typed arrays and hashes , importing and exporting of subroutines and basic meta operators .
If you want to experiment with Perl 6 today , Rakudo is the recommended choice .
Mitchell Charity started elf , a bootstrapping compiler written in Perl 6 , with a grammar written in Ruby .
Currently it has a Perl 5 backend , others are in planning .
It lives in the pugs repository , once you 've checked it out you can go to misc / elf / and run ./ elf_f $ filename .
You 'll need ruby - 1.9 and some perl modules , about which elf will complain bitterly when they are not present .
elf is developed in bursts of activity followed by weeks of low activity , or even none at all .
It parses more than 70 % of the test suite , but implements mostly features that are easy to emulate with Perl 5 , and passes about 700 tests from the test suite .
Flavio Glock started KindaPerl6 ( short kp6 ) , a mostly bootstrapped Perl 6 compiler .
Since the bootstrapped version is much too slow to be fun to develop with , it is now waiting for a faster backend .
Kp6 implements object orientation , grammars and a few distinct features like lazy gather / take .
It also implements BEGIN blocks , which was one of the design goals .
v6 is a source filter for Perl 5 .
It was written by Flavio Glock , and supports basic Perl 6 plus grammars .
It is fairly stable and fast , and is occasionally enhanced .
It lives on the CPAN and in the pugs repository in perl5 /*/ .
Smop stands for Simple Meta Object Programming and does n't plan to implement all of Perl 6 , it is designed as a backend ( a little bit like parrot , but very different in both design and feature set ) .
Unlike the other implementations it aims explicitly at implementing Perl 6's powerful meta object programming facilities , ie the ability to plug in different object systems .
It is implemented in C and various domain specific languages .
It was designed and implemented by Daniel Ruoso , with help from Yuval Kogman ( design ) and Paweł Murias ( implementation , DSLs ) .
A grant from The Perl Foundation supports its development , and it currently approaches the stage where one could begin to emit code for it from another compiler .
It will then be used as a backend for either elf or kp6 , and perhaps also for pugs .
Larry Wall wrote a grammar for Perl 6 in Perl 6 .
He also wrote a cheating script named gimme5 , which translates that grammar to Perl 5 .
It can parse about every written and valid piece of Perl 6 that we know of , including the whole test suite ( apart from a few failures now and then when Larry accidentally broke something ) .
STD .pm lives in the pugs repository , and can be run and tested with perl - 5.10.0 installed in /usr / local / bin / perl and a few perl modules ( like YAML : :XS and Moose ) :
cd src/perl6 / make make testt # warning : takes lot of time , 80 minutes or so ./ tryfile $ your_file
It correctly parses custom operators and warns about non-existent subs , undeclared variables and multiple declarations of the same variable as well as about some Perl 5isms .
Many people ask why we need so many different implementations , and if it would n't be better to focus on one instead .
There are basically three answers to that .
Firstly that 's not how programming by volunteers work .
People sometimes either want to start something with the tools they like , or they think that one aspect of Perl 6 is not sufficiently honoured by the design of the existing implementations .
Then they start a new project .
The second possible answer is that the projects explore different areas of the vast Perl 6 language : SMOP explores meta object programming ( from which Rakudo will also benefit ) , Rakudo and parrot care a lot about efficient language interoperability , grammars and platform independence , kp6 explored BEGIN blocks , and pugs was the first implementation to explore the syntax , and many parts of the language for the first time .
The third answer is that we do n't want a single point of failure .
If we had just one implementation , and had severe problems with one of them for unforeseeable reasons ( technical , legal , personal , ... ) we have possible fallbacks .

WASHINGTON 
Though they hate to discuss it , Senators John McCain and Barack Obama are quietly planning what to do in the frenetic 77 - day period from the presidential election to Inauguration Day , so they will be ready to take up the reins of government .
Democrats said that John D. Podesta , a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton , was leading the transition preparations for Mr. Obama .
Mr. Podesta , who founded a lobbying firm with his brother in 1988 , is president of the Center for American Progress , a sort of government - in - exile waiting for Democrats to regain power .
At the McCain campaign , Republicans said , transition work is being coordinated by William E. Timmons , a longtime Washington lobbyist whose clients have included the American Petroleum Institute and the mortgage company Freddie Mac .
If Mr. McCain wins , Republicans said , his transition team will probably be led by Mr. Timmons and John F. Lehman , a McCain fund - raiser who was secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan .
Both campaigns refused to discuss their transition plans , saying they did not want to jinx their chances or appear too cocky .
The Obama campaign was stung in July when Republicans called Mr. Obama presumptuous for lining up transition advisers .
The shorelines of ancient Alberta , British Columbia and the Canadian Arctic were an important refuge for some of the world 's earliest animals , most of which were wiped out by a mysterious global extinction event some 252 million years ago .
U of C scientists have solved part of the mystery of where marine organisms that recovered from the biggest extinction on earth were housed .
A team of researchers , including Charles Henderson , a geoscience professor at the U of C , Tyler Beatty , a PhD candidate at the U of C and J - P Zonneveld , an associate professor at the U of A , discovered that the shorelines of ancient Canada provided a refuge for marine organisms that escaped annihilation during the Permian - Triassic extinction event .
" The boundary between the end of the Permian and beginning of the Triassic period saw unparalleled species loss in the marine realm , and biotic recovery was delayed relative to other mass extinctions , " says Henderson , in a paper published in the October edition of Geology .
" A major unresolved question has been discovering where the marine organisms that recovered from the extinction were housed . "
Henderson adds that this may not be the only refuge where life survived after the mass extinction , but it is the only area discovered to date .
During the Permian , all the world 's land masses joined together into a single supercontinent called Pangea .
Near the end of the Permian , during the mass extinction , about 95 per cent of all marine species and 70 per cent of land species died and the recovery of life on Earth took longer than other extinction events because so much biodiversity was lost .
There are several theories as to why this mass extinction event took place ranging from the heating of the Earth to a catastrophic event .
The authors favour major climate change since increased temperatures and elevated CO 2 levels are linked to oxygen stress that is key to the results of their research .
On land , the Permian period marked the expansion of reptiles and mammal - like reptiles .
Perhaps the most famous is Dimetrodon , a pre-dinosaur reptile , which grew to about 11 feet ( 3.5 metres ) and had what looked like a sail on its back .
Researchers have been studying the Permian - Triassic extinction event for years , but mostly in Greenland and south China where formations represent areas of deep water and have very low levels of oxygen .
The inter-university research team studied trace fossils along the ancient shorelines found in rock located in western Alberta , northeast British Columbia , and the barren landscapes of the Canadian Arctic .
Trace fossils preserve the activity of organisms and can be burrows or other actions created by the ancestors of modern worms and marine arthropods .
The dating of these shorelines is confirmed by the presence of distinct conodonts – a microfossil in which the passing of time is recorded by rapid evolutionary changes .
" These trace fossils present a record of ocean - bottom dwelling organisms and indicate locally well - oxygenated conditions in an ocean otherwise characterized by widespread anoxia , " says Beatty - the lead author .
" Within this habitable zone , the latest Permian extinction levels are reduced and the recovery time is minimized .
The findings support the idea that reduced oxygen levels is a major cause of why the recovery from Earth 's greatest extinction was delayed . "
The First Documentary Devoted to the Tom Feeney Vote - Rigging Scandal and BRAD BLOG'S Four Year Odyssey in Reporting it
SIGNED DVD ALSO AVAILABLE AS NEW PREMIUM TO READERS !
Brad Friedman Byon 9/27/2008 , 6:30 am PT
" After the Florida Election in 2000 , one man found himself on the wrong end of a smoking gun . "
That 's the tagline for Murder , Spies & Voting Lies : The Clint Curtis Story , the brand - new documentary film by Patty Sharaf which has now finally been released !
Kansas City
Star is among the first out of the box to review the film , calling it a " Must See ! " and declaring that it " plays like a high - tension political thriller . "
The terrifying feature - length documentary , shot in high - definition video , details , for the first time , the complete Clint Curtis / Tom Feeney / Yang Enterprises vote - rigging scandal , in all of its , yes , sometimes very gory detail .
It also tells a tale of the media , as it details my attempts to tell the story over the last four years , to a corrupt , detached , and too - often frightened corporate media .
The BRAD BLOG broke the Curtis story originally in late 2004 , and we 've been investigating and reporting on it ever since .
The DVD of MSVL is finally available for purchase at VotingLies.com and will also be premiering beginning this weekend on LinkTV , for those of you lucky enough to get the satellite TV channel .
See LinkTV's main Murder , Spies page for air dates and times , as well as an extended five - minute preview of the film .
Sharaf has been kind enough to offer the DVD --- signed by herself and myself --- available as our newest , and perhaps most appropriate , BRAD BLOG premium ever !
An online donation of $ 50 or more gets you your own copy !
( And just in time for Halloween ! )
Snail mail works as well , if you prefer to send a check to : Brad Friedman , 7095 Hollywood Blvd. , # 594 , Los Angeles , CA 90028 .
The support is greatly appreciated and very much needed .
LinkTV narrates their own 60 - second preview of MSVL below ...
For those who are n't familiar with the remarkable Curtis / Feeney story of the Florida software programmer who says he was asked by a powerful Republican to create vote - rigging software , where have you been ?
See this summary version for the quick details .
For those who are familiar with the story , you will learn details in MSVL you never knew , along with new interviews on the case from Gore Vidal , reporter Bob Fitrakis , computer security expert Harri Hursti , whistleblower Steve Heller , Curtis co-worker Mavis Georgalis , and many more !
While the Curtis story has been told , often beautifully , in a number of other documentaries , such as Uncounted : The New Math of American Elections and Stealing America : Vote - by - Vote , this is the first to go all the way into all of the frightening details underscoring this case , including the mysterious death of Florida 's Inspector General Raymond Lemme while investigating the allegations , and the bizarre case of the convicted Chinese spy , Hai Lin " Henry " Nee , who worked at the firm with Curtis .
A few quotes from some of the early reviews :
" Must see !... Plays like a high - tension political thriller ... Amazingly elaborate and detailed ... Want to get hoppin ' mad ?
This 'll do it ... Let 's hear it for paper ballots . "
- Bob Butler , Kansas City Star " Alfred Hitchcock would have chosen this , if the fact that it 's true did n't scare him too much ...
The crime that dare not speak its name : Election Fraud . " - Mimi " Dharma & Greg " Kennedy , National Chair of PDA " Well done , covers so much well , and airs unexplored aspects of our election nightmare .
Definitely one of the best of the genre . " - John Ennis , filmmaker Free For All
The film is also screening at a number of upcoming film - festivals around the country , including the New Jersey Film Festival this weekend .
See the MSVL website for dates & times .
Four years later , I 'm happy to still be here to see the release of the film , quite frankly .

LOPEZ ISLAND , Wash . --
To have his hogs butchered legally , farmer Bruce Dunlop could haul his animals by ferry and truck 150 miles to the nearest federally sanctioned slaughterhouse .
Instead , he just calls on his friendly roving neighborhood slaughterhouse .
Up rolls a diesel truck pulling an 8 - by - 12 - foot trailer fitted with a sink , a 300 - gallon water tank and a cooling locker with carcass hooks .
A butcher in a floor - length apron kills , skins , guts and trims the pigs into slabs of meat that are then hung in the cooler and trundled to a packaging plant .
Soon the meat is stocked in the freezers of shops on the island and across Washington state and Oregon .
It 's not exactly meals on wheels .
But Lopez Island 's mobile slaughterhouse -- the first to be sanctioned by the U.S. Agriculture Department -- now shuttles from farm to farm three or four days a week , collecting fresh carcasses of cows , pigs and sheep that will become steaks , sausage , bacon and hamburgers .
Without the rolling abattoir , says Mr. Dunlop , 53 years old , " we 'd be pretty much out of luck . "
Federal rules and consolidation of the nation 's meatpacking industry have made it increasingly costly and cumbersome for small farmers to bring their animals to slaughter .
According to the rules , animals intended to be sold as meat must be killed at a slaughterhouse with a federal inspector present .
( Some states allow state inspectors to do the job . )
Lauren Etter / The Wall Street Journal Lopez Island 's mobile slaughterhouse parked at Bruce Dunlop 's farm .
But the number of plants under federal inspection has dwindled to 808 nationwide , down from 1,750 three decades ago .
Today , many farmers and ranchers must travel hundreds of miles or out - of - state for a legal slaughterhouse .
Wyoming , for example , has no plants under federal inspection .
It has 27 with state inspectors , but under federal law , the meat can't be shipped across state lines .
On this island off the coast of Washington , a group of about 15 farmers decided that , rather than haul animals to a slaughterhouse in Sumner , Wash . , they 'd bring a slaughterhouse to their animals .
Mr. Dunlop , originally from Montreal , moved to his idyllic , 75 - acre farm 12 years ago , fulfilling a lifelong dream .
He began making and selling gourmet foods like marionberry syrup and apple - peach chutney .
Lauren Etter / The Wall Street Journal Carcasses hung in the a cooling locker .
He also started raising hogs and sheep .
He sold them to neighbors who had them carved by a " custom butcher . "
Federal law allows a butcher to slaughter an animal without an inspector present so long as the meat is n't offered for sale .
Mr. Dunlop and others on Lopez Island saw an opportunity to supply meat to consumers who 've grown more conscious of how and where their food is produced .
Farmers ' markets and health - food stores have proliferated , nudging organic and locally grown food into the mainstream .
Lopez Island restaurants and groceries began offering island - grown fruits and vegetables .
" All of a sudden there 's a customer demand and there 's farmers to produce it and the infrastructure " was n't readily available , Mr. Dunlop says .
The farmers discussed building a brick - and - mortar slaughterhouse , but their neighbors stymied that .
Then Mr. Dunlop heard about a Texas rancher who slaughtered antelope in a trailer ( with state but not federal approval ) .
He headed south to learn about it .
Lauren Etter / The Wall Street Journal Bruce Dunlop 's herd of sheep cross a road .
In 2000 , the farmers formed the Island Grown Farmers Cooperative with the help of Lopez Community Land Trust , a nonprofit group dedicated to sustainable agriculture and affordable housing .
They designed a prototype mobile slaughterhouse and submitted it for U.S. Agriculture Department approval .
At first , the agency was wary , having never approved such a thing before , says Gregory Sherman , an Agriculture Department supervisor in Everett , Wash. , who took part in evaluating the application .
" It was certainly unique , " Mr. Sherman says .
" But we did n't want to just say , ' Sorry , you can't do this ' because it had n't been done before . "
The Agriculture Department approved the unit in 2002 after determining that there was sufficient need and that farmers could dispose of waste through composting .
The cooperative hired two butchers , and the Agriculture Department assigned an inspector who would follow the slaughterhouse around .
To pay for butchers and other expenses , the cooperative charges a fee for each animal killed : $ 105 for a cow , $ 53 for a pig , $ 37 for a sheep .
At the crack of dawn one morning recently , the mobile unit pulled up behind a pickup truck at Mr. Dunlop 's farm , a lively hollow where goats munched on wild roses and hogs rolled in mud .
Mr. Dunlop rounded up 10 of his 50 hogs .
Butcher Dave Soler , a husky 24 - year - old in a belt ringed with half a dozen knives and a sharpener , pulled on his apron and knee - high rubber boots .
Jim Donaldson , the Agriculture Department inspector , put on a hard hat and lab coat .
Lauren Etter / The Wall Street Journal
From a small straw - lined pen attached to an old barn , Mr. Dunlop guided each animal into a wooden corral .
" Here , pig , " he cooed at one , shaking a bucket of corn pellets .
In a flash , Mr. Soler stunned the animal with a bolt gun , then cut its throat and hoisted it into the trailer with a winch .
He stripped off the hide , and Mr. Donaldson inspected the pig 's organs to ensure it was healthy .
Within an hour , the hog 's carcass was hanging in the locker .
By around 1 p.m. , the other nine hogs had been butchered .
Mr. Soler took off his blood - soaked apron , climbed into the co-op 's white Ford pickup and steered the trailer 50 miles to a packaging plant in Bow , Wash .
The meat would be processed , vacuum - packed , labeled and sold in the co-op 's retail outlet in Bow .
Some products would also be distributed on the island .
At Blossom Grocery , an island health - food store , the freezer is packed with sausage , steaks and other cuts from animals killed in the mobile unit .
At the Bay Café , chef and owner Daren Holscher says he features island meat on his menu as often as possible .
Still , some of his lamb comes from New Zealand because the supply is more consistent and costs less , he says , even with fuel and shipping costs .
Scott Meyers of Sweet Grass Farm Beef started raising Japanese Wagyu cattle on his grass pasture once the mobile unit was up and running .
" It gave me access to the marketplace , " he says .
" Without that , I would n't have even considered " raising beef .
Mr. Meyers says the mobile unit offers his animals a " sublime " death because they avoid the stress of traveling long distances .
Such care makes his beef taste better , he says , as he introduces part of his herd : " This one 's Violet , here 's Splits and Buttercup . "

19 Cool Inventions That Are n't Likely To Make Anyone Rich
Mint.Com Success Story
To the Editor :
“ Mom and Dad Are Cleared , but Junior ’s Another Story ” ( “ On the Road ” column , Sept. 9 ) , about children being delayed for hours from flying because they have names similar to ones on the federal terrorist watch list , was frightening to me .
These children and their parents are effectively second - class citizens , requiring special clearance each time they fly .
The lists are grossly flawed , and the procedures to correct them completely inadequate .
Since some of the procedures that could prevent such travesties are as simple as listing the ages of actual persons on the federal watch list , who are presumably almost all adults or at least teenagers , it seems that our government does not really care .
This could get much worse .
Within a few years , we are likely to have some sort of national identification system , and the government will be able to check the names of everyone boarding a train or bus ; will we then have no -ride rules also ?

A War Criminal in Academia
By David Swanson
The Miller Center on Public Affairs at the University of Virginia has invited a war criminal to speak on October 27 , 2008 , on the topic of “ War and Decision : Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism . ”
Georgetown University employs the very same war criminal as a “ Professor and Distinguished Practitioner in National Security Policy . ”
Harvard University ’s Kennedy School of Government has made him a “ Belfer Center Visiting Scholar . ”
And to Stanford University he ’s a “ Distinguished Visiting Fellow of the Hoover Institution . ”
The man ’s name is Douglas Feith .
Feith was the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy from 2001 to 2005 .
Nine days after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Feith drafted a memo proposing “ deliberately selecting a non-al Qaeda target like Iraq . ”
Feith had signed the letter from the Project for a New American Century to President Clinton in 1998 urging him to attack Iraq .
And in 1996 Feith had worked with Richard Perle on a report for then - Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu that advocated removing Saddam Hussein from power .
Feith ’s work after September 11 , 2001 , quickly became the manufature of pseudo - evidence pretending to link al Qaeda to Iraq .
Feith created , cherry picked , and distorted information , and pressured others to do the same , to help build a false case for an illegal war of aggression .
And he did n’t even do so from within an agency legally permitted to engage in so - called intelligence work .
He did so from within the Pentagon where he set up a parallel intelligence operation with the role of producing what Cheney and Bush wanted but could n’t get from the other intelligence agencies .
Feith ’s operation was called the Office of Special Plans .
In 2002 , Feith and gang produced a slideshow purporting to show that Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda were working together and had been for years .
The slideshow began by explaining why the legal intelligence agencies had it all wrong .
Feith relied on a witness named Curveball who had spoken with the German government , which found him not credible .
Based on the pretense that Curveball was providing good information , Feith claimed al Qaeda and Iraqi officials had met .
And he made claims of this nature in presentations to the White House that he omited from presentations to the intelligence agencies .
Most of this has been documented in a report by the inspector general of the Department of Defense .
Karen Kwiatkowski , who worked with Feith in the Pentagon , has also spoken out about his crimes and abuses .
She has spoken about this at an event organized by the Charlottesville Center for Peace and Justice , but as far as I know the Miller Center has never invited her to speak .

While he was able to compile a nearly 400 - page report exposing the fundamentally flawed , politically motivated processes that led to the unjustified firings of nine US Attorneys , Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine says more details of the scandal remain unknown .
Officials like Karl Rove and Harriet Miers , who have refused to cooperate with separate investigations from the IG and Congress , should be compelled to answer to a federal prosecutor , Fine told lawmakers Friday .
Rove , Miers and several other White House officials refused to cooperate making it impossible " to fully investigate all of the reasons for the removal of the US attorneys , " Fine told the House Judiciary Committee , responding to questions about his lengthy report released Monday .
" We were not able to uncover all the facts , " he said , " and we believe the prosecutor ought to look at them . "
Attorney General Michael Mukasey has appointed a special prosecutor to follow up on Fine 's report .

Audio : Financial crisis blame game gets more Savage
by Jeremy Hooper
First we saw Maine 's Michael Heath connect gays ( and God 's wrath ) to the financial crisis .
Then we saw the Liberty Counsel warn Google that their gay acceptance would also have a fiscal impact .
Now unhinged radio host Michael Savage ( neé Weiner ) has his turn :
Eh , he plays a role .
Every civil rights battle has a heated , vitriolic figurehead who rails against the side of peaceful , reasoned progress , and Michael Savage is one of our fight 's most prominent .
So now , rather than get angry , we almost want to thank him .
For in twenty years , when we prepare our historical documentary on the gay marriage battle , we 're going to need clear - cut examples of the unscrupulous hate that still managed to infect the early 21st century .
No on gives better biting soundbite than Michael Savage !
After railing against gay marriage , Savage said " the spiritual side of the downturn on Wall Street was directly related to the moral downturn " [ Media Matters ]
Your thoughts
Yes .
Why should we mock the fetus ?
God damn it gays , stop mocking the fetus !!!!!!!!!!
Posted by : Stef | Oct 3 , 2008 12:09:19 PM
But ... I like to mock the fetus !
Does this mean I have to become gay now ?
I do n't know if I want to wear assless chaps & a ballgag to mock the fetus .
Decisions , decisions ...

Why does this man still have a platform ?
Mock the fetus ?
Sounds like a bad techno song .
And what does he mean the goverment should n't be forcing him to deal with it ?
That would be the government forcing heteros into homo marriages against their will .
THAT would be forcing .
What a complete and total moron .

A guest post by Daniel Donahoo
It was all Alan Becker ’s fault .
And I do n’t even know who he is .
All I know about him is he has a site at deviant art and created a fantastic animation titled “ Animation vs Animator ” ( which of course prompted the subsequent action - animation sequel - “ Animation vs
Animator 2 – The Chosen One ” )
I showed it to my two boys and they were amazed .
They watched it three times in a row and it got me thinking about some animation freeware I ’d downloaded a while back .
So , I squeezed between them and opened up
Pivot Stick Figure Animator .
I ’d found Pivot sometime ago .
It is a simple stick figure animation tool that appeals to those of us who “ let ourselves go ” in the design software department once we had kids .
You know , back in the late 1990s when you were the only person in your family to have a website and then this thing called pregnancy appeared and before we knew it Macromedia had re-developed Dreamweaver and Flash so much that we ’d lost our capacity to use them ( and our desire to re-learn them ) .
My idea was simply to show my boys how the animation was created through a demonstration , give them an idea about the amount of work it required to create what Alan Becker had created .
Pivot makes creating individual frames really easy , and moving animations is based on a simple click and drag process .
Each figure has different points ( red dots ) that can be manipulated and a single point ( yellow dot ) to move the whole figure .
A simple left - hand - side toolbar has about 5 or 6 options which are simple to grasp and not overwhelming for young users .
So I began to create a stick figure waving at us from the computer screen and within a couple of minutes I had about 5 - 10 seconds of animation .
Within 5 minutes , my four year old and six year old were asking for a turn .
They mastered the basic concept very quickly .
Together we worked out you could insert any jpg background from the hard - drive and they were away .
Despite my own beliefs in the capacity of children and their ability to do things that we never acknowledge ( so never see them do ) , I was amazed at the speed at which they picked up the basic concepts using Pivot .
After a few days they had realized they could create their own stick figures to animate and had begun to use the simple drawing tool to save their own stick figure props like beds , cannons and barbells .
So , the benefits of Pivot for kids are :
Simple Click and Drag animation :
The click and drag style of animation that leaves a “ shadow ” of the previous position of the arm , leg , whatever until you click .
Speed :
The nature of the one click frame creation combined with the click and drag animation style means results can be achieved quickly .
This is important , especially for kids in the early primary years .
A range of simple functions : Single click functions that allow a change of size and color which add to the animation pleasure .
My eldest worked out by increasing the size of an animation over many frames makes it look like it grows .
Extending aspects :
There is an extension area that allows you to design your own “ stick figures ” and import them into your animation .
The program saves the files as animated gifs – which is delightfully old school – but I have been experimenting with possible conversion tools and you can get some slightly pixilated , but decent avi files out of it .
The reason for this is my boys now want to include sound effects .
So , I ’m looking for a simple video editing tool so we can see if they can manage that .

Wow , CNN grew a few .
Good for them .
AP apparently protested as well .
Yes , Virginia , there is a media .
And it ’s starting to wake up .
I ’m really shocked that CNN did this .
CNN was the network providing television coverage for all the networks , and after McCain ’s people said there would be no coverage of Palin ’s actual substantive ( if you ’d call it that ) conversations with world leaders , CNN pulled the plug .
Wow .
Here ’s AP ’s coverage , it ’s good :
Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , who has not held a press conference in nearly four weeks of campaigning , on Tuesday banned reporters from her first meetings with world leaders , allowing access only to photographers and a television crew .
CNN , which was providing the television coverage for news organizations , decided to pull its TV crew , effectively denying Palin the high visibility she had sought .
Palin planned to meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe in New York on Tuesday as the United Nations General Assembly convenes this week .
She also was expected to meet with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger .
Those sessions and meetings scheduled for Wednesday are part of the Republican campaign ’s effort to give Palin experience in foreign affairs .
She has never met a foreign head of state and first traveled outside North America just last year .
Huff
Post has more , and notes that the media also seems to have gotten ticked at McCain this morning for refusing to take questions .
Well here ’s an idea : Stop covering him .
Pull your reporters on the McCain ’s bus ( well , they ’re no longer in the bus at all , now they follow in vans ) and stop covering McCain as there is nothing to cover .
That will get his attention .
MILLBRAE , Calif . 
The computer and printer maker Hewlett - Packard announced on Monday that it would eliminate 24,600 jobs , or 7.5 percent of its work force , as part of its plan for digesting the computer services giant Electronic Data Systems , which it acquired for $ 13.9 billion in August .
“ I think most of you that follow us know I am a big believer that having the most efficient cost structure directly relates to your ability to scale and grow , ” Mark V. Hurd , Hewlett - Packard ’s chief executive , told securities analysts gathered at a hotel here , near San Francisco ’s airport .
Almost half of the job cuts will occur in the United States .
The company , based in Palo Alto , Calif. , said it expected the reorganization to result in annual cost reductions of nearly $ 1.8 billion .
It said it would record a $ 1.7 billion charge in the fourth quarter tied to the layoffs .
The layoffs are the start of a three - year plan in which Hewlett - Packard will try to unify its existing services business with its new acquisition .
Up to half of the eliminated positions may be refilled over the course of the reorganization , it said .
Terminator : A Hardcore “ Timeout ” For Ruby Code
By Peter Cooper
Terminator is a new library developed by Ara Howard and Mikel Lindsaar that solves the problem of Ruby 's own " timeout " feature not actually being up to the task of terminating code .
timeout is supposed to terminate the execution of a block of code if it's not finished within a certain amount of time , but due to Ruby 's threading model it does n't always work that way !
Initially , Mikel considered SystemTimer - another replacement for timeout .
SystemTimer is based upon UNIX alarm signals and , for some reason , still did n't resolve the main problem ( although SystemTimer has ridiculously good documentation and is clearly working well for someone ) .
After lamenting on the Ruby - Talk mailing list , Ara Howard stepped in with a potential solution which turned into what is now Terminator .
Terminator works by starting up another Ruby instance that tracks the PID of the Ruby instance that spawned it .
Windows is currently not supported .
Read an interview with one of U.S. Bank 's Executives about how their hiring strategy has changed their business from the top down .
The following is republished from The Tech Times # 207 .
An exciting development in the world of DOM scripting is the W3C Selector API .
Up until now , using the DOM Level 2 API , the only way to obtain references to HTML elements in the DOM was to use either document .
getElementById or document.getElementsByTagName and filter the results manually .
With the rise of CSS , JavaScript programmers asked the obvious question , “ If the browser has a really fast way of selecting HTML elements that match CSS selectors why ca n’t we ? ” .
The Selector API defines the querySelector , and querySelectorAll methods that take a CSS selector string and return the first matching element or a StaticNodeList of matching elements , respectively .
The methods can be called from the document object in order to select elements from the whole document or a specific HTML element to select only from descendants of that element .
To illustrate how much easier your life will be using the Selector API , have a look at this example HTML :
< ul id =" menu " > < li > < input type=" checkbox " name = " item1_done " id =" item1_done " > < label for =" item1_done " > bread</ label > </ li > < li class=" important " > < input type=" checkbox " name = " item2_done " id =" item2_done " > < label for =" item2_done " > milk</label > </li > <!-- imagine more items --> </ul >
Our task is to check all the checkboxes for the list items that have the class “ important “ .
Using only DOM Level 2 methods we could do it this way :
var items = document.getElementById(' menu').getElementsByTagName( ' li ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i < items.length ; i++) { if ( items[i].className.match(/important / ) ) { if ( items[i].firstChild.type == " checkbox " ) { items[i].firstChild.checked = true ; } } }
Using the new selector API we can simplify it to this :
var items = document.querySelectorAll( '# menu li.important input[type=" checkbox " ] ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i < items.length ; i++) { items [ i ]. checked = true ; }
That ’s much nicer !
The methods also support selector grouping — multiple selectors separated by commas .
The Selector API is working right now in Safari 3.1 , the Internet Explorer 8 beta , and Firefox 3.1 alpha1 .
Opera is also working on adding support for the API .
If you ’re a fan of one of the many JavaScript libraries available you ’re probably thinking “ But , I can already do that . ”
One of the great examples of the benefits of using JavaScript libraries are the implementations of CSS selectors found in nearly all of them .
Recently we ’ve seen huge speed improvements in the CSS selector implementations because library authors have been sharing their techniques .
So what ’s the benefit of using the Selector API ?
In a word : speed — native implementations are fast !
And better yet all of the javascript libraries are poised to benefit .
jQuery and Prototype are already developing implementations that make use of the Selector API , while The Dojo Toolkit , DOMAssistant and base2 have already made use of it .
There ’s a reason why those 3 libraries were the first ones to benefit .
Kevin talked about the potential problem back in Tech Times # 190 in the article titled “ Is Your JavaScript Library Standards Compliant ? ”
The Selector API makes use of standard CSS selectors so if the browser does n’t support a certain selector then you wo n’t be able to use it .
The libraries that have already taken advantage of the Selector API are those that only supported standard CSS selectors .
For those libraries , supporting the API was ( almost ) as easy as doing this :
if(document.querySelector ) { return document.querySelector( selector ) ; } else { return oldSelectorFunction ( selector ) ; }
Libraries that support custom selectors will have more work to do .
The risk is that if you have used custom CSS selectors extensively in your project , it may be difficult for your chosen library to pass on the speed benefit to you because the library will have to use its default selector instead of the Selector API .
If the library somehow rewires its custom selectors so that they can utilize the Selector API , the secondary risk is increased code bloat .
Hopefully the Selector API will encourage the use of standard CSS selectors over custom ones .
In fact if uptake of the new browser versions is good and the performance benefits of the new Selector API are compelling enough we could see custom selector functionality moved to supplementary libraries you only need to use in case of legacy compatibility requirements .
Dean Edwards ’ base2 Library has the nicest implementation in my opinion .
Base2 implements the API exactly , which means you can write your JavaScript using standard the standard API methods — Base2 only creates custom querySelector and querySelectorAll methods if the browser does n’t support them .
You ca n’t get any cleaner than that .
Base2 does , however , implement the non-standard “ != ” attribute selector in it ’s custom selector function , apparently because of peer pressure , so it ’ll have to have points deducted for that .
Regardless of whether you use a JavaScript library or roll your own , the new browser implementations of the Selector API give everyone an instant speed boost .
We all win , hooray !

Researchers have discovered two new genes that increase the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) in childhood .
While further study is needed to identify the specific disease - causing mutations in these new genes , the researchers say the genes are particularly strong candidates to be added to the list of genes already known to affect IBD .
" As we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex , chronic disease , we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patient 's genetic profile , " said co-first author Robert N. Baldassano , M.D. , director of the Center for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease at The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .
" We will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes , " added study leader Hakon Hakonarson , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of the Center for Applied Genomics at Children 's Hospital .
" We strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development , given what 's known about its biology . "
Both authors direct research programs at Children 's Hospital and are also faculty members of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
Their study , performed in collaboration with researchers from the Medical College of Wisconsin , The University of Utah , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital and two research hospitals in Italy , appears in advance online publication Aug. 31 in Nature Genetics .
IBD is a painful , chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract , affecting about two million children and adults in the United States .
Of that number , about half suffer from Crohn 's disease , which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract , and half have ulcerative colitis , which is limited to the large intestine .
IBD that begins in childhood tends to be more severe than adult - onset disease , and is more likely to affect the colon than other areas of the GI tract .
Those age - related differences in IBD spurred the current research team to do their gene hunting in childhood - onset disease .
" Although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric IBD than in adult - onset IBD , we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood , " said Baldassano .

The researchers performed a genome - wide association study , searching for genetic variations in DNA samples from 1,000 patients with childhood - onset IBD , compared to samples from 4,250 healthy subjects .
Both patients and controls were of European ancestry .
In addition to finding gene variations previously reported by other groups , the study team identified two novel gene variants , one on chromosome 20 and the other on chromosome 21 .
They then replicated their findings with studies using additional samples from other sources .
The researchers say that the TNFRSF6B gene on chromosome 20 is a compelling candidate , because it is already known to participate in the biological pathway of a protein called tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) .
TNF is a cytokine , a chemical messenger that plays a key role in the harmful inflammation characteristic of IBD .
Some current treatments for IBD use monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind to a type of TNF involved in the disease ( Among those drugs are infliximab , adalimumab and certolizumab ) .
" As we better understand the complex gene interactions in IBD , we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti-TNF drugs , " said Hakonarson .
Anti-TNF medications such as those mentioned above are currently given intravenously or as injections , said Baldassano , who added , " If better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-TNF drugs in pill form , the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient . "
The study team also found an association between ulcerative colitis and genes on the major histocompatiblity complex ( MHC ) on chromosome 6 .
The MHC is a large group of genes with important roles in the immune system , and this finding may help refine diagnostic techniques that would allow physicians to administer more specific therapies to their patients .
Financial support for the study came from the National Institutes of Health , the IBD Family Research Council , the Crohn 's and Colitis Foundation of America , the Koss Foundation , the NIH General Clinical Research Center of the Medical College of Wisconsin , the Primary Children 's Medical Center Foundation , the Edmunds Fund , the Heineman Foundation , the Cotswold Foundation , and The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , which funded all genotyping performed in the study .
Baldassano's and Hakonarson 's co-authors included Struan Grant , Ph.D. , Jonathan Bradfield , Ph.D. , David A. Piccoli , M.D. , Petar Mamula , M.D. , Robert Grundmeier , M.D. , and Dimitri Monos , Ph.D. , all of Children 's Hospital .
Other co-authors were Subra Kugathasan , M.D. ( formerly of the Medical College of Wisconsin and currently at Emory University ) , who is co-first author with Baldassano ; Stephen Guthery , M.D. , of the University of Utah ; Gitit Tomer , M.D. , and Lee Denson , M.D. , of Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ; Salvatore Cucchiara , M.D. , Ph.D. , of Sapienza University , Rome , Italy ; and Vito Annese , M.D. , of " Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza " Hospital , San Giovanni Rotondo , Italy .
Faced with Iraqi anger over a US plan to enable Washington to keep military forces in the country indefinitely , George Bush is offering concessions to the government of Nouri al - Maliki in an effort to salvage an agreement , it emerged yesterday .
The proposed terms of the impending deal , which were first revealed in The Independent , have had a predictably explosive political effect inside Iraq .
Negotiations between Washington and Baghdad grew fraught , with Iraqi politicians denouncing US demands to maintain a permanent grip on the country through the establishment of permanent military bases .
Officials complained that the plan which allows US troops to occupy permanent bases , conduct military operations , arrest Iraqis and enjoy immunity from Iraqi law , would turn Iraq into a colony of the US , and create the conditions for unending conflict both in Iraq and the Middle East .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With Washington 's Iraqi allies rising up in revolt against the plans , Mr Bush ordered a negotiating shift this weekend after speaking to Mr Maliki , the Iraqi Prime Minister .
" Now the American position is much more positive and more flexible than before , " a leading Iraqi negotiator in the talks was quoted as saying .
Senior Iraqi officials want a major reduction of the US military footprint in Iraq as soon as the UN Security Council mandate approving their presence expires at the end of the year .
Iraqi officials also want US forces confined to barracks unless the Iraqis ask for their assistance .
Emboldened by recent successes by Iraqi security forces , many officials want the US troops to leave altogether .
President Bush , who is on a farewell tour of Europe , wants a new agreement sealed by the end of next month so he can declare a military victory in Iraq and say his 2003 invasion has been vindicated before he leaves office .
But any long - term settlement to maintain US forces in Iraq would cut the ground from under the Democratic presidential nominee , Barack Obama , who has promised to withdraw US troops if he is elected in November .
The Bush administration says a new agreement is needed to ensure stability in Iraq , as without one or an extended UN mandate , there would be no legal basis for US forces to remain .
The growing Iraqi anger with the proposal was front - page news in the US yesterday .
Sami al - Askari , a senior Shia politician close to Mr Maliki told The Washington Post : " The Americans are making demands that would lead to the colonisation of Iraq ...
If we can't reach a fair agreement , many people think we should say , ' Goodbye , US troops .
We do n't need you here any more . ' "
The Democrat - controlled Congress is also uneasy about President Bush 's attempt to impose a colonial - style mandate on Iraq .
Both Democrats and Republicans have questioned Mr Bush 's assertion that he does not require congressional approval for the proposed agreement .

The argument is focused on negotiations on a status of forces agreement defining the legal rights and responsibilities of US forces .
As framed , it gives the US military free reign to operate in the country .
There is also proposed " security framework " covering the relationship between the US and Iraq .
Momentum is also growing within the Maliki administration for the US to leave altogether .
Mr Maliki was in Iran this week where the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told him not to sign up to any long - term security deals with Washington .
The agreement is being negotiated by David Satterfield , the US State Department 's top adviser on Iraq , who still maintains it can be initialled by a July deadline which Mr Bush set last year last year .
" It 's doable , " he told reporters in Baghdad .
" We think it 's an achievable goal . "
At a news conference , Mr Satterfield kept repeating that the US wants only to create a more independent Iraq .
" We want to see Iraqi sovereignty strengthened , not weakened , " he said .
But Iraqis say that US demands for long - term military bases in the country even if the numbers are reduced , give the lie to that assertion .
US negotiatiors are also determined to maintain policies that allow them to arrest Iraqis without the approval of Iraqi courts , maintaining immunity for US troops and contractors from Iraqi prosecution and carrying out military operations without the Iraqi government 's knowledge or approval .
Washington also wants to retain control over Iraqi airspace and the right to refuel planes in the air , which has raised concerns that President Bush wants to have the option of using Iraq as a base to attack Iran .
It rained a lot in Alaska this summer — even more than usual — and it was a cold summer , too .
The sun does n’t set on much of the state between mid-June and mid-July , but the weather was such that if you came from Outside , which is how Alaskans refer to the rest of the United States , and you happened to visit on a day that was fair , people would thank you for bringing the sunshine .
If you were there to inquire into the political situation , people thanked you for that , too .
They thanked you for coming , for hearing them out , and for not treating their story as a national joke .
Many Alaskans enjoy being disconnected from the Lower Forty - eight , which is sometimes referred to as if it were a foreign country .
There is pride in this sense of apartness , and that pride has been stung repeatedly since 2006 , when the F.B.I. began raiding state lawmakers ’ offices in an ever - expanding anti-corruption campaign .
There have been indictments and guilty pleas .
Oil - industry executives who were caught on videotape in the Baranof Hotel , in Juneau , the state capital , giving cash handouts to a state legislator have coöperated in pointing out other state legislators who liked to get paid before voting on oil - industry tax rates .
Last year , the F.B.I. hit the home of Ted Stevens , Alaska ’s six - term senator , and he became a favorite figure of ridicule on “ The Daily Show ” : an angry little man , with an uncanny resemblance to Mr. Magoo , who had once made himself seem even older than his eighty - plus years by describing the Internet as “ a series of tubes ” ; Jon Stewart called him a “ coot , ” and portrayed him as a bully and a crook .
As I travelled around Alaska in mid-August , Alaskans wanted me to understand that , sadly , he might well be all of that — and a very good thing for the state , too .
Palin was elected governor just as the corruption scandal broke , and quickly took the opportunity to proclaim herself a reformer .

I booked a flight to the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport shortly after Stevens was indicted on , and pleaded not guilty to , seven felony charges for failing to report more than a quarter of a million dollars in gifts from the same oilmen who had bought much of the state legislature .
I had to change planes in Las Vegas , but when I got there I was told that my flight to Anchorage had been cancelled , on account of a volcano in the Aleutian Islands that had erupted and “ burped ” — the technical term — a gigantic cloud of ash into the lower stratosphere .
The cloud had drifted in a northeasterly direction and occupied much of the airspace over the Gulf of Alaska .
More than five thousand travellers were stranded as a result .
The next day , when the cloud moved and I completed my journey , I learned that , after a similar belch of ash choked out all four engines of a K.L.M. flight into Anchorage in 1989 , Ted Stevens finagled an earmark on an appropriations bill to secure federal funds for the Alaska Volcano Observatory , whose missions included the monitoring of volcanic activity and its attendant hazards .
The Alaska Volcano Observatory became a punch line on “ The West Wing , ” mocked as a ludicrous example of congressional pork , which is how it might sound until you think about your plane crashing .
So Ted Stevens may have saved my life — and that was something a great many Alaskans could say as they looked about at the roads and bridges , the hospitals and flood - control systems , the satellite weather and global - positioning relay stations , the sprawling Army and Air Force bases , the rural landing strips and postal air - cargo flights that sustain existence in Alaska as it enters its fiftieth year of statehood .
Much of this infrastructure was the result of Stevens ’s work on the Senate Appropriations and Armed Services Committees and its Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , and he made no apologies for his transactional approach to politics . *
On the contrary , as he brought Alaska the highest number of federal dollars per capita in the nation , he boasted that he was doing his job .
Still , Stevens ’s decision to launch a reëlection campaign in the middle of a federal investigation required more than ordinary moxie .
The oilman at the center of the corruption scandal , Bill Allen , had agreed to testify against Stevens .
The two men had once shared ownership of a racehorse , and had counted themselves good friends .
Allen , a former welder and oilfield superintendent who came to Alaska from Texas and built a billion - dollar oilfield - services company , Veco Corporation , liked to be around other powerful men .
He liked them to need him , and he had already claimed under oath that he had bribed Stevens ’s son , Ben , a former state senator with a reputation for profiteering from government contracts his father had a hand in .
For instance , Ben Stevens had received seven hundred and fifteen thousand dollars over three years from the Special Olympics , as the chief executive of the 2001 Winter Games in Anchorage , for which his father had brought millions of dollars in federal aid .
Conflicted interests also hung heavily over Ben Stevens ’s dealings regarding Alaska ’s fisheries .
He has said that he has done nothing illegal , yet the speculation in Alaska was not whether , but when , indictments would drop on him , and how they might affect his father ’s fate .
( Everyone was waiting , too , for charges to be filed against the state ’s only congressman , Don Young , a man so ornery that he makes Stevens look affable .
Young , who is seventy - five and has been in office almost as long as Stevens , was also running for reëlection , and he had so far spent more than a million dollars from his campaign war chest on lawyers , an expense that he would not explain except to say that being investigated gets pricey . )
With so much trouble encompassing Stevens , the desire for a seventh term had a brazen air of unreality about it .
At his age ?
Why not go gently ?
That would not be the way of Ted Stevens , the dominant figure of Alaska ’s fifty - year existence as a state .
He is a man given to rages — he has said that they are an effective way to get what he wanted , and “ I do n’t lose my temper .
I always know where it is . ”
He is also a man used to having enormous clout .
On the eve of the millennium , he was named “ Alaskan of the century , ” and he is known as Alaska ’s Senator - for - Life .
Before his last run for office , he told the Anchorage newspaperman Michael Carey , “ I just want people to understand the commitment I ’m making if I stay on .
This is a period I could go out and make a million dollars a year , without any question . ”
Stevens had by then made a lot of people rich .
Evidently , he felt underpaid , and Bill Allen had been there to help out .
This time around , his humble pitch to voters is : I ’ve always been there for you ; now I need you to come through for me .

“ It ’s the most momentous political season I ’ve lived through in Alaska , ” Pat Dougherty , the editor of the Anchorage Daily News , the state ’s largest newspaper , told me — and that was three weeks before the governor , Sarah Palin , became the human cannonball of the Presidential campaign and blasted into overlapping orbits of political and tabloid super - celebrity .
Just about everyone in Alaska knew that Palin was on John McCain ’s list of potential running mates , but no one in the state ’s insular , Republican political world had seen any indication that the campaign was checking her background .
That made sense to Dougherty .
Palin was forty - four years old and had served only a year and a half as governor , and he said , “ The idea of her as Vice - President is ridiculous .
She ’d be way in over her head . ”
Then again , two years ago Dougherty had n’t considered Palin ready to be governor , even after she prevailed in the Republican primary against the deeply unpopular incumbent , Frank Murkowski , who had previously spent twenty - two years as Alaska ’s junior senator .
“ We endorsed the Democrat in her race , ” he said .
“ We did n’t think she had the experience . ”
Looking back , Dougherty allowed that he had underestimated Palin .
After twenty months in office , she enjoyed an eighty - per-cent approval rating — the highest in the nation — and although he said he would n’t yet call himself an admirer , he described her performance as “ great spectator sport . ”
Dougherty was particularly impressed by her tough , you - deal - with - Alaska - on - Alaska ’s - terms attitude toward the big oil producers on whom the state ’s economy largely depends .
Palin was elected governor just as Alaska ’s political establishment was being realigned by the Veco bribery scandal .
She had no role in exposing the corruption , but she was swift to see opportunity in the moment of crisis .
The tainted politicians were being held to account , but hostility to the oil companies behind the corruption remained high .
Since the nineteen - seventies , and the construction of the Trans - Alaska oil pipeline , major oil producers had enjoyed extraordinary influence over Alaskan lawmakers , and had pretty much dictated the terms on which they did business with the state .
Under Frank Murkowski , the big oil companies had negotiated terms for the construction of a new pipeline that would allow for the extraction and conveyance to market of thirty - five trillion cubic feet of natural gas from Alaska ’s North Slope ; and it was in the context of the legislature ’s votes on the gas pipeline that the F.B.I. had begun its corruption sting .
When Palin arrived on the scene , Murkowski ’s gas - line deal was dead , and she adopted another approach , cutting out the big oil producers in favor of a Canadian pipeline company .
She counted it a great victory when , this summer , the legislature approved a framework for proceeding with the project .
“ We ’re not just gonna concede to three big oil companies of this monopoly — Exxon , B.P. , ConocoPhillips — and beg them to do this for Alaska , ” Palin told me last month in Juneau .
“ We ’re gonna say , ‘ O.K. , this is so economic that we do n’t have to incentivize you to build this .
In fact , this has got to be a mutually beneficial partnership here as we build it .
We ’re gonna lay out Alaska ’s must - haves .
Parameters are gonna be set , rules are gonna be laid out , a law will encompass what it is that Alaska needs to protect our sovereignty , to insure it ’s jobs first for Alaskans , and in - state use of gas ’ ” — her list went on .
In the past , she said , “ Alaska was conceding too much , and chipping away at our sovereignty .
And Alaska — we ’re set up , unlike other states in the union , where it ’s collectively Alaskans own the resources .
So we share in the wealth when the development of these resources occurs . ”
And she said , “ Our state constitution — it lays it out for me , how I ’m to conduct business with resource development here as the state C.E.O .
It ’s to maximize benefits for Alaskans , not an individual company , not some multinational somewhere , but for Alaskans . ”
Alaska is sometimes described as America ’s socialist state , because of its collective ownership of resources — an arrangement that allows permanent residents to collect a dividend on the state ’s oil royalties .
It has been Palin ’s good fortune to govern the state at a time of record oil prices , which means record dividend checks : two thousand dollars for every Alaskan .
And because high oil prices also mean staggering heating bills in such a cold place — and because it ’s always good politics to give money to voters —
Palin got the legislature this year to send an extra twelve hundred dollars to every Alaskan man , woman , and child .
But , even as Palin enjoyed populist acclaim for her grand gestures — sharing the wealth and standing up to Big Oil — it was far from certain that the natural - gas pipeline , which she claimed as her proudest accomplishment , would ever get built .
Palin had committed the state to risking half a billion dollars to help move the project forward , but there was no commitment from the producers to ship their gas through the line ; without that , no one was willing to finance its construction .
As Palin boasted of putting the big boys in their place , it looked increasingly likely that she would have to plead with them to return .
In the meantime , Palin the reformer had been caught up in her own scandal , known as Troopergate .
The allegation was that Palin had dismissed her public - safety commissioner , a respected and well - liked officer named Walter Monegan , because Monegan had resisted pressure from her office to fire a state trooper named Michael Wooten .
Wooten was Palin ’s ex-brother - in - law , and his divorce from Palin ’s sister Molly had involved an ugly custody battle that was not entirely resolved ; it appeared that Palin had used her public office to settle a private family score .
On July 28th , a bipartisan vote in the state legislature commissioned an investigation into the matter , at a cost of up to a hundred thousand dollars .
Palin had invited it .
“ Hold me accountable , ” she said .
She promised full coöperation : “ We would never prohibit , or be less than enthusiastic about , any kind of investigation .
Let ’s deal in the facts . ”
On the day I stopped by Palin ’s office in Juneau , she did not seem bothered that Alaska ’s newspapers were filled with stories about Troopergate .
Palin had just called a press conference to discuss the latest twist — a tape - recorded phone call from Frank Bailey , one of her closest aides , who could be heard trying to influence an officer to sack Trooper Wooten .
“ Todd and Sarah are scratching their heads , you know , ” Bailey said , referring to the Governor and her husband , Todd Palin .
“ Why on earth has n’t — why is this guy still representing the department ?
He ’s a horrible recruiting tool .
And , from their perspective , everybody ’s protecting him . ”
Bailey , Palin ’s director of boards and commissions , went on to convey the Governor ’s displeasure , and urged action against Wooten .
“ She really likes Walt a lot , ” Bailey said on the tape , referring to Monegan .
“ But on this issue she feels like it ’s — she does n’t know why there ’s absolutely no action for a year on this issue .
It ’s very troubling to her and the family .
I can definitely relay that . ”
At her press conference , Palin said she realized that the recording could be regarded as a “ smoking gun . ”
She claimed that she had never asked Bailey or anyone else to make such calls on her behalf .
“ However , ” she said , “ the serial nature of the contacts understandably could be perceived as some kind of pressure , presumably at my direction . ”
Palin , who studied journalism in college and worked for a time as a sportscaster , has an informal manner of speech , simultaneously chatty and urgent , and she reinforces her words with winks and nods and wrinklings of her nose that seem meant to telegraph intimacy and ease .
Speaking recently at her former church , the Wasilla Assembly of God , she said , “ It was so cool growing up in this church and getting saved here , getting baptized by Pastor Riley in Little Beaver Lake Camp , freezing - cold summer days that we had at camp — my whole family getting baptized when we were little . ”
She sounded the same when we met , high - spirited , irrepressible , and not in the least self - conscious .
On the contrary , she is supremely self - confident , in the way of someone who believes that there is nothing she can’t talk her way into , or out of , or around or through .
There was never a hesitation before speaking , or between phrases , no time for thought or reflection .
The words kept coming — engaging , lulling , distracting — a commanding flow , but without weight .
Yet , for all the cozy colloquialism , she can not be called relaxed .
She ’s on — full on .
She said that one of her goals had been to combat alcohol abuse in rural Alaska , and she blamed Commissioner Monegan for failing to address the problem .
That , she said , was a big reason that she ’d let him go — only , by her account , she did n’t fire him , exactly .
Rather , she asked him to drop everything else and single - mindedly take on the state ’s drinking problem , as the director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board .
“ It was a job that was open , commensurate in salary pretty much — ten thousand dollars less ” — but , she added , Monegan had n’t wanted the job , so he left state service ; he quit .
As for Frank Bailey ’s phone call , Palin professed not to understand what it had to do with anything .
“ We just found out about it a couple of days ago , ” she said .
“ And yeah , it ’s very disturbing , and it ’s an issue , and ” — she began to speak as if Bailey were in the room and she were having it out with him :
“ You blundered , Bailey , and you know you did . ”
She said , “ I ’ll be talking to him , ” and the next week she put Bailey on paid leave and ordered him to coöperate with the investigation .
But that did not explain Bailey ’s phone call .
After all , Palin told me , “ my husband made a call also .
But , you know , there were death threats against a member of my family . ”
She said , “ About my husband , his First Amendment rights , even — was that taken away once his spouse was elected governor ? ”
Palin continued , “ Our security detail , when I first got elected , met with us and said , ‘ Do you guys got any issues with any threats ? ’ ” To which Palin replied , “ ‘ Yeah , well , by the way , there happens to be — the only threat that I knew of was one of your own troopers . ’
And they ’re , like , ‘ Geez , this does n’t sound good , you need to go tell your commissioner that . ’
So I did .
I shared that with the commissioner .
So did Todd , and then Todd followed up to say ” — at this point , Palin seemed to be quoting her husband : “ ‘ We were interviewed back in ’05 before Sarah was even a candidate — what ever happened to that investigation , that interview ?
We know that the trooper ’ ” — Wooten — “ ‘ got to see the interview notes ; well , we never have , and that ’s kind of a scary position for us to be in .
We complied with your request to bring you information on this trooper forward , and did we put our family in jeopardy by letting him see the interview notes about the illegal activities ? ’ ”
Palin insisted that Wooten “ did have illegal activities .
We witnessed them , and people have come to us with complaints .
He Tasered his eleven - year - old stepson .
This trooper , he was pulled over for drinking and driving and a witnessed open container in his car , and he did threaten to kill my dad — I heard him — and illegally shot a moose , which is a big darned deal here in Alaska . ”
Trooper Wooten has admitted to Tasering the boy and shooting the moose , and he was disciplined for these things within the department , but , under the union contract , he could not be fired at the Governor ’s whim .
( He had been cleared of the threat to Palin ’s father , but disciplined for drinking and driving , which he still denies . )
It was obvious that this continued to frustrate Palin .
She also seemed to forget that you should not talk about your affairs when they ’re under investigation .
Troopergate was the one subject about which she seemed keen to explicate the details .
She wanted to persuade me that firing Walt Monegan had nothing to do with Trooper Wooten ; that it was in no way a conflict of interest or an abuse of power .
But , as she spoke , she seemed to be saying something else — that her vendetta against Wooten was wholly justified .
Compared with Ted Stevens ’s impending criminal trial , the Troopergate investigation seemed like a sideshow — an added dash of intrigue in Alaska ’s sensational political summer — except for the fact that Palin had always liked to present herself as a new kind of Alaskan politician , the kind who cleaned up after others ’ shenanigans , not the kind who needed to be cleaned up after .
Palin ’s record as the mayor of Wasilla , a town forty miles north of Anchorage , told a somewhat different story .
According to “ Sarah , ” a biography by Kaylene Johnson , Palin had got into politics after she befriended the man who was then mayor and his police chief at a step - aerobics class .
She made them her allies and ran for City Council .
Then she challenged them for control of City Hall , and drove them out .
As she purged her former friends and patrons , she denounced them as “ good ol ’ boys , ” although her takeover of Wasilla had been aided from the start by Alaska ’s Republican Party establishment .
Palin ’s style of governing was unorthodox and at times impulsive .
Although she boasts of a record as a fiscal conservative , she raised the sales tax while she was in office .
She left the town saddled with millions of dollars in debt from the building of a new sports complex , and with legal fees , because she had failed to secure title to the land on which the complex was built .
Casting herself in the Ted Stevens mold , however , she had proved herself skilled at collecting federal earmarks for Wasilla , bringing in twenty - seven million dollars for her small town in three years .
The American empire is kaput .
Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama realizes that fact yet , but the myth of the omnipotent unipower , the essential nation , the country which declares that what it says goes , has been exposed to all .
The Iraq debacle sullied Washington ’s reputation , but did not destroy the illusion of American indispensability .
Assorted politicians , like McCain and Obama , promised to restore US primacy , either through more bluster or better diplomacy .
But the financial crash has wrecked the economic basis of America ’s imperial pretentions .
Washington simply can’t afford to attempt to run the world any longer .
The US stock market has dropped 2500 points in 9 days .
Trillions of dollars in wealth disappeared as the Dow lost six years worth of growth .
The Bush administration and Congress have tossed ever increasing amounts of money at failing firms , hoping to appease the economic gods , rather as the ancient Canaanites sacrificed children to Baal .
But the markets refuse to be appeased , and financial contagion has circled the globe .
Even before the economic crisis spiraled out of control , the US government was effectively broke .
The national debt currently stands at $ 9.8 trillion , up $ 4 trillion ( about 72 percent ) since George W. Bush took office .
With the pre-bail - out federal deficit in 2009 expected to hit a half trillion dollars , earlier this year Congress upped the debt ceiling to $ 10.6 trillion .
But truly frightening are the many liabilities yet to come due .
Uncle Sam is an extraordinary wastral and soft touch , like the person who cosigns notes for relatives , buys rounds of drinks for his friends , and promises everyone he knows that he ’ll take care of them .
The federal government makes loans and loan guarantees for most any purpose known to man or woman  education , energy research , housing , agricultural land , airlines , veterans , and more .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is billions of dollars short of the reserves necessary to cover expected bank losses .
Washington is on the hook for generous pensions for its own workers as well as billions of dollars in guarantees of pensions for private workers whose companies fail .
Then there ’s Medicare and Social Security , which together have an unfunded liability  that is , promised benefits exceeding expected revenues  of more than $ 100 trillion .
No one knows where the money is going to come from to pay all of these bills , but that has n’t stopped Congress from continuing to expand benefits .
In 2003 the Republican Congress and Republican president created the Medicare drug benefit without bothering to figure out how to pay for it , adding trillions of dollars more to the system ’s unfunded liabilities .
Now the government ’s liabilities are going up again , as Congress and the administration spend wildly in an attempt to revitalize the economy .
Indeed , the administration and Congress apparently are prepared to bankrupt America to save American business .
So far this year they have spent : $ 850 billion for the Wall Street bailout plus the financial " sweeteners " needed to buy enough votes for passage ; $ 300 billion to bail out the housing industry largely through the Federal Housing Administration ; $ 200 billion in Federal Reserve loans to commercial banks ; $ 200 billion ( and probably more ) to bail out and essentially nationalize the political piggy banks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ; $ 144 billion or more to buy mortgage - backed securities through Fannie and Freddie ( yes , the same entities being bailed out by Uncle Sam because of their past purchases of bad debt ) ; $ 87 billion to repay JPMorgan Chase for financing Lehman Brothers trades ; $ 85 billion for a loan to bail out and effectively nationalize insurer American International Group ; $ 50 billion to guarantee money market funds ; $ 37.8 billion in a second loan to AIG , $ 29 billion to finance the buyout of Bear Stearns ; $ 25 billion in loans to the auto industry , which continues to sink as demand for cars falls ; $ 10 billion in direct Treasury Department purchases of mortgage - backed securities ; $ 4 billion in mortgage community grants .
That ’s $ 2 trillion , which is real money even in Washington .
It ’s even more to the American people , running about $ 18,000 per household .
Some , and hopefully much , of that money eventually will be repaid .
But do n’t hold your breath .
And the bailouts are n’t over .
Just two business days after Congress approved the $ 700 billion buy of bad securities and any other assets desired by the Treasury Secretary , the Federal Reserve announced that it may purchase unsecured short - term corporate debt .
If so , the Fed will be directly lending to the firms in the biggest financial trouble with no security ; we all know how that is likely to end .
Moreover , the Treasury Department says it wants to " directly strengthen the balance sheet of individual institutions " by acting like a common investor and buying an equity stake in companies .
Treasury also is considering taking a formal ownership position in US banks , giving them cash directly .
The Fed then cut interest rates , even though its ongoing policy of cheap , easy money is one of the primary causes of the boom that just went bust .
As Congress and the president continue to pile debt upon debt , America ’s financial problems will cascade .
In May the Congressional Budget Office warned : " Budget deficits that grow faster than the economy ultimately become unsustainable .
As the government attempts to finance its interest payments by issuing more debt , the rise in deficits accelerates .
That , in turn , leads to a vicious circle in which the government issues ever - larger amounts of debt in order to pay ever - higher interest charges .
In the end , the costs of servicing the debt outstrip the economic resources available for financing those expenditures .
At some point , then , policy has to change :
Taxes must be raised , spending must be reduced , or both . "
With the post - bailout 2009 budget deficit now expected to run around one trillion dollars , Uncle Sam may soon have to worry about who is going to buy all of this debt .
Will the Chinese continue purchasing securities from a financially irresponsible entity that keeps adding obligations with no obvious means of paying ?
Will Americans want to take on the increasingly risky paper ?
Will they be able to afford to do so ?
Earlier this year  before the tsunami of federal bailouts covering anyone even walking near Wall Street  Moody ’s Investors Services announced that it was considering downgrading federal bonds , citing the government ’s failure to fund Social Security and Medicare .
" These two programs are the largest threats to the long - term financial health of the United States and to the governments ’
AAA rating , " Moody ’s Vice President Steven Hess explained .
Tom Lemmon , also of Moody ’s , warned that " the underlying credit rating of the US government faces the risk of downgrading in the next ten years if solutions are not found to our growing Medicare and Social Security unfunded obligations . "
Lowering the investment rating for US debt would hike federal expenditures even more .
As credit dries up and the US economy stalls , how can Washington continue to engage in social engineering the world over ?
The Iraq war continues .
Nearly $ 600 billion so far has been wasted on Bush ’s folly , and the total cost will exceed $ 2 trillion , according to the Congressional Budget Office , and maybe $ 3 trillion or even more , if Joseph Stiglitz ’s and Linda Bilmes ’s numbers come true .
Getting out now would cut the expense , but many of the costs are impossible to escape , such as the expense of caring for America ’s grievously wounded , which will stay with us throughout their lifetimes .
Then there are Washington ’s other military activities .
America accounts for roughly half of the globe ’s military outlays .
The US maintains nearly 800 military bases and other facilities around the world .
In 2009 Uncle Sam will be spending roughly $ 515 billion on " normal " military operations  more , in real terms , that at any time since World War II .
That means Americans now are spending more per year to patrol the globe than they spent to fight the Cold War , Korean War , and Vietnam War .
But that ’s not including Iraq and Afghanistan , which together cost roughly $ 12 billion a month .
Toss in those costs and include some money for unexpected contingencies , and we ’re talking $ 700 billion .
That ’s the amount of the Wall Street bailout , but an expense that will continue year after year .
It ’s one thing to act like the global dominatrix when the country is living on easy street , enjoying record economic growth and government revenue .
But as the economy is crashing and Uncle Sam will soon have to visit the equivalent of global loan sharks to finance its operations , the time for the pretention of international hegemony is over .
Why are over - burdened US taxpayers expected to defend the Europeans , who have a larger collective economy and population , from nonexistent threats ?
Yes , the government in Moscow has an ugly edge , but Vladimir Putin is not the reincarnation of Joseph Stalin and there will be no Red Army dash through Germany and France and on to the Atlantic .
And if that was a possibility , then why should n’t the Europeans sacrifice a little more of their abundant wealth to defend against it ?
In fact , with the financial crisis hitting Europe as well , military spending there is likely to drop .
Observed Mark Stoker of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , " I ca n’t see defense is going to escape any kind of austerity measures .
It would be very difficult for any government to justify cutting health and education in favor of , say , building two aircraft carriers and buying a load of planes to stick on them . "
Surely the US should n’t be subsidizing Europe if those nations spend even less on their own defense .
What they spend for the military obviously is their decision to make , but they should bear the full consequences of whatever decision they do make .
Even worse , why should Washington take on the role of protecting former pieces of the Soviet Union and even the Russian empire ?
We should wish the Baltic States , Georgia , and Ukraine well .
But they never counted as a security interest to America .
Just how much US money and blood should be spent to guarantee Georgia ’s right to supress secessionists and settle a century - old feud to its satisfaction ?
If Europe believes this to be an important goal , wonderful .
Let the Europeans spend the money and take the risks necessary to make it happen .
It is equally nonsensical for America to continue subsidizing the defense of Japan , which has the second or third largest economy in the world , depending on the measure used .
Yet it spends less than one percent of its GDP on defense , a quarter of America ’s burden .
The ongoing economic crisis is a good time to tell Tokyo : you ’re a big country now , so defend yourself and your region .
The same goes for South Korea .
It possesses one of the largest economies in the world and has 40 times the GDP of its decrepit northern antagonist .
A majority of younger South Koreans say they fear America more than North Korea .
Why are nearly 26,000 US troops still on station there ?
Bring them home and demobilize them , while the Republic of Korea takes over responsibility for its own defense .
South Korea has matured .
It should act like it and take on " adult " international responsibilities .
Finally , it ’s time for Washington to give up on nation - building .
Social engineering is difficult enough at home .
It ’s well - nigh impossible for outsiders , especially naïve and ignorant  even if well - intentioned 
Americans , to transcend history , tradition , geography , religion , ethnicity , and culture to remake other societies .
Iraq has been a catastrophe .
We ’ve been trying to fix Haiti for more than a century .
Arresting warlords in Somalia was one of Washington ’s dumbest ideas .
Neither Bosnia nor Kosovo are real countries , despite years of American attention .
And , to be perfectly blunt , who cares if they become real countries ?
We should be concerned about the mistreatment of people everywhere .
But Washington has demonstrated no competence in setting foreign nations right , and ivory tower humanitarians have no right to risk the lives of our brave servicemen and women in the name of a glorious crusade for democracy in Mesopotamia , the Balkans , Caribbean , Africa , or anywhere else .
War truly must be a last resort , which means no resort at all unless American society truly is at risk in some fundamental way .
No wars of choice or convenience , no matter how easy and cheap they appear likely to be .
The American economy will eventually recover from its current trauma .
But the myth of US omnipotence likely is shattered forever .
Over the last six years the US has tossed away its moral superiority , diplomatic indispensability , and military infallibility .
Now it has lost its economic security .
Washington is broke , having made a succession of financial promises the country can ill afford to cover .
There was never a good time for empire .
But if there ever was a good time , it has passed .
Instead of attempting to micro-manage global affairs , America should again become a normal country , strong enough to protect itself , but no longer claiming responsibility for maintaining global security , stability , and prosperity .
Doing so is n’t possible , at least at an affordable price .
Empire is n’t worth the risk to American society or the lives of American military personnel .
It certainly is n’t worth the cost , especially at a time of economic crisis .
Let us make John Quincy Adams ’ apt dictum the lodestar of our new foreign policy : America " goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy .
She is the well - wisher to the freedom and independence of all .
She is the champion and vindicator only of her own . "
This is the second post in a series examining “ urban legends ” about energy that comfort Americans .
These comforting myths about unconventional and alternative energy sources provide excuses for avoidign the hard work of gathering information , analysis , planning , and executing programs necessary to prepare for the multi- decade transition through peak oil to the next era ( whatever that will be ) .
{ The opening was re-written to better show the structure of the series}
These five myths are :
I . Our massive reserves of unconventional oil .
II .
We ’ll run crash programs to solve peak oil , just as we mobilized for WWII .
III .
Demand creates supply , by raising prices .
IV .
Oil is Oil , even if it is not oil
V. Demand creates supply , from new technology .
Unfortunately , we can rely on none of these .
Certainly they are not substitutes for intense research and planning , which is how they are used today .
As I have described at length in previous posts , we know astonishingly little about our available energy resources , consumption patterns , and alternatives .
Nor has the available information been collected , analyzed , and used for models and simulations — the foundation of good planning .
News reports said that the recent satellite interception by the USAF cost $ 125 million ; one - tenth of that could fund a multi- disciplinary project that would help plan a sound future for America ’s energy supply .
Instead we rely on inspired guessing .
Side note : what is our source of information about the monthly volume of Saudi Arabia ’s oil exports ?
Please place your answers in the comments .
Chapter II —
We ’ll run successful crash programs to beat Peak Oil just as we mobilized for WWII
The massive mobilzation during WWII has important differences from crash programs to prepare America for face Peak Oil .
Crash programs are probably necessary , but are no panacea .
The economics differ ; today ’s mobilization might make things worse — unlike WWII .
There may less potential innovation available .
The causes of innovation are mysterious , and can not be relied upon .
To sum this up , we turn to one of great rules of history : past performance is no guarantee of future success .
1 . It is not 1940 — few idle resources
We rapidly and easily mobilized for WWII because WWII followed the Great Depression .
Very roughly , a quarter of our resources – people and manufacturing capacity – were idle .
The adaptation to WWII stimulated the US economy ( esp. as the bombs produced landed elsewhere ) .
Crash programs to prepare for Peak Oil will operate in a fully functioning economy ( at least , I hope so ) .
Allocating resources means diverting people and funding from something else .
Either consumption — consumer spending and government services — or investment ( construction , R&D , etc ) .
This will prove more disruptive to the economy than employing idle workers and re-starting empty factories during WWII .
That is , large - scale crash programs — however necessary — will make things worse in the short - term ( until they produce results ) .
2 . It is not 1940 — no decade of massive underinvestment in everything
Also , WWII followed a decade of underinvestment during the Great Depression .
Unlike today , there were no venture capitalists beating the bushes for good ideas to fund .
So there had been an accumulation of “ idle ” technology , as a field long left fallow produces a good harvest when planted .
3 . What do we know about innovation ?
There is a large literature about this subject , one of such vital importance to our society .
And it , unlike so many other subjects , has a wealth of hard data on which to work .
Here is a nice summary of what we know , from “ The structure of invention “ , W. Brian Arthur , Research Policy , March 2007 — Excerpt :
A significant difficulty that all theories face is that modern research shows that the actual process of invention varies greatly from historical case to historical case , so that universalities appear not to exist .
Some novel technologies issue from an individual working alone , others from several groups working with independent ideas .
Some derive from huge programmatic investment , others from private shoestring effort .
Some emerge from years of trial and are marked by a sequence of intermediate versions that do not quite fulfill the goal , others appear whole cloth as if from nothing .
“ Attempts thus far to present a general interpretation of all technology change have foundered on the great diversity and complexity of that change , ” says Constant ( 1980 ) .
As a result , in modern times the idea of “ invention ” has assumed a status like that of “ consciousness ” or “ mind , ” something we can speak of but not quite articulate .
Textbooks hurry past it without explaining what it is .
About the conditions that foster inventive activity we are much better informed .
We know that novel technologies are shaped by social needs ; that they respond to economic opportunities , perceived risk , and factor price changes ; that they cumulate with the accretion of cultural and scientific knowledge ; and that they can be catalyzed by the exchange of information within networks of colleagues .
Sometimes massed effort can overcome all obstacles .
But not all problems can be solved by a Manhattan Project .
Software development illustrates this , where resource inputs often have little to do with time until completion .
The relationship is certainly not a linear relationship ; sometimes an inverse one .
Some inventions must await the right time in history , irrespective of when we need it .
Conclusion
How fitting that this mysterious process has become an object of near - religious faith in our culture .
Much as primitive peoples prayed to the Gods for rain , we put our faith in the upsurge of inventions , hoping for machines to appear to meet our current needs .
Just in time .

Some posts about unconventional and alternative energy sources
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili had long planned a military strike to seize back the breakaway region of South Ossetia but executed it poorly , making it easy for Russia to retaliate , Saakashvili ’s former defence minister said .

Irakly Okruashvili , Georgia ’s leading political exile , said in a weekend interview in Paris that the United States was partly to blame for the war , having failed to check the ambitions of what he called a man with democratic failings .
Saakashvili ’s days as president were now numbered , he said .
The former defence minister ’s remarks are significant because Saakashvili has always maintained Russia started the war by invading his country .
The Georgian president said he handed EU leaders last week “ very strong proof ” that Moscow was to blame , though he did not give details .
But Okruashvili , a close Saakashvili ally who served as defence minister from 2004 to 2006 , said he and the president worked together on military plans to invade South Ossetia and a second breakaway region on the Black Sea coast , Abkhazia .
“ Abkhazia was our strategic priority , but we drew up military plans in 2005 for taking both Abkhazia and South Ossetia as well , ” Okruashvili said .
There was no immediate reaction from Saakashvili ’s officials to his remarks .
While in office , Okruashvili was an outspoken hawk , overseeing a military buildup and calling for Georgia to take back South Ossetia -- his birthplace -- by force .
But in the interview he fiercely criticized Saakashvili ’s handling of the war , which he said was launched in haste , without diplomatic support and failed to take account of a build - up of Russian forces in the region .
TWO - PRONGED OPERATION
“ The original plans called for a two - pronged operation entering South Ossetia , taking Tskhinvali , the Roki Tunnel and Java , ” he said , referring respectively to the regional capital , the main border crossing between Russia and the rebel region , and another key town .
“ Saakashvili ’s offensive only aimed at taking Tskhinvali , because he thought the U.S. would block a Russian reaction through diplomatic channels . ”
“ But when the U.S. reaction turned out to be non-existent , Saakashvili then moved troops toward the Roki tunnel , only to be outmaneuvered by the Russians , ” he said .
Russia responded to the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali by pouring troops and tanks through the Roki tunnel into South Ossetia , routing the Georgian army .
Okruashvili said that outcome was inevitable .
“ After 2006 we did n’t have the possibility for success by military means ... the Russians had repositioned and improved their military infrastructure in the North Caucasus , Abkhazia , and South Ossetia -- and obviously they did it for us . ”
Okruashvili said the Georgian president could have ordered his army to defend several key towns from the Russians but “ let the Russians in to avoid criticism and appear more of a victim ” .
Washington had always made clear to the Georgian leadership that it would not support an invasion , Okruashvili added .
“ When we met President Bush in May 2005 , we were told directly : do n’t involve yourself in a military confrontation .
We wo n’t be able to help you militarily . ”
Okruashvili , 34 , fled to Europe in 2007 after imprisonment in Georgia , where he faced corruption charges he denied , saying they were intended to punish him for criticizing the president .
In March , a Georgian court sentenced him to 11 years in prison in absentia , but he was granted asylum in France where last week a court rejected Tbilisi ’s extradition request .
Okruashvili said Washington was partly to blame for the war because it uncritically supported Saakashvili despite his growing authoritarianism .
“ There were no checks and balances .
The institutions he created all revolved around him .
Lack of criticism from the U.S. allowed him to go too far , ” he said .
Okruashvili said the Georgian president should now resign or face possible prosecution for ordering the war and for signing a “ disgraceful ” EU - brokered ceasefire plan which he said gave Russia a much stronger claim on the two rebel regions .
“ ( Saakashvili ) must be held accountable and resign .
If he steps down , he should n’t be prosecuted .
But if he does n’t it will lead to criminal charges against him , ” Okruashvili said .
Propelled to the forefront of the opposition when the charges brought against him helped spark mass demonstrations in Tbilisi , Okruashvili said he hoped the coming anniversary of those protests would rally the president ’s critics .
“ November 7th will be a test .
We ’ll see how much the opposition is able to mobilize , ” he said .
In the French capital since January , Okruashvili plans to come back to his homeland soon .
“ I will return within a year , even if it means risking jail .
But in the meantime I will try to create the right conditions .
Saakashvili ’s days are numbered . ”
L'Eglise de scientologie est renvoyée devant le tribunal correctionnel de Paris pour " escroquerie en bande organisée " .
Le juge Jean - Christophe Hullin a signé , lundi 8 septembre , une ordonnance renvoyant devant la justice l'Association spirituelle de l'Eglise de scientologie ( ASES - Celebrity Centre ) , principale structure de l'association en France , et sa librairie , la SARL SEL , pour " escroquerie en bande organisée " .
La condamnation de l'Eglise de scientologie pour ce chef pourrait aboutir à la dissolution des deux structures mises en cause , selon une source proche du dossier .
" UNE GRANDE VICTOIRE "
Sept scientologues , dont Alain Rosenberg , directeur général du Celebrity Centre , sont également poursuivis , dont certains pour " exercice illégal de la pharmacie " .
Le magistrat est allé à l'encontre des réquisitions du parquet , qui avait requis le 4 septembre 2006 un non-lieu pour l'ensemble des mis en cause , estimant qu'il ne résultait pas de l'information judiciaire des charges suffisantes .
" C'est une grande victoire , le magistrat a eu le courage de balayer l'attitude complaisante du parquet à l'égard de la scientologie " , s'est félicité Me Olivier Morice , avocat de plaignantes .
" L'attitude du parquet ne peut que nous interpeller sur l'éventuelle prise en considération de motivations politiques dans le traitement judiciaire parisien des dossiers relatifs à la scientologie " , a - t - il ajouté .
L'affaire avait commencé en décembre 1998 par la plainte avec constitution de partie civile d'une femme estimant avoir été escroquée par l'Eglise de scientologie .
Abordée quelques mois plus tôt à Paris , au métro Opéra , par des scientologues pour un test de personnalité gratuit , elle avait au final dépensé plus de 200 000 francs ( environ 30 000 euros ) pour des cours , l'achat de livres , de médicaments , ainsi que d'un " électromètre " , appareil électrique ayant pour objet de mesurer les variations de l'état mental de la personne par les modifications importantes de la résistance électrique .
Une autre plaignante et l'ordre des pharmaciens se sont par la suite constitués partie civile dans ce dossier .

The decision not to risk taxpayer funds to save Lehman Brothers this weekend came just as the political appetite for bailouts had reached its limits in Washington .
Whether Treasury Department and Federal Reserve officials made the right decision will only start coming into focus as financial markets respond in the days ahead .
( CNN ) -- Fannie
Mae said it will set aside the loan of a woman who shot herself as sheriff 's deputies tried to evict her from her foreclosed home .
Fannie Mae foreclosed on the Akron , Ohio , home of Addie Polk , 90 , after acquiring the mortgage in 2007 .
Addie Polk , 90 , of Akron , Ohio , became a symbol of the nation 's home mortgage crisis when she was hospitalized after shooting herself at least twice in the upper body Wednesday afternoon .
On Friday , Fannie Mae spokesman Brian Faith said the mortgage association had decided to halt action against Polk and sign the property " outright " to her .
" We 're going to forgive whatever outstanding balance she had on the loan and give her the house , " Faith said .
" Given the circumstances , we think it 's appropriate . "
Residents of Akron have rallied behind Polk , who is being treated at Akron General Medical Center .
She was listed in critical condition Friday afternoon , according to Akron City Council President Marco Sommerville .
U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , mentioned Polk on the House floor Friday during debate over the latest economic rescue proposal .
" This bill does nothing for the Addie Polks of the world , " Kucinich said after telling her story .
" This bill fails to address the fact that millions of homeowners are facing foreclosure , are facing the loss of their home .
This bill will take care of Wall Street , and the market may go up for a few days , but democracy is going downhill . "
Neighbor Robert Dillon , 62 , used a ladder to enter a second - story bathroom window of Polk 's home after he and the deputies heard loud noises inside , Dillon said .
" I was calling her name as I went in , and she was n't responding , " he said .
He found her lying on a bed , and he could see she was breathing .
He also noticed a long - barreled handgun on the bed , but thought she just had it there for protection .
He touched her on the shoulder .
" Then she kind of moved toward me a little and I saw that blood , and I said , ' Oh , no .
Miss Polk musta done shot herself , ' " Dillon said .
He hurried downstairs and let the deputies in .
He said they told him they found Polk 's car keys , pocketbook and life insurance policy laid out neatly where they could be found , suggesting that she intended to kill herself .
" There 's a lot of people like Miss Polk right now .
That 's the sad thing about it , " said Sommerville , who had met Polk before and rushed to the scene when contacted by police .
" They might not be as old as her , some could be as old as her .
This is just a major problem . "
Watch Polk 's neighbor describe what he saw »
In 2004 , Polk took out a 30 - year , 6.375 percent mortgage for $ 45,620 with a Countrywide Home Loan office in Cuyahoga Falls , Ohio .
The same day , she also took out an $ 11,380 line of credit .
Over the next couple of years , Polk missed payments on the 101 - year - old home that she and her late husband purchased in 1970 .
In 2007 , Fannie Mae assumed the mortgage and later filed for foreclosure .
Deputies had tried to serve Polk 's eviction notice more than 30 times before Wednesday 's incident , Sommerville said .
She never came to the door , but the notes the deputies left would always disappear , so they knew she was inside and ambulatory , he said .
The city is creating programs to help people keep their homes , Sommerville said .
" But what do you do when there 's just so many people out there and the economy is in the shape that it 's in ? "
Many businesses and individuals have called since Wednesday offering to help Polk , Sommerville said .
" We 're going to do an evaluation to see what 's best for her , " he said .
" If she 's strong enough and can go home , I think we should work with her to where she goes back home .
If not , we need to find another place for her to live where she wo n't have to worry about this ever again . "
For his part , Dillon hopes his neighbor of 38 years can return to her home .
" She loves that house , " he said .
" I hope they can get her back in .
That would make me feel better because I do n't know what they 're going to put in there once she leaves . "
He said the neighborhood is declining because so many people have lost their homes .
" There 's a lot of vacant houses around here .
...
Now I 'm going to have a house on my left and a house on my right , vacant , " he said .
" That do n't make me feel good , because we were good neighbors , we trusted each other , and we looked out for each other .
" This neighborhood is shot , to me , from what it used to be , " he added .
" When I moved here , if it were like it is now , I would have never moved here .
But it was a nice neighborhood .
...
" I 'll just tough it out .
I 'm too old to start thinking about buying another house . "
Sommerville said that by the time people call for help with an impending foreclosure , it 's usually too late .
" I 'm glad it 's not too late for Miss Polk , because she could have taken her life , " Sommerville said .
" Miss Polk will probably end up on her feet .
But I 'm not sure if anybody else will . "

All About Home Financing • Ohio • Countrywide Financial Corporation
As Catherine Donnelly climbed the stairs to her dorm room at Princeton University over a quarter - century ago , the Louisiana freshman felt ready for whatever lay ahead .
But then she met Michelle .
Her full name was Michelle LaVaughn Robinson .
She was so tall that her head seemed to brush the sloping ceiling of the cramped fourth - floor room .
She was Donnelly 's new roommate .
And she was black .
Well , this was new .
Growing up in the South , Donnelly had gone to school with a handful of black classmates , but living together was quite another thing .
Donnelly quickly warmed to Robinson , with her big sense of humor and riveting stories .
But she was worried that her mother , who Donnelly said had grown up in a racist family , would not react well .
She was right .
When Donnelly 's mother , now 71 , learned the race of her daughter 's roommate , she was beside herself .
She called alumni friends to object .
And the next morning she marched into the student housing office .
" I said I need to get my daughter 's room changed right away , " recalled Alice Brown , a retired schoolteacher , who has since come to regret her reaction .
" I called my own mother and she said , ' Take Catherine out of school immediately .
Bring her home . '
I was very upset about the whole thing . "
For 17 - year - old Robinson - who is now Michelle Obama and the first African - American woman to face the real prospect of becoming first lady - the incident was a stunning beginning to a formative chapter in her life .
It was a time when her views on race and American culture began to coalesce - views that have helped make her a compelling figure but also somewhat of a lightning rod during the campaign .
Just last week the Barack Obama campaign took on an apparently baseless rumor that she had once been taped talking of white Americans as " whitey . "
Obama says she did not know about Alice Brown 's actions until several weeks ago .
But she wonders now if the incident might explain in part why she and Brown 's daughter did not become better friends .
" We were never close , " Obama said in an e-mail .
" But sometimes that 's the thing you sense , that there 's something that 's there , but it 's often unspoken . "
At the time Obama entered Princeton in 1981 , the Ivy League campus was largely , if unofficially , segregated socially and Obama found her years there marked by questions about race and loyalty - much the same questions she and her husband often face today .
Then , as now , Obama 's focus was on overcoming differences rather than igniting them .
The lesson she finds in the roommate incident is one of hope - Alice Brown is now considering casting her vote for Barack Obama .
" What it demonstrated was the growth that this parent had , " Obama wrote .
" What that told me is that , yes , the problems we face in this nation around race are real . . . but we also have to remember that people change and they grow . "
Michelle Obama has often been cast as the more adamant half of the Obama household , when it comes to racial matters , and some have traced this thread to her Princeton years .
But she was hardly a campus activist .
Instead , she pursued quieter means of change characteristic of her practical nature , according to classmates with whom she remains close .
In her efforts to understand the lot of black students , this determined young woman with the big hair and trademark strand of pearls attended meetings with school administrators about the African - American Studies department , helped bring black alumni to campus to address students , and worked afternoons in the school 's Third World Center .
It was , according to several professors and friends close to her , a critical passage in her life .
" Princeton was a real crossroads of identity for Michelle , " said Harvard Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree , who was her law school adviser and now works with the Obama campaign .
" The question was whether I retain my identity given by my African - American parents , or whether the education from an elite university has transformed me into something different than what they made me .
By the time she got to Harvard she had answered the question .
She could be both brilliant and black . "
Search for racial identity
Obama 's questions became , in part , the subject of her senior thesis , called " Princeton - Educated Blacks and The Black Community . "
Much has been made in the blogosphere of Obama 's observation in that work : " My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my ' Blackness ' than ever before . . .
Regardless of the circumstances under which I interact with Whites at Princeton , it often seems as if , to them , I will always be Black first and a student second . "
But her 1985 thesis is not just about her own experience , but also examines larger issues of racial identity .
The thesis had been embargoed until after the presidential election , but when the campaign came under criticism , it was released in February .
" Michelle 's central question was what good does a Princeton education do for the black community , " recalled Howard Taylor , sociology professor emeritus , and former chairman of the Center for African American Studies .
" What will it do for me ?
Will it separate me from the black community ? "
Princeton in the early 1980s was not an easy place to be black .
For young Michelle Robinson , reared on the South Side of Chicago and the daughter of a municipal pump operator , it was " a new frontier , " as Katie McCormick Lelyveld , Obama 's director of communications , described it .
Long regarded as the most conservative of the Ivy League schools , its social scene was dominated by elite " eating clubs " where blacks sometimes worked but were rarely members .
Many blacks socialized largely among themselves , according to some students , including the school 's director of communications , Lauren Robinson - Brown , a classmate of Obama's .
" We ate together .
We partied together .
We were each others ' support system , " she said .
When Obama entered Princeton , she was one of 94 black students in a class of 1,141 .
Her transition from her family 's one - bedroom urban apartment to the exclusive suburban campus was made somewhat easier by the fact that her brother Craig Robinson had arrived there two years earlier .
Robinson , now the head basketball coach at Oregon State University , was a star basketball player who had been recruited to the campus and his success opened many doors for his younger sister .
But still , the veil of race hung heavy .
Despite her mother 's opposition , Catherine Donnelly was drawn to her new roommate , one of two young women with whom she shared the low - ceilinged room in Pyne Hall .
She recalled that Obama , whom many called " Miche , " " had these beautiful long - fingered hands that she used to tell great stories with .
I loved her hands . "
But when another room became available the following semester , Donnelly moved out .
She says it was not because of her mother 's racial concerns , but because the new room was larger .
Once she moved out , she said she and Obama rarely spoke , even when they passed each other on campus .
" Michelle early on began to hang out with other black students , " said Donnelly , now a lawyer in Palmetto , Ga . " Princeton was just a very segregated place .
I wish now that I had pushed harder to be friends , but by the same token she did not invite me to do things either . "
Obama herself often felt stigmatized on campus .
In her thesis , she wrote that at Princeton , " No matter how liberal and open minded some of my White professors and classmates try to be toward me , I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus ; as if I really do n't belong . "
Obama and her friends talked about the racial situation on campus a lot .
" But Michelle kind of stayed away from the fray , " recalled Lisa F. Rawlings , a classmate who is now a program director at Prince George 's Community College in Maryland .
Asked if Obama experienced incidents of racism , Lelyveld said in an e-mail that , " So many years down the line , she [ Obama ] can't say for certain whether there were any specific incidents . "
Lelyveld initially said that Obama did not remember her freshman roommate .
But several of Obama 's African - American classmates say they found the campus was as racially fragmented as it was elitist , and some white students agree .
Hilary Beard , a friend of Obama 's who is African - American and was a class ahead , recalls , " A lot of white students there had never been around black students .
. . .
They would want to touch my hair . "
And Rawlings says , " I can not tell you the number of times I was called ' Brown Sugar . ' "
While many found such incidents disturbing , Obama 's brother , Craig Robinson , says that few got up in arms about it .
" We all viewed it as what you needed to do , to do business there , " said Robinson .
" You had to put up with certain things . "
By her second year , Obama had settled in with three roommates of color in a suite of sparely furnished rooms .
She quickly gained a reputation for her vast collection of Stevie Wonder records .
An early riser , she was also known for her stylish appearance .
" Michelle was always fashionably dressed , even on a budget , " remembers Angela Acree , Obama 's roommate for three years and now a Washington , D.C. , lawyer .
" You would n't catch her in sweats , even back then . "
But mostly Obama was recognized for her commitment to her studies .
Part of it was the rigor of the school .
And part of it was the expectations that she - like many black students who were the first in their family to go to college - knew awaited her back home .
" Michelle and Craig spoke a lot about their parents , " said Beard .
" She was going to succeed for them as much as herself . "
Obama , who majored in sociology with a minor in African - American studies , dedicated her thesis to , " Mom , Dad , Craig and all of my special friends .
Thank you for loving me and always making me feel good about myself . "
Although Obama had friends who were both black and white , her social world revolved around several of the black organizations on campus , as it did for many other black students .
Obama was a member of the Organization of Black Unity , a primary resource for black students on campus which arranged speakers and programs .
There was also a Black Thoughts Table , a popular discussion group about current affairs and race .
Obama also took part in two fashion shows that were sponsored largely by black student groups .
In one devoted to the Ethiopian Relief Fund in 1985 , and dubbed " Secret Fantasy , " she modeled a sleeveless red velvet ball gown .
In the other , which benefited a local after - school program , she was clad in a yellow Caribbean peasant skirt .
Lelyveld said that Obama does not recall the events , but the organizers remember her vividly .
Karen Jackson Ruffin , who designed the dresses Obama wore , recalled that she asked Obama to participate , " because she is so tall and carries herself so well .
Michelle is very mellow and she said , ' Sure . ' " A cultural home
One of the issues debated among black students at the time was whether they could partake in white - dominated schools and careers and still remain connected to the black community .
" The question was were you a traitor to your race to go to a white - dominated school at all , " said Steve Dawson , a Princeton alumnus and the former head of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni .
" Michelle had crossed that threshold in going to Princeton .
But she was concerned as she considered law school , is it still an OK thing to do ? "
WASHINGTON  President Bush sought to present a united global front in responding to the financial crisis on Saturday , saying the world ’s leading industrialized countries had agreed on common steps to stabilize the markets and shore up the banking system .
“ All of us recognize that this is a serious global crisis , and therefore requires a serious global response , for the good of our people , ” Mr. Bush said after an early - morning meeting at the White House with finance ministers from the Group of 7 countries .
Mr. Bush said the countries had agreed to general principles in responding to the crisis , including working to prevent the collapse of important financial institutions , and protecting the deposits of savers .
But he offered no details on fresh measures , suggesting that there are still differences between countries about which steps to take , and when , to shore up their respective financial systems .
Mr. Bush warned that countries should not undermine one another in their policies .
Two airlines have agreed to demands from airline attendants and family groups to filter porn on their in - flight WiFi services .
Both American Airlines and Delta announced this week that they would block sites that are considered inappropriate for viewing in public , though problems involving Internet pornography have yet to be reported .
" Since the launch of Gogo , American has not experienced any reported incidents of customers viewing inappropriate content via the Gogo service , " American Airlines said in a statement issued earlier this week .
" However , we believe this is an appropriate measure to take . "
Gogo is AA 's in - flight wireless service offered on select domestic flights between New York , San Francisco , Miami , and Los Angeles .
The service is being offered through AA 's partner , Aircell , and was just rolled out this August .
But even before WiFi service was launched on any US - based airline , religious and family groups worried about the possibility that travelers might be tempted to join the one - person Mile High Club and pull up some porn in the presence of children , flight attendants , and the general public on the plane .
Despite these early protests , AA seemed to take a cautious approach to the " problem . "
Airline spokesperson Tim Smith said last month that the " vast majority " of customers already use good judgment in what 's appropriate to look at while flying versus what 's not .
" Customers viewing inappropriate material on board a flight is not a new scenario for our crews , who have always managed this issue with great success , " he said .
Clearly , that view has changed .
In addition to American , Delta also announced this week that it would filter its Internet connections when the airline 's own WiFi service launches later this year .
" Blocking will be limited in scope and will be for sites that few , if any , would question are inappropriate to be viewed on an aircraft , " Delta spokesman Kent Landers told the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
" Our focus is to achieve a balanced approach . "
Delta also originally said that it would rely on its flight attendants to take care of inappropriate situations , but it now favors an automatic approach .
Critics have pointed out that porn- filtering systems have a tendency to block not - so - pornographic content , such as that from Vanity Fair and educational material .
Delta insists that this will not be the case with its system , although the airline did not specify exactly how it plans to do things differently .
In - flight WiFi , on its own , though , does n't quite open up a Pandora 's Box of sin— travelers have always been able to bring video porn onto planes ever since the advent of the laptop and portable DVD player .
Before that , the plethora of " men 's magazines " being offered at airport kiosks have made ( and still make ) it possible .
We guess all those swaths of travelers who need to get their porn fix in the air will have to go back to preloading it on their laptops before they board .
Partimage Homepage
About partimage
Partimage is opensource disk backup software .
It saves partitions having a supported filesystem on a sector basis to an image file .
Although it runs under Linux , Windows and most Linux filesystems are supported .
The image file can be compressed to save disk space and transfer time and can be split into multiple files to be copied to CDs or DVDs .
Partitions can be saved across the network using the partimage network support , or using Samba / NFS ( Network File Systems ) .
This provides the ability to perform an hard disk partition recovery after a disk crash .
Partimage will only copy data from the used portions of the partition .
( This is why it only works for supported filesystem .
For speed and efficiency , free blocks are not written to the image file .
This is unlike other commands , which also copy unused blocks .
Since the partition is processed on a sequential sector basis disk transfer time is maximized and seek time is minimized , Partimage also works for very full partitions .
For example , a full 1 GB partition may be compressed down to 400MB .
When to use it
Very useful to restore partitions for recovery if there is a problem like virus infection , file system errors , upgrade regression errors , configuration error or hard drive error or failure .
Partimage is fast and easy to use , create and image of the system partition often .
When you have a problem , just restore the partition , and after a few minutes , you have the original partition .
No need to reconfigure your system , utilities , daemons or reinstall and taylor applications .
You can write the image to a CD - R for archival purposes or to avoid using hard - disk space .

Installing many identical computer images .
For example , if you buy 50 PCs , with the same hardware , and want to install the same system on all of then , you will save a lot of time .
Install on the first PC and create an image from it .
For the 49 others , you can use the image file and Partition Image restore function .

An other example is for instructional use where all students need to have the same environment to start with .
At the end of a session each student can write a CD ( or save their system partition to a fileserver , students frequently forget or misplace this type of thing ) with their current revisions .
At the beginning of the next session , restore the image and they can continue .
They may misconfigure or corrupt their environment in the course of their learning they will be able to “ step back ” to a well defined point where their environment was working .
Limitations
Partimage does not support ext4 or btrfs filesystems .
No defragmentation is performed during save or restore .
Filesystem being backedup must be unmounted and inaccessible to other programs .
This means that when backing up the “ system ” filesystem , the operating system is down .
Single files or directories cannot be restored .
Although the backup could be restored to an temporary / alternate partition and single files or directories could be recovered from the alternate partition .
Advantages
Fast .
Since file fragments are not “ hunted down ” head movement is minimized allowing optimal use of the disk ’s cache .
Fast .
Since only allocation clusters which are in use as read and saved .
Read only .
None of the data being backed up is modified .
This includes meta - data like last - access date .
Preserves integrity of source partition .
Multi file synchronization .
If there are multiple files that make up a fileSet , no file in the set will be out of sync with the other files .
Destination flexibility .
Backup media can be a file on another partition on the same disk , another local disk or a network attached file .
Fast Restore .
Data is simply flowed onto the disk optimizing the disk cache and minimizing disk seek time .
Simple restore .
There is only one media to restore .
No decision regarding order of restoring multiple back media .
No recover of deleted files .
Files that were deleted at the time of the backup are not on another media that needs to be restored causing deleted files be resurrected
recovery to alternate partition Excellent choice for mirroring the file system on another disk or at another location .
Other information
For a utility for backing up a filesystem on a file basis with more features such as file exclusion , checksumming , multi - thread compression , encryption you should use FSArchiver .
WASHINGTON - Nevada regulators have shut down Silver State Bank .
It was the 11th failure this year of a federally insured bank .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was appointed receiver of the bank , located in Henderson , Nev .
It had $ 2 billion in assets and $ 1.7 billion in deposits as of June 30 .
The FDIC said Friday the bank 's insured deposits will be assumed by Nevada State Bank of Las Vegas .
Its branches will reopen Monday as offices of Nevada State Bank in Nevada and National Bank of Arizona in Arizona .
The agency said depositors of Silver State Bank will continue to have full access to their deposits .
The 11 failures so far this year compare with three for all of 2007 , and federal banking officials have said that more banks are in danger of collapse .
Silver State Bank has operated 12 branches in Nevada and Arizona as well as loan offices in Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Washington , Oregon , California and Florida .
Bloomberg News reported that in July , Silver State announced the resignation of Andrew McCain as a director of the bank .
McCain , who had served on the audit committee and was a director for five months , is the son of Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
A call to the campaign 's press line was n't immediately returned .
The FDIC estimated its resolution will cost the deposit insurance fund between $ 450 million and $ 550 million .
Regular deposit accounts are insured up to $ 100,000 ; for some individual retirement accounts , the limit is $ 250,000 .
There were about $ 20 million in uninsured deposits held in roughly 500 accounts at Silver State that potentially exceeded the insurance limit , the FDIC said .
Concern has been growing over the solvency of some banks amid the housing slump and the steep slide in the mortgage market .
The pressures of tighter credit , tumbling home prices and rising foreclosures have been battering many banks , large and small , across the nation .
The largest bank failure by far this year has been that of savings and loan IndyMac Bank , which was seized by regulators on July 11 with about $ 32 billion in assets and deposits of $ 19 billion .
The seizure of Pasadena , Calif . - based IndyMac , which was the largest regulated thrift to fail in the United States , prompted hundreds of angry customers to line up for hours in Southern California to demand their money .
IndyMac also was the second - largest financial institution to close in U.S. history , after Continental Illinois National Bank in 1984 .
The FDIC has been operating the bank , now called IndyMac Federal Bank , under a conservatorship .
The FDIC plans to raise insurance premiums paid by banks and thrifts to replenish its reserve fund after paying out billions of dollars to depositors at IndyMac .
The fund , currently at $ 45 billion , is expected to take a hit from IndyMac of $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion .
Federal officials expect turbulence in the banking industry to continue well into next year , and more banks to appear on the FDIC 's internal list of troubled institutions .
Of the 8,500 or so FDIC - insured banks in the country , 117 were considered to be in trouble in the second quarter - the highest level in about five years and up from 90 in the first quarter .
The agency does n't disclose the banks ' names .
Only 13 percent of banks that make the list fail , on average , and most are nursed back to health or acquired by stronger institutions , according to the FDIC .
Federally insured banks and thrifts set aside a record $ 50.2 billion to cover losses from soured mortgages and other loans in the April - June quarter , when profits plunged 86 percent from a year earlier .
Silver State Bank customers with accounts exceeding $ 100,000 can contact the FDIC at 1-800-523-8177 to set up an appointment to discuss their deposits .
With portable navigation systems hanging from millions of windshields and the price point of the popular devices diving down to the $ 99 mark , automakers ' expensive in - dash nav systems are going the way of the car phone .
But with mobile - phone based navigation gaining ground – and the new 3 - G iPhone expected to debut on Monday with full GPS capability – portable navs could soon face a similar fate .
Phone - based GPS navigation has been steadily gaining ground on portables .
Earlier this week , Networks in Motion , the leading provider of navigation services to the top four U.S. cellular carriers , announced that the day before Mother ’s Day , May 10 , saw the largest spike ever in the use of navigation on mobile phones , with nearly 5 million requests .
That 's a lot of drivers finding their way to mom 's house .
And looking at a small screen while driving .
Portable navigation has experienced phenomenal growth over the past several years , while automakers ' expensive in - dash systems have been shown to increase the depreciation of a vehicle .
But the use of GPS - enabled mobile phones isexpected to quadruple by 2011 , and if GPS is introduced on the new iPhone , as expected , it could accelerate the shift away from portable nav systems .
And as Popular Mechanics reported , leave GPS suppliers " scared %#*@-less . "
Portable nav heavyweight Garmin already introduced an iPhone - like GPS phone earlier this year , and last week minor player Mio unveiled two similar GPS phones .
Now , all eyes will be on Steve Jobs on Monday when the Apple Godhead is expected to unveil the iPhone 2.0 with built - in GPS at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco .
The market is ripe for it .
Networks in Motion , which claims to have a 57 percent share of U.S .
revenue from navigation services offered on mobile phones , says that in early in 2007 it had less than a million paid users .
Now it has more than 3 million , and in May it reached the milestone of more than 100 million monthly navigation requests .
But the biggest challenge will be how to deal with driver distraction issues in moving from the small screen of portable navs to the even smaller screen of mobile phones .
Let 's see if Apple will show the way .

Update : Google Guy's Words Get Quick Response
Google co-founder Larry Page turned up on Capitol Hill today to boost the company 's " Free the Airwaves " campaign , and he had some strong words for those who oppose their bid to open more of the airwaves for high speed Internet access .
Google , Microsoft and others in the tech world want the FCC to allow the unlicensed use of " white spaces " -- the gaps in the spectrum between television channels -- as a means of making broadband Internet access widely available in the U.S.
But broadcasters fear that their use could cause interference with television stations and other devices , such as wireless microphones .
Page said some of the tests that have been done to determine whether new devices using the white spaces would interfere had been " rigged . "
A Google spokesman said later he was referring to tests held in August at FedEx Field .
" The test was rigged deliberately , " Page said during his remarks in the Dirksen Office building .
" That 's the kind of thing we 've been up against here , and I find it despicable . "
What did he mean by rigged ?
A Google spokesman explained later that the test devices could not detect the wireless microphones because the testers had used the same frequency as local television stations -- in essence hiding within the television spectrum so that the test device could not detect them .
Asked afterward whether the Federal Communications Commission , which had run the tests , had a role in their " rigging , " Page stepped back .
" Broadcasters have been very active in this , " he said .
He also called on the FCC to approve the unlicensed use of the white space before the November election and toward that end , his handlers said , he was meeting with most of the FCC commissioners today , as well as some members of Congress .
The company 's Free the AIrwaves campaign has also led 16,000 people to send letters to the FCC .
He also took the opportunity to pull out the new G1 phone , which is the first to use Google 's Android software .
" The notion that a small device like this is going to interfere is just garbage , " he said .
Shortly after Post I.T. blogged about Page 's visit to Washington , Mark Brunner , Shure Inc. 's senior director , public and industry relations , contacted us with a response :
" The FCC 's wireless microphone field tests were carefully planned and thoroughly executed based on sound engineering science and real - world operating scenarios .
These tests were open to the public , and those who choose to discount the results -- which have not yet been published -- had every option to be present and to witness them for themselves . "

John McCain just spewed the most ridiculous piece of garbage when it comes to categorizing Obama ’s health care plan .
I just heard him say live at a rally in Waukesha , WI that Obama wants a single - payer health care system that puts government in charge of health care , and if you like that , go to Canada or England .
Not only did McCain say this is Obama ’s plan , but he claimed that Obama said this was his plan .
Obama has made it clear over and over and over and over again that his plan keeps private insurance intact .
No one ’s ever mentioned single - payer .
Not once .
How the McCain camp can continue to just make stuff up is astonishing to me .
I know this is nothing new , but for me , when it dips into the health care realm , it gets personal .
UPDATE : In the same forum , about 30 minutes later , McCain said we have to be able to trust what our candidates say .
We have to be able to trust they are telling the truth .
( Natural News )
The anti-impotence drug Viagra actually reduces men's fertility by decreasing the ability of their sperm to fertilize an egg , according to a study conducted by researchers at Queen 's University Belfast and published in the journalResearchers carried out two different experiments to determine what effect the popular drug might have on sperm cells .
In the first study , human sperm samples were bathed in weak Viagra solutions , intended to approximate the blood concentration acquired from taking a single 100 - milligram Viagra pill .
They found that while the Viagra - bathed sperm became more active , they also suffered damage to the structure at their heads known as the acrosome .
This portion of the cell contains enzymes that help break down the membrane around an egg so that the sperm can penetrate it .
To determine if this cell damage actually affected fertility rates , the researchers compared the fertility of two groups of male mice , one of which had been given Viagra .
They found that mice in the Viagra group produced 40 percent fewer fertilized embryos than mice that had not been given any drugs .
Researcher David Glenn noted that the many fertility clinics that prescribe Viagra in order to increase sperm counts may actually be harming the fertility of their clients .
" I think it is worrying that some in - vitro fertilization clinics are using Viagra in order to boost fertility results , " Glenn said .
" Couples that go there for treatment are , by definition , already having problems getting pregnant .
Giving male partners something that could make the problem worse is scarcely the right approach .
" Glenn also expressed concern over the long - term effects that recreational Viagra use might have on people 's fertility " Viagra has become a widely used recreational drug , " Glenn said .
" It is mixed with cocaine , for example , and is sold in clubs .
Our work leaves open the possibility that there could be a cumulative effect from taking Viagra , however , which could pose serious fertility problems in later life . "
Faithful readers of this column may remember news we reported back in early April that the next Ubuntu release had been cunningly named “ Jabbering Jackass . ”
The news came from a memo that got leaked to the Linux Loop , the story went , and it was , of course , an April Fools ’
Day joke — which we knew all along .
Anyhoo , turns out the * real * next version of Canonical ‘s very excellent software — sans the “ cuddly cartoon donkey ” — will be Jaunty Jackalope , as Mark Shuttleworth himself announced on a mailing list post last week .
‘ Several Million Devices ’
“ The Warrior Rabbit is our talisman as we move into a year where we can reasonably expect Ubuntu to ship on several million devices , to consumers who can reasonably expect the software experience to be comparable to those of the traditional big OSV’s ( Operating System Vendors ) — Microsoft and Apple , ” Shuttleworth wrote .
Boot time and “ the blurring of Web services and desktop applications ” are two of the key areas to be addressed with Jaunty , which is due next April , he added .
The news was , of course , picked up with great interest throughout the Linux blogs , including Slashdot , the Linux Loop and others .
‘ Kinky Kangaroo ’ ?
The Web angle , in particular , “ would really push everyone forward — Apple and Microsoft are , as far as we can tell , nowhere near integrating Web applications with their desktops , but if Ubuntu does it well , they may have to , ” wrote Thomas Teisberg on the Linux Loop .
“ Depending on how far the developers go with this , integrating Web applications with the desktop could be the most significant thing Ubuntu does for some time . ”
Over on Slashdot , meanwhile , much of the discussion seemed to focus on Canonical ’s naming process .
Creative suggestions began with “ Kinky Kangaroo ” and went on from there ; several , we might add , are not suitable for mixed company .
For those fond of worrying about the future , however , an anxiety - producing question was also posed : “ What I want to know is what the hell are they going to do after 26 releases ? ” asked 3p1ph4ny .
Now that , indeed , is food for thought .
Now Hiring
Perhaps even bigger than the announcement squelching those pesky Jabbering Jackass rumors once and for all , however , was Shuttleworth ’s related announcement last week that Canonical is embarking on a new push to improve the Linux desktop experience .
“ We are hiring designers , user experience champions and interaction design visionaries and challenging them to lead not only Canonical ’s distinctive projects but also to participate in GNOME , KDE and other upstream efforts to improve FLOSS usability , ” Shuttleworth wrote on his blog .
The move is “ a much - needed push , ” Teisberg asserted .
“ My hope for this team is that it will give Ubuntu the necessary push to bring something truly new to the desktop , not just more of the same , ” he added .
“ If this happens , Ubuntu stands a chance to jump over Apple and Microsoft and be far ahead by the time they start moving again . ”
‘ This Intrigues Me Greatly ’
Indeed , “ that ’s a considerable amount of work he ’s planning on hiring up for , ” wrote Captain Spam on Slashdot , where more than 500 comments had been made by Friday .
“ This intrigues me greatly , to be honest .
And , with any luck , this all comes back to the community so that not - Ubuntu users can get in on it , too . ”
And then , of course , the inevitable : “ This must be proof that 2009 will be the year of the Linux desktop ! ” chimed in CaptainNerdCave .
We ’ll start working on the cover story now !
Same Old , Same Old ?
With an endorsement like that , LinuxInsider could n’t resist taking to the streets , so to speak , to get reactions from others in the blogosphere .
“ Canonical is just taking its place as an open source vendor , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ They see areas where their business will do better if things were improved in certain places and will dedicate resources to it .
It ’s all pretty much the same as those who have gone before . ”
Others , however , saw more reason for enthusiasm .
“ I ’m skeptical about self - declared usability experts ’ conclusions about ‘ ease of use ’ for any given interface element , because it ’s easy to ‘ scientific - ize ’ a particular aesthetic preference , even with the best of intentions , ” Slashdot editor Timothy Lord told LinuxInsider .
Widespread Applause
Nevertheless , “ Canonical paying more people to spend more time thinking about and smoothing over the little burrs in the typical Linux desktop is nonetheless a great thing —
I ’m excited about Shuttleworth making this investment , ” Lord added .
“ Shuttleworth is upfront that there ’s no way to suggest certain changes without rankling some faction or other , but the churn of ideas that this will generate will benefit everyone .
I ’d love to see a site along the lines of the GIMP - UI Brainstorm where ideas , even wacky ones , can be floated for consideration . ”
Indeed , “ as a general advocate and ‘ activist ’ in many arenas , I know exactly how hard it is to get movement started , ” agreed Kevin Dean , a blogger on Monochrome Mentality .
Shuttleworth ’s explicit acknowledgment of such challenges “ affected me so much , actually , that I e-mailed Mark this morning and thanked him for that , ” Dean told LinuxInsider .
“ In general , I do n’t care what steps he ’s taking or where he hopes those steps land him , but for the simple act of ‘ moving ’ I applaud him . ”
Bobbing for Apple ?
Then there ’s the implicit — or perhaps explicit — competition with Apple .
Speaking at the O’Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) this summer , Shuttleworth urged developers to push the Linux desktop to rival the Mac .
Now , with this new initiative , could it actually happen ?
“ I ’m excited about this , too , but I also think he ’s too late , at least for those of us who do n’t need specific Mac - only proprietary software , and prefer the flexibility of being able to switch window managers , and install nearly any software we need , at no charge , from apt repositories , ” Lord asserted .
“ I realize that ’s not everyone .
But for me , the Mac experience is n’t usually quite as pleasant as using a Linux distro I ’ve set up to my taste ; I still do n’t even know how to get OS X apps into true full - screen mode , or to show the desktop with one mouse - click like I can in Gnome or KDE , or to make OS X ’s windows autoraise , ” Lord explained .
“ There are probably workarounds to each of these , but small things like that mean I usually prefer a windowing environment where my favorite ways to work are either on by default or easy ( to my mind ) to select , ” he added .
“ I do prefer OS X ’s network set - up tool to Gnome ’s clunky one , though , and luckily ever more Free / Open Source software is available for the Mac . ”
‘ One Piece of the Puzzle ’
Shuttleworth ’s new push is “ one piece of the puzzle , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ Creating a useful and seamless end - user experience for those who just want to just use a computer solves one issue .
Making it a better experience than a Mac smacks of a little hubris , but more power to anyone who drives Linux to a polished , shrink - wrapped product people can just power up and go . ”
A more important challenge , however , is that “ we have to make Linux seem valuable above and beyond its intrinsic technical prowess , ” yagu added .
“ Shrink - wrap the new Linux , put it on the shelves at Best Buy and Circuit City ( not Wal - Mart ) , and people will start looking at it .
Otherwise , Linux is just a curiosity , a novelty that all the geeks wo n’t shut up about . ”
· No food or drinking water as tempests batter nation · Desolation in Cuba is like Hiroshima , says Castro

Haiti was reeling last night from a series of tropical storms which devastated crops and infrastructure and left bodies floating in flooded towns .
Three storms in three weeks unleashed " catastrophe " and submerged much of the impoverished Caribbean nation , said President Rene Preval .
A fourth storm , Ike , was gathering force in the Atlantic and could strike next week .
More than 120 people have died , thousands are homeless and agriculture and transport networks have been washed away , prompting calls for emergency international aid .
" There are a lot of people who have been on top of the roofs of their homes over 24 hours now , " the interior minister , Paul Antoine Bien - Aime , told Reuters .
" They have no water , no food and we can't even help them . "
Haiti , vulnerable because of its flimsy dwellings and soil erosion , has been the worst affected by the tempests that have battered the Caribbean and US Gulf coast .
Parts of Cuba have also been devastated , prompting Fidel Castro to compare the impact to a nuclear attack .
Tropical storm
Fay started the crisis three weeks ago .
Hurricane Gustav wreaked havoc last week by uprooting trees and triggering floods and mudslides that killed dozens .
Tropical storm Hanna struck on Tuesday with 65 mph winds , killing at least 61 people and flooding the northern Haitian city of Gonaives with two metres of water .
Corpses and the carcasses of donkeys and cows - flies swarming over them - bobbed down streets turned into rivers .
" I saw 10 bodies float in the flooded streets of the city , " the police commissioner , Ernst Dorfeuille , told the local Radio Metropole .
Gonaives lies in a flat river plain between the ocean and deforested mountains that run with mud even in light rains .
With roads impassable and winds too strong for helicopters , UN peacekeepers reached the city on inflatable boats .
They found hundreds of survivors clinging to rooftops , begging for water and food - women on balconies waved empty pots and spoons .
" I lost everything , even the baby 's clothes , " Jezula Preval , one of 1,500 people huddled in the a desolate shelter nicknamed the " Haiti Hilton " , told the Associated Press .
She gave birth to a healthy boy on Tuesday , after floodwaters swallowed her house .
Patients in a flooded hospital had crowded into an upper floor room .
At the church about 100 people huddled on a balcony , waiting for the water to recede .
" There is no food , no water , no clothes , " said the pastor , Arnaud Dumas .
" I want to know what I 'm supposed to do ... we have n't found anything to eat in two , three days .
Nothing at all . "
The UN soldiers secured a warehouse in preparation for food distribution , but could not impose order on the chaos .
" It is a great movement of panic in the city , " the interior minister said from an inflatable speed boat .
The US embassy in Port - au - Prince declared a disaster situation , freeing $ 100,000 in emergency aid , a spokeswoman , Mari Tolliver , said .
She said hygiene kits , plastic sheeting and water jugs for up to 5,000 families were being sent from Miami .
Some officials feared that the toll of casualties and damage would be on a par with tropical storm Jean , which left 2,000 dead in 2004 .
Cuba was also counting the cost yesterday .
Officials said the onslaught from Gustav in the western province of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth was equivalent to the past 14 storms combined .
" There are severe damages to the electrical system .
It 's practically on the floor , " said the vice - president , Carlos Lage .
" In terms of buildings and homes , roofs are generally gone .
The island is exposed to the sky . "
Effective organisation minimised loss of life in Cuba , but could not save property .
State media reported that 503 schools and 100,000 homes were affected .
Some 3,306 tobacco curing barns were destroyed , along with thousands of tonnes of tobacco leaves , coffee and grapefruit .
Castro , the former president , said the damage was immense .
" The photos and videos transmitted on national television reminded me of the desolation I saw when I visited Hiroshima . "
Forecasters do not know if Ike , a category four storm advancing from the east , will make landfall .
With winds of 140 mph it could be disastrous .
Ike is the third major hurricane of the Atlantic season , which runs from June to November .
The government , lender , and homeowner would each receive one - third of the appreciation of the first sale of the house , he said .
The plan would ease the problem of getting new mortgages and provide liquidity to the original lenders , he said .
Ross is critical of the bailout plan that was passed by the Senate late Wednesday .
“ It should n’t really be called the Wall Street bailout bill , " he said , " It should be called the lobbyist reward bill . ”
Although Ross lauded lawmakers for increasing Federal Deposit Insurance Corp insurance on bank deposits to $ 250,000 , he raised issue with certain features .
“ Some of the other things are obviously a little bit whacky — repealing the 39 - cent excise tax on children ’s arrows made of wood and reducing the tariffs on importing rum from Puerto Rico and places like that to the mainland , ” he said .
“ So I suppose the people whose houses are being foreclosed can drink rum and watch their kids shoot bow and arrow . ”

Chevrolet Volt Leads General Motors Into Its Second Century DETROIT
- General Motors launched its next 100 years today by unveiling the much - anticipated production version of the Chevrolet Volt - a vehicle that delivers up to 40 miles of gasoline - and emissions - free electric driving , with the extended - range capability of hundreds of additional miles .
" Revealing the production version of the Chevy Volt is a great way to open our second century , " said Rick Wagoner , GM Chairman and CEO .
" The Volt is symbolic of GM 's strong commitment to the future ... just the kind of technology innovation that our industry needs to respond to today 's and tomorrow 's energy and environmental challenges . "
Form follows function
The design of the Chevrolet Volt production car has evolved from the original concept that was unveiled at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit .
Because aerodynamics plays a key role in maximizing driving range , GM designers created an aerodynamically efficient design for the production vehicle .
Many of the design cues from the concept vehicle endure in the production Volt , including the closed front grille , athletic stance , rear design graphics , outside rearview mirrors and more .
The Volt 's rounded and flush front fascia , tapered corners and grille are functional , enabling air to move easily around the car .
In the rear , sharp edges and a carefully designed spoiler allow the air to flow off and away quickly .
An aggressive rake on the windshield and back glass help reduce turbulence and drag .
Working closely with GM aerodynamicists to shape the Volt , design and engineering teams developed one of the most aerodynamic vehicles in GM 's history .
They spent hundreds of hours with the Volt in GM's wind tunnel , testing and re-testing parts such as the front and rear quarter panels , rear spoiler , rockers and side mirrors .
Aerodynamic improvements enabled GM to reach the Volt 's target of driving up to 40 miles ( based on EPA city cycle ) without using gasoline or producing emissions .
Inside , the Volt offers the space , comfort , convenience and safety features that customers expect in a four - passenger sedan , and it delivers them in a variety of interior color , lighting and trim options unlike any offered before on a Chevrolet sedan .
Modern controls and attractive materials , two informational displays , and a touch - sensitive infotainment center with integrated shifter distinguish the Volt 's interior from other vehicles in the market .
Some of Volt 's interior technological features include : * Driver - configurable , liquid crystal instrument display * Standard seven - inch touch screen vehicle information display *
Touch screen - style climate and infotainment controls * Optional navigation system with onboard hard drive for maps and music storage * Standard Bluetooth for cellular phone and USB / Bluetooth for music streaming New era in automotive transportation The Chevrolet Volt is leading a new era of electrification of the automobile by creating a new class of vehicle known as the Extended - Range Electric Vehicle , or E - REV .
The Volt uses electricity to move the wheels at all times and speeds .
For trips up to 40 miles , the Volt is powered only by electricity stored in its 16 - kWh , lithium - ion battery .
When the battery 's energy is depleted , a gasoline / E85 - powered engine generator seamlessly provides electricity to power the Volt 's electric drive unit while simultaneously sustaining the charge of the battery .
This mode of operation extends the range of the Volt for several hundred additional miles , until the vehicle 's battery can be charged .
Unlike a conventional battery - electric vehicle , the Volt eliminates " range anxiety , " giving the confidence and peace of mind that the driver will not be stranded by a depleted battery .
The Chevrolet Volt can be plugged either into a standard household 120v outlet or use 240v for charging .
The vehicle 's intelligent charging technology enables the Volt 's battery to be charged in less than three hours on a 240v outlet or about eight hours on a 120v outlet .
Charge times are reduced if the battery has not been fully depleted .
At a cost of about 80 cents per day ( 10 cents per kWh ) for a full charge that will deliver up to 40 miles of electric driving , GM estimates that the Volt will be less expensive to recharge than purchasing a cup of your favorite coffee .
Charging the Volt about once daily will consume less electric energy annually than the average home 's refrigerator and freezer units .
Charge out of driving
The Chevrolet Volt offers spirited driving performance in a remarkably quiet interior .
More than 220 lithium - ion cells contained within the Volt 's battery pack provide ample power .
The Volt 's electric drive unit delivers the equivalent of 150 horsepower , 273 lb - ft. ( 370 Nm ) of instant torque , and a top speed of 100 miles per hour .
The lack of engine noise , combined with special sound - deadening materials , make the Chevrolet Volt an extremely quiet vehicle to drive .
GM estimates that the Volt will cost about two cents per mile to drive while under battery power compared to 12 cents per mile using gasoline priced at $ 3.60 per gallon .
For an average driver who drives 40 miles per day ( or 15,000 miles per year ) , this amounts to a cost savings of $ 1,500 annually .
Using peak electric rates , GM estimates that an electrically driven mile in a Chevy Volt will be about one - sixth of the cost of a conventional gasoline - powered vehicle .
The cost savings are even greater when charging during off - peak hours , when electric rates are cheaper .
The Chevrolet Volt is expected to be built at GM's Detroit - Hamtramck manufacturing facility , subject to GM successfully negotiating satisfactory government incentives .
Production is scheduled to begin late 2010 for models in the United States .
Pricing has not been announced .

GM 's 100th birthday celebration kicks off in a few short hours featuring their revival of the semi-electric car in just a few hours with the official unveil of the Chevy Volt on a very MTV Unplugged - like stage .
Click here to get electric with us tomorrow at 8:30 AM EST as we watch Chevy 's exercise in generating buzz both under the hood and with the worldwide apparatus collectively known as the " media . "
For the moment , hit the jump to see our past coverage of the excitement — but whatever you do , wake up early tomorrow here at our Chevy Volt Live - Blog ! ( 9:30 AM EST ) UPDATE : Dear god , one hundred media people stuck in the Wintergardgen watching GM give themselves a big hand for an hour .
We 're really hoping the Volt comes out sooner rather than later as we 're getting pretty bored .
( 5:50 AM EST ) UPDATE : Wert , FTW !
First media person in the " media work room " here at the Ren Cen in downtown Detroit .
Yes , I have no life .
But fear not —
I wo n't be the only one .
Ben and Mark are both on their way as well .
( 12:10 AM EST ) UPDATE :
We 've got shots of the Renaissance Center Wintergarden stage taken this evening in the gallery below .
The Chevy Volt , A Jalopnik History
Update 1 : CNN calls the Obama , Bush and McCain meeting that is happening right now ---" Historic "
Update 2 : The Trail : McCain's " Straight Talk Air " landed at National Airport just after noon , and McCain 's motorcade sped toward the Senate .
But by then , senior Democrats and Republicans colleagues were already announcing that a deal in principle had been reached .
McCain 's flunkies are all over TV attacking Obama .
" McCain Campaign Still Active Across The Country " ..... And then there 's this :
The McCain campaign , however , has not " temporarily set politics aside . "
In the five hours after McCain 's speech , aides Nancy Pfotenhauer , Tucker Bounds , and Mike Duhaime appeared on Fox News and MSNBC five times , frequently criticizing Obama and Democrats ...
Ambinder again :
My colleague Nora McAvalnah tells me that sources close to Senate Democratic leadership
now fear that McCain 's true motivation for calling off his campaign and coming back to DC is simply to cast a " no " vote against the bailout , despite his private statements to the contrary .
And now Rep. John Boehner is backing down on the bail out which to me looks like they want McCain to take the lead of the Republican party and announce what they will do .
You read that right .
According to dumbshit , I mean medium , Blossom Goodchild aliens were supposed to land on Earth today and stay stationary for a period of 3 days .
Go ahead and read that last sentence again , I ’ll wait , I could n’t make shit like that up if I tried .
I ’m going to love reading her excuse tomorrow of why it did n’t happen .
I ’m also going to laugh my ass off at the comments that people who will continue to defend this person will leave .
Are people really that stupid to not know when they ’re being coherced and lied to ?
God some people ought to be put to death at birth and save the world from their stupidity .
Dan Drezner , after watching the Palin interview , asks a question :
Question to other GOP policy wonks : is it possible to support a candidate that campaigns on the notion that expertise is simply irrelevant ?
The depressing thing is that this has been the GOP platform for years now .
Expertise is overrated .
Gut instincts , being “ tough , ” and being “ decisive , ” and not “ blinking ” are all far more important than actually knowing things .
Look at the thorough disdain for science the GOP has displayed for the past few years .
Amorphous morals trump reason and science , and then those morals are conveniently discarded or altered when it becomes inconvenient for the GOP ( see : family values , David Vitter ) .
The funny thing about all this is that the new savior of the GOP , Sarah Palin , is the one who is finally waking everyone up to what the Republican party really is all about .
They are not serious about foreign policy ( Fallows is just brutal ) .
They are not serious ( or honest ) about scientific policy .
They are not serious about economic policy ( other than cutting taxes ) .
They are not serious about an energy policy ( just drill , baby , drill ) .
They just are not serious about , well , anything .
And Sarah Palin is the distilled essence of wingnut .
She has it all .
She is dishonest .
She is a religious nut .
She is incurious .
She is anti-science .
She is inexperienced .
She abuses her authority .
She hides behind executive privilege .
She is a big spender .
She works from the gut and places a greater value on instinct than knowledge .
And most dangerous of all , she is supremely self - confident to the point of not recognizing how ill - equipped she is to lead the country .
This from last night stood out for me :
Charles Gibson , the interviewer , asked her if she did n’t hesitate and question whether she was experienced enough .
“ I did n’t hesitate , no , ” she said .
He asked if that did n’t that take some hubris .
“ I answered him yes , ” Ms. Palin said , “ because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can’t blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission , the mission that we ’re on , reform of this country and victory in the war , you ca n’t blink .
So I did n’t blink then even when asked to run as his running mate . ”
George Bush in a dress .
The Palin interview should be a gut - check for Republicans and conservatives who think the last eight years has been a perversion of conservative principles .
I am betting most of them will not even put down their pom-poms , though .
Martin Lawrence is going to don the fat suit anew in a third installment of Big Momma ’s House .
We get the following scoop from our friends at IESB :
IESB ’s Robert Sanchez attended the SOUL MEN press day in Beverly Hills today and talked with producer David Friendly .
Friendly says that Big Momma ’s House 3 is still in the works ( it was rumored to be ready for 2008 ) .
He says it ’s currently in the script writing stage and will hopefully be ready for 2009 release .
Big Momma ’s House ( 2000 ) and Big Momma ’s House 2 ( 2006 ) starred Martin Lawrence as an undercover FBI agent using a fat suit to impersonate a Southern granny .
Martin Lawrence comedies are peculiar train - wrecks that I try my best to avoid .
I have tried to watch a few films of his and always leave the experience confused .
I just do n’t find them funny , which is too bad because some of the premises are absolutely outlandish .
An FBI agent that does his investigating in drag and in a fat suit , is a stand alone film material .
Somehow Lawrence has managed to make this into a trilogy , and again although I have never watched any of these films ; morbid curiosity may one day get the better of me .
If anyone could star in a buddy cop movie where his partner is a drug sniffing Mallard duck , it would be Martin Lawrence .

There was an interesting debate between MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and David Frum last night about the tone of discourse in American politics .
Frum is a decent man , and has always sought to debate seriously with people , and I thought that he represented himself well against Maddow .
Frum accused the MSNBC host of injecting sarcasm in her reporting , telling her she was part of the problem in American politics .
Maddow is ferociously smart , and defended herself against Frum 's charges with intelligence and dignity .
She told him that drawing equavalencies between her jokes and Republican smear tactics was not fair , and sarcasm was merely a way of disseminating information in a different way .
It was a very interesting back and forth , and both parties made excellent points .
Frum accepted Republican culpability in the terrible current political climate , and Maddow was gracious in giving Frum a lot of time to make his point ( a rare thing in the soundbyte media era ) .
Watch for yourself below :
EA has made inroads with free - to - play games in other markets , but Battlefield : Heroes will be the company 's first attempt to make that business model work in North America with a big - name title .
While we knew a lot about the game , like the art style and character classes that will be available at launch , EA has recently sent Ars Technica a beta key , and after a few hours of play time we 're confident in saying that there is much in this title to look forward to .
It 's important to get the misinformation out of the way : the game will have ads on both the official website and the game 's launcher .
The good news is that there will be no ads in the actual game , and the ads in the various front - ends are unobstrusive .
The other way EA is hoping to make money from the game is microtransactions : selling in - game items for a few dollars each .
We were once led to believe players would only be able to purchase visual upgrades for their characters — new hats or glasses or similar items — but EA has now told us the item store will also allow you to " catch - up with your hardcore free - playing buddies with time - saving convenience items . "
That does n't sound promising .
The game features a third - person , cartoony version of the Battlefield play we 've come to expect from DICE , but there are a number of updates and changes to the formula .
Characters now level up by killing others in the game or capturing areas for their team , and you can use your points to upgrade special powers to aid in combat .
The soldier , for instance , has a healing move that gives him his own health back as well as those around him ; leveling that power makes him a good person to put in the middle of an offensive .
It 's a good thing too , as the game does n't feature a medic class .
You can choose between the gunner , who has the heaviest weapons ; the soldier , who can heal others and is your all - around guy ; and the commando , who is your stealthy , go - to character .
You 'll be able to create , modify , and level up four characters , so exploring your options is easy .
A kinder , gentler war ?
The actual person - to - person combat does n't feel nearly as deadly as past Battlefield games , and in fact it can be somewhat hard to learn how to aim ; landing your shots with machine guns can feel slightly random .
If you do get a shot in , you 'll see how many points of damage you have done against your opponent , and if they heal or activate a special move , you 'll also see an effect around their character model , letting you know how the fight is going .
Battles can last longer than you 're accustomed to from other games , Heroes seems designed to have gunfights that last a decent amount of time .
Special powers and healing moves stretch that time out even more .
With a stock character , the game can almost feel slow at time , both in battle and while moving .
Taking advantage of the game 's three vehicles — tanks , planes , and jeeps — can help with that problem when you 're trying to get around quickly .
Special abilities let you do things such as blast enemies and vehicles into the air
The jeeps are fast , as expected , but the tanks are also more sprightly than one would expect .
Cranking around in one , firing at infantry ... it 's a zippy feeling .
The planes allow you to really cover ground , and if you want a dizzying experience , jump onto the wing while your friend flies and shoot at those below you .
The vehicles are simple to use , easy to understand , and fit into the casual nature of play .
That is n't to say the game does n't have depth : grabbing turrets to take down planes , making sure you have enough of each class to defend against all attacks , and clever use of team - tactics with your special powers are much more important than simple skill .
The game does a good job of keeping you with people at your own skill level on random games , although the final version will also have extensive social networking features if you want to set up games with your friends .
The beta only has two maps : Seaside Skirmish for larger battles with tanks and planes , and Victory Village for a more man - to - man style of fighting , and you can learn everything there is to know about the game in an hour .
Mastering it , and leveling up your favorite powers , will take some time .
I do have some complaints about the way the game is set up , however .
The lack of female character models is a little off - putting , and the pause that occurs when a new player joins a server and their customizations load is annoying .
Also , each character chooses to be part of the Royal Army ( think the Allies ) or the National Army ( think Axis ) at the creation phase .
Why is that bothersome ?
If one side drops off the server , no one can simply switch sides to even up the teams .
Instead , you have to wait for more characters to join on the opposite side .
It may be due to the limited nature of the closed beta , but in some games it was quite a long time until the teams were even again .
The game play has its own feel and pace , and strategy is much more important here than it is in other shooters .
Heroes does the casual thing well , while also giving hardcore gamers some depth , and I can see how leveling up your character and chasing the achievements can become addictive .
EA and DICE are also promising constant updates with more content , so the game will be a living being , much like Team Fortress 2 .
Will Battlefield : Heroes find an audience ?
Hard to say , but the game wo n't cost you anything to play , so it will at least be worth a try when it receives a wider release .
The big question is what EA will choose to sell you , and what gamers will find themselves willing to pay for .
SMALL cars sometimes struggle to climb steep hills .
But a converted Chevrolet Lacetti has something special to help it along .
Instead of having to keep changing down and revving harder to ascend a winding Alpine - type test track , the engine can cruise almost to the summit in top gear .
This is because the car benefits from one of the developments that in these more economical and greener times promises to give the petrol engine a new lease of life .
Old technologies have a habit of fighting back when new ones come along .
This is not surprising because they often have an enormous amount of design , engineering and production knowledge invested in them — especially so in the case of car engines .
So new hybrid systems , fuel cells and electric motors will be chasing a moving target .
The internal combustion engine will be getting better too .
The Lacetti is just one example .
It gets its extra oomph from a supercharger forcing more air into the combustion chambers of its engine .
This is an old idea that used to speed up 1920s racing cars , like “ blower ” Bentleys .
But their engines tended not to last very long .
With stronger engines , superchargers have been staging a comeback in big cars .
The one in the Lacetti is different : it is a dual - speed supercharger that provides its highest boost at low speeds .
This gives the car a huge 40 % increase in torque , or pulling power .
The car was fitted with the device by its developer , Antonov Automotive Technologies , a British company .
The supercharger is purely mechanical and uses planetary gears to change speed .
Antonov reckons that it could be used to reduce the size of a car 's engine by up to 50 % — so it would use less fuel and produce fewer CO2 emissions , but still provide good performance .
Car engines ( racing cars aside ) have long been a compromise between efficiency , power and durability .
Greater flexibility has come with fuel injectors , which can metre fuel more precisely than carburettors , and variable - valve control , which can optimise the opening and closing of inlet and exhaust valves to produce more power when accelerating or greater economy when dawdling around town .
The same systems are also used in some big and thirsty V8 and V6 engines to shut down a few cylinders when driving slowly .
Now engineers are taking these developments much further .
The e-Valve system developed by Valeo , a French automotive supplier , uses electromagnetic controls to open and shut valves instead of pushrods operated by a camshaft .
As each valve can be operated independent of any other , all sorts of tricks become possible , including shutting down cylinders and switching temporarily from the traditional four - stroke Otto cycle ( as developed by Nicolaus Otto , a German engineer in 1876 ) to a type of Atkinson cycle ( an ultra - lean system invented as a rival in 1882 by James Atkinson , a British engineer , but which suffered from a lack of power ) .
The Toyota Prius already uses a form of Atkinson cycle for the petrol engine that operates alongside an electric motor in its hybrid system .
Valeo reckons that on average their e-Valve system can cut fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in a car by up to 20 % .
It could also be used to make three - and two - cylinder engines that run efficiently and smoothly .
These tiny engines could power small cars directly , combine with electric motors in hybrids or work as “ get - you - home ” engines or range - extending generators in plug - in electric cars .
Two - pot power
Fiat is investing heavily in smaller engines with its new valve - control system , Multiair .
This uses hydraulics and electronics to optimise valve settings .
When combined with a turbocharger ( a supercharger driven by exhaust gases ) ,
Fiat engineers talk of producing a “ downsized ” two - cylinder engine that performs like a bigger four - cylinder one , but with fuel savings of some 20 % .
Fiat is expected to start using Multiair engines in its cars in a year or so .
Using a combination of variable valve - control , fuel injection and turbocharging , Daimler is developing an entirely new type of engine .
It can switch between operating as a petrol engine , with agility and power , to operating as a diesel , with economy and torque .
The DiesOtto engine , as Daimler has called it , starts as a petrol engine with spark plugs igniting the mixture of fuel and air in its cylinders , and remains as a petrol engine when high performance is needed .
But at low and medium speeds the engine switches into diesel mode , in which the fuel is ignited by compression and heat alone .
A 1.8 - litre four - cylinder test version of DiesOtto fitted to a prototype Mercedes S - class saloon produced plenty of power , but also returned an average fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km ( equivalent in America to 44.4mpg ) — extremely good for a such a big car .
The vehicle 's emissions were also lower .
In a similar vein , Ricardo , another British automotive - engineering company , has been working with a group of partners on an engine that can switch from four - stroke to two - stroke running .
Two - stroke engines can provide very high levels of torque .
Ricardo reckons such an engine could not only improve fuel economy by 27 % over a traditional engine but also greatly reduce its size and complexity .
And because small engines take up less space in a car , that means there will be more room for occupants , inviting more innovative designs .
By putting all these technologies together , small cars capable of breaking the 100 mpg barrier will become possible .
Getting more than 80 mpg from some small diesel - powered cars is already feasible — with a very light foot on the accelerator .
Indeed , according to Edmunds.com , an automotive - information service , when you count the overall costs of owning a car , only one hybrid in America , the Honda Civic Hybrid , gets into the top ten of the least expensive vehicles to run , with fuel prices at $ 5 a gallon .
It may be old hat , but the internal combustion engine still has a lot of mileage in it .
Daredevil teenager who plunged 100ft to his death after 66,000 - volt pylon shock was ' scared of heights '
Michael Lee O'Nion was elctrocuted when he climbed a 100ft pylon
A 15 - year - old schoolboy electrocuted after clambering 100ft up an electricity pylon was terrified of heights , his family revealed yesterday .
Michael Lee O'Nion was climbing the tower and accidentally touched the 66,000 - volt power lines .
He was thrown off by the shock and friends saw him fall to his death on barbed wire 20ft above the ground that had been put up round the pylon to deter people from climbing it .
Michael 's father Lee , a 39 - year - old lorry driver fought back the tears at the family home in Flanderwell , Rotherham yesterday
He said : " He is the last person in the world I would expect to climb up like this .
" He was a daredevil , he loved a laugh and a joke but he was frightened of heights and was n't embarrassed to admit it .
' We recently went on holiday to the seaside and it took us three days to persuade to go on one of the white knuckle rides .
' So whether he had overcome his fear or whether it was because all his mates were there I do n't know .
' He was a loveable rogue but I do n't why he did this .
I have been to the pylon to see and I can't understand why he went up there .
' I miss him so much .
I loved him so much .
I can't believe this has happened .'
Paramedics and fire officers arrived within minutes but he was pronounced dead at the scene near Rotherham .
The youngster was killed after he jumped off the pylon as part of a dare
The boy , named locally as Michael O'Nion , is believed to have lived with his family nearby .
They have been informed but he has yet to be formally identified .
A specialist rescue team had to use high rise access equipment to free the body .
Police sealed off the surrounding woodland .
Maltby , Wickersley and Thrybergh areas of South Yorkshire had electricity cut for up to 30 minutes as the recovery operation was carried out .
Friends left flowers at the scene with messages .
One read : ' Ca n't believe you 're gone Mickey . '
Supt Keith Lumley of South Yorkshire Police said :
' The woods in this area are popular as a play area for local youngsters and the dead boy was with a group of friends when this happened .
' The pylon is about 30 m high and carrying about 66,000 volts .
Friends and family lay flowers and tributes at the base of the electrical Pylon where the 15 - year - old died
' There are barbed wire barriers to stop anyone climbing up the pylon but it seems this boy climbed over these to the power lines .
' At some point he made contact and the power arced and he was thrown part of the way down the pylon .
' This is a terrible tragedy and underlines how dangerous it is for anyone to climb these pylons .
It may seem like fun and adventurous but is obviously extremely dangerous . '
Station manager Stephen Copp of South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was a complicated and difficult operation to free the boy 's body .
Thousands of homes in the Maltby , Wickersley and Thrybergh areas of South Yorkshire had electricity cut for up to 30 minutes during the recovery operation .
We know that , together , we can end the death penalty everywhere .
We are making tremendous progress – today , 22 states in the U.S. and two - thirds of the countries in the world have abolished the death penalty .
Join us .
Amnesty In Action
ChangE IS POSSIBLE
For 40 years , Amnesty International has been campaigning to abolish the death penalty around the world .
When Amnesty started its work in 1977 , only 16 countries had totally abolished the death penalty .
Today , that number has risen to 106 – more than half the world ’s countries .
We campaign to stop executions of specific individuals in the U.S. and around the world .
Take action in urgent cases today .
We conduct research on the use of the death penalty around the world , to shine a light on this human rights abuse and to fuel reform .
Read our most recent annual report on the death penalty world wide .
We mobilize grassroots activists to pass legislation abolishing the death penalty and defeat legislation that would reinstate it .
E-mail us at [ email protected ] to get more involved .
why we must act now
Human rights violations
All people have the right to live , and we all have the right to be free from cruel , inhuman , and degrading punishment .
These are human rights that people have , regardless of whether they have been convicted of crimes .
The death penalty violates these basic rights .
STANDING UP FOR WHAT’S RIGHT
The death penalty is the ultimate cruel , inhuman and degrading punishment .
Amnesty opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused , the nature or circumstances of the crime , guilt or innocence or method of execution .
Amnesty International believes than the death penalty should be abolished , once and for all .
The death penalty is too flawed to fix .
MEDIAWATCH :MIDWAY
THROUGH her debate with Joe Biden , Sarah Palin began dropping her Gs and channelling Marge Gunderson , the plain - speakin ' , pistol - packin ' pregnant police chief in Fargo .
Palin declared , in no uncertain terms , that she need n't answer questions put to her by the moderator , that Obama - lovin ' Gwen Ifill , who works for the ultraliberal Public Broadcasting Service , or anybody else in the mainstream media .
She was gonna talk straight to the American people .
It was great theatre , but in a Beckett - like absurdist way .
It is a tried and true tactic of the American right to blame any and all their problems on the " mainstream media " .
They even have an acronym for it : MSM , as if it 's some malevolent Chinese food additive .
According to the right , the only place the American people can get fair and balanced news is from the likes of Fox , Rush Limbaugh , and the rest of the right - wing ideologues who clutter the airwaves on talk radio .
The truth is , Sarah Palin and John McCain should thank their lucky stars for the dreaded MSM because , aside from the aforementioned ideologues , it is only those members of the MSM who uphold minimal journalistic standards of fairness and relative objectivity who are looking at Palin these days for anything but a punchline .
Even some right - wing pundits have had the temerity to point out that the nice lady from Alaska is an empty suit .
Peggy Noonan , Ronald Reagan 's speechwriter , got into trouble with her fellow Republicans when , while commenting on McCain 's cynical sop to the religious right , she described Palin 's selection as " political bulls * * t " into a TV microphone she did n't know was on .
Noonan 's dismissal of Palin as a serious politician in a Wall Street Journalcolumn after the debate was even more devastating , because it came with time for reflection , and after Noonan had withstood withering attacks from Republicans who accused her of aiding and abetting the enemy .
The McCain campaign is blaming the MSM for Palin 's steadily sinking poll numbers .
An interesting tactic , given that Palin 's handlers have steadfastly refused to let journalists from that mainstream media question her .
They are especially wary of letting newspaper reporters have a go at her .
She has done only a few sit - down interviews with handpicked TV presenters .
One of the interviews , with Sean Hannity , a right - wing pundit on Fox , was cringe - inducingly obsequious , like watching Ryan Tubridy interview Jesus Christ .
The interview with Katie Couric , an avowed liberal who gets paid $ 15 million a year to read the news on CBS , should n't have been much harder for Palin , but Couric asked a couple of questions that required speaking beyond rehearsed talking points , and Palin folded like a cheap suit .
Palin fumbled around like a child caught stealing biscuits .
At one point , she rambled on for more than a minute in a stream of consciousness that sounded like a cross between a paragraph in Finnegans Wakeand Robert De Niro 's last , apocalyptic words as he sank beneath the water 's surface at the conclusion to Cape Fear .
So worried were Palin 's handlers about how she 'd perform in the debate that , just days before it , they launched a pre-emptive strike on Ifill , a widely - respected journalist who just happens to be black .
You know , like Barack Hussein Osama .
Wink , wink .
The conservatives had a point : Ifill is writing a book called The Breakthrough : Politics and Race in the Age of Obama , so she has a personal and financial stake in Obama getting elected .
But when Ifill was selected as moderator two months ago , she disclosed that she was writing the book , and no one complained then .
Of course , McCain had not yet selected Tina Fey as his running mate .
As it turned out , no one beyond the loony right - wing blogosphere suggested Ifill was anything but impartial during the debate .
It 's sad but true that the mainstream media will carry on with the charade , all the way to November 4th , that Sarah Palin is a serious candidate , that she resonates with ordinary voters because she 's just so gosh darn ordinary , even if the Republicans have no intention of letting said ordinary voters hear what she has to say in anything but a stage - managed interview .
Objectivity is a beautiful thing .
It was beyond ironic , then , when Palin said she was taking the gloves off the other day and accused Obama of " palling around with terrorists " .
As her indisputable source for this specious accusation , she cited none other than the New York Times , America 's greatest newspaper , which she and the rest of the right constantly deride as a biased , bigoted mouthpiece of the liberal left .
Apparently , Governor Palin did n't read the article in its entirety , because the exhaustive piece concluded that Obama and William Ayers , who was a member of a violent radical group opposed to the Vietnam War , are acquaintances at best , and that Ayers became a respected professor of education after his radical youth .
In a media week when , aside from the more mundane news that the American economy is collapsing , it was all Palin , all the time , the best description of Sarah Palin 's utter cluelessness about anything outside her own small , provincial Northern Exposureexistence came from a caller to a talk radio show , albeit a show not typical of the usual American talk radio fare .
National Public Radio's " On Point " is one of the more thoughtful call - in shows in America , and one caller told host Tom Ashbrook that after listening to the debate she had come to the conclusion that Sarah Palin is George Bush in a skirt .
No doubt , Governor Palin would find comfort in her belief that anyone who listens to NPR is a God- hatin ' , Obama - lovin ' commie .

3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team returning from Iraq for homeland patrols to help with “ civil unrest ” and “ crowd control , ” training in use of non-lethal weapons
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Wednesday , September 24 , 2008
U.S. troops returning from duty in Iraq will be carrying out homeland patrols in America from October 1st in complete violation of Posse Comitatus for the purposes of helping with “ civil unrest and crowd control ” – which could include dealing with unruly Americans after a complete economic collapse .
This shocking admission was calmly reported on September 8th by the Army Times website , which reports that from the beginning of next month the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team “ Will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
The article notes that the deployment “ marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities . ”
The purpose of the unit ’s patrols includes helping “ with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The unit will be on homeland patrol for at least 20 months before returning to Iraq or Afghanistan in early 2010 , according to the report .
Training for homeland operations has already begun at Fort Stewart and at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs .
Ominously , the report states that , “ The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , ” 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them . ”
The unit would also be deployed to deal with hostile crowds of Americans in the aftermath of a massive economic depression , potential food riots and race riots , if one defines the term “ crowd control ” to match its reasonably applicable scenarios .
The open admission that U.S. troops will be involved in law enforcement operations as well as potentially using non-lethal weapons against American citizens is a complete violation of the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act , which substantially limit the powers of the federal government to use the military for law enforcement unless under precise and extreme circumstances .
Section 1385 of the Posse Comitatus
Act states , “ Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both . ”

Under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , signed by President Bush on October 17 , 2006 , the law was changed to state , “ The President may employ the armed forces to restore public order in any State of the United States the President determines hinders the execution of laws or deprives people of a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law or opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws . ”
However , these changes were repealed in their entirety by HR 4986 : National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 , reverting back to the original state of the Insurrection Act of 1807 .
The original text of the Insurrection Act severely limits the power of the President to deploy troops within the United States .
For troops to be deployed , a condition has to exist that , “ (1 ) So hinders the execution of the laws of that State , and of the United States within the State , that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law , and the constituted authorities of that State are unable , fail , or refuse to protect that right , privilege , or immunity , or to give that protection ; or ( 2 ) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws .
In any situation covered by clause ( 1 ) , the State shall be considered to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the Constitution . ”
Is the Bush administration and Northcom waiting for such a scenario to unfold , an event that completely overwhelms state authorities , before unleashing the might of the U.S. Army against the American people ?
The deployment of National Guard troops to aid law enforcement or for disaster relief purposes is legal under the authority of the governor of a state , but using active duty U.S. Army in law enforcement operations inside America absent the conditions described in the Insurrection Act is completely illegal .
With the promise of an “ October surprise ” on behalf of Bin Laden and Al - Qaeda being bandied about by the media and the potential for civil unrest should a complete collapse of the U.S. economy unfold , the presence of U.S. troops inside America , returning fresh from kicking down doors , arresting “ insurgents ” and taking them to internment camps in Iraq , should put Americans on alert and provoke urgent questions about the legality of U.S. Army units engaging in law enforcement operations against American citizens .

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said political leaders are discussing the idea of closing the world ’s financial markets while they “ rewrite the rules of international finance . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The idea of suspending the markets for the time it takes to rewrite the rules is being discussed , ” Berlusconi said today after a Cabinet meeting in Naples , Italy .
A solution to the financial crisis “ ca n’t just be for one country , or even just for Europe , but global . ”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much 8.1 percent in early trading and pared most of those losses after Berlusconi ’s remarks .
The Dow was down 0.5 percent to 8540.52 at 10:10 in New York .
Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in Washington today , and will stay in town for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings this weekend .
European Union leaders may gather in Paris on Oct. 12 , three days before a scheduled summit in Brussels , Berlusconi said today , while Group of Eight leaders may hold a meeting on the crisis “ in coming days , ” he said .
Berlusconi did n’t give any details about what kind of rules leaders were looking to change , except to say that leaders are “ talking about a new Bretton Woods . ”

Oct 15 ( Reuters ) -
The rescue plan unveiled by the United States to protect the nation ’s banks represents “ a major step towards stabilising the system , ” U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told the Financial Times in an interview .
Paulson told the paper he would not claim the action marked “ an end to financial stress , ” adding that the effects of the intervention would “ clearly take time to work through . ”
The U.S. was pressing ahead in parallel with its plan to buy troubled mortgage - related assets , Paulson told the paper .
The U.S. ushered in a new era in banking on Tuesday with plans to take equity stakes totalling up to $ 250 billion in financial institutions , an incursion into the private sector that U.S. officials called a regrettable last resort .

So I was putzin ' around on google image search , looking at cakes , of course , when I stumbled across this picture :
Which , you know , made me kind of curious .
So I went to the originating site of the photo and read the corresponding blog post .
It 's written by Scott of Basic Instructions , which you should definitely check out sometime .
Anyway , by the time I finished reading his post I was crying with laughter , and I knew I could not post his cake photo without the whole story attached .
I e-mailed him and got his permission , and so without further ado , here it is : " I had a day job as an office manager for the Seattle office of an international firm .
We found out that one of our employees was transferring to one of our offices in China .
When one of our people would leave , we usually had a little wing - ding with drinks and cake on the departing employee 's last Thursday in the office , so on Tuesday it fell to me to fax a cake order into our nearest Costco Bakery .
I should point out that on that day I had a headache so bad that it hurt to move my eyes .
Ordering the cake was the last thing I did before I went home sick for the afternoon .
As I filled out the order form , I realized that in addition to the personalized message ( " Good Luck in China , " in this case ) we could also get a large decoration for no extra charge .
I looked at the options and none of them were appropriate .
They were all things like teddy bears , balloons , or race cars .
Crap , in other words .
I figured if none of them were appropriate , I might as well get something that made no sense whatsoever .
I put a check mark next to the word " Fireman .
"
The next morning ( Wednesday ) , lying in bed just before getting up , my mind wandered over the previous day and all the things I had accomplished .
My eyes snapped open as I thought , " What did I do !?
Why did I order a fireman ?
That makes no sense !!!
I 'm going to look like an idiot !
" I went to work , intent on calling the Costco as soon as they opened and stopping the cake before it started .
I still had a day before I was supposed to pick it up .
I figured that should be plenty of time .
After some effort , I got hold of the bakery manager , only to be told that the cake had already been made .
It was too late .
I figured I 'd just have to stand up straight and take it like a man .
My wife and I went to Costco to pick up the cake .
When I got to the bakery , this is what was waiting for me .( see above picture ) Making the hose flesh - toned had been a very bad move .
At first all I could do was blink at it and wonder , " Am I the only one who sees a giant wang ? " I looked at my wife .
She was blinking at the cake .
An awkward silence and a few stammered sentences later we established that we both saw the same thing .
A fireman holding an immense , dripping wang .
I could not serve this cake to my coworkers .
My first thought was that I would just absorb the cost of a second cake and pretend this never happened .
Then I thought , " Wait a minute !
This is not an erotic bakery !
This is Costco !
I should be able to order any stupid cake I want and be confident that it will not be sexually charged .
" While at the checkout line I found a Costco employee to complain to , and showed him the cake .
He blinked at it .
I told him I was uncomfortable serving this cake at a place of business , and he started laughing and looking relieved .
Here ’s what I came to realize about the cake .
The obscene image was just obvious enough that you can't help but recognize it , but also obviously innocent enough that you do n't want to say anything for fear that you 're the only one who sees it .
Soon I was surrounded by several Costco employees who were looking at the cake and laughing .
They explained that they had a new cake decorator who was a deeply religious woman from a foreign country , as if that explained everything .
At one point while we were hammering out a settlement a woman happened by , caught a glimpse of the cake , covered her mouth and gasped .
Good stuff . "
AFTER years of fat profits and bonuses , cost - cutting is once again at the top of the corporate agenda .
For companies wanting to chop out middle - management dead wood or sack factory workers , costs can vary enormously across the world .
America , New Zealand and Tonga are among the most company - friendly countries , requiring no penalties or compensation to fire a full - time employee of 20 years .
By contrast , a business in Zimbabwe must shell out well over eight years ' worth of pay to sack a worker .
But companies in Venezuela and Bolivia are even more tied — workers there cannot be fired at all .

Today I installed numpy on a cluster .
Normally , as a Gentoo admin , I just install things with emerge , and all the details are taken care of automagically .
However , this cluster runs Red Hat Enterprise , and I do n’t have admin privileges , so I had to install numpy in my home directory .
I installed 1.0.4 , to match the version used on another system .
You may not need to do this for more recent versions of numpy , which may have an improved setup script .
The overall process is :
Unpack the tar file with : tar xfvz numpy - 1.0.4.tar.gz cd numpy - 1.0.4 cp site.cfg .example site.cfg vi site.cfg python setup.py install –home= ~
Numpy tries to find the installed system linear algebra libraries BLAS , ATLAS , and LAPACK .
If it ca n’t find them , you will miss out on some dramatic speed improvements .
This cluster happens to have the Intel Math Kernel Libraries ( mkl ) , which replace the open source versions .
To tell numpy where to find mkl , you have to edit the file site.cfg .
It is not immediately obvious what to do–at first I tried to add the mkl path and library names to the blas_opt and lapack_opt sections , but that did n’t work .
I had to add a section as follows :
[ mkl ]
library_dirs = /opt/software/intel/mkl/10.0.1.014/lib/em64t
mkl_libs = mkl , guide
lapack_libs = mkl_lapack
include_dirs = /opt/software/intel/mkl/10.0.1.014/include
I did n’t have to uncomment the blas_opt or lapack_opt sections at all .
I got this idea from a file I found on the scipy web site .
Leave a comment if this does or does not work for you .
AradiTracker has been closed down by its administrators over unspecified legal issues , reports TorrentFreak .
TorrentFreak was able to contact an anonymous source from the 24,000 peer bit torrent site , who said this was n't about money – but little else .
“ Early Thursday morning ( BST ) legal action was taken directly against Araditracker , " the source says .
" For the moment we are unable to divulge details .
As a direct result the decision has been taken to close the site .
It is very unlikely to return as a torrent tracker . ”
A year ago , the Dutch piracy outfit , BREIN , forced the ISP LeaseWeb to turn over the personal information of the admins for 6 torrent sites hosted on the provider , including AradiTracker .
The moved forced them to find a different host , but the four - year - old site has been up and running with no other major problems since then .

They 've now made an emergency appeal to the state Supreme Court to prevent the issuance of a report on the abuse of power by Sarah Palin in trying to get her ex brother - in - law fired from being a state trooper .
The resistance to transparency is coming from an out - of - state entity :
Texas - based Liberty Legal Institute and Anchorage attorney Kevin Clarkson , representing the group of anti-investigation legislators , filed the emergency appeal .
" The plaintiffs and Alaskans will suffer irreparable harm if the investigation at issue continues and if the resulting investigative report issues as planned on Oct. 10 , 2008 , " they wrote in their appeal .
I see no reason why candidates for the highest offices in the country should shut down legitimate legislative investigations into their alleged abuse of power , started long before they were such candidates .
In fact , I see very good reason for American voters to know what the Alaska legislature made of Palin 's ethics before they get to vote in November .
But as we know , John McCain believes in minimal transparency and maximal secrecy .
At least he has since Sarah Palin was pickd for his veep .

GOOGLE has snatched what is believed to be its biggest single client in the world - the NSW Department of Education - away from its rival Microsoft to claim up to 1.3 million new users of its free email product .
The NSW Director - General of Education , Michael Coutts - Trotter , said the department had exploited its size to get the best deal for students and teachers , who will each receive customised Gmail accounts .
" Our new email contract was so big that global players like Google were prepared to put together a world - class package of services for the children and young people in NSW public schools , " he said .
These guys are just digging into such depths of nonsense and desperation that pretty soon they ’re going to pop out in China , which will be helpful since they can ask the Chinese for the trillion dollars it ’ll take to bail out McCain ’s pals on Wall Street for the mess his economics advisor Phil Gramm made possible .
Here ’s the latest attempt to exploit the financial market crisis for political ends ( from CNN ) …
McCain supporter Sen. Lindsey Graham tells CNN the McCain campaign is proposing to the Presidential Debate Commission and the Obama camp that if there ’s no bailout deal by Friday , the first presidential debate should take the place of the VP debate , currently scheduled for next Thursday , October 2 in St. Louis .
So we need to put the country first and cancel the vice presidential debate .
Denver billionaire investor Philip Anschutz is plugging into the red - hot renewable - energy field , announcing plans to develop multibillion - dollar wind - farm and transmission - line projects .
The Anschutz Corp. said Tuesday it has acquired the rights to a proposed $ 3 billion , 3,000 - megawatt transmission project that will run from Wyoming to Southern California , Las Vegas and Phoenix .
The 900 - mile project will carry power from a 2,000 - megawatt wind farm Anschutz is developing in Carbon County in south - central Wyoming .
One megawatt of wind generation can power 300 homes .
The renewable - energy development is the first for Anschutz , who made his fortune in oil , gas , real estate , telecommunications and other ventures .
“ Anschutz has his roots in energy , ” said Jim Monaghan , a spokesman for Anschutz .
“ It ’s just a natural thing for a broad - based investment company that has roots in energy to be invested in alternative sources of clean energy . ”
Another billionaire investor , Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens , this month called for the nation to boost its wind - power generation from less than 2 percent to 20 percent over the next decade as part of a plan to cut dependence on foreign oil .
“ These projects were in play before we saw anything publicly from Pickens , ” Monaghan said .
A large portion of the wind farm will be built on a ranch Anschutz has owned for about 15 years , said Bill Miller , a longtime executive with the Anschutz Corp. , based in Denver .
The project will have to go through a permitting process with the Bureau of Land Management because it crosses federal land .
That process is expected to take 24 months to 30 months , Miller said .
Construction of the wind farm could take two years to four years after permitting is completed , he said .
The wind farm will span 100,000 acres and is being developed by Power Co. of Wyoming , a company owned by Anschutz .
The wind farm is expected to cost billions of dollars , but Miller did n’t provide an estimate because of the fluctuating price of materials .
The permitting process for the transmission project could take up to 36 months because it will cut across multiple states .
Anschutz acquired rights to the Transwest Express Transmission Project from National Grid , a London - based transmission and utility firm that has operations on the East Coast .

BOSTON —
The group fighting to reduce penalties for marijuana possession in Massachusetts charged yesterday that opponents are misrepresenting their ballot question as a referendum on legalizing marijuana , rather than its intent to reduce penalties for small amounts of pot .
Whitney Taylor , campaign manager of the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , said a radio ad this week misrepresented the referendum question .
“ This ad goes beyond misstatements , spin or opinion and blatantly lies about what Question 2 would do if passed , ” Taylor said .
“ The opponents of Question 2 are trying to dupe the voters of Massachusetts into thinking that Question 2 is something it ’s not . ”
Question 2 , a voter referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot , would decriminalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana , instead imposing a fine .
Vote No on Question Two , a collection of law enforcement and civic organizations , purchased the ad that said “ legalizing marijuana will have a disastrous impact on thousands of families living in Massachusetts . ”
William Breault , the voice in the ad and chairman of Main South Alliance for Public Safety , a Worcester public - safety advocacy organization leading the fight against the question , said he had no qualms about the ad ’s language .
“ If legalize helps us to get the public ’s attention , we will use it , ” Breault said .
“ We have not told ( supporters of Question 2 ) what to do , so they should n’t tell us what to do . ”
Breault said he felt comfortable about the language in the ad , because he believes that the pro-marijuana committee , which received $ 400,000 from billionaire George Soros in 2007 , ultimately wants marijuana users to face no penalties .
“ Soros is the sugar daddy of the legalization movement , ” Breault said .
“ Question 2 supporters are a carefully camouflaged , highly intelligent elitist group with the goal of legalization . ”
Taylor , however , said Breault ’s claims are a further distortion of facts , saying Soros has never embraced legalization .
“ Soros contributed money so that this issue would be discussed and debated based on facts , ” Taylor said .
“ Unfortunately , our opponents just want to bring up red herrings rather than debate the actual issues . ”
Financial support for the ad in question came from Save Our Society From Drugs , a non-profit organization against lenient drug policies based in St. Petersburg , Fla .
Calvina Fay , the group ’s executive director , said that Massachusetts citizens have asked for support in fighting Question 2 and believes the ad was accurate .
“ When you decriminalize drugs you are essentially legalizing them , ” Fay said .
This is not the first time the pro-marijuana committee has accused their opposition of breaking the rules .
In September , Question 2 supporters filed complaints with Attorney General Martha Coakley ’s office , charging that the Massachusetts District Attorney ’s Association distributed false statements about the ballot question on its Web site .
Taylor ’s group also filed complaints with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance charging the Coalition for Safe Streets , another opposition group , with campaign - finance violations .
The AG ’s office threw out the charges made against the district attorney ’s association , but no decision has been released on the campaign - finance charges .
Hackers claim they have broken into the computer system of the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , the mega - machine designed to expose secrets of the cosmos , British newspapers are reporting .
A group calling itself the Greek Security Team left a rogue web page mocking the technicians responsible for computer security at the giant atom smasher as " schoolkids " , the Times and Daily Telegraph reported .
The hackers vow they have no intention of disrupting the experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) on the Swiss - French border , they just wanted to highlight the flaws in the computer system 's security .
" We 're pulling your pants down because we do n't want to see you running around naked looking to hide yourselves when the panic comes , " they wrote , according to the Daily Telegraph .
The hackers claim to have gained access to a website open to other scientists on Wednesday ( local time ) as the LHC passed its first test with flying colours , the reports said .
They appear to have tried to gain access to the computer system of the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment , one of the four detectors that will be analysing the progress of the experiment .
James Gillies , a spokesman for CERN , told the Times says there does not seem to be any harm done .
" We do n't know who they were but there seems to be no harm done .
It appears to be people who want to make a point that CERN was hackable , " he said .
Scientists have hailed the success of the start of the experiment in the Large Hadron Collider , the 27 - kilometre circular tunnel in which parallel beams of protons will be accelerated to nearly the speed of light .
Superconducting magnets will then steer the counter - rotating beams so that strings of protons smash together in four huge laboratories , fleetingly replicating the conditions that prevailed at the Big Bang that created the Universe 13.7 billion years ago .

PC gaming was n't a huge factor at this year 's E3 , but it seems that Microsoft was merely biding its time before making its big moves to try and perk up the waning PC gaming market .
The company made a variety of positive announcements at the GameFest technology conference in Seattle this week , including the announcement of DirectX 11 and the removal , and in some cases refunding , of subscription fees for Games for Windows Live .
DirectX 11 will build on the groundwork of DirectX 10 without staggering the market as did its predecessor .
DX 11 will fully support Windows Vista , as well as future versions of Windows , including all DX 11 hardware features .
More importantly , DX 11 will be compatible with DX 10 and 10.1 hardware , as well as the new forthcoming DX 11 hardware .
Noteworthy improvements with the APIs include GPGU support " that lays the groundwork for the GPU to be used for more than just 3D graphics , " as well as multithreaded resource handling and tessellation support .
" DirectX 11 will be coming when the next version of Windows ships , and it will be available for Vista at the same time , " said Kevin Unangst , senior global director of Windows gaming , in a call with Ars earlier today .
" Of course , developer SDKs , and so forth , will be available in advance of that .
Details are still being disclosed to developers now . "
Microsoft is being more careful with DirectX 11 when it comes to pushing out the technology to consumers .
Many criticized the way that DirectX 10 staggered the PC gaming market as it attempted to lure gamers to switch to Vista , and that 's something the company does n't seem to want to repeat .
" We 're giving the developers the early look , " said Unangst .
" With DirectX 11 , we do n't have to make the same platform shift [ as we did with DirectX 10 ] . "
Kevin Unangst
While DirectX 11 will mean big changes for developers now , gamers will immediately benefit from the company 's newly announced revamps of the Games for Windows Live platform .
Most notably , the Games for Windows Live service is now free for all preexisting GFWL titles , and will hold all forthcoming titles .
This service used to cost $ 50 a year , as it does for the sister Xbox Live service , and includes platform - wide TruSkill matchmaking , cross-platform play with the Xbox 360 , voice and text chat , and integrated community features , such as the gamercard and integrated friends lists .
This change comes as the result of criticism of Microsoft 's for - pay service which was launched at a time when comparable and arguably superior services already existing for PC gamers were already available for free
" The work that we did over the last year was important .
We launched Games for Windows Live : we took the plumbing from Xbox Live and then applied to the PC world , " Unangst told Ars .
" People liked achievements , automatic updates , friends lists , and so on .
We wanted to do new things , like cross- platform gameplay .
We 've had a number of partners sign on .
But I think what we learned over the last year is that services play a big role in how Windows gaming is evolving and moving .
We talked to publishers and developers of PC content , and for the gamers , multiplayer is a baseline expectation on Windows .
So we decided to make the decision now for free Games for Windows Live . "
Refunds for early adopters
But that 's not all .
To reward those gamers who have been with the service from the beginning , Microsoft will be giving refunds to gamers who have been subscribing to the Games for Windows Live service specifically .
" Yes , there will be a benefit for customers who purchased gold subscriptions on Windows , " said Unangst .
" Proactively , we will be offering refunds for those with Windows - specific Gold subscriptions .
Customer service has already begun to get communications prepared . "
In addition , Microsoft plans to launch a Windows Live equivalent of the Xbox Live Marketplace .
PC gamers will be able to access free and for - pay downloadable games , trailers , demos , and more .
This will give developers and publishers a new outlet for content , leveraging Microsoft 's reach , which will complement continued improvements of the Games for Windows Live APIs behind the scenes and the elimination of licensing fees for developers leveraging the platform or royalty fees for using the brand .
The marketplace will include " exclusive content optimized for [ the platform ] . "
And , though " there will be some overlap " between the Xbox Live Marketplace and the GFW Live one , " the portfolios and catalogs will cater directly to the specific audience . "
Unangst used Fallout 3 as an example of a game that would have content on both .
PC gamers and developers were n't the only benefactors of the company 's string of announcements .
Microsoft also revealed that the Xbox Live Community Games initiative , which it announced at GDC earlier this year , would be taking on a whole new importance .
Independent developers will be able to set prices for their content when the service launches later this fall , allowing them to reap the benefits of a closed distribution system and the muscle of Microsoft , as well as up to 70 percent of the profits .
This is potentially something that the new Windows - based Marketplace may also eventually integrate .
" The primary focus of the Games for Windows Live marketplace is to extend the game experience and offer additional game content , " Unangst explained .
" That does n't preclude us from distributing community games in the future .
The infrastructure is certainly there .
We 're just not ready to talk about that part of the roadmap yet . "
When asked about how Microsoft expects Xbox Live gamers to respond now that the equivalent service on Windows is free , Unangst explained that the value of the two similar services was different for each audience .
" It 's all a part of that philosophy of designing what 's best for each of our customers .
On the Windows side , we 're meeting the demand of the PC gaming audience , " said Unangst .
" But we 're also adding more and more value for Xbox Live Gold with things like NetFlix integration , party chat , and so on .
That 's more and more value for what is already a very good deal .
I 'm an Xbox Live Gold Subscriber , I pay my monthly fee — what 's it , $ 5 bucks a month ?
Now you get the same kind of value for the Windows .
They are linked , but they are distinct services . "
Unangst was resolute in his stance that PC gaming remains a big focus of Microsoft , in spite of claims to the contrary that have resulted from the successes of the Xbox 360 .
While much of the press has been critical of the PC Gaming Alliance and the overall strategy towards furthering the PC gaming industry , Unangst was adamant in saying that rumors of PC gaming 's death have been greatly exaggerated .
With regard to questions about the move to DirectX 11 and how that affected the PCGA 's attempt to open up PC gaming to the masses , Unangst spoke carefully .
" You can look at the mission and the intent of the PCGA at a broader level , " he said .
" It 's not about technology adoption , it 's about having an industry forum that has the dialogues about PC gaming .
We have members of the hardware community and the software community that are a part of that .
We have constructive discussions .
We all have a shared interest in seeing that PC gaming stays at the forefront . "
Looking ahead
So what 's the next step for Microsoft now ?
" It 's a question of what starts today , " Unangst said .
" The industry is moving towards digital distribution in a big way .
Once people stop looking at NPD and US retail sales as the sole barometer of PC gaming strength , they will realize that PC gaming is growing exponentially .
There 's no question that the industry is healthy . "
" [ Microsoft 's new developments ] are the indicator of the continued investment , " concluded Unangst .
" We 're going to go and invest in PC gaming in a big way .
First we did the retail and the branding and the marketing , then we did advertising , and now you 're starting to see the fruits of our technology advances .
We 've been listening to the industry and saying ' what do you want from us to make the platform better ? ' "
With these new initiatives , Microsoft is doing exactly what many had hoped it would do : working harder for PC gaming .
The company is putting more resources , more time , and more money into further expanding the way that gamers play on their Windows boxes .
Games for Windows
Live is now far more relevant than it was as a paid service , the company 's continued focus on bringing more games to the platform and offering more tools to developers big and small is admirable , and the enthusiasm of its important PC gaming executives is there .
Maybe PC gaming is n't dying after all .

It turned out the " apparatchik from central office " was looking at the wrong backyard but Mr Rahr was outraged that his council could monitor anyone 's home : " It gave me a nasty feeling .
It was just like Big Brother , like something out of 1984 . "
The council does not use Google Street View or Google Maps , but rather its own in - house aerial mapping program , E - view .
Mr Rahr said " that makes me feel even more creepy .
It 's a bit weird they have their own program just to look at us . "
In fact , it is common practice for councils to use aerial mapping programs to keep track of information they gather .
Every time a dog attack is reported , a complaint made , a development application submitted or a bike rack installed , the information goes into the mapping system .
" If councils did n't have this kind of information , it would be a concern .
We would n't be able to do our job , " said a City of Sydney spokesman , Josh Mackenzie .
More than half the council 's staff can log into E - View , which allows them to search on a person 's name or address or zoom in on the detailed aerial photos .
The City of Sydney 's spatial information co-ordinator , Matthew Dobson , said that the aerial shots were soon to be updated .
" A number of councils have E - View or similar programs .
You just could n't get by without them , " he said .
However , the secretary of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties , Stephen Blanks , said statutory authorities should not be gathering personal information without consent .
" For example , on Google Street View you can email Google and have the photograph of your property removed .
Where 's the equivalent facility on this ? " he asked .
( h/t Heather )
NY Times columnist Bob Herbert appeared on Countdown to put some perspective on McCain 's rose - colored promises of a $ 5,000 per family tax break somehow being an adequate plan to insure more Americans .
OLBERMANN : The infamous article — the “ contigencies ” article — that John McCain wrote when he wrote an article for the actuarial magazine reader : “ We need to do for health insurance what we ’ve done for the banking industry . ”
We ’ll just for a moment throw out the economic collapse that resulted from doing that , even taking him at his word that he only meant the interstate commerce part , of letting you shop for a better healthcare plan in Arizona if you live in Michigan , is there any way that wo n’t end in disaster ?
HERBERT : No .
That will be guaranteed to end in disaster because what he wants to do is essentially deregulate the healthcare insurance industry .
So what happens is a health insurance company sets up in a state that has the least regulations , so what happens now is if you purchase private healthcare , you may have a plan that says you get breast examinations that are covered or covered if you have a pre-existing condition or you ’re covered for an ordinary annual checkup .
Well if the company is set up in a state that says you do n’t have to provide that coverage , well , guess what ?
Do we think that they ’re going to provide it ?
No , they ’re not going to provide it .
So you ’re going to get healthcare that is of a much lesser value .
This is exactly what they want to do , though .
I mean , this is an ideological thing .
They want healthcare to go into the marketplace .
They do n’t want healthcare provided on the job and they do n’t want government sponsored healthcare .
They want everybody out there in the marketplace .
Ergonomic Computer Workstations – Equipment and Setup Guide
A properly set up workstation is the utmost thing to be considered for maintaining good ergonomics at the office .
See our handy guide below :
Quick Setup Guide :
STEP 1 : Your Chair
A proper ergonomic chair is crucial to any ergonomic workstation .
If you need to find yourself a good chair , we have reviewed the best ergonomic chairs on the market in 2017 , and included an extensive buying guide as well .
Here are a few tips for after you ’ve picked a chair that works well for you :
The hips should be pushed as far back as possible against the chair .
The seat height should be adjusted so that the feet stay flat on the floor and the knees are equal to or slightly lower than the hips .
The back of the chair need to be adjusted to a 100° - 110° reclined angle .
The user should ensure that the upper and lower back is supported .
Inflatable cushions or small pillows can be used , if required .
The armrest ( if present ) can be adjusted to relax the shoulders .
If armrests are uncomfortable , immediately remove them .
STEP 2 : Your Keyboard
A keyboard tray can provide optimal positioning of input devices .
It should accommodate the mouse , enable leg clearance , and have an adjustable height and tilt mechanism .
The tray should not push the user too far away from other work materials , such as telephone .
The user should pull himself / herself close to the keyboard .
The keyboard should be positioned directly in front of the user ’s body .
The keyboard and desk height needs to be adjusted so that the shoulders are relaxed , elbows are in a slightly open position ( 100° to 110° ) , and the wrists and hands are straight .
The tilt of the keyboard is dependent upon the sitting position of the user .
Use the keyboard tray mechanism , or keyboard feet , to adjust the tilt .
While sitting in a forward or upright position , the user should try to tilt it away from him / her at a negative angle .
If the user is reclined , a slight positive tilt will help maintain a straight wrist position .
Wrist rests are excellent in helping to maintain neutral postures and pad hard surfaces .
However , the wrist rest should only be used to rest the palms of the hands between keystrokes .
It is not recommended to rest the palms on the wrist rest while typing .
Avoid using excessively wide wrist rests , or wrist rests that are higher than the space bar of your keyboard because it might cause strain .
Place the pointer as close as possible to the keyboard .
Placing it on a slightly inclined surface , or using it on a mouse bridge placed over the 10 - keypad , can help to bring it closer .
If you do not have a fully adjustable Ergonomic Keyboard Tray , you may need to adjust your workstation height , the height of your chair , or use a seat cushion to get in a comfortable position .
Remember to use a footrest if your feet hang down .
STEP 3 : Monitor , Desk , and Phone
If the screen and source documents are not positioned correctly , it may force the user to work in awkward postures .
These need to be adjusted so that your neck is in a neutral , relaxed position .
Try the following :
A new study in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy explored how men and women perceive online and offline sexual and emotional infidelity .
Results show that men felt sexual infidelity was more upsetting and women felt emotional infidelity was more upsetting .
Monica T. Whitty and Laura - Lee Quigley of Queen ’s University Belfast surveyed 112 undergraduate students and asked them questions about sexual and emotional infidelity both offline and on the internet .
When given the choice , men were more upset by sexual infidelity and women were more upset by emotional infidelity .
Additionally , “ men were more likely to believe that women have sex when in love and that women believe that men have sex even when they are not in love .
It was not , however found that either men or women believe that having cybersex implied the other was also in love or that being in love online implied they were having cybersex . ”
“ Given the newness of the internet , the rules have still not been clearly defined as to what are acceptable online encounters , ” the authors note .
“ Our results support a social - cognitive model as they demonstrate that social shifts have led men and women to think differently about sex and love . ”

Couple Tried to Trade Sex With 5yo Girl for Apartment and Used Car
A woman and her married boyfriend , living in San Antonio , have been accused of trying to offer sex with the woman 's daughter , aged 5 , for an apartment , a used car and child care for the woman 's second 10 - months - old daughter .
The couple will appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Stein Nowak on August 29 .
Jennifer Richards , 25 , is charged with using interstate facilities to spread the information about a minor , while Sean Michael Block , 40 , is accused of distributing child porn .
FBI started an investigation on the issued after one of its informants found out about a text message that was presumably sent by Block .
The message read : " Nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it . "
The FBI 's lead agent on the case , Rex Miller , said that the two made a deal which included an apartment , a used car and child care for Richards ' 10 - months - old daughter .
Both intended to sell the toddler later .
In addition the two looked to blackmail the informant .
The woman " was of the belief that these sexual interactions would be a positive experience for ( her daughter ) and that Richards would receive sexual gratification " from watching , the affidavit said .
According to the authorities the two children are no longer in the woman 's custody .
Richards did not manage to sell her daughter for sex .
Rex Miller also concluded that the couple had plans to kidnap , rape and " carve up " a teenage runaway .
The conclusion was made after FBI 's lead agent on the case reviewed computers that Block and Richards used and listened to several tape conversations .
Ronald Guyer , Block 's lawyer , accepted the severity of the charges .
However , he mentioned that FBI found no evidence that Block 's behavior advanced beyond his desires .
" There has been no action on his part , " Guyer told the judge .
Block and Richards met at the Cheesecake Factory at North Star Mall , where he worked as a bartender and she was a waitress .
Block 's wife Sarah Block , filed for divorce on August 22 .
She also filed for protective order on behalf of her 14 - month - old child .

Pennsylvania is hardly the first state where you would expect innovation in wine retail .
The state ’s Liquor Control Board owns all the retail outlets and the distribution in the state .
Generally monopolies are known for limited selection and high prices , not innovation .
Yet that is exactly what might be in store for Pennsylvania wine enthusiasts as the state has proposed to allow 100 “ wine kiosks ” around the state .
To the tape :
The kiosks , a type of temperature - controlled vending machine capable of holding 500 bottles of wine , would be placed in grocery stores and other places [ malls ] , according to request on the LCB ’s Web site .
They would offer about a dozen different types of wine .
Before you think this is where all the minors are going to go before the prom , each kiosk will have “ fingerprints and biometric readings ” for age verification .
Yikes !
Retinal scan for retsina .
Making wine more accessible is a good thing .
I hope for all wine loving Pennsylvanians that the selection is great !
Get a little Bollinger before heading to Borders ?
Malbec and a movie ?
I wonder if they will have stemware .
Or perhaps TetraPak wine so the bottle does n’t break while being dispensed .
Would you like to see them in your state ?

GHC 6.10 promised to deliver on 2 things that I 'm looking forward to a lot :
Data Parallel Haskell ( in some form )
Associated types ( fully working )
This is about the first of those .
The GHC 6.10 beta was just recently released and with the extralibs package came dph !
I 've therefore been investigating it a little and here 's what I 've come up with for those that are interested .
Quickly : What is DPH ?
Data Parallel
Haskell is an extension to Haskell to support highly optimized parallel arrays for doing nested data parallelism .
In particular , it allows you to write pretty expressions like this :
test xs ys zs = sumP $ zipWithP ( -) [ : z +( x*y /2 ) | x <- xs , y <- ys , z <- zs :] [ : ( y ^ 2 ) - 1 | y <- [ :1..:] :]
And GHC will do the conversion of that nice , list - like syntax into highly optimized arrays that can run in parallel on your SMP machine .
It 's an excellent way to harness many cores by doing uniform operations over very large data sets .
This is a vectorised syntax and the pass in GHC that does this complex transformation is the vectorisation pass .
The packages that come with dph
As it stands , 6 packages actually comprise the DPH system :
dph -base - this is the basic interface and provides things like the internal fusion primitives
dph-prim - interface - this ( AFAICS ) is something of a psuedo - interface to Prelude functions in reality .
dph-par -
This library exposes a set of parallel combinators for doing computations using the vectorised syntax for arrays , and doing it in parallel as well .
dph -prim - par -
The primitive , unlifted interface to the parallel combinators .
dph-seq -
This library exposes simple sequential combinators for doing computations with the vectorised syntax .
dph -prim - seq -
This is the primitive , unlifted interface to sequential combinators .
There are a few things worth noting .
First , dph-par and dph-seq are based on the dph - prim - par and dph - prim - seq packages , respectively .
The vectorisation pass in GHC does the conversion from what I can tell .
Second , dph-par and dph-seq export the exact same set of modules and an identical interface .
The reason is that you can just pass a flag to GHC stating if you want to use the parallel version of DPH or just the sequential version .
You do n't have to make any API changes but you get more control over how things work .
Likewise , dph - prim - par and dph - prim - seq export a practically identical interface if you are doing unlifted operations so you can again choose if you want to use the sequential or parallel versions of the package ( although they do export modules that the other does n't have - the most general interface is just using Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Unlifted which are identical . )
When compiling your code , you pass either the - fdph - par flag to get the parallel combinators , or the - fdph - seq flag to get sequential ones .
The interface you use for either ( in both the vectorised and more plain , unlifted case ) is identical .
Example : Dot product
For an example of both of the interfaces we 'll be writing a simple parallel dot product and using it in a few computations , with the vectorised interface and the unlifted one .
The first file , test.hs , will simply contain the driver for our experiment .
{-# LANGUAGE PArr , CPP #-} #ifdef PRIM import DotPPrim import Data .

So we can compile with - DPRIM to use the primitive interface and otherwise we 'll use the vectorised one .
The vectorised version of the dot product module is nice and simple :
{-# LANGUAGE PArr #-} {-# OPTIONS - fvectorise #-} module DotPVect where import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Prelude .
Int as I dotp :: [ : Int : ] -> [ : Int : ] ->
Int dotp v w = I.sumP [ : ( I.* ) x y | x <- v , y <- w :]
This example is really touchy - for example , you must use the ( * ) operator exported from Data .
Array .
PArallel .
PreludInte - using the regular Prelude version will cause the vectoriser to choke .
The vectorisation pass is still in the works , though .
Regardless we have a very nice , declarative syntax as of right now .
The options we need to compile with in particular are :
ghc - fcpr-off - threaded - Odph - funbox - strict - fields - fdph- par ...
So if we compile these two modules , we get our nice program .
However , we do n't get anywhere due to a massive space leak that causes the program to die with a stack overflow :
$ $ HOME / ghc-6.10/bin/ghc - o vect -- make test.hs - fcpr-off - threaded - Odph - funbox - strict - fields - fdph- par [ 1 of 2 ] Compiling DotPVect ( DotPVect.hs , DotPVect.o ) [ 2 of 2 ]

As far as I can tell this is due to the fact that sumP is in reality just a redefinition of GHC .
PArr.sumP which is n't optimized at all , I guess .
As well , we cannot even examine the core of this program using ghc - core - it 's so huge it would cause less to suck up hundreds of megs of memory !
So the vectorised approach works , but it is not at all optimized right now and the vectoriser is very touchy , so getting things just to compile right can be very annoying , and there are some glaring holes in the API that are filled in the unlifted API .
For a preliminary release that might be asking a bit much , but hey , at least the vectorisation pass does work and we do use both cores on my core2 duo ! :]
Luckily , if we go to the primitive interface we get much better results .
The DotPPrim module is also quite simple :
module DotPPrim where import Data .
Array .
Parallel .
Unlifted as U dotp :: U.Array Int -> U.Array Int ->
Int dotp v w = U.sum ( U.zipWith ( *) v w )
This version works a lot better and faster , and we do utilize both those nice cores :
$ $ HOME / ghc-6.10/bin/ghc - o prim - DPRIM -- make test.hs - fcpr-off - threaded - Odph - funbox - strict - fields - fdph- par [ 1 of 2 ] Compiling DotPPrim ( DotPPrim.hs , DotPPrim.o ) [ 2 of 2 ]

If we look at the core output of this program using ghc - core we can see thousands of optimization rules firing and the core is n't that bad , either .
So the primitive interface gives us much better results , we use both cores , and it is n't very difficult to use , either .
As the vectorisor and the pass get better and better in the future however , it would naturally be preferable to just use that good syntactic sugar .
Conclusion
DPH is going to be a lot of fun - once the API is more complete and the vectorizer is touched up a bit , it should prove to be very nice in practice .
Right now the syntactic sugar for vectors works but the vectoriser is quite fickle and will go ' boom ' on very simple things / changes that can in practice be quite annoying .
As well the vectorisation pass increases compile times a lot .
OTOH , the primitive interface works nicely right now and there 's a lot more functions exposed from the get go - although they are by no means complete .
Regardless , you can probably fix yourself up some nice things to play with right now .
DPH is going to change a lot in the future but with the new Recycle your Arrays work , the vectoriser getting more robust , as well as API gaps getting filled , things should get even better and faster .
Perhaps some of the shootout benchmarks would be nice to test DPH on ?
Dana Gould should give Dems lessons on how to make these people look like the pompous fools they are :
Because it sums up many of modern individual ’s problems , this photo brought a smile to my face .
I do n’t know if it ’s real or not , but it surely is an interesting message .
Someone who only wants a simple living , just enough to feed his family and make it through without worrying for his dear ones immediate needs , ca n’t be someone who does n’t know how to enjoy life and its little charms .
I have no social understanding of this ever - wanting - more and forgetting - to - actually - live phenomenon but it ’s spreading like a virus .
So do n’t forget to stop and ask yourself every once in a while what is the cost of your work .
The actual cost of your work .
And if that helps you or keeps you from living and enjoying your life !

PDF : Aspartame Study Female Rats Developed Visible Tumors
Victoria Inness - Brown , M.A .
Aspartame Experiment
September 15 , 2008
“ In my opinion , we are the rats of the pharmaceutical and chemical companies that liberally spread their synthetic chemicals worldwide , with no one fully understanding the long - term adverse effects — especially the complex interactions from injecting and intermixing thousands of toxic chemicals in the plant and animal kingdoms sustaining our planet . ”
— Victoria Inness - Brown
As a citizen scientist concerned about family members addicted to diet soda , I performed a 2 - 1/ 2 year scientific study on the effects of the artificial sweetener aspartame by putting aspartame ( in the form of packets of NutraSweet™ ) in the drinking water of 60 rats , while keeping 48 as controls .
Of my 30 females on aspartame , 20 of them — or 67 % — developed tumors the size of golf balls or greater .
Of my 30 males on aspartame , seven — or 23 % — developed visible tumors .
Five control females — or 21 % — developed visible tumors generally smaller in size .
No tumors were observed in my control males .
The percentage of females - to - males with tumors was approximately 3:1 , which coincides with the complaints about aspartame registered with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ( FDA )
before it stopped accepting them , where females registered 77 % of all complaints .
My rats on aspartame also developed other apparent health issues , such as paralysis , difficulty walking , spasmodic torticollis ( also called dystonia , where the neck is twisted and the head continually tilted to one side ) , infected and bleeding eyes , skin lesions , thinning and yellowing fur , and obesity — which is sad , because people often use aspartame to lose weight .
1 H.J. Roberts , MD , Aspartame Disease , an Ignored Epidemic ( West Palm Beach , FL : Sunshine Sentinel Press , Inc. , 2001 ) : 88 .
In reference to L. Tollefson ,
R.J. Barnard , and W.H. Glinsmann , “ Monitoring of adverse reactions to aspartame reported to the U.S .
Food and Drug Administration , ” in Proceedings of the First International Meeting on Dietary Phenylalanine and Brain Function , edited by R.J. Wurtman and E. Ritter - Walker , Washington DC ( May 1987 ) : 347-372 .
Female on aspartame who often used her huge tumor as a pillow Male on aspartame whose hind legs became paralyzed while consuming aspartame .
Three of the rats in my control group developed thinning fur and one developed skin problems .
The US Acceptable Daily Intake ( ADI ) set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) allows for the human consumption of 50 mg of aspartame per kg of body weight per day , which is equivalent to a 150 - lb person drinking about 20 12 - oz.
cans of diet soda .
My male rats received about 34 mg / kg of aspartame per day , which is equivalent to a 150 - lb. ( 68 - kg ) human male drinking about 13 12 - oz.
cans or 2.25 two - liter bottles of diet soda a day .
My females received about 45 mg / kg per day , which is equivalent to a 120 - lb. ( 55 - kg ) human female drinking about 14 12 - oz. cans or 2.4 two - liter bottles of diet soda a day .
FDA laws state that the ADI for any food additive should be one hundred times less than the
lowest amount found to cause adverse health effects .
2 If my results are considered valid , then the ADI for aspartame should be the equivalent of less than 1/8 can of diet soda per day .
However , if the tumor rate observed in my study is considered valid , then aspartame should be removed from the marketplace altogether .
According to the pro-aspartame authors of The Clinical Evaluation of a Food Additive : Assessment of Aspartame , “
If the additive is found to cause cancer in either animals or humans at any dose , it is banned from use as a food additive , as a result of the Delaney Anticancer Clause of 1958 . ”

For complete details , get My Aspartame Experiment : Report from a Private Citizen , available from my website as a downloadable e-book .
Note :
After reading my report , my family member who had been consuming the most aspartame - laced diet soda said “ Your report is very convincing .
Since reading it , I ’ve cut way down on diet sodas with aspartame . ”
Note :
My heavily referenced new e-book , My Aspartame Experiment : Report from a Private Citizen , with compelling personal testimonies from aspartame victims , becoming an integral part of an astonishing story underscored by quotes from independent scientific studies and other sources reporting serious adverse effects from aspartame .
Salted within the story are “ Pollyanna - like ” quotes from aspartame industry “ talking points ” that are also distributed by the numerous national and global regulatory agencies meant to protect the 200,000,000 consumers worldwide who daily ingest aspartame in over 6000 foods , drinks , pharmaceutical drugs and vitamins .
This powerful combination of strategically placed quotes and photos dramatically illustrates the stark contrasts between the studies sponsored by the aspartame industry that consistently claim aspartame is safe , versus those done by independent researchers consistently reporting serious adverse effects from the sweetener .
The report also highlights the deep conflicts of interests of the scientists and doctors who did the highly - applauded pro-aspartame Magnuson 2007 Report , and debunks a multitude of other aspartame industry studies by exposing the flaws in their experimental designs .

" Looking at the size of the credit market in the United States , the equities market , the housing market and then looking at the size of the credit default swap market , which is around $ 62 trillion now , and the world wide derivatives market which is now $ 1,300 trillion dollars , I very much doubt that $ 700 billion would make any difference at all .
In fact , I think it 's a bad proposal in the sense that it will distort market pricing , " Faber said .
( Watch the complete Marc Faber interview on the U.S. bailout plan on the left )
Faber says that the fundamental problem is not falling home prices as U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson suggests .
" The problem is that too much money was lent against homes at inflated asset values .
In other words that means at the peak of the market , people went and lent them 120 percent against the value of the home .
And that is the problem — the leverage in the system , " Faber said .
He added that the current bailout plan proposed by the Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve does not address this leverage problem in the markets .
More From CNBC.com
" My friend suggested what would be much cheaper — go in and buy a million homes in the United States and burn them down .
Because that will reduce the supply .
Of course it is an economic nonsense solution , but it is as good as the Treasury 's proposal , " Faber quipped .
Negotiations over the bailout to restore credit markets degenerated into chaoslate Thursday , as politicians wrangled over the details of the rescue plan .
And while the bickering on Capitol Hill heated up , Washington Mutual , the largest U.S. savings and loan bank , was taken over by authorities and with JPMorgan Chase buying up most of its assets .
U.S. stock futures fell by more than 1 percent .
Spc Hinzman has described the war in Iraq as illegal
Canada is to deport a United States soldier who fled to the country to avoid deployment in Iraq .
Spc Jeremy Hinzman , 29 , was told his family 's application for refugee status had been turned down by Canada .
His supporters say Spc Hinzman , who had already served a tour of duty in Afghanistan , was the first Iraq war resister to seek sanctuary in Canada .
Some 200 deserters from the US military are believed to have fled to Canada , some living incognito .
Others have sought refugee status .
Lee Zaslofsky , a spokesman for the War Resisters ' Support Campaign , a pressure group helping US deserters in Canada , told AFP news agency Spc Hinzman would face " cruel " and " harsh " punishment in the United States .
Deserters from the US military face a court martial and up to five years in prison .
Canada last month deported the first US deserter to have arrived in the country since the war in Iraq .
Robin Long is now in detention in the US , awaiting court martial .
Although the parliament in Ottawa passed a non-binding motion in June allowing US deserters to remain , the government has ignored the vote .
The conservative government is said to be keen to avoid angering Washington over the issue .
Tens of thousands of Americans , most of them avoiding the military draft , found refuge in Canada during the Vietnam war .
Canadians in favour of deporting the latest generation of deserters argue that the US no longer has compulsory conscription .

You said 700 BILLION ?
An alien observing this whole financial mess from orbit would find it all very interesting .
I do as well , on one level .
Fascinating stuff .
Learning more and more about the innards of the US financial system .
On another level , it terrifies the crap out of me .
Someone ’s writing a check in MY name to the tune of $ 10 k or so to cover this ( $ 700 billion total ) ?
WHAT ?
I ’ve got a kid on the way and am scrimping and saving .
I turned off cable TV !
Hell , I started drinking the crappy free coffee at work instead of buying good stuff , and starting bringing peanut butter sandwiches for lunch .
I ’m saving my ass off and some pin striped suit wearing sonofabitch is sticking his hands out to the tune of 700 BILLION DOLLARS ?
Screw that noise , let them die !
Let every bank fail ; fuck ’em .
So my next mortgage will be drawn against a Chinese bank ?
Fine .
They probably at least know what they ’re doing better than the US bankers .
The Infamous Brad has a good point about when it will end … as of December 31 , 2009 , 97 % of all of the teaser rate mortgages will have reset … so the dipshits who bought a house way bigger they could afford will have been foreclosed upon , and the banks holding those mortgage securities will stop seeing losses on them .
How Did We Get Here ?
And as to how this all happened , I ’ve not seen an explanation from the asshats on Wall Street and the SEC and the Fed .
They just want our money .
However , the Good Math , Bad Math guy has a series of articles that sum it up pretty well :
Economic Disasters and Stupid Evil People
How “ safe ” was a lie
How it turned into a trillion dollar disaster
So that ’s how we got here .
Right now as I write this Congress is arguing about what in the hell to do about it .
And for you partisans , just put a sock in it .
Plenty of blame to go around for the deregulation to allow this …
a Republican Congress got it signed by a Democratic President .
The Freakonomics guys have blogged a bit about this , too .
A guest blogger justifies the bailout of Bear Stearns and AIG .
I guess I do n’t have a huge problem with those .
At least they let Lehman Brothers fail appropriately .
A response came saying Paulson is wrong about this … essentially it means that the profits are private ( them Wall Street types were rolling in it the past decade ) , but when it comes time for the losses , somehow that gets socialized .
Or Else …
What ?
I ’m a bit more concerned about this $ 700 billion dollar war chest they ’re asking for .
To my understanding , this is the issue :
– Credit is the lifeblood of the financial system .
– The system is chock full of bad mortgage - backed securities ( see the Good Math Bad Math links above on this ) .
– Banks wo n’t lend to each other because they KNOW they all have bad debt and do n’t believe they ’ll get paid if they do give credit .
– FAIL
This is all very esoteric from my perspective .
I ’ve got car repair bills ( my wife crashed her car ) .
I ’ve got a mortgage to pay ( fixed rate , dammit ! ) , and mouths to feed .
I need to pay for gas , and food , and my health care costs just DOUBLED .
I do n’t give a flying fuck if UBS ca n’t get a loan from Citibank .
I want someone to tell me …
WHY DO I CARE ?
Why ca n’t we just wait for the dust to settle ?
Okay , for a while the credit market will dry up , many investors will be screwed over as stock drops … but then , after a while , the bad debt will be excised from the books , and we ’re all good again , right ?
It apparently would be pretty dire … but what would such a situation actually look like on the ground if we just allow the failing institutions to fail ?
Is n’t that supposed to be how the free market works ?
If a bunch of idiots bet a bunch of money on stupid investments , they should LOSE THEIR MONEY , not take MINE .
So anyway , all of these articles say that the credit market has to stay liquid , OR ELSE .
Well , can someone please explain the “ or else ” part ?
If not , then let ’s please just let them die .
P.S .
Also , if anyone henceforth explains to me that they are an investment banker , derivatives broker , or Wall Street executive , I am going to put my foot so far up their ass that my t oes are going to come out of their face .
Then I ’m going to drive off in their Mercedes .
Not that I did n’t hate this type of weasel before … but now there ’s no jury in the country that would convict me for doing bodily harm !
P.P.S .
The above section is hyperbole , and is no way intended to actually constitute a threat , no matter how expensive the asshat ’s suit .
P.P.P.S .
My letter to Congress
By Ben Cohen
Professor Noam Chomsky has influenced my thinking more than any single person on earth .
His speeches , interviews , articles , and books have profoundly changed the way I see the world , and I feel forever indebted to him for his contributions to human knowledge .
The MIT linguistic professor is regarded as the world 's leading intellectual for good reason .
His encyclopedic knowledge of political , philosophical and economic issues is simply breathtaking , and his ability to break complex subjects down to their rawest essentials is form of high art .
Although regarded as an intellectual , Chomsky is highly suspicious of the term , a symptom of his deep hostility to concentrated power and elitism .
Chomsky has spent a life time standing up to power , confronting conventional wisdom with moral force and penetrating intelligence .
He uses his position of privilege to speak for those less fortunate than him , and has routinely spoken out against the actions of his own government when it was not popular or even dangerous to do so .

Chomsky has made such huge contributions to progressive thought that it is unlikely it would be anywhere without him .
His analysis of the modern corporate state system and mass media has provided a template for younger generations to fight more effectively against it , and a legion of followers have followed in his footsteps to take up the cause .
For many , Noam Chomsky is the symbol of resistance , an inspiration to millions without power or influence and a glimpse at what real intellectualism should be about .
The Daily Banter spoke with Professor Chomsky about an array of topics , from the bailout and the presidential elections to the legacy of George Bush .
The interview will be divided into two parts , the first concentrating on the economy and the current financial crisis .
TDB : What are your thoughts on the current economic crisis and the bail out bill that passed in the Senate ?
NC : The crisis is real , it ’s not manufactured .
Exactly how serious it is , one does n’t know .
Some of the most credible specialists like Nuriel Rabbini who have a very good record of accurate prediction think it ’s an extremely serious crisis and that the system might just freeze up .
There is also a good deal of controversy about whether the current proposal will do more than put a band aid on a serious problem .
Now there are alternatives , constructive alternatives .
And they are being proposed , I mean , you can find them in the literature , but they are not on the agenda .
It ’s interesting , I mean the public is strongly opposed to the bailout , you can see that in the behavior of Congress , the House of Representatives where the Representatives come up for election in November voted it down , despite the enormous pressure .
The Senate , which is kind of a millionaires club , where only a third of them come up for election , they passed it overwhelmingly .
So the House did respond to a populist revolt .
Superficially that looks like a sign of a functioning democracy , but that ’s only superficial .
I mean even a dictatorship , when the public is rioting , the government will respond .
In this case , the public ’s reaction was resorting to shouting ‘ No ’ .
In a democracy , in a functioning democracy , what would be happening is that popular organizations , unions , political groupings , others would be developing their programs , putting them forth , insisting that their representatives implement those programs .
And there are possible programs that might make a difference , but none of this is happening .
And the reason this is n’t happening is because there is no functioning democracy .
The role of the public is restricted to shouting ‘ No ’ .
The bill passed in the House because the alternative was quite dire , but it does n’t mean it was a good proposal , or by any means the best proposal .
I mean there are serious problems , and they have deep roots .
The immediate problems were caused by the housing bubble that Alan Greenspan had permitted to explode .
They could have controlled it on the basis of the kind of lunatic belief in free market fundamentalism .
So they allowed this bubble to explode and the houses were way beyond their trend line , the actual realistic price .
They ’ve been collapsing , but they ’ve got a long way to go .
The Bush economy , which was like the Reagan economy , is very fragile , and is based on debt – lenders from abroad , and also consumer spending which is debt driven .
Consumer spending was largely based on inflated house prices , essentially collateral , and as the house prices collapse , so does the basis for consumer spending , then the economy collapses because its not a well functioning real economy .
All this goes back more deeply to the financial liberalization back in the 1970s .
Now financial liberalization is just a catastrophe waiting to happen , and there are very well understood reasons for that .
Markets have built in inefficiencies , serious inefficiencies which are well known .
One of them is that transactions in a market do not take into account what are called ‘ externalities ’ , so if you and I make some sort of a deal , say you sell me a car , we may make an arrangement that is good for us , but we do n’t take into account the costs for others .
And there are costs , traffic jams , pollution , the price of gas , and so on .
They may seem small , but they ’re not .
They add up and they can be quite large .
In the case of financial institutions , they are very large .
A financial institution has the task of taking risks , and if it ’s a well run institution , say Goldman Sachs , it tries to cover the potential losses to itself , but only to itself .
It does not take into account what is called systemic risk , the effects of its failure on the whole system .
So that means risk taking is what ’s called ‘ under priced ’ – you are not really taking into account the risks , the real risks when you look after only yourself , and that means there is a lot more risk taking than an efficient system would permit .
And that ’s bound to lead to crisis , and it has ever since financial liberalization was initiated back in the 70’s .
There has been an increase in both the regularity and the scale of financial crises , and now a major one has hit and come home .
So it was predicted and predictable , and it ’s now serious .
TDB : Does the nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac and the enormous bailout on Wall Street represent an end to Laissez Faire capitalism ?
NC : It ’s not an end to Laissez Faire capitalism because it never existed !
The nationalization is very dramatic right now , its all over the front pages , but the fundamental principle that the public takes the risks and pays the costs while profit is privatized , that principle which we are seeing dramatically right now , that ’s a basic principle for the whole economy .
I mean , the whole advanced economy is based on that principle .
The state sector of the economy , which is dynamic and the source of much of the innovation and development that underlies the advanced economy , that is the system in which the public pays the cost and takes the risks , and profits are ultimately privatized .
Take say , computers and the internet .
They were pretty much in the state system for decades before they were handed over to a private enterprise to make profit from , and virtually everything you look at in the advanced economy and the cutting edge economy works like that .
I mean there is now talk in the press , commentators talk about the socialization of risk and cost and privatization of profit , but they are talking about it as if it is something new , and a blow to laissez faire capitalism .
It ’s not new .
That ’s the way the system works , and has worked for centuries .
TDB : What did you think of Ron Paul and his brand of old style Repblican libertarianism ?
Was his philosophy based on mythology ?
NC : It ’s based on a myth if it assumes there was ever a free enterprise , or market economy that did not have critical state intervention .
I mean there are societies that have real market economies .
That ’s what we call the Third World .
They have it rammed down their throats by force .
That ’s part of the reason why they are the Third World .
But the rich developed countries were always based on substantial intervention .
I mean the mythology that is circulating now is mind boggling .
I mean there is talk about Ronald Reagan the icon of free market capitalism , where on the congressmen said that ‘ this bailout is putting a coffin on Reagan ’s coffin ” .
Reagan was the most protectionist president in post war American history !
He doubled protectionist barriers .
He called on the Pentagon to initiate programs to teach backwards American managers modern Japanese style production techniques .
He carried out one of the largest bailouts in American history , Continental Illinois .
He may not have even known what the programs were , but his administration was a strong believer in large scale state intervention

On Wednesday , John McCain told Fox News ' Sean Hannity that his VP pick Sarah Palin is " probably one of the foremost experts in this nation on energy issues , " and reaffirmed his desire to put her in charge of energy policy in his administration .
But on Thursday , Palin once again mangled the facts about energy issues , wrongly asserting to a crowd in Wisconsin that there 's some sort of congressional ban on oil exports .
A crowd member told her he had heard that 75 percent of Alaska 's oil is being sold to China , and if that 's true , he wanted to know why .
" No .
It 's not 75 percent of our oil being exported , " Palin said , suggesting that some of Alaska 's oil is going abroad , but not that much , according to the Associated Press .
" In fact , Congress is pretty strict on , um , export bans of oil and gas especially , " she continued .
The AP reporter fact - checked the assertion :
No Alaska oil has been exported since 2004 , and little if any since 2000 , according to the Energy Information Administration and the Congressional Research Service .
And Congress has never imposed outright bans on oil exports .
Congress prohibited exports of Alaska oil in 1973 when the Alaska oil pipeline was built .
But that ban was lifted in 1996 when there were large volumes of Alaska oil coming down from the North Slope and U.S. demand was soft .
The Alaska ban has never been reinstated .
Though natural gas exports must be approved by the Energy Department , there is n't the same stipulation for oil .
According to the Energy Information Administration , more than 95 million barrels of Alaskan oil -- or about 2.7 percent of the total produced in Alaska -- were exported between 1996 and 2004 , the majority of it to South Korea , Japan , China and Taiwan .
The EIA states that there have been no Alaskan oil exports since 2004 , but that 's not because of any congressional restriction on exports .
This is n't the first time that Palin has misstated the facts about Alaska and energy supplies .
Last month , she claimed that Alaska provides " 20 percent " of the nation 's energy .
In fact , it provides just 3.5 percent , and several fact - checking sites have since thoroughly debunked her claim .
And the natural - gas pipeline she keeps touting as evidence of her success in energy policy ?
It only exists on paper , and the necessary federal approval is still years away .
" In the note he said he hated mankind and the human race .
And that he had been planning this since 2002 , " Mr Neulaniemi said .
The note went on to say " the solution is Walther 22 " , a reference to the gunman 's Walther .22 calibre handgun , ABC reported .
The Independent reported that Saari lived alone with his cat and police were having trouble getting in contact with his relatives .
But former classmate Susanna Keronen said Saari bore no resemblance to the loner profile of many mass murderers .
" He was happy , a social guy - there was nothing exceptional - he got along with people well and he was not lonely .
He had friends [ and was easy to talk to ] , " she said .
In his profile on social networking site IRCgallery , Saari billed himself as a committed misanthrope and touted war and revenge .
He spent his last hours on the internet , having logged on to IRCgallery on Tuesday morning before leaving for school and opening fire on his classmates .
Saari , an atheist , said on MySpace.com , that he was interested in meeting friends and networking .
But on other sites , he mulled the final solution to the problems of mankind and aired darker thoughts .
On his YouTube profile , Saari listed death metal and electronic bands among his favourite music , and quoted lyrics from a song called War , by the group Wumpscut : " Whole life is war and and whole life is pain and you will fight alone in your personal war . "
He also listed horror as his favourite movie genre and said his hobbies were computers , guns , sex and beers .
Saari also mentioned his gun on a dating site , and wrote that he was looking for a woman but did not want children .
Saari did not have a previous criminal record , The Guardian reported .

The latest good luck for the Democrats is that the McCain campaign was just as bamboozled as the press by the false Hillary narrative .
McCain was obviously itching to choose his pal Joe Lieberman as his running mate .
A onetime Democrat who breaks with the G.O.P. by supporting abortion rights might have rebooted his lost maverick cred more forcefully than Palin , who is cracking this particular glass ceiling nearly a quarter - century after the Democrats got there first .
Lieberman might have even been of some use in roiling the Obama - Hillary - Bill juggernaut that will now storm through South Florida .
The main reason McCain knuckled under to the religious right by picking Palin is that he actually believes there ’s a large army of embittered Hillary loyalists who will vote for a hard - line conservative simply because she ’s a woman .
That ’s what happens when you listen to the TV news echo chamber .
Not only is the whole premise ludicrous , but it is every bit as sexist as the crude joke McCain notoriously told about Janet Reno , Hillary and Chelsea Clinton .
Given the press ’s track record so far , there ’s no reason to believe that the bogus scenarios will stop now .
The question of why this keeps happening is not easily answered .
Ideological bias , unshakeable Clinton addiction and lingering McCain affection may not account for all or even most of it .
Journalists are still Americans  even if much of our audience doubts that  and in this time of grave uncertainty about our nation ’s future we may simply be as discombobulated as everyone else .

We , too , are made anxious and fearful by hard economic times and the prospect of wrenching change .
YouTube , the medium that has transformed our culture and politics , did n’t exist four years ago .
Four years from now , it ’s entirely possible that some , even many , of the newspapers and magazines covering this campaign wo n’t exist in their current form , if they exist at all .
The Big Three network evening newscasts , and network news divisions as we now know them , may also be extinct by then .
It is a telling sign that CBS News did n’t invest in the usual sky box for its anchor , Katie Couric , in Denver .
It is equally telling that CNN consistently beat ABC and CBS in last week ’s Nielsen ratings , and NBC as well by week ’s end .
But now that media are being transformed at a speed comparable to the ever - doubling power of microchips , cable ’s ascendancy could also be as short - lived as , say , the reign of AOL .
Andrew Rasiej , the founder of Personal Democracy Forum , which monitors the intersection of politics and technology , points out that when networks judge their success by who got the biggest share of the television audience , “ they are still counting horses while the world has moved on to counting locomotives . ”
The Web , in its infinite iterations , is eroding all 20th - century media .
The Obama campaign has long been on board those digital locomotives .
Its ability to tell its story under the radar of the mainstream press in part accounts for why the Obama surge has been so often underestimated .
Even now we ’re uncertain of its size .
The extraordinary TV viewership for Obama on Thursday night , larger than the Olympics opening ceremony , this year ’s Oscars or any “ American Idol ” finale , may only be a count of the horses .
The Obama campaign ’s full reach online  for viewers as well as fund - raising and organizational networking  remains unknown .
Hubble scientists have captured beautiful images of celestial birth in a region 170,000 light - years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud .
The pictures , taken in honor of the space telescope 's 100,000th orbit , show one of the most active star - forming regions in the galaxies near the Milky Way .
The high - energy activity of the 100 - light - year - wide region near Tarantula nebula could have been triggered by a supernova .
Located near the star cluster NGC 2074 , the image was colorized with red showing sulphur atom emissions , green denoting glowing hydrogen , and blue representing glowing oxygen .
What the scientists describe as the " seahorse - shaped pillar " at the lower right is approximately 20 light - years long , or four times the distance between the sun and its nearest neighbor , Alpha Centauri .
The new photos recall the iconic 1995 images of stars coming into being at the " fingertips " of large gas columns .
Those pictures made the cover of Time Magazine and cemented the Hubble 's reputation as the defining telescope of the era .

Full Text of Ron Pauls speech to the House of Representatives today :
“ Madam Speaker , I rise in strong opposition to this bill , because it wo n’t solve our problem .
It is said that we ’re in a liquidity crisis and a credit crunch , and all we need is more credit .
The Federal Reserve has already injected over a trillion dollars worth of credit , and it has n’t seemed to help a whole lot .
Injecting another 600 or 700 billion dollars will not solve the problem .
I think one of the reasons why we ’re floundering around here is that we do n’t understand the problem , because instead of it being a credit crunch I think a lot more serious than that and that is , I think what ’s happening in the market today is signaling something much more draconian .
Because it ’s probably telling us that our government is insolvent , that we ’re on the verge of bankruptcy , and big things are starting to happen , and we do n’t quite understand it , so we fall back on the old cliches :
What we need is more appropriations , more spending , more debt , and more credit in the market , that means more inflation by the Federal Reserve system .
And yet that is what caused the trouble .
We want to do this , it is said , to prevent the recession or depression , because that is “ unbearable ” .
But the truth is , you should have thought of that about 10 or 15 years ago , because the financial bubble created by the excess of credit and the lowering of the interest rates is the cause of the recession .
The recession is a demand .
It ’s a must .
You ca n’t avoid it .
Yes , it ’s been papered over several times over these last several decades , but that just made the bubble bigger .
But the message now is you ca n’t paper it over any longer , so the recession and / or the depression will come .
My sincere conviction is that by doing more mischief and not allowing markets to adjust , debt to be liquidated , you ’re going to guarantee a depression .
It ’s going to be prolonged , the agony is going to be there a lot longer than if you allow markets to adjust .
Liquidation of debt , let the bankruptcy occur , let the good assets come up , and let it react .
This idea that there ’s just not enough regulation is completely wrong .
There ’s too much regulation and lack of regulation of the Federal Reserve system and the Exchange and Stabilization Fund . ”
Besides ripping into trees for termites , this dinosaur likely ran through the forests on its two slender legs .
Even in the dinosaur world , the small and dainty existed , in the form of a mini- dino that likely did n't terrorize any creatures other than termites .
The newly described dinosaur , called Albertonykus borealis , was about the size of a chicken and is now considered the smallest dinosaur to have existed in North America .
" These are bizarre animals .
They have long and slender legs , stumpy arms with huge claws and tweezer - like jaws , " said researcher Nick Longrich , a paleontologist at the University of Calgary in Canada .
The dinosaur belongs to the Alvarezsauridae family , which includes Alvarezsaurus calvoi , a bird - like dinosaur that likely snagged insects for food , and Mononykus olecranus , another lightweight that was equipped with a pair of stubby claws whose function is not known for sure .
Like its relatives , A. borealis had long slender hindlegs , which probably made the dinosaur an agile runner .
Stout front legs and hands that each sported a massive claw would have easily torn into logs to snag termites .
" Proportionately , the forelimbs are shorter than in a Tyrannosaurus but they are powerfully built , so they seem to have served a purpose , " Longrich said .
" They are built for digging but too short to burrow , so we think they may have been used to rip open logs in search of insects . "
In fact , the researchers also found evidence for termite borings in fossilized wood discovered in the same area where the mini-dino fossils showed up , also supporting the idea that this dinosaur was a termite eater .
The 70 million - year - old bones of A. borealis were discovered at Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park in Alberta in 2002 by a team led by Philip Currie of the University of Alberta .
The bones were stored at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta .
It was n't until recently that Longrich came upon them .
" You can really find amazing things if you just keep looking at fossils we already have sitting in museum collections , " Longrich said .
" The number of dinosaur discoveries is actually accelerating because we just keep digging up more material to work with . "
The research , detailed in the August issue of the journal Cretaceous Research , was supported by the National Science Foundation , an Alberta Ingenuity Graduate Studentship , the University of Calgary and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council .
Recyclable trash being illegally dumped reveals TV channel
LONDON : Garbage dumping is a trans - continental affair for Britain .
Recyclable waste collected from British homes is illegally dumped on farmlands in Tamil Nadu because it is cheaper to send the rubbish to India than to recycle it properly in the UK .
The waste is dumped in farmland wells and local residents claim it has been going on for the last four years if not longer .
Waste from the UK and the US is allegedly being buried in around 10 illegal dumping sites in the state .
An investigation by ITV television channel ’s flagship news programme Tonight has revealed that a tonne of waste that would cost £ 148 to recycle in the UK is instead shipped to India on the waste black market for dumping for a mere £ 40 a tonne .
Tonight ’s reporter Mark Jordan travelled to Tamil Nadu where along with a local environment body he dug just four feet of one well site to reveal a hidden mountain of British waste including Walkers crisp bags , Sainsbury ’s apple juice , children ’s report cards and copies of British newspapers from as recent as this January .
It is estimated that this particular well could be up to 30 feet deep .
Nity Jayaraman , an international waste investigator for the past 10 years , who brought the Tonight team to the Indian tips , said : “ Nearby is a paper company , it ’s supposed to be importing paper waste and recycling it .
And this company gets this waste , takes a little bit of paper from it and the rest of it is pure trash — pure unrecyclable , unusable trash which is just dumped in places like this . ”
According to Indian law , this kind of trash is considered hazardous waste .
“ You ’re shipping out your garbage , you ’re shipping out your responsibility .
And it violates every law , right from the time that it entered India , it ’s been violating laws because this is import of hazardous waste and the hazardous waste has come in illegally , ” Jayaraman told Tonight .
All UK councils are required to recycle .
But after householders separate their rubbish and bin workers collect it , councils pass it on to waste firms , who in turn use subcontractors .
They are under no obligation to reveal what they actually do with it .
Britain exports between 12 million and 14 million tonnes of waste a year to be recycled in third world countries .
The majority of these exports are legal and above board .
However , it is illegal to do so unless the waste has been properly divided into paper , metals , plastics and glass before it leaves the country .
The Environment Agency , which has charged nine companies in recent years for sending unsorted waste abroad , told Tonight : “ We do n’t believe containers of mixed waste are going out now .
Having said that there is no room for complacency , if we want to recycle more then we are really dependent on these international markets and it ’s incumbent on all of us to make sure that what we are throwing away and then what is subsequently exported is of the right standard and is wanted by the receiving countries , otherwise basically we set back UK recycling many , many decades . ” .
" If you notice , since Britney started wearing clothes and behaving ; Paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore , thank God , and evidently , Lindsay Lohan has gone gay , we do n't seem to have much of an issue . "
Is this 1953 ?
Why is my head suddenly filled with images of Dudley Smith once again running things in L.A. ?
Of course , he 's not and all I 've got is real life LAPD Chief William Bratton running his mouth .
Recently a measure was introduced by the City Council to put tighter reins on the paparazzi .
But the proposal is an " unnecessary farce " according to Bratton .
Why ?
Well , you see , there 'd be no trouble with the paparazzi if the famous womenfolk of Los Angeles " started wearing clothes and behaving . "
Umm … okay .
In an interview yesterday with NBC Bratton said : See ?
It 's all the women 's fault .
It 's not like male celebrities ever get drunk and crash their cars and injure two people and end up on the surgeon 's table being sewn back together .
Hell , that type of thing did n't even happen just this week .
No , men , in Bratton 's view apparently , do n't misbehave .
I guess that 's just boys being boys .
That 's different .
And really , the paparazzi are n't vultures either .
Like moths to a flame , they 're merely lured to celebs by the siren song that is their bad behavior .
You know how it is , they just can't help themselves .
If only women would just stop dressing provocatively and going outside and visiting restaurants and such , the paparazzi would surely just leave them alone .
Right ?
Right .
( By the way , what the hell does " evidently Lindsay Lohan has gone gay " even mean ?
I 'm trying to wrap my head around the connection between " going gay " ( as if there 's such a thing to begin with ) and " behaving . "
I 'm also trying to wrap me head around the news that Lohan has " gone gay . "
Did she come out as a lesbian recently ?
Oh , nevermind .
I 'm sure I do n't care . )

Navigant Consulting Inc ( NCI ) recently prepared a report called North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment on behalf of a natural gas organization called the American Clean Skies Foundation .
In this report , NCI estimates the amounts shale gas and tight gas production can be increased in the next decade .
These estimates suggest that US natural gas production can be ramped up by nearly 50 % by 2020 .
How reasonable are these estimates ?
What obstacles are there to such a big ramp up ?
My analysis indicates that NCI is correct in some respects .
There is indeed a great deal of unconventional natural gas resources in the United States , and recent improvements in technology point to the possibility of significantly greater production .
There are two major problems , however .
One is that short - term demand is not very flexible .
It is very easy to flood the market with more natural gas than the market can absorb .
The other is that there are a number of obstacles ahead for companies selling natural gas .
It is likely that these obstacles , rather than a lack of natural gas , will curtail the rise in natural gas production .
As a result , the full ramp up in production is not very likely .
Recent EIA Data for Natural Gas
Let 's start by looking at EIA natural gas data .
EIA has recently reported a big increase in US natural gas production ( 8.8 % , comparing the first five months of 2008 with the first five months of 2007 ) .
Some have suggested that the EIA numbers must be wrong .
It seems to me that what we may be seeing is the effect of a recent technological breakthrough .
Until fairly recently , many of us had noticed a pattern of increased drilling being required to achieve the same quantity of natural gas production .
Most of us interpreted this to reflect declining Energy Return on Energy Invested ( EROEI ) .
In the last few months , there has been a sudden shift in the data .
EIA data shows that recent production is rising at the same time that the drilling of new wells is leveling off .
Average daily dry gas production during the first five months of 2008 is up 8.1 % over the same period in 2007 .
( Because 2008 is a leap year , total dry gas production has increased 8.8 % for the five month period . )
Figure 2 . US dry gas production has been rising since about November 2007
Figure 3 . Number of natural gas wells drilled levels out , about the same time production begins to rise ( November 2007 )
Figure 4 . Number of natural gas drilling rigs levels out in late 2007
One can look at many other measures as well , and see a similar pattern .
The number of well feet drilled per day levels off and even drops , in late 2007 and early 2008 , at the same time natural gas production increases .
My interpretation of what is happening is that there has been a technological breakthrough , probably in the area of shale gas production of natural gas .
Because of this breakthrough , companies are able to produce more gas , with less drilling effort .
There are several reasons I believe that the data reflects a technological breakthrough , rather than , say , an error in EIA data .
First , when I look at individual company reports , the ones that show drilling activity seem to show the same kind of pattern -- more success with fewer wells drilled .
Also , even where there is not information on the number of wells drilled , the company reports talk about increased productivity of wells , due to the increased use of horizontal drilling and better fracturing techniques .
Finally , the increased natural gas in the system is having the expected impact on storage and prices , as I will discuss later in this post .
EIA does not break out recent production into unconventional vs. conventional .
In fact , the most recent break out of unconventional is for 2006 , given in the backup data to Figure 80 of the Annual Energy Outlook :
Figure 5 . EIA History of Forecast of Natural Gas by Source
It is clear from looking at this figure that unconventional gas has been rising rapidly .
EIA 's forecast for the future looks unreasonably pessimistic alongside its production history .
The other two major categories ( onshore conventional and offshore conventional ) are both declining rapidly ( but miraculously are forecast to rise in the future ) .
The EIA graph in Figure 5 shows that there is the potential for an increase in gas production from Alaska , once a pipeline is built .
The EIA forecasts that this will happen in 2020 .
The amount of the increase appears to be about 10 % of current US natural gas production .
If this in fact takes place , on my Figure 1 , there will be a small bump up in production in 2020 , bringing the 2020 production total from 29 trillion cubic feet to 31 trillion cubic feet .
If there is an increase in overall natural gas production , one might reasonably assume that the increase in unconventional natural gas is finally overpowering the decline in conventional production .
EIA data by state and information from company financial reports both point to success with shale gas , particularly Barnett shale in Texas .
If the recent increase in production in fact relates to shale gas , this would tend to tie what is happening now to what the Navicgant Consulting , Inc. ( NCI ) analysis is forecasting for the years ahead .
Navigant Estimates
NCI in its report does not make an estimate of total US natural gas production .
Instead , it makes estimates of shale gas and tight gas production , in very general terms .
In Figure 1 , I put these estimates together with some rough estimates of the remaining pieces to get an estimate of expected future natural gas production .
( I used a 3 % annual decline rate for conventional natural gas . )
NCI 's forecast of shale gas production is in terms of how much sustainable production might be expected from the various shale formations :
Figure 6 . Navigant Consulting Inc ( NCI ) forecast of future shale gas production
The timing is not given very precisely , just " next decade " .
In Figure 1 , I assume that this higher level of production will not be reached until 2020 .
Because of the imprecision of the wording , a person could argue that production might reach this higher level as early as 2015 .
With my interpretation of the NCI report , indications are that shale gas is now the big source of growth , and will continue to be in the future .
Tight gas production will also continue to grow .
Figure 7 .
Breakdown of Figure 1 forecast of unconventional gas into tight gas , shale gas , and coal bed methane
Previous unconventional gas posts
Many readers will remember that I have written previously about unconventional natural gas :
US Natural Gas : Lessons from BP's Tight Gas Facility in Wamsutter WY
In these posts , I talk about how widespread shale gas and tight gas are .
I also talk about the advances BP has been making in its Wamsutter , Wyoming tight gas facility .
With this as a background , it is easy for me to believe that if all of the resources are there , there is a reasonable possibility that US unconventional production can be ramped up further .
I think there are obstacles that may get in the way of this , however .
Short term problem : overwhelming the system with too much gas , and causing price to drop
What happens when one increases natural gas production by 8 % per day ?
There are a few places this can go -- a little to offset a decline in imports from Canada , a little to use as exports to Canada and Mexico , and a little to meet the growing demand of electric utilities .
Liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) imports can be reduced to their contractual minimum .
On the industrial side , some factories with spare capacity can use some additional natural gas .
It is difficult for these uses to absorb the 8 % growth in production , however .
How could you individually increase your own natural gas use ?
You could turn up the thermostat to heat your house more in the winter , or you could use more electric appliances if you have electricity from natural gas .
There really is n't much else you could do , without purchasing something new ( for example , a clothes dryer that runs on natural gas , or a car that runs on natural gas ) .
It is not a whole lot different for business users of natural gas .
Once demand is satisfied , the remainder is added to natural gas underground storage .
This past week , 102 billion cubic feet were added to storage ; the week before 88 billion cubic feet were added to storage .
The US is currently producing about 56 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day , so over the past two weeks we have put about 20 % of production into storage .
Figure 8 . Recent EIA Natural Gas Underground Storage Graphic
The problem is that natural gas underground storage is not terribly large , and it has n't been increased recently in size to accommodate the new larger natural gas production .
Historical data suggests that the practical limit of working storage is 3,600 billion cubic feet .
This is a bit over two months ' production .
As of August 22 , 2008 , the amount of natural gas in working storage was 2,757 billion cubic feet , leaving only 843 ( = 3,600 - 2,757 ) billion cubic feet of " space " available .
Once storage fills up , there is no other place for the natural gas to go .
To make matters worse , it is very difficult for producers to shut production in , if there is no space available for storage , so producers will mostly continue to produce , whether or not there is space available .
Once traders realize that there is a significant chance that natural gas production will exceed storage space , prices start to drop .
It seems to me that this is part of what has happened with natural gas prices recently .
One consideration in deciding whether the supply will exceed the storage space is the long range weather forecast .
The forecast is for a warm fall , meaning that little heat will be needed .
We are also in the midst of an economic slowdown , and this is also likely to reduce natural gas use .
All of this makes for a bad situation for natural gas producers -- lots of supply , but not enough demand , and prices dropping disproportionately to the prices of other fuels .
In another post in the next few days , I will talk various approaches that have been proposed to increase demand , so as prevent this problem .
I will also talk about the quantity of gas that might be available .
Other obstacles to growth
It seems to me that the main issue is not whether there is enough natural gas in the ground .
It is whether we will be able to get it out and transport it to users .
It seems likely to me that one or more of the following will reduce growth to significantly below what theoretical studies would suggest :
Not enough distribution pipeline and underground storage
Every company adding new production will realize that it needs pipeline to connect its gas to an appropriate processing center .
It may not be as obvious that the distribution system as a whole is likely to need to be expanded , if significantly more natural gas is produced .
For example , if natural gas is to be used to replace heating oil in the Northeast , it is likely that both more underground storage and more distribution pipeline will be needed .
( See this post by Heading Out . )
Expanding the distribution system is likely to be expensive and take several years .
Worn out pipelines
Matt Simmons has repeatedly stated that pipeline infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life .
If this is true for natural gas , this could be a problem .
Not enough of the right kind of drilling rigs
If everyone wants new horizontal drilling rigs , this will be a bottleneck to growth , until enough new rigs of the correct type can be built .
Not enough pipe
There have been articles in the press about steel for drilling pipe and casing being in short supply .
Not enough trained manpower
This is a problem in any industry that tries to ramp up quickly .
Reduced credit availability
Banks have cut back on their lending .
Natural gas companies that have depended on a lot of leverage in the past will find this business model very difficult to maintain .
I expect them to either slow down their rates of growth , or partner with an oil major who is in a better position financially .
Counter - party risk
Quite a few of the natural gas companies are major participants in the derivative markets .
We know that many banks are in financial difficulty .
If banks in financial difficulty are counter - parties on transactions , their defaults may cause financial problems for the natural gas companies .
Issues with water re-injection or disposal
Unconventional gas production requires re-fracturing of wells from time to time .
The fluid used in re-fracturing must be disposed of properly .
There was recently considerable opposition to shale gas drilling in New York because of water issues .
Declining profitability
This is closely tied to EROEI .
If there continue to be advances in technology , I would not expect this to be a problem .
Some of the sites may prove to be more difficult to extract than the NCI forecasts , and this could be a problem .
There is also the possibility of external impacts , such as higher taxes .

This Sarah Palin woman , gorgeous , lipstick besmirched , thingy ; whatever , suffers grossly from an over productive ambition gland , an organ every politician needs to even step to the stage , but in her case the organ is diseased .
Palin , a candidate in obvious denial of her own shortcomings , suffers not only the aforementioned glandular dysfunction , but a hugely distended right - wing malformation already in - place .
She , it seems , vulgar , and vapid internally , has become the ready patient of malicious , non-elected , campaign ' doctors ' ...' strategists ' .
She , as a vice - presidential possibility managed by these shadowy operators , is clearly not worthy of the operation .
I understand it is possible to swap some pig parts with humans , ears , maybe even a heart .
But not this one , a bigoted heart can not be changed .
And we , as humans , cannot fly on ambition alone .
The governor - patient , however , took to the planned restoration like a ' pig in a mud pie ' -- apparently there 's a lot of mud in Alaska - - she never blinked , ( what kind of organic disconnect is that ? ) .
Nor , in her case , can the damaged tissue be exchanged for a new healthy organ with improved potential , no matter the extent of hormonal treatment to stymie rejection .
She has installed herself , her heart , in a confined smelly place and her expressed mindset , George Wallace - like intentions , only add to the foul odor of racism , class hatred , and cultural divisiveness , and rots the tissue more .
No matter how she covers herself with cosmetics , no transplanted organ will ever give her wings , for now , she is stuck , ( Dems take note ) .
Palin -- and by way of the selection of her as his VP running mate , McCain - - has chosen to be mired in the filth of hatred .
With hate as her primary mantra she should never be allowed to represent our country .
Never .
By transplanting Sarah Palin into the campaign the RNC thought they would give lift to a stalled flight .
Wrong .
The ' flight - organ ' in this patient is decaying before their eyes .
Sarah Palin is forcing more die - hard Republicans to vote for Barack Obama than any tactic the DNC could have possibly conceived !
The recipient , in this metaphorical case , is also the organ .
Palin , who supposedly represents the values of the McCain campaign , also represents a large segment of our population .
Really ?
The McCain team 's selection process tied to RNC power players , providing the rationale for this dangerous operation , selecting this candidate as a ' attractive ' Vice Presidential insertion has become a travesty ... no , it began as a travesty .
There are two kinds of the ambition hormone need to achieve success in politics : the good kind , like in , ' country first , me last ' , and the second , evil kind : self - embodiment , self - serving , egomaniacal , 'me always right , you always wrong ' , kind .
Too much secretion of the latter here .
It 's obvious now , the organ chosen for transplant , is rotten , and the recipient is dying .
Good choice , John McCain and party buddies .
Sarah P. , not exactly the legacy you had in mind ?
Or , worse , much worse , maybe she is .
Our country has tripped and fallen on its face thanks to the mindless Bush / Cheney implementation of a faulty neocon master plan and the failure of a fear - ridden , weak - kneed , ' go - along - get - along ' , congress .
My fear here , however , is that the events we are experiencing now are the direct result of this secretive and conspiratorial - plagued administration , and is exactly what Cheney wanted .
This awful comedy of horrors happened in slow motion chunks , took eight years to fall , the ending was foreshadowed , and here it is , a full blown , catastrophe .
And it appears McCain / Palin aims to continue this patently wrong - headed approach .
Senator McCain , it appears , even in light of Bush 's error upon error administration , that you are aiming America ' right ' into the ugliest ' face - palm , tragic - comedy , clichéd , follow - up conceivable : Sarah Palin , is a twisted joke .
And you and your cronies are looking more like slapstick clowns falling into a pool of mud and slinging it around ?
She 's not even gorgeous anymore , instead here , a silk purse is shown to be a sow's ear .
Thank you very much .
" Trust me , my friends .
I know how to find terrorists , I know how to win wars , " you assured .
Trust you John McCain ?
After you constructed and dumped an ethical and moral train - wreck on us in Palin ?
You are hauling mud to a mudslide .
Sarah Palin is a naive VP candidate that is a lightweight by any standard .
As if the disaster of the past administration is not funny - sad enough for you , now you bring in an overload of misjudgment and hate - filled verbiage .
Trust you ?
Yeah , right .
The operation to transform the patient into some kind of flying wonder , failed .

Presenter , BBC Radio 4 Profile
Candidates McCain and Obama have both appeared alongside Stewart The US presidential election is a deadly serious business , as the party conventions amply illustrate .
Which might make it surprising that satire is playing a more and more influential role in the way the US media covers politics .
Jon Stewart , presenter of The Daily Show , produced by Comedy Central , attracts a key youthful audience and has all the top politicians as guests .
The show tackles political topics in a humorous way .
It makes fun of the way politicians contradict themselves , and also lampoons the mainstream news networks ' overblown style with its own team of anarchic correspondents .
Influence Jon Stewart , a former stand - up comedian , is the main presenter and lynchpin .
But as far as the audience is concerned , there seems to be more to the show than having a laugh .
" Is Jon Stewart the most trusted man in America ? " ran a recent New York Times headline , reporting survey evidence that suggests he is now seen in the same light as the more traditional news anchors like Tom Brokaw of NBC news .
NBC's Tom Brokaw acknowledges Stewart 's remarkable appeal Brokaw told me he especially admires Stewart 's appeal to younger viewers - those the politicians and mainstream media find hardest to reach .
" To Jon 's great credit , he has drawn the new generations into the political arena in a way they have not been for the last few election cycles , and the country is better off for it " .
Philip Bobbitt , a veteran political commentator and academic , became a fan after observing Stewart 's popularity amongst his students .
" I think he feels he has a constituency of young people to whom he feels a responsibility and he is trying to present issues in a satirical way but in a robust and affirmative way " .
Political awareness
So what lies behind Stewart 's appeal across the generations ?
He is now in his mid-forties .
But Larry Nicol , one of his schoolteachers in New York in the 1970s , recalls lessons with Stewart in the classroom as a kind of rehearsal for his later comic career .
" The class was basically like a bunch of guys sitting around on a Saturday night , having a beer and making funny wisecracks , " he said .
" To be a psychologist - which he majored in at university - and then switch to comedy , you have to have that veneer of political awareness , and he did have a passion to be funny . "
But such passions , as many a would - be performer knows , do not pay the bills .

After Stewart graduated , he worked as everything from puppeteer to Woolworths ' shelf - stacker while trying to become a comedian - encouraged , with some anxiety , by his mother Marian Leibowitz .
" He made a little deal with me that I would give him two years to try and explore what he wanted to do , " she says .
" So he took all kinds of weird jobs just to keep himself afloat until that point he announced he wanted to go to New York to be in comedy . "
Pulling power Stewart finally found his feet in stand - up comedy , and then moved into TV presenting via MTV in the late 1990s .
His humour is biting , especially when you do n't know what to expect .
This is a very smart , serious fellow
John Zogby , political pollster
As presenter , Stewart relishes the laughs he gets as politicians ' inconsistencies are mercilessly exposed by slick editing , and the main news anchors are parodied with hyped - up language .
But unlike other satirical shows , Stewart also secures top political players .
Bill Clinton has been on , as has Pervez Musharaff .
While he was Pakistani president , he held a surreal tea - time conversation with Stewart about the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden .
And Barack Obama and John McCain , desperate to appear cool to younger voters , have joined Jon Stewart for what they hope is an electorally beneficial laugh .
But these are not casual appearances where the candidates can relax and wander humorously off - message .
Stewart 's interviews are based on detailed research , and he can be forensic as well as funny , as John McCain discovered when confronted over US policy in Iraq .
John Zogby , top US pollster and adviser to many politicians , admits he has been " skewered " on Stewart 's show .
" His humour is biting , especially when you do n't know what to expect .
This is a very smart , serious fellow . "
Iconoclast Stewart likes to protest that such skewering is purely for comic effect .
And yet he has passionate views about what he sees as the failure of other kinds of news debate to shed light on political issues .
He famously confronted the hosts of CNN 's crossfire programme , accusing them of " partisan hackery " and " doing theatre when you should be doing debate " .
And what of Jon Stewart 's future ?
Some have assumed that satire will struggle in the post - Bush era .
But Stewart , the iconoclast in danger of becoming an institution , will prosper as long as the politicians , as well as TV advertisers , crave that appeal to youthful cool .
Some suggest he will be offered huge amounts to sign up as a presenter with one of the major US networks .
Jon Stewart as a mainstream broadcaster , avuncular informant of the American nation ?
" Are you insane ? " is a favourite catchphrase Stewart might use in response to such a suggestion .
But the journey from hard - up amateur comedian to millionaire media icon has , in its way , been insanely swift .
One way or another Stewart , a man very much in demand , is likely to have the last laugh .

What are these ?
For Barry McKernan and Saavik Ford , academics who live with their baby son in New York , sitting down to the television news is a nightly ritual , as it has been for generations of families .
But there the tradition ends .
Instead of watching heavyweight presenters dispense news from on high , the couple switch to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , known for delivering stories with lacerating humour and an inbuilt bullshit detector .
They know Stewart will part politicians from their reputations with laser - like precision , while simultaneously rubbing the media 's nose in its own deference .
And , more importantly , they trust him .
' The Daily Show is probably more reliable for news than anything on TV except PBS [ Public Broadcasting Service ] , ' said McKernan , 36 , who teaches astronomy at the Borough of Manhattan Community College .
' It stands apart from everything else because it unspins the news .
It frankly points out how ridiculous the 24 - hour news networks are - mostly gassing away by unqualified ' experts ' filling the hours . '
McKernan and Ford - young , liberal , politically engaged - are typical of a section of America that has grown sceptical of what they see as mainstream television 's bland , knee - jerk journalism .
For them only one man is asking the right questions , and that is a 45 - year - old comedian called Jon Stewart .
Like a court jester , he segues into truths that solemn courtiers cannot or dare not , announcing to the startled throng that the emperor has no clothes .
Ford , 30 , reflected : ' The mainstream news media appear to me to be too lazy to do their jobs as well as a comedian . '
The Daily Show is satire with substance , a spoof news programme in which Stewart mercilessly punctures the headlines and skewers the powerful with cleverly edited film clips , sharp one - liners and bemused expressions .
It features interviews - guests have included Victoria Beckham , Bill Clinton , Tom Cruise and Pervez Musharraf - and parodic news items from a team of roving reporters .
Ridiculous stories delivered with a straight face , in the style of the fake newspaper The Onion , are combined with the bracing iconoclasticism of Michael Moore minus earnestness or ego .
British viewers - who can catch it on the More4 channel four times a week or via the Comedy Central website - might be reminded of the Nineties news spoof The Day Today with Chris Morris and Steve Coogan , Angus Deayton 's irreverent hosting of Have I Got News for You and Armando Iannucci 's taste for the politically preposterous .
Add the rottweiler instincts of John Humphrys or Jeremy Paxman , and throw in some downright silliness , and you have something approaching The Daily Show .
Broadcast on cable channel Comedy Central , it has prospered in the Bush years with steadily growing viewing figures - still below 2 million but , like the New York Times ( circulation 1.1 million ) , punching above its weight with opinion formers .
Its bite - sized chunks of laugh - out - loud smartness are also perfectly geared for internet virals and the so - called ' YouTube generation ' .
A blogger called Matt Tobey may have only got slightly carried away last week when he wrote : ' I was n't alive to see Michelangelo paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
I was n't born yet when the Beatles toured .
And I probably wo n't ever get out to see that Japanese dude eat all them hotdogs .
But goddamn , seeing Jon Stewart at his absolute best running circles around cable news douchebags is almost as good . '
This year 's presidential election has marked Stewart 's coming of age as a cultural and political force in America .
Whereas his debut as Oscars host in 2006 saw some jokes fall flat , he returned this year in triumph with timely political gags .
Appearing on The Daily Show - described by Newsweek magazine as ' the coolest pit stop on television ' - is now a gamble that no would - be president can afford to duck if they want to parade their ' human side ' and ability to laugh at themselves .
John McCain , the Republican candidate , has been on more than a dozen times over the years .
Barack Obama , his Democratic rival , used The Daily Show for his last TV appearance before the primary election in Pennsylvania .
Hillary Clinton - ' the first viable presidential candidate with a working uterus ' - appeared on the eve of the crucial primaries in Texas and Ohio .
At the Democratic national convention , Daily Show reporters found it hard to work as they were mobbed by so many fans .
It is a delicious paradox that people 's search for truth has led them to fake news .
Under the headline ' Is Jon Stewart the Most Trusted Man in America ? ' , the New York Times opined recently : ' The Daily Show resonates not only because it is wickedly funny but also because its keen sense of the absurd is perfectly attuned to an era in which cognitive dissonance has become a national epidemic .
Indeed , Stewart 's frequent exclamation " Are you insane ? ! " seems a fitting refrain for a post - M* A * S*H , post - Catch - 22 reality , where the surreal and outrageous have become commonplace - an era kicked off by the 2000 election standoff in Florida , rocked by 9/11 and haunted by the fallout of a costly war waged on the premise of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . '
Showing politicians condemn themselves out of their own mouths is a classic Stewart manoeuvre .
In one sequence , The Daily Show spliced excerpts from McCain 's acceptance speech at the Republican convention with one by Bush before he became president .
The word - for - word similarities were uncanny , promising change in Washington , a pro-life culture and the rest .
It was a masterpiece of editing that required no narrative to tear down false idols , arguably more effective than anything the Democrats have thrown at McCain in recent weeks .
It makes Obama 's argument that McCain represents a third term of Bush more eloquently than the candidate himself has so far managed .
Stewart 's admirers in the political and media classes are legion .
David Remnick , editor of the New Yorker magazine , told The Observer : ' He is our most astute - and , obviously , most hilarious - press watchdog and overall political bullshit monitor .
His most effective move is to cull through the tapes of all the countless banalities , hypocritical contradictions and attempted snow - jobs executed in boundless profusion on our airwaves and on political podiums .
He just puts them on the air and you watch with slack - jawed amazement . '
Remnick added : ' Stewart is all the things the best stand - up comics are - quick , verbally deft - but he is also possessed of a political and moral sense .
There are days when I think he is the only one keeping a sane head . '
The Daily Show also satirises American media with its cliches , hang - ups and petty obsessions .
For those who accuse Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News of being a partisan Republican mouthpiece , there seemed to be no antidote until The Daily Show came along .
It also strikes a chord with those who feel the 24 - hour news channels hype every gaffe into a hurricane and despair of US newspapers as their circulations fall and they lay off staff .
The lack of aggression in challenging the official intelligence used to justify the Iraq war , and the timidity around revelations of John Edwards 's extramarital affair are just two examples of a perceived cancer eating into American journalism .
Step forward Stewart , filling the void not with new facts - he does not claim to be an investigative reporter - but forensic editing and satirical snap .
Iraq was quickly branded ' Mess O'Potamia ' .
While mainstream TV news endlessly repeated the Pentagon 's description of ' the coalition of the willing ' backing US forces , Stewart was quick to dub them the ' coalition of the piddling ' and point out that allies such as Morocco were sending not troops but 2,000 monkeys to set off landmines .
Other media were forced to play catch - up when the show highlighted the links between Halliburton , of which Vice - President Dick Cheney was chief executive , and government wartime contracts worth millions .
Gavin Esler , the BBC's Newsnight presenter and former chief North America correspondent , describes Stewart as ' hugely influential ' in the US .
' I think his success tells you a great deal about the dire state of some American network television journalism .
It is often parochial , sentimental and focused on a diet of crime stories , supposedly " human interest " stories and medical " breakthroughs " .
It is no coincidence that the biggest cheer Sarah Palin received in her Republican convention speech was when she attacked the mainstream media .
' Stewart is highly intelligent , perceptive and persistent as an interviewer but also funny .
He allows his guests to be human and is not sycophantic .
The best interviews I have seen this year with Obama , Hillary Clinton and McCain have all been by Stewart .
It 's hardly surprising they appear on his shows - they get to demonstrate their own sense of humour , which is very appealing to voters . '
Many on the right believe the show is too liberal , in a country where that can be something of a dirty word .
Stewart has admitted he is looking forward to the end of the Bush administration 'as a comedian , as a person , as a citizen , as a mammal ' .
But The Daily Show goes beyond party politics .
When political debate in the most powerful country on Earth boils down to the semantics of ' putting lipstick on a pig ' , its stiffest challenge is to keep fake news more absurd than the real thing .
Keep succeeding , and Jon Stewart might even swing the election .
The best way to have people obsessing about your birthday is to never tell anyone the exact date .
That 's what Google 's been doing ; we pretty much know that big G's 10th anniversary is in September , but the exact time is unknown .
And , while some have written about it almost a month ago , only now Google is officially " celebrating " its birthday by releasing a special tenth anniversary page , featuring an interactive timeline of the company 's history .
They 've also launched Project 10100 , described as " a call for ideas to change the world by helping as many people as possible . "
The project works as follows : you send Google your idea by October 20th ; it 's done by simply filling out a submission form , add a 30 - second video if you like .
Public voting on ideas begins on January 27th , 20 semi finalists will be chosen , and an advisory board will then select up to five final ideas .
Google will commit 10 million dollars to make these ideas work .
Check out the introductory video below :
West is just another place , not another way to live .
A man has to know what he wants .
The Statue of Liberty is dubbed as a symbol of freedom to the shackled , a symbol of hope to the deprived , a symbol of refuge to the homeless and beyond all , a glorious symbol of human spirit and its undying faith in a better tomorrow .
The planet today is at a delicate and vital turn where every move we make could make or break the future for the beautiful planet that we all call ‘ Home ’ .
This present and the consequential future largely depends on the way we treat our planet and how well we adapt to renewable and clean sources of energy by inviting the alternate power into our homes and lives .
It then seems only an obvious matter that the ‘ Statue of Liberty ’ should also spread the ‘ Green Light ’ with her eternal golden torch .
Why is the Statue of Liberty green ?
First of all – and less relevant to the environment , it has a very well known green tinge largely due to the copper of the statue reacting with the elements to produce the copper salts which give its green hue .
Now , it only seems appropriate that the visual green inclination is being backed up by some solid green intent .
If the ‘ First lady of Freedom ’ cannot break the shackles of conventional power and fossil fuel , then it would surely have been indeed a shame !
Secondly , it ’s because the Lady Liberty and her flaming light are now being lit up each night with wind power that is being bought by the government from a company that produces wind energy from its farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia .
Pepco Energy supplies all the energy that lights up the statue and while it looks strange that New York is not tapping into offshore wind energy that is available in plenty at such close quarters , it seems the wheels are in motion to ensure that the statue is indeed powered by green energy produced in New York .
The Statue of Liberty has always been a symbol to many of a bright future .
Perhaps now she can be a symbol to all of a bright green future .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gas prices rose for the fourth straight day as Hurricane Ike slammed the Texas Gulf Coast early Saturday morning .
According to a nationwide survey released by the motorist group AAA Saturday , the average price of regular unleaded gasoline edged up 5.8 cents to $ 3.73 a gallon , from $ 3.675 a day earlier .
AAA said the nearly 6 cent increase was the biggest one - day spike this year and the largest since shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005 .
The price of gas rose by 14 cents and 16 cents on consecutive days in the aftermath of Katrina .
The national price increase was driven by sharp spikes in the Southeast , primarily the Carolinas , Tennessee and Kentucky , states which lie at the end of several Gulf pipelines .
Generally , increases in other regions were fairly slight .
In Texas , where the storm made landfall early Saturday , the average price rose 5.4 cents to $ 3.60 a gallon .
In the two coastal areas affected most directly by the storm , Galveston and Houston , prices rose 3.6 cents and 4.8 cents to $ 3.525 and $ 3.544 respectively .
Analysts have expressed fears that gas prices could continue to rise in the next few days as as Hurricane Ike 's approach to the Texas Gulf Coast led to shutdown of oil drilling and refining in the region .
But the Department of Energy and other agencies will make sure consumers do n't get hurt by efforts to raise gas prices the wake of Hurricane Ike , President Bush said Saturday .
Shortages are predicted because of the large number of refineries shut down on the Gulf Coast ahead of the storm .
In a brief televised statement , Bush said the Environmental Protection Agency waivers on certain reformulated gasolines were suspended Friday night to make it easier for imports to get into U.S. markets .
In Texas , iReporters told CNN.com that they were facing long lines to buy gas .
Cheri Morgan said Friday that she waited for a half hour to fill up her car in Houston before evacuating to San Antonio .
" Everyone was driving crazy and they really need some kind of traffic flow at the gas stations .
It 's wild , " she said .
" Everybody 's rushing and panicking . "
And iReporter Kyle Norton said Friday he waited for an hour at a Sam's Club in College Station , Texas to get gas as people were filling up their cars and gas cans .
He added that a friend went to four gas stations before finding one that still had regular unleaded gasoline .
Speaking on Friday , AAA spokesman Dan Ronan , who is based in Irving near Dallas , said that Houston - based AAA staffers reported 20 cent increases at some gas stations , but they 're in the minority .
Likewise , he said the reports of stations running low on gas in coastal Texas are scattered and isolated .
" There have been anecdotal reports about service stations running low on fuel and that 's to be expected , " said Ronan .
" The good thing is that it seems as though the state and delivery systems have gotten a lot better since Katrina . "
Prices nationwide
Prices have been rising in the Midwest and Southeast as of late partly due to production delays caused by Hurricane Gustav .
Nationwide , Alaska and Hawaii remained the two states with gas prices still tracking above $ 4 a gallon ; Alaska at $ 4.365 and Hawaii at $ 4.321 , according to AAA .
The cheapest gas continues to be found in New Jersey , where prices averaged $ 3.424 a gallon .
Gas remains about 9.3 % , or 38.1 cents , below the record high average of $ 4.114 a gallon that AAA reported July 17 .
Prices are down 4.5 cents down in the past month , but up 93.2 cents from a year ago .
Tom Kloza from Oil Price Information Service , which provides the data for AAA , said Friday the nationwide average for gas prices could break the July 17 record as a result of the hurricane , but even if that happens , they would stabilize by October .
Oil prices rose Friday to $ 101.18 a barrel on concern about Ike after briefly dipping below $ 100 a barrel for the first time since April 2 .

For Israel , the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon war was all about questions .
What mistakes were made , and who made them ?
What could be done to restore the Israeli military 's " deterrence " after a widely perceived defeat ?
In general , what lessons could be learned from the confrontation with Hizbullah in order that next time , there would be no question of failure ?
Unfortunately , it seems that entirely the wrong kinds of conclusions are being reached , at least in the military hierarchy and among the policy shaping thinktanks .
On Friday , Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper published comments made by Israeli general Gadi Eisenkot , head of the army 's northern command .
Eisenkot took the opportunity to share the principles shaping plans for a future war .
The general promised " disproportionate " force to destroy entire villages identified as sources of Hizbullah rocket fire , the reasoning being that they are " not civilian villages " but rather " military bases " – the kind of reasoning that can land you in a war crimes tribunal .
Eisenkot pointed to how Israel levelled the Dahiya neighbourhood of Beirut in 2006 and confirmed that this would be the fate of " every village from which Israel is fired on " .
In case there was any doubt , he added : " This is not a recommendation .
This is a plan .
And it has been approved . "
The frank promise of " disproportionate " force will be chilling for the Lebanese , who even last time round were subjected to indiscriminate attack , the targeted destruction of civilian infrastructure , and carpet cluster - bombing .
But what Ha'aretz dubbed the " Dahiya Doctrine " received enthusiastic support in some quarters , such as veteran Israeli TV and print journalist Yaron London .
London seemed highly pleased with Eisenkot 's determination to " destroy Lebanon " , undeterred " by the protests of the ' world ' " .
London , while looking forward to Israel " pulverising " some " 160 Shi'ite villages " made the implications of Eisenkot 's thinking clear : " In practical terms , the Palestinians in Gaza are all Khaled Mashaal , the Lebanese are all Nasrallah , and the Iranians are all Ahmadinejad . "
The meaning of " practical terms " did not need repeating .
The Ha'aretz report also described how similar conclusions were being reached in reports by military - academic institutions .
One such paper , published by the Institute of National Security Studies ( INSS ) at Tel Aviv University , and unambiguously titled " Disproportionate Force " , details the author 's ( reserve Colonel Gabriel Siboni ) understanding of the lessons of 2006 :
With an outbreak of hostilities , the IDF will need to act immediately , decisively , and with force that is disproportionate to the enemy 's actions and the threat it poses .
Such a response aims at inflicting damage and meting out punishment to an extent that will demand long and expensive reconstruction processes .
Siboni urges the Israeli military to strike disproportionately at " the enemy 's weak points " , and only afterwards to go after the missile launchers themselves .
Devastating " economic interests " , " centres of civilian powers " , and " state infrastructure " will " create a lasting memory among Syrian and Lebanese decision makers " and thus increase " Israeli deterrence " and tie up " enemy " resources in reconstruction .
A further new INSS publication by a former head of the National Security Council , urges Israel to guarantee that next time around , the Lebanese army and civilian infrastructure " will be destroyed " .
Or as the author pithily puts it , " People wo n't be going to the beach in Beirut while Haifa residents are in shelters " .
This determination to " create a lasting memory " in the minds of the Syrian and Lebanese is reminiscent of previous Israeli declarations of intent .
In 2003 , the IDF 's chief of staff , Lieutenant General Moshe Ya'alon , said that the war being waged in the occupied territories would " sear deep into the consciousness of Palestinians that they are a defeated people " .
In 2006 in fact , the likes of Dr Reuven Erlich , head of the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre at the Centre for Special Studies in Tel Aviv , also recommended " searing " into the " Lebanese consciousness " the " steep price they will pay for provoking and harassing us " .
Using brute force to " sear " certain truths into the consciousness of Arabs of varying descriptions has a certain heritage in Israeli and Zionist thought , going all the way back to Jabotinsky 's theory of the " iron wall " .
In the 1920s he wrote candidly that " every indigenous people will resist alien settlers as long as they see any hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement " .
The need then was for an " iron wall " of force to bring the Palestinians to the point of giving up " all hope " .
While the brutal logic of settler - colonial domination has been a guiding principle for Israeli military strategists through the decades , it has been complemented by the racist " anthropological " cliche that the " Arabs only understand force " .
Interestingly , such tropes are now commonplace in US military discourse , as the Pentagon is also now in the position of directly occupying a Middle East country and facing resistance .
Thus it seems Israel is learning entirely the wrong lessons from the 2006 conflict .
Wrong , of course , from a moral point of view ( though that only seems to enter the picture in terms of an anticipated international backlash ) .
The conclusion could also be seen as flawed from the perspective of the kind of response it could invite .
Fundamentally though , these pledges of disproportionate devastation show that the Israeli military leadership suffers from tunnel - vision policymaking , wedded to the idea that Israel will gain acceptance in the Middle East through force of arms .
The last of the paper cups had scarcely been swept up after the Democratic convention when American liberals got the bad news .
While they had been celebrating Barack Obama 's steamroller ride to the Democratic nomination their candidate 's lead over his Republican rival had evaporated , leaving John McCain five points ahead in Reuters / Zogby polls .
Meanwhile McCain 's popularity in the red - state heartland took another jump with his selection of the moose - shooting ex-beauty queen , Alaskan governor Sarah Palin , as his vice - presidential running mate .
The war hero and gun advocate " hockey mom " are obviously reaching American heartlanders : at some point the left is going to have to learn to reach the same people , especially in the swing states .
And to do that they are going to have to learn to speak redneck .
A third of Americans live in the geographic " redneck " south and more than 50 % in the cultural south - in places with white southern Scots - Irish values such as western Pennsylvania , central Missouri and southern Illinois , eastern Connecticut , northern New Hampshire , and others never seen as southern .
When you look at people in what has come to be called the red - state heartland , most of their values are traditional white Scots - Irish values .
They hold the key to any national election , yet the liberal and alternative media never speak to , or for , them .
Progressives dominate the internet , politically speaking , but use it to talk to one another in a closed , politically correct conversation that by definition excludes others , particularly rednecks .
I had an editor once , an old - school shot - and - a - beer newsman , who told me : " Joe , do n't become a stenographer for the powerful , regardless of their politics or party . "
I still believe that .
It 's humanity and a nation we 're obligated to , not political junkyism or political correctness .
Especially political correctness that excludes millions who do not see the world in terms of social politics .
For instance , if I say on National Public Radio that " rednecks do n't vote in their own interests because they are misled by the gun lobby " , liberal middle - class America agrees with me .
Proof is in the sales of my book .
It 's been normal practice so long that we rednecks are immune to it , and have come to take a certain defiant pride in the label .
I am an Appalachian native who grew up dirt - eating poor .
Yet I have managed to live a couple of decades in the middle class as a news reporter , magazine editor and publishing executive .
I know the liberal middle class is condescending to working - class redneck culture - which is insulting , but not a crime .
The real crime is the way corporate conservatives lie to my people , screw us blind , kill us in wars and keep us in economic serfdom .
The good news is that many lower working - class people are starting to figure that out .
If we bothered to cover redneck culture we'd be surprised to find how many progressive rednecks , what I call leftnecks , are out there .
America 's media caste , however , is put off by the way these folks look and sound , and by their unpredictable opinions .
It 's happy to deal with the rural red - state working class as long as it remains out there somewhere in " the heartland " , a place to be polled and surveyed by Gallup to fuel self - absorbed political punditry .
Those in the media are granted entitlement to be the one voice , defining America to the many .
And they keep that entitlement as long as they maintain false objectivity and keep working - class people politically in the dark .
That is not difficult .
Every daily newspaper has a business section , but none has a labour section .
My European friends , this is no accident .
No accident at all .

By Friedrich Engels
This pamphlet first appeared in the form of a series of leading articles in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung , beginning on April 4th , 1849 .
The text is made up of from lectures delivered by Marx before the German Workingmen ’s Club of Brussels in 1847 .
The series was never completed .
The promise “ to be continued , ” at the end of the editorial in Number 269 of the newspaper , remained unfulfilled in consequence of the precipitous events of that time : the invasion of Hungary by the Russians [ Tsarist troops invaded Hungary in 1849 to keep the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty in power ] , and the uprisings in Dresden , Iserlohn , Elberfeld , the Palatinate , and in Baden [ Spontaneous uprisings in Germany in May - July 1849 , supporting the Imperial Constitution which were crushed in mid-July ] , which led to the suppression of the paper on May 19th , 1849 .
And among the papers left by Marx no manuscript of any continuation of these articles has been found .
“ Wage - Labor and Capital ” has appeared as an independent publication in several editions , the last of which was issued by the Swiss Co-operative Printing Association , in Hottingen - Zurich , in 1884 .
Hitherto , the several editions have contained the exact wording of the original articles .
But since at least 10,000 copies of the present edition are to be circulated as a propaganda tract , the question necessarily forced itself upon me , would Marx himself , under these circumstance , have approved of an unaltered literal reproduction of the original ?
Marx , in the ’40s , had not yet completed his criticism of political economy .
This was not done until toward the end of the fifties .
Consequently , such of his writings as were published before the first installment of his Critique of Political Economy was finished , deviate in some points from those written after 1859 , and contain expressions and whole sentences which , viewed from the standpoint of his later writings , appear inexact , and even incorrect .
Now , it goes without saying that in ordinary editions , intended for the public in general , this earlier standpoint , as a part of the intellectual development of the author , has its place ; that the author as well as the public , has an indisputable right to an unaltered reprint of these older writings .
In such a case , I would not have dreamed of changing a single word in it .
But it is otherwise when the edition is destined almost exclusively for the purpose of propaganda .
In such a case , Marx himself would unquestionably have brought the old work , dating from 1849 , into harmony with his new point of view , and I feel sure that I am acting in his spirit when I insert in this edition the few changes and additions which are necessary in order to attain this object in all essential point .
Therefore , I say to the reader at once : this pamphlet is not as Marx wrote it in 1849 , but approximately as Marx would have written it in 1891 .
Moreover , so many copies of the original text are in circulation , that these will suffice until I can publish it again unaltered in a complete edition of Marx ’s works , to appear at some future time .
My alterations centre about one point .
According to the original reading , the worker sells his labor for wages , which he receives from the capitalist ; according to the present text , he sells his labor - power .
And for this change , I must render an explanation : to the workers , in order that they may understand that we are not quibbling or word - juggling , but are dealing here with one of the most important points in the whole range of political economy ; to the bourgeois , in order that they may convince themselves how greatly the uneducated workers , who can be easily made to grasp the most difficult economic analyses , excel our supercilious “ cultured " folk , for whom such ticklish problems remain insoluble their whole life long .
Classical political economy [ 1 ] borrowed from the industrial practice the current notion of the manufacturer , that he buys and pays for the labor of his employees .
This conception had been quite serviceable for the business purposes of the manufacturer , his bookkeeping and price calculation .
But naively carried over into political economy , it there produced truly wonderful errors and confusions .
Political economy finds it an established fact that the prices of all commodities , among them the price of the commodity which it calls “ labor , ” continually change ; that they rise and fall in consequence of the most diverse circumstances , which often have no connection whatsoever with the production of the commodities themselves , so that prices appear to be determined , as a rule , by pure chance .
As soon , therefore , as political economy stepped forth as a science , it was one of its first tasks to search for the law that hid itself behind this chance , which apparently determined the prices of commodities , and which in reality controlled this very chance .
Among the prices of commodities , fluctuating and oscillating , now upward , now downward , the fixed central point was searched for around which these fluctuations and oscillations were taking place .
In short , starting from the price of commodities , political economy sought for the value of commodities as the regulating law , by means of which all price fluctuations could be explained , and to which they could all be reduced in the last resort .
And so , classical political economy found that the value of a commodity was determined by the labor incorporated in it and requisite to its production .
With this explanation , it was satisfied .
And we , too , may , for the present , stop at this point .
But , to avoid misconceptions , I will remind the reader that today this explanation has become wholly inadequate .
Marx was the first to investigate thoroughly into the value - forming quality of labor and to discover that not all labor which is apparently , or even really , necessary to the production of a commodity , imparts under all circumstances to this commodity a magnitude of value corresponding to the quantity of labor used up .
If , therefore , we say today in short , with economists like Ricardo , that the value of a commodity is determined by the labor necessary to its production , we always imply the reservations and restrictions made by Marx .
Thus much for our present purpose ; further information can be found in Marx ’s Critique of Political Economy , which appeared in 1859 , and in the first volume of Capital .
But , as soon as the economists applied this determination of value by labor to the commodity “ labor " , they fell from one contradiction into another .
How is the value of “ labor ” determined ?
By the necessary labor embodied in it .
But how much labor is embodied in the labor of a laborer of a day a week , a month , a year .
If labor is the measure of all values , we can express the “ value of labor ” only in labor .
But we know absolutely nothing about the value of an hour ’s labor , if all that we know about it is that it is equal to one hour ’s labor .
So , thereby , we have not advanced one hair ’s breadth nearer our goal ; we are constantly turning about in a circle .
Classical economics , therefore , essayed another turn .
It said : the value of a commodity is equal to its cost of production .
But , what is the cost of production of “ labor " ?
In order to answer this question , the economists are forced to strain logic just a little .
Instead of investigating the cost of production of labor itself , which , unfortunately , cannot be ascertained , they now investigate the cost of production of the laborer .
And this latter can be ascertained .
It changes according to time and circumstances , but for a given condition of society , in a given locality , and in a given branch of production , it , too , is given , at least within quite narrow limits .
We live today under the regime of capitalist production , under which a large and steadily growing class of the population can live only on the condition that it works for the owners of the means of production – tools , machines , raw materials , and means of subsistence – in return for wages .
On the basis of this mode of production , the laborer ’s cost of production consists of the sum of the means of subsistence ( or their price in money ) which on the average are requisite to enable him to work , to maintain in him this capacity for work , and to replace him at his departure , by reason of age , sickness , or death , with another laborer – that is to say , to propagate the working class in required numbers .
Let us assume that the money price of these means of subsistence averages 3 shillings a day .
Our laborer gets , therefore , a daily wage of 3 shillings from his employer .
For this , the capitalist lets him work , say , 12 hours a day .
Our capitalist , moreover , calculates somewhat in the following fashion :
Let us assume that our laborer ( a machinist ) has to make a part of a machine which he finishes in one day .
The raw material ( iron and brass in the necessary prepared form ) costs 20 shillings .
The consumption of coal by the steam - engine , the wear - and - tear of this engine itself , of the turning - lathe , and of the other tools with which our laborer works , represent , for one day and one laborer , a value of 1 shilling .
The wages for one day are , according to our assumption , 3 shillings .
This makes a total of 24 shillings for our piece of a machine .
But , the capitalist calculates that , on an average , he will receive for it a price of 27 shillings from his customers , or 3 shillings over and above his outlay .
Whence do they 3 shillings pocketed by the capitalist come ?
According to the assertion of classical political economy , commodities are in the long run sold at their values , that is , they are sold at prices which correspond to the necessary quantities of labor contained in them .
The average price of our part of a machine – 27 shillings – would therefore equal its value , i.e. , equal the amount of labor embodied in it .
But , of these 27 shillings , 21 shillings were values were values already existing before the machinist began to work ; 20 shillings were contained in the raw material , 1 shilling in the fuel consumed during the work and in the machines and tools used in the process and reduced in their efficiency to the value of this amount .
There remains 6 shillings , which have been added to the value of the raw material .
But , according to the supposition of our economists , themselves , these 6 shillings can arise only from the labor added to the raw material by the laborer .
His 12 hours ’ labor has created , according to this , a new value of 6 shillings .
Therefore , the value of his 12 hours ’ labor would be equivalent to 6 shillings .
So we have at last discovered what the “ value of labor ” is .
“ Hold on there ! ” cries our machinist .
“ Six shillings ?
But I have received only 3 shillings !
My capitalist swears high and day that the value of my 12 hours ’ labor is no more than 3 shillings , and if I were to demand 6 , he ’d laugh at me .
What kind of a story is that ? "
If before this we got with our value of labor into a vicious circle , we now surely have driven straight into an insoluble contradiction .
We searched for the value of labor , and we found more than we can use .
For the laborer , the value of the 12 hours ’ labor is 3 shillings ; for the capitalist , it is 6 shillings , of which he pays the workingman 3 shillings as wages , and pockets the remaining 3 shilling himself .
According to this , labor has not one but two values , and , moreover , two very different values !
As soon as we reduce the values , now expressed in money , to labor - time , the contradiction becomes even more absurd .
By the 12 hours ’ labor , a new value of 6 shillings is created .
Therefore , in 6 hours , the new value created equals 3 shilling – the amount which the laborer receives for 12 hours ’ labor .
For 12 hours ’ labor , the workingman receives , as an equivalent , the product of 6 hours ’ labor .
We are , thus , forced to one of two conclusions : either labor has two values , one of which is twice as large as the other , or 12 equals 6 !
In both cases , we get pure absurdities .
Turn and twist as we may , we will not get out of this contradiction as long as we speak of the buying and selling of “ labor ” and of the “ value of labor . ”
And just so it happened to the political economists .
The last offshoot of classical political economy – the Ricardian school – was largely wrecked on the insolubility of this contradiction .
Classical political economy had run itself into a blind alley .
The man who discovered the way out of this blind alley was Karl Marx .
What the economists had considered as the cost of production of “ labor ” was really the cost of production , not of “ labor , ” but of the living laborer himself .
And what this laborer sold to the capitalist was not his labor .
“ So soon as his labor really begins , ” says Marx , “ it ceases to belong to him , and therefore can no longer be sold by him . ”
At the most , he could sell his future labor – i.e. , assume the obligation of executing a certain piece of work in a certain time .
But , in this way , he does not sell labor ( which would first have to be performed ) , but not for a stipulated payment he places his labor - power at the disposal of the capitalist for a certain time ( in case of time - wages ) , or for the performance of a certain task ( in case of piece - wages ) .
He hires out or sells his labor - power .
But this labor - power has grown up with his person and is inseparable from it .
Its cost of production , therefore , coincides with his own cost of production ; what the economist called the cost of production of labor is really the cost of production of the laborer , and therewith of his labor - power .
And , thus , we can also go back from the cost of production of labor - power to the value of labor - power , and determine the quantity of social labor that is required for the production of a labor - power of a given quantity , as Marx has done in the chapter on “ The Buying and Selling of Labor Power . ” [ Capital , Vol.I ]
Now what takes place after the worker has sold his labor - power , i.e. , after he has placed his labor - power at the disposal of the capitalist for stipulated - wages – whether time - wages or piece - wages ?
The capitalist takes the laborer into his workshop or factory , where all the articles required for the work can be found – raw materials , auxiliary materials ( coal , dyestuffs , etc. ) , tools , and machines .
Here , the worker begins to work .
His daily wages are , as above , 3 shillings , and it makes no difference whether he earns them as day - wages or piece - wages .
We again assume that in 12 hours the worker adds by his labor a new value of 6 shillings to the value of the raw materials consumed , which new value the capitalist realizes by the sale of the finished piece of work .
Out of this new value , he pays the worker his 3 shillings , and the remaining 3 shillings he keeps for himself .
If , now , the laborer creates in 12 hours a value of 6 shilling , in 6 hours he creates a value of 3 shillings .
Consequently , after working 6 hours for the capitalist , the laborer has returned to him the equivalent of the 3 shillings received as wages .
After 6 hours ’ work , both are quits , neither one owing a penny to the other .
“ Hold on there ! ” now cries out the capitalist .
“ I have hired the laborer for a whole day , for 12 hours .
But 6 hours are only half - a- day .
So work along lively there until the other 6 hours are at an end – only then will we be even . ”
And , in fact , the laborer has to submit to the conditions of the contract upon which he entered of “ his own free will " , and according to which he bound himself to work 12 whole hours for a product of labor which cost only 6 hours ’ labor .
Similarly with piece - wages .
Let us suppose that in 12 hours our worker makes 12 commodities .
Each of these costs a shilling in raw materials and wear - and - tear , and is sold for 2.5 shillings .
On our former assumption , the capitalist gives the laborer .25 of a shilling for each piece , which makes a total of 3 shillings for 12 pieces .
To earn this , the worker requires 12 hours .
The capitalist receives 30 shillings for the 12 pieces ; deducting 24 shillings for raw materials and wear - and - tear , there remains 6 shillings , of which he pays 3 shillings in wages and pockets the remaining 3 .
Just as before !
Here , also , the worker labors 6 hours for himself – i.e. , to replace his wages ( half - an - hour in each of the 12 hours ) , and 6 hours for the capitalist .
The rock upon which the best economists were stranded , as long as they started out from the value of labor , vanishes as soon as we make our starting - point the value of labor - power .
Labor - power is , in our present - day capitalist society , a commodity like every other commodity , but yet a very peculiar commodity .
It has , namely , the peculiarity of being a value - creating force , the source of value , and , moreover , when properly treated , the source of more value than it possesses itself .
In the present state of production , human labor - power not only produces in a day a greater value than it itself possesses and costs ; but with each new scientific discovery , with each new technical invention , there also rises the surplus of its daily production over its daily cost , while as a consequence there diminishes that part of the working - day in which the laborer produces the equivalent of his day ’s wages , and , on the other hand , lengthens that part of the working - day in which he must present labor gratis to the capitalist .
And this is the economic constitution of our entire modern society : the working class alone produces all values .
For value is only another expression for labor , that expression , namely , by which is designated , in our capitalist society of today , the amount of socially necessary labor embodied in a particular commodity .
But , these values produced by the workers do not belong to the workers .
They belong to the owners of the raw materials , machines , tools , and money , which enable them to buy the labor - power of the working class .
Hence , the working class gets back only a part of the entire mass of products produced by it .
And , as we have just seen , the other portion , which the capitalist class retains , and which it has to share , at most , only with the landlord class , is increasing with every new discovery and invention , while the share which falls to the working class ( per capita ) rises but little and very slowly , or not at all , and under certain conditions it may even fall .
But , these discoveries and inventions which supplant one another with ever - increasing speed , this productiveness of human labor which increases from day to day to unheard - of proportions , at last gives rise to a conflict , in which present capitalistic economy must go to ruin .
On the one hand , immeasurable wealth and a superfluidity of products with which the buyers cannot cope .
On the other hand , the great mass of society proletarianized , transformed into wage - laborers , and thereby disabled from appropriating to themselves that superfluidity of products .
The splitting up of society into a small class , immoderately rich , and a large class of wage - laborers devoid of all property , brings it about that this society smothers in its own superfluidity , while the great majority of its members are scarcely , or not at all , protected from extreme want .
This condition becomes every day more absurd and more unnecessary .
It must be gotten rid of ; it can be gotten rid of .
A new social order is possible , in which the class differences of today will have disappeared , and in which – perhaps after a short transition period , which , though somewhat deficient in other respects , will in any case be very useful morally – there will be the means of life , of the enjoyment of life , and of the development and activity of all bodily and mental faculties , through the systematic use and further development of the enormous productive powers of society , which exists with us even now , with equal obligation upon all to work .
And that the workers are growing ever more determined to achieve this new social order will be proven on both sides of the ocean on this dawning May Day , and on Sunday , May 3rd .

Anthrax suspect 's colleague ' really , really ' doubts his guilt David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008

In the wake of the apparent suicide of government scientist Bruce Ivins , the FBI is preparing to declare the anthrax case closed , even though , as the New York Times reports , the evidence against Ivins was largely circumstantial .
Genetic analysis has identified a flask in Ivins ' laboratory at Fort Detrick as the source of the anthrax used in the attack , and the envelopes used to mail the anthrax were purchased at a nearby post office .
However , the Times notes that at least ten people had access to the flask in question , and the FBI has never found evidence that Ivins was in New Jersey on the dates when the letters were mailed .
According to the Washington Post , " Knowledgeable officials asserted that Ivins had the skills and access to equipment needed to turn anthrax bacteria into an ultra - fine powder that could be used as a lethal weapon .
Court documents and tapes also reveal a therapist 's deep concern that Ivins , 62 , was homicidal and obsessed with the notion of revenge . "
However , colleagues of Ivins told the Post that Fort Detrick was not equipped to create weaponized anthrax , with one explaining , " USAMRIID does n't deal with powdered anthrax .
... I do n't think there 's anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it .
You would need to have the opportunity , the capability and the motivation , and he did n't possess any of those . "
Anthrax expert Dr. Meryl Nass has also cast doubt on whether Ivins had either the expertise needed to produce weaponized anthrax or access to a large enough supply of spores for the volume of anthrax used in the attacks .
The claim that Ivins was homicidal has come from just one source , social worker Jean Carol Duley , who alleges that he " has actually attempted to murder several other people .
...
He is a revenge killer . "
No one else has yet come forward to back Duley up , and her own credibility is now under attack , with both RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna and Salon 's Glenn Greenwald pointing out that Duley only received her degree in social work a year ago and has a history of DUI and other convictions .
NBC
News reports that Ivins was well - liked in the community of Frederick , MD , where Fort Detrick is located .
He played in a church band and volunteered at the local Red Cross .
Neighbors told NBC they trusted Ivins and considered him " really safe . "
NBC 's Meredith Vieira spoke to Dr. Russell Byrne , who had been both a colleague and a friend of Ivins for 15 years .
Sounding distraught , Byrne said he was " still trying to process a lot of information .
It 's come in really quickly .
A lot of it is just consternation at the ridiculous motives they 're attributing . "
The other motive that has been suggested for why Ivins might have mailed out anthrax is that he could have been hoping to profit from his participation in work at Fort Detrick on an anthrax vaccine .
However , Byrne found that unlikely , explaining that the government owns the patent on the vaccine and that Ivins himself was only one of several researchers , so there could have been no more than " small monetary incentives . "
Byrne further found it unlikely that Ivins would have been able to transform the anthrax spores into a powdered form at the laboratory without him knowing .
" I was the division chief , and I did n't know that anybody did that , " he stated .
" All of the challenges that we did with animals were with wet spores .
...
The dry spores I was n't aware of . "
Byrne said he had n't recently been working in the same lab as Ivins , but people who were told him him that " changes really began to accelerate in the last year .
...
He would sit at his desk weeping .
He really could n't do his work any more because the pressure was tremendous . "
Byrne has told the press he believes Ivins was hounded by the FBI , and Ivins ' lawyer has blamed FBI harassment for Ivins ' suicide .
" I think he committed suicide when he was walked out of the building , escorted by law enforcement officials , " Byrne told Vieira .
" That meant the end of his career . "
Ivins was sent for psychiatric evaluation on July 10 , because of his " deteriorating emotional condition , " and was barred from returning to the base .
Until then , he had maintained his full security clearance and continued to take part in sensitive research and discussions .
Byrne concluded , in reference to Duley 's allegations , " It 's possible that somebody could hide that [ violent side ] from all of your co-workers and nobody would ever hear about it , but I really , really doubt it . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The fate of the government 's $ 700 billion financial bailout plan was thrown into doubt Monday as the House rejected the controversial measure .
The next steps were unclear .
The abrupt defeat left the Bush administration and congressional leaders scrambling to figure out whether to renegotiate the bill and introduce it again as soon as Thursday or to try other options .
Stock markets reacted violently .
Investors who had been counting on the rescue plan 's passage sent the Dow Jones industrial average down well over 700 points .
The stock gauge closed 778 points lower - nearly 7 % . ( Full coverage )
The measure , which is designed to get battered lending markets working normally again , needed 218 votes for passage .
But it came up 13 votes short of that target , with a final vote of 228 to 205 against .
Two - thirds of Democrats and one - third of Republicans voted for the measure .
President Bush , who earlier in the day said he was confident the bill would pass , said he was " very disappointed " by the House vote .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , speaking at the White House , said he will continue to " use all the tools available to protect " the economy .
Republican leaders , who had pushed their reluctant members to vote for the bill , pointed the finger for the failure at a speech given Monday by Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
Pelosi , speaking on the House floor , had blamed the nation 's economic problems on " failed Bush economic policies . "
House minority leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said after the vote that passage would have been possible if it had not been for Pelosi's " partisan speech . "
Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , one of the main congressional negotiators , dismissed the GOP claim that Pelosi 's speech was responsible for Republicans voting against the bill .
" Because somebody hurt their feelings , they decided to hurt the country , " Frank said .
" That 's not plausible . "
' Our time has run out '
The four - hour debate that preceded Monday 's vote included impassioned pleas for and against the measure from Democrats and Republicans alike .
Party leaders told members that the only way to protect the economy from a spreading credit crunch was to vote for the difficult - to - swallow measure .
" Our time has run out , " said Rep. Spencer Bachus , R - Ala. , the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee .
" We 're going make a decision .
There are no other choices , no other alternatives . "
Added Frank : " Today is the decision day .
If we defeat this bill today , it will be a very bad day for the financial sector of the American economy . "
Boehner told his members , many of whom objected to the measure , that they had to accept something he and many of them found distasteful .
" If I did n't think we were on the brink of an economic disaster , it would be the easiest thing to say no to this , " Boehner said .
But he said lawmakers needed to do what was in the best interest of the country .
One lawmaker who voted against the bill , Rep. John Culberson , R - Texas , said the measure would leave a huge burden on taxpayers .
" This legislation is giving us a choice between bankrupting our children and bankrupting a few of these big financial institutions on Wall Street that made bad decisions , " he said .
Culberson voted against the bill .
Other conservative Republicans who voted " no " argued the bill would be a blow against economic freedom .
Thaddeus McCotter , R - Mich. , said the bill posed a choice between the loss of prosperity in the short term or economic freedom in the long term .
He said once the federal government enters the financial marketplace , it will not leave .
" The choice is stark , " he said .
Some Democrats voted against the bill for not doing enough to help taxpayers facing foreclosure or unemployment and accused proponents of moving too fast .
" Like the Iraq war and Patriot Act , this bill is fueled by fear and haste , " said Lloyd Doggett , D - Texas .
The runup to the vote
The debate followed a weekend of marathon negotiations between lawmakers and administration officials to hammer out legislation .
Leading House Republicans signed on to the proposal on Sunday after expressing earlier reservations .
The core of the bill is based on Paulson 's request for the authority to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions , so banks can resume lending and the credit markets , now virtually frozen , can begin to operate more normally .
Democrats and Republicans - concerned about the potential cost - added several conditions and restrictions to protect taxpayers on the downside and give them a chance at some of the potential upside if the companies benefit from the plan .
The turmoil in Washington comes amid great upheaval in the nation 's financial system .
Banks and Wall Street firms , worried about both their own needs for cash and the condition of other institutions , essentially stopped loaning money to one another in recent weeks .
That choked off the money being made available on Main Street in the form of mortgage loans , business loans and other consumer borrowing .
The crisis stems from problems in mortgage - backed securities , which saw their value plunge as home prices have gone into their worst slide since the Great Depression and foreclosures have soared to record levels .
In turn , the market for trillion of dollars worth of those securities held by major firms evaporated , sending them down to fire - sale prices and raising the risk of widespread failures among the nation 's major financial firms .
On Monday , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which insures deposits at failed banks , arranged for the sale of the banking assets of Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 4 bank holding company , to Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) for $ 2.2 billion in stock .
That follows three weeks of other shocks : the Treasury Department 's seizure of mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) ; Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers ' bankruptcy filing ; rival Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) purchase by Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
In addition , the Fed bailed out insurance giant American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , loaning it $ 85 billion in return for a nearly 80 % stake .
Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's largest savings and loan , became the largest bank failure in history .
After months of attempts by regulators to fix the problems , the bailout was seen by many as the most comprehensive effort yet .
Proponents vowed late Monday to keep trying .
Sen . Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , a lead negotiator in the bailout bill negotiations said , " If we do n't act promptly and effectively , then many people are going to lose their jobs . "
John McCain traces the rancorous tone of the presidential campaign back to last summer when he invited Barack Obama to have lots and lots of town - hall meetings with him all around the country .
When Obama turned him down , obviously McCain had no choice but to start depicting his opponent as a terrorist - loving advocate of talking dirty to kindergarteners .
Finally this week , the two men did meet in a town - hall showdown , which turned out to be like all other debates , except with much less excitement and much more pacing around .
It seems unlikely that many people switched off their TV sets and said : “ Gee , I could sit through a dozen of these . ”
McCain may feel compelled to go back to his guilt - by - association theme .
And this has me feeling very guilty about my associates .
The McCain folks have been obsessed with William Ayers , a neighbor of Obama ’s who is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
Back in the 1960s , Ayers and his wife , Bernardine Dohrn , were leaders of the Weather Underground , an antiwar group whose penchant for violence was exceeded only by its haplessness .
Ayers has since become an education expert and was named Chicago ’s Citizen of the Year in 1997 .

CUYAHOGA FALLS , Ohio ( CNN ) -- Camryn Jakeb Wilson was bathed in TV lights the day he was born , celebrated on the local news as Summit County 's 2008 New Year 's baby after his arrival at 12:33 a.m. January 1 .

Just 12 weeks later , he was bathed in warm water minutes after he quietly died in his mother 's arms , the victim of shaken baby syndrome .
Camryn's 9 - year - old sister , Tabatha , asked why he needed a bath now .
" We have to get him ready to go to Jesus , " a nurse softly replied .
Tabatha took up a sponge to help .
Camryn's father , Craig R. Wilson , 28 , of Cuyahoga Falls , is scheduled for a pretrial hearing on murder and other charges August 20 .
Police say he confessed to shaking and squeezing the infant after arguing with his wife , Crystal Wilson .
But he has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and faces trial in September .
" There are no excuses for this to happen to any baby , " said Crystal Wilson , 26 .
" This is murder .
He had no reason to die .
He died because he cried . "
An innocent infant 's violent death has destroyed a family .

" It really is a tragedy , " said Craig Wilson 's defense attorney , Jonathan T. Sinn .
" I mean , not only did Crystal and Craig lose a son , but Crystal lost a husband , and Craig 's parents lost a son and a grandson .
...
One day this was a happy , perfect family , and the next day it 's been devastated . "
Shaken baby syndrome Violently shaking an infant for just a few seconds can cause :
 Brain injury leading to paralysis , mild to severe cognitive impairment , cerebral palsy
 Blindness
 Broken bones
 Death
Normal activities such as bouncing a baby on one 's knee , tossing it in the air or jogging with a baby on one 's back do not cause shaken baby syndrome .

The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome estimates that as many as 1,400 babies annually are injured or killed by shaking .
According to the center , 70 percent to 79 percent of people convicted of killing or hurting babies are men .
The average age of perpetrators is 24 , and 82 percent are either the parent of the victim or the live - in boyfriend of the mother .

Craig Wilson and Crystal Twiddy , both recovering alcoholics , met about four years ago in a softball league popular with Alcoholics Anonymous members .
The couple beamed in engagement photos shot in a garden setting before they were married in September .
It was the first marriage for both .

Craig , the machinist son of the Cuyahoga Falls High School wrestling coach and a former Mat Cats wrestler himself , became a father figure to Tabatha , Crystal 's daughter from a previous relationship .
The newlyweds also became frequent caretakers to 1 - year - old Corrine , a daughter Craig had with another woman .
Family members said the couple 's only source of conflict was Craig 's interaction with Corrine 's mother .
On March 12 , the topic sparked a heated quarrel , according to a police report and family accounts .
The couple hurled their wedding rings , along with profane insults , at each other .
Crystal left with Tabatha to attend one of her regular AA meetings , leaving baby Camryn in the care of his father .
" Maybe they both could have used a meeting that night , " Sinn observed .
When Crystal and Tabatha got home from the meeting March 12 , Crystal immediately noticed that Camryn did n't look right in his baby swing .
He was gasping for air but could n't be wakened .
After briefly speaking with an on - call doctor at Akron Children 's Hospital , she scooped him up and rushed him there .
Camryn was critically injured , with bleeding inside his head and in the backs of his eyes , and several broken ribs -- some of which , according to the autopsy , turned out to be older injuries .
Medical personnel at the hospital determined that the combination of injuries could only mean abuse .
When rib fractures are seen in a 10 - week - old infant , " it 's beating up , " said Dr. Nicolas Krawiecki , a pediatric neurologist and faculty member at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , Georgia .
He is not involved in the Wilson case .

Craig Wilson was summoned to the hospital , where police questioned both parents separately .
Early on March 13 , the 5 - foot - 7 - inch , 190 - pound father was arrested after admitting that he had shaken and squeezed his baby out of frustration and anger toward his wife resulting from the argument over Corrine 's mother , according to the police investigators ' report .
The bleeding inside Camryn's head was catastrophic .
The two sides of his brain were " like two telephone poles with the lines between them cut , " a family member said a doctor told them .
Camryn was blind and incapable of feeling someone touching him , he could not breathe on his own , and if he lived , he would never be aware of his surroundings or even be capable of thinking , family members said .

After almost two weeks of waiting for a miracle that would never come , Crystal Wilson decided to withdraw life support .
She gave friends and family -- including everyone on Craig 's side -- time to gather to say goodbye to the tiny boy with the big , sightless eyes .
Various relatives took turns holding him as he gradually slipped away .
" They pulled together ; they prayed together ; they took baby Camryn off life support together , " said Sinn , the Wilson family 's longtime lawyer .
" And that was a wonderful thing , that they were able to pull together like that despite Craig being alleged to have done these things . "
Camryn's father was not among them as he remained in jail .
Sheriff 's deputies took Craig Wilson to the funeral home for a brief private viewing of the infant 's body the night before the funeral .
How to deal with crying Steps to take if a baby is crying and you are getting flustered :
 Lay the baby on its back in its crib
 Put the crib rails up
 Leave the room
 Close the door
 Distract yourself with relaxing activities for a few minutes
 Call a friend or relative to take over if necessary

But the family unity would not last .
Buried with Camryn were multiple relationships that could not survive the grief , recrimination and legal machinations that have followed his death .

Crystal Wilson intends to divorce her husband of 11 months and is at odds with her in - laws .
" My anger is kicked in full load , " she wrote on her private MySpace page .
" I do n't care what Craig 's family members think .
He did this to my son .
May he get what he deserves !
Maybe people should talk more about Camryn than Craig .
Craig 's name has no worth to even be mentioned . "
Through their attorney , Wilson and his family declined to comment to CNN .
Sinn said the autopsy on Camryn raises questions about whether Craig Wilson or someone else might have injured the infant on previous occasions .
The autopsy report , obtained by CNN , found Camryn had multiple rib fractures , including several that apparently were incurred on one or more previous occasions .
" The question becomes :
If that autopsy is accurate , if this child has been severely injured to the point that his ribs were fractured on prior occasions , multiple occasions , how come no one knew that ? "
Sinn said .
If Camryn 's caregivers did n't pick up on his earlier rib fractures , neither did medical personnel trained to look for signs of child abuse .
Camryn had been to Children 's Hospital several times during his short life -- including earlier on the day he was fatally injured -- for well - baby checks and immunizations .
No doctor or nurse ever noted broken ribs or signs of unusual pain in the infant , family members said .

Cuyahoga Falls police have said there are no suspects besides Craig Wilson , and Summit County Children Services removes children immediately from a home investigators consider dangerous .
Crystal Wilson 's other child , 9 - year - old Tabatha , is still at home with her mother .
Sinn conceded that his client belatedly admitted to police having squeezed Camryn on previous occasions .
" He only made the confession after the detectives involved started talking about other possibilities of how this child could have been injured , what other folks in the household could have injured him .
Then Craig quickly took responsibility , " Sinn said .

Sinn said his client would accept " today " an offer to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter , saying Craig Wilson had no intention to kill Camryn that night , making a murder charge inappropriate .
But prosecutors say there will be no deal .
" No matter what happens , Craig is going to very likely spend the majority of his adult life in prison , " Sinn conceded .
" We are talking massive numbers here . "
John Saros , executive director of Summit County Children Services , said crime within a family can bring long - lasting hardship , especially when a family member goes to prison .
" If that 's the breadwinner or the main breadwinner , then you 've got some serious financial problems right off the bat , " he said .
Crystal and Tabatha can attest to that .
They can no longer afford to live in the charming little house they once shared with Craig on a peaceful Cuyahoga Falls street .

" I lost my job because of this , because I could n't work enough hours .
Now I have to move into a smaller place , " Crystal said .
" It 's horrible .
It 's a whole life change . "
And the consequences in such circumstances extend beyond the immediate family , Saros said .
" It will be the basis for divorces ; it 'll be the basis for the kind of family conflict that then brings into play maternal and paternal grandparents and the extended family on both sides , and we end up with a lot of conflict , " said Saros , who has been in the family services field for 40 years .
Crystal Wilson 's mother -- Camryn's grandmother , Laura Twiddy -- is angry at Craig but is trying to keep perspective .
" I can't have HATE eat me up and beat me down .
I can't live like that , " she wrote on her MySpace page .
" I will have to one day forgive him so that I might find peace . "
Peace of a sort can be found near the back of Stow Cemetery , where birds chirp in the trees above a freshly carved marker bearing a photograph of a big - eyed baby boy .
The plot where Camryn now lies beneath that stone was donated to Crystal Wilson by a kind relative : Janet Wilson , Camryn 's great - grandmother .

Senator John McCain was on a roll .
In a room reserved for high - stakes gamblers at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut , he tossed $ 100 chips around a hot craps table .
When the marathon session ended around 2:30 a.m. , the Arizona senator and his entourage emerged with thousands of dollars in winnings .
A lifelong gambler , Mr. McCain takes risks , both on and off the craps table .
He was throwing dice that night not long after his failed 2000 presidential bid , in which he was skewered by the Republican Party ’s evangelical base , opponents of gambling .
Mr. McCain was betting at a casino he oversaw as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , and he was doing so with the lobbyist who represents that casino , according to three associates of Mr. McCain .
The visit had been arranged by the lobbyist , Scott Reed , who works for the Mashantucket Pequot , a tribe that has contributed heavily to Mr. McCain ’s campaigns and built Foxwoods into the world ’s second - largest casino .
Joining them was Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s current campaign manager .
Their night of good fortune epitomized not just Mr. McCain ’s affection for gambling , but also the close relationship he has built with the gambling industry and its lobbyists during his 25 - year career in Congress .
As a two - time chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee , Mr. McCain has done more than any other member of Congress to shape the laws governing America ’s casinos , helping to transform the once - sleepy Indian gambling business into a $ 26 - billion - a - year behemoth with 423 casinos across the country .
He has won praise as a champion of economic development and self - governance on reservations .
Reports out of Japanese newspapers Saturday indicate that Nintendo is preparing to announce a new version of the Nintendo DS hardware in the coming days , one that adds non-gaming functions to the popular portable machine .
Nikkei Net , the online arm of Japan 's foremost economic newspaper , reports that the new model will launch this year in Japan and include a camera and music playback .
Nikkei's take on the new machine is that Nintendo is moving outside the boundaries of the " game industry " and attempting to create a device that will compete with more general electronics like cell phones .
The machine 's wireless communication functionality will also be strengthened by allowing it to connect to " information terminals , " possibly allowing a user to find nearby train stations or restaurants using his DS .
Nikkei does point out that the camera function of DS could be integrated with gameplay , by allowing games to use the photos taken with the hardware .
The online version of the story omits a line that is present in a photograph of the print story , which says that the new model will cost less than 20,000 yen ( about $ 188 ) .
The DS Lite costs 16,800 yen ( $ 158 ) in Japan .
Nikkei says the new model will go on sale in Japan first , this year , and that a U.S. release is " being considered . "
And there might be more to this new model – another version of the Nikkei report , since removed , apparently ran on a site called Monex and said that the hardware would have larger screens and be able to transfer data from the Wii or an SD card .
Note that we may not be getting the full picture of the device 's capabilities from these reports ; note also that the current version of the story does not confirm the two data points in the above paragraph .
Nintendo will hold media briefings in Tokyo and San Francisco on Thursday .
Simultaneous media events generally mean some big piece of news is to be announced , so this would seem like a likely topic of discussion .

Third Party Candidates Want McCain's Debate Spot
If the success of a rescue plan depends on its wackiness , this one might just work .
A couple of colorful third - party presidential candidates who both hail from Georgia but are ideological opposites are offering to save the first presidential debate .
If John McCain goes through with his threat to skip Friday night 's first presidential debate at Ole Miss University , Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney has offered to step in and debate Democratic nominee Barack Obama .
" I 'm ready right now to travel to Mississippi , " says McKinney , whose last most memorable act as a Democratic congresswoman from Georgia in 2006 was allegedly punching a Capitol Hill police officer who mistook her for an ordinary citizen at a security checkpoint .

Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party presidential nominee , also stands ready to save the day .
" Given Senator McCain 's political stunt to avoid the debate , I ask that Friday 's debate moves forward without him , as I am more than willing to step in to participate , " says Barr , who is perhaps best known for his zealous drive to impeach President Bill Clinton .
( And , as Mark Hemingway at the National Review reminds us , Barr is also notorious for once shooting off a gun accidentally at a reception .
Leave your guns at home on Friday , Bob . )

McKinney was defeated about four months after her brush with police , in August 2006 , by primary challenger Hank Johnson , who is now the Democratic congressman representing McKinney 's old seat .
She had made a brief comeback to Congress after both she and Barr , who was a Republican congressman , lost to respective primary challengers in 2002 .
And here they are today , both making a wild stab in the dark to get on that presidential debate stage Friday night .
" Any presidential candidate who is on enough ballots to be
elected deserves to participate , " McKinney said in a statement released by the Green Party late Wednesday .
" We need multi-party presidential debates , and I 'm ready to go up against Barack Obama or any other candidate and present my ideas to the American people .
I should be included in these debates whether McCain shows up or not , "
Ditto that from Barr .
Just as Ronald Reagan chose to debate independent presidential candidate John Anderson one - on - one in 1980 , and just as George H.W. Bush demanded the inclusion of H. Ross Perot in all three presidential debates in 1992 , so should Obama welcome Barr to the stage .
According to Barr , of course .
" It 's time that at least one of the two leading presidential candidates show leadership and provide the American public an opportunity to witness an open and fair debate , based upon substance and issues rather than sound bites and rhetoric , " Barr said in a statement issued today .
McKinney , who is black , blamed race as the reason why the Capitol Hill police officer stopped her in the spring of 2006 when she breezed past the magnetometer .
That 's when she belted the cop with the cell phone she was carrying .
Known as an outspoken radical , the former congresswoman and current Green Party presidential candidate - whose campaign mantra is " Power to the People ! " - also gained national attention when she suggested the Bush administration may have orchestrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
She lost her 2002 primary campaign soon after that .
And her father , former state representative Billy McKinney , spelled out the reason why his daughter was defeated : " J - E - W - S . "
And here 's why McKinney thinks she should be allowed to debate Obama Friday night : " Voters deserve to know which candidate best represents their interests and ideals . "
As for Bob Barr , if the presidential political landscape is hurled even further into the Twilight Zone and he does wind up on the Ole Miss debate stage Friday night , our advice to Obama is : bring breath mints .
Fiorina : Palin does n't have the experience to run HP
McCain supporter Carly Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett Packard , seemed to veer off message for a moment on the McGraw Milhaven show on KTRS radio in St Louis , when she made the case that Sarah Palin may be qualified to run America -- but certainly not to run her old company .
" Do you think she has the experience to run a major company like Hewlett Packard ? " the host asked Fiorina .
" No , I do n’t , " she replied .
" But that ’s not what she ’s running for .
Running a corporation is a different set of things . "
She then went back on the attack on Obama 's experience .
( She probably would n't want him running HP either . )
" I would just remind you that it is Barack Obama who is running for president .
John McCain who is running for president , " she said .
" Sarah Palin has more experience than Barack Obama has . "
" I find it quite stunning , actually , that the Barack Obama campaign is questioning Sarah Palin 's experience , " she said .
NOTE : That last line is Fiorina 's , not mine , though I initially omitted quotation marks by mistake .
I find the email I 'm getting about it quite stunning ....
God damn .
Richard Cohen files for divorce , and he wants the kids , the house , the car , and the dog .
He is pissed .
Also , Mark Halperin was on Anderson Cooper , and I have no idea what happened to the guy who just three weeks ago was insisting that McCain ’s housing gaffe was bad for Obama , but he was playing things straight down the middle and calling McCain ’s lies… lies .

For first time in modern history , a presidential race is actually going to be decided by the vice presidential pick .
Thanks to Sarah Palin , this is no longer a contest between Barack Obama and John McCain - it 's between Brother Barack and Sistah Sarah .
Rock star vs. rock star .
Inexperienced vs. inexperienced .
Newcomer vs. newcomer .
Change vs. change .
His " change " is East Coast intellectual .
Her " change " is NASCAR .
His change is wine and cheese .
Her change is mayonnaise by the gallon .
And notice how everyone is calling her Sarah Palin - not Gov. Palin .
That 's not good for the Democrats .
It shows a certain familiarity that goes beyond just issues or her knowledge of the " Bush Doctrine . "
Heck , even I did n't know what the Bush Doctrine was when Charlie Gibson asked her about it the other night on her first national TV interview .
The Democrats have got to get to the core of this new campaign .
It 's not a pretty thought , but somehow Democrats must plant in voters ' minds that , given McCain 's age and his health history , he might not make it through the term if he 's elected .
Even if McCain does make it through a term , it 's not likely he 'll seek re-election and she will be the natural successor .
In other words , Sarah Palin may indeed be president someday .
Then there is the question of how to boost the turnout in key states .
Palin has become an instant heroine with the Wal - Mart crowd in Ohio , Nevada , Pennsylvania and other critical states .
And Wal - Marters are a lot more likely to volunteer or show up at the polls than the younger people Obama has attracted .
Right now , the best shot Obama has of winning is to get out and register 12 million or so unregistered blacks , especially in the South .
But he has got to do it without anyone noticing .
Palin will have no problem signing up new voters in her group .
She can go to the Mountain Dew 250 in Talladega , Ala. , and pitch for votes , and no one will bat an eye .
But Obama can't go to a meeting called by Al Sharpton to get out the black vote , because if he does there will be a backlash .
He 's got to do it under the radar .
And forget the comedy , Barack .
You are not naturally funny and you do not speak " street . "
You speak like a professor .
And you do not know how to set up a joke .
That " lipstick on a pig " line clearly backfired .
If you had said , " As John McCain said about Hillary Clinton 's health care ... lipstick on a pig is still a pig , " at least you would have had a frame of reference to fall back on .
You did n't , you left yourself left wide open and you got nailed .
Now everything you say will be double - examined for sexism .
On the bright side , as far as Obama is concerned , is that the Susie Buells of the world - the hard - core Hillary supporters - are starting to get worried .
That might translate into some action .
They had a thank - you party for the donors to the new California Academy of Sciences out at Golden Gate Park the other night , and I do n't mean the people who gave like $ 5,000 .
These were real donors .
The blue - blood donors .
The ones who cut six - figure or at least five - figure checks .
It was fabulous .
Patti Austin performed .
I was at a table with Dede Wilsey , Paul Pelosi , Susie Buell , John Traina .
At the next table were members of Gap founder Don Fisher 's clan .
It was like being at the Opera opening .
Come to think of it , they even had an opera singer perform .
Stanlee Gatti must have made all the furniture just for this one night , because it all matched the color of the room 's beams , which are the color of the Golden Gate Bridge .
Paula LeDuc did the catering .
She served up " salad " that was actually little plots of grass , about 6 inches tall .
Down in the grass were three eggs with caviar and other kinds of stuff .
Now that 's going " green . "
And for once they let spouses and dates sit together , thereby eliminating 2 1/ 2 hours of forced conversations with people you do n't even know .
The town was bursting with conventioneers last week .
Open collars , computer bags and lots and lots of lines to get a cab .
I had to wait 15 minutes for a taxi in front of the St. Regis , and it was the same in front of the Palace and in front of the St. Francis .
And the cabbies need the work , because those black town cars are stealing a lot of their fares .
The town cars are n't supposed to pick up people on the street .
They 're supposed to be by reservation only , but they are n't following the rules .
Plus , a lot of these guys obviously have a thing going with some of the doormen at the hotels .
It 's clear that when they shake hands during a pickup that money is being passed .
So business San Francisco style is still alive and well .
Sarah 's rule : Politics is like an Alaskan sled race .
Only the lead dog gets a change of view .
Barack Obama's
White House campaign claims desperate Republicans are waging a nation - wide campaign , orchestrated with John McCain 's staff , to intimidate voters and depress turnout in next month 's presidential election .
Top aides to the Democrat battled back against what they called a Republican " smokescreen " over a liberal advocacy group called ACORN , which is under investigation in several states over allegations of voter registration fraud .
The group released a video , set to the song You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' , showing Senator McCain warmly greeting its activists at a February 2006 event in support of immigration reform .
Senator Obama says his own ties to the Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) went no further than legal work he did with the Justice Department for ACORN against the state of Illinois in the mid-1990s .
" As an elected official I 've had interactions with them , " the Illinois Senator told reporters in Ohio .
" But they 're not advising the campaign .
We 've got the best voter registration turnout and volunteer operation in politics right now , and we do n't need ACORN 's help , " he said .
The McCain campaign is airing a 90 - second ad alleging close and enduring ties between Senator Obama and ACORN , which it says had bullied banks into extending the kinds of subprime mortgage loans at the heart of the US financial crisis .
The group boasts of gathering the names of 1.3 million mostly non-white , low - income voters in 21 states in the most successful voter registration drive in US history .
But many of the names are said by conservatives to be duplicated , or of famous sports stars , or of cartoon and movie characters .
" If left uncorrected , these numerous investigations and accusations of voter fraud with ACORN could produce a nightmare scenario on election day , " Senator McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis said in a statement .
" It is our hope that the Obama campaign joins us in our efforts to prevent voter fraud prior to election day . "
' Repression and intimidation '
On MSNBC television , ACORN spokesman Scott Levenson blamed any problems on rogue canvassers and attacked Senator McCain 's " denomination of this advocacy group that does work for the most powerless of our society . "
Senator Obama 's campaign manager David Plouffe says ACORN is in no way involved in his own voter registration program , and says the allegations are a Republican attempt to divert attention from their own " suppression " tactics .
" A lot of noise they 're trying to create here is a smokescreen because we have no doubt that their effort towards repression and intimidation is going to be unprecedented , " he said .
Mr Plouffe says Senator McCain and the Republicans have nothing to offer on the stricken US economy and suffered a " huge inspiration gap , " and so were resorting to trickery to suppress Democratic turnout in swing states .
He says there are now more than 9 million voters newly registered for the November 4 election and Democratic registrations are outpacing Republican ones by four to one .
" There 's a long history to Republican efforts to whip up fear about the electoral process , " the Obama campaign 's general counsel Bob Bauer said , promising a " ferocious " Democratic response in the courts .
He listed reports that Republican bosses in one Michigan county were using lists of foreclosed homes to throw their former owners off the rolls .
In Ohio , Republicans are now attacking a procedure they themselves initiated for the 2004 election allowing voters to register and cast an absentee ballot on the same day .
Mr Bauer rejects the McCain campaign 's accusation that Obama operatives had paid $ US800,000 to ACORN to register voters in Kansas , insisting cooperation with the group stopped at joint canvassing efforts .
" It 's a lie and the repetition of the lie wo n't make it true .
We have never paid ACORN for any registration purposes and they know it , " he said .
Mr Plouffe says that as in 2004 , state Republicans were hiring burly individuals " with law enforcement backgrounds " to work as nominally independent monitors at polling stations .
" We think this is a highly cynical effort they 're engaged in here , " he said .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - A small Yahoo Inc YHOO.
O investor proposed a new deal on Thursday to sell the company to Microsoft Corp MSFT.
O for $ 22 a share , a 74 percent premium to the Web pioneer 's current stock price .
The headquarters of Yahoo Inc. is shown in Sunnyvale , California , May 5 , 2008 .

Under the proposal by investment fund Mithras Capital , Microsoft would unload Yahoo ’s Asian assets and non-search businesses , extract $ 3 billion worth of cost savings and receive $ 2.8 billion of tax benefits , meaning the software giant would pay $ 10.3 billion for Yahoo ’s search business .
Mithras Capital , which owns more than 1.9 million shares , or 0.14 percent , of Yahoo , said in a press release that the proposal allows Microsoft to buy Yahoo ’s search business for $ 2 billion less than it offered in July .
Talks between the two companies broke off in July after Yahoo rejected Microsoft ’s proposal to buy its search business and enact a revenue sharing partnership .
Yahoo also rebuffed a full acquisition offer from Microsoft in May .
Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment .
Mark Nelson , partner of Mithras Capital , said he plans to send a letter proposing the deal to Microsoft and Yahoo Thursday night .
Microsoft executives have said the chances of it buying Yahoo are “ negligible , ” but that was before a decline in the price of Yahoo shares , which has fallen on concerns that the financial crisis and slumping economy could hurt its business .
Yahoo shares are down 36 percent since the start of August , falling to new five - year lows on Thursday .
The stock decline has investors looking to revive talks with Microsoft , which is looking to close the gap on search leader Google Inc GOOG.O .
“ As Yahoo shares decline and Microsoft struggles in its online services business , it is increasingly likely Microsoft will make a new offer , ” American Technology Research analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday .
He has a buy rating on Yahoo with a $ 22 target price .
The proposal also calls for Yahoo ’s board to drop its poison pill preventing such a tender offer , while valuing Yahoo ’s Asian assets at $ 7.2 billion and its non-search business at $ 4.5 billion .
Yahoo , which ceded three board seats to activist investor Carl Icahn in August , has been involved in ongoing talks with Time Warner Inc TWX.N about buying its AOL unit , according to a source briefed on the situation .
Yahoo also has delayed the start of a search advertising partnership with Google while it sorts out regulatory concerns about the deal .
“ It is imperative for Microsoft to act now , while the Yahoo - Google deal is mired in regulatory concerns , and before Yahoo strikes a deal with AOL , ” said Mark Nelson , a partner at Mithras .
“ It is imperative for the Yahoo board to embrace this proposal as the best outcome for long - suffering Yahoo shareholders , ” Nelson said in a news release .
Shares of Microsoft closed down 3.09 percent to $ 22.30 on the Nasdaq while Yahoo stock fell 8.07 percent to $ 12.65 in Thursday trade .

Screen scraping is the art of programatically extracting data from websites .
If you think it 's useful : it is .
If you think it 's difficult : it is n't .
And if you think it 's easy to really piss off administrators with ill - considered scripts , you 're damn right .
This is a tutorial on not just screen scraping , but socially responsible screen scraping .
Its an amalgam of getting the data you want and the Golden Rule , and reading it is going to make the web a better place .
We 're going to be doing this tutorial in Python , and will use the httplib2 and BeautifulSoup libraries to make things as easy as possible .
We 'll look at setting things up in a moment , but first a few words about being kind .
Websites crash .
They look pretty and reliable and stable , but then a butterfly flaps its wings somewhere and they ride a handbasket straight to hell .
For small websites ' hell ' is a complete crash , while for bigger websites its more often sluggish performance .
Either way , the butterfly flapping its wing is always an unexpected influx of traffic , and often that traffic spike is the direct result of inconsiderable screen scrapers .
For my blog , the error reports I get are all generated by overzealous webcrawlers from search engines ( perhaps the most ubiquitous specie of screenscraper ) .
Early on , I would routinely be assaulted by a small research web crawler whose owner was nigh impossible to contact .
Not infrequently it would crash things by initiating more http requests than my small vps could handle .
The programmers who wrote the scraper were n't being considerate , and it was causing problems .
This brings us to my single rule for socially responsible screen scraping : screen scraper traffic should be indistinguishable from human traffic .
By following this rule we avoid placing undue stress on the websites we are scraping , and as an added bonus we 'll avoid any attempts to throttle or prevent screen scraping1 .
We 'll use a couple of guidelines to help our scripts feign humanity :
Cache feverently .
Especially when you 're scraping a relatively small amount of data ( and your computer has a lot of memory to store in ) , you should save and reuse results as much as possible .
Stagger http requests .
Although it 'll speed things up for you to make all the http requests in parallel , it wo n't be appreciated .
However , even if you make the requests sequentially it can end up being a fairly large hit .
Instead , space your requests out by a small period of time .
Several seconds between each request assures that you wo n't be causing problems .
Take only what you need .
When screen scraping it 's tempting to just grab everything , downloading more and more pages just because they are there .
But its a waste of their bandwidth and your time , so make a list of the data you want to extract and stick to it .
Now , armed with those three guidelines , lets get started screen scraping .
Setup Libraries
First we need to install the httplib2 and BeautifulSoup libraries .
The easiest way to do this is to use easy_install .
sudo easy_install BeautifulSoup sudo easy_install httplib2
If you do n't have easy_install installed , then you 'll need to download them from their project pages at httplib2 and BeautifulSoup .
Choosing a Scraping Target
Now lets get scraping .
We 're going to start small and grow a simple and considerate library for scraping HackerNews .
The first step is to consider what data we want to extract .
The web interface to HackerNews looks like this :
Thus , from loading only the frontpage we can extract a lot of data about each story : the title , the link , the social score , the poster , when it was posted , and the number of comments .
There are 30 hits displayed on each page , so we 'll be able to gather a fair bit of data with only retrieving one page .
The Simplest Case
With `httplib2 and BeautifulSoup its quick and easy to extract the data we need from HackerNews .
Simple enough to just throw a few commands into the interpreter :
>>> import httplib2 >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup >>> conn = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " ) >>> page = conn .
request ( u" http://news.ycombinator.com/ " , " GET " ) >>> page [ 0 ] {' status ' : ' 200 ' , ' content-location ' : u'http://news.ycombinator.com/', ' transfer - encoding ' : ' chunked ' , ' keep - alive ' : ' timeout=3 ' , ' connection ' : ' Keep - Alive ' , ' content - type ' : ' text / html ; charset=utf - 8'} >>> # page [ 1 ] contains the retrieved html .
... >>> soup = BeautifulSoup ( page [ 1 ] ) >>> titles = soup .
findAll ( 'td ' , ' title ' ) >>> titles = [ x for x in titles if x . findChildren ( ) ] [ : - 1 ] >>> subtexts = soup .
findAll ( 'td ' , ' subtext ' ) >>> stories = zip ( titles , subtexts ) >>> len ( stories ) 30 >>> stories [ 0 ] ( < td align = " right " valign = " top " class = " title " >
1.</td > , < td class = " subtext " >< span id =" score_272314 " > 38 points </ span > by < a href="user?id=yangyang42" >yangyang42</a>
5 hours ago | < a href= " item?id=272314 " > 8 comments</a></td >)
The bit with titles is necessarily confusing .
The titles css class is sued for both the td tags that contain the number of the item ( for example 1 . or 15 . ) , and for the td tags that contain the a tags with the title of the story and its link .
However , we only want the later kind , so we filter out the td tags without any children tags .
We 're also excluding the last result from that filtered list .
That 's because the last one contains the More link to view the next 30 results , and is not actually a story itself .
So we 're pretty close to what we want , but the data is n't in a very accessible format yet .
Lets try to finagle it into something usable .
Right now each story is a 2 - tuple of Tag objects :
>>> stories [ 0 ] ( < td class = " title " >< a href= " http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/08/the-secret-of-t.html "
>
The secret of the web ( hint : it 's a virtue ) </a>< span class= " comhead " > ( sethgodin.typepad.com ) </ span></td> , < td class= " subtext " >< span id =" score_272314 " > 38 points </ span > by < a href="user?id=yangyang42" >yangyang42</a>
5 hours ago | < a href= " item?id=272314 " > 8 comments</a></td >)
What I 'd really like is a dictionary containing all of that data .
First lets figure out how to extract each piece of the data :
>>> s = stories [ 0 ] >>> s [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] [ ' href ' ] u'http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/08/the-secret-of-t.html' >>> s [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string u" The secret of the web ( hint : it 's a virtue ) " >>> s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string u'38 points ' >>> s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 1 ] . string u'yangyang 42 ' >>> s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 2 ] . string u'8 comments ' >>> s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 2 ] . string . split ( " " ) [ 0 ] u'8 '
So , we 've figured out how to grab everything except how long ago the story was posted .
Thus far we were using the findChildren method to navigate the tag tree , but there is also the contents attribute , which allows access to both tags and strings .
>>> s [ 1 ] . contents [ < span id =" score_272314 " >38 points </ span > , u' by ' , < a href="user?id=yangyang42" >yangyang42</a > , u' 5 hours ago | ' , < a href = " item?id=272314 " > 8 comments </a > ] >>> s [ 1 ] . contents [ - 2 ] . split ( " " ) [ u '' , u'5 ' , u'hours ' , u'ago ' , u ' ' , u' | ' , u ' ' ] >>> s [ 1 ] . contents [ - 2 ] . strip ( ) . split ( " " ) [ u ' 5 ' , u'hours ' , u'ago ' , u ' ' , u ' | ' ] >>> s [ 1 ] . contents [ - 2 ] . strip ( ) . split ( " " ) [ 0 ] u'5 '
In reality , though , its probably easiest to just use a regular expression to extract this data .
>>> import re >>> txt = unicode ( s [ 1 ] ) >>> txt u' < td class= " subtext " >< span id =" score_272314 " > 38 points </ span > by < a href="user?id=yangyang42" >yangyang42</a>
5 hours ago | < a href= " item?id=272314 " > 8 comments </a></td>' >>>
DATE_RE = re .
compile ( " (? P< qty >\d+ ) (? P< unit >\w + ) ago " ) >>>
DATE_RE . findall ( txt ) [ ( u ' 5 ' , u'hours ' ) ] >>> txt = DATE_RE . findall ( txt ) [ 0 ] >>> txt ( u ' 5 ' , u'hours ' ) >>> u " %s %s " % ( txt [ 0 ] , txt [ 1 ] ) u '5 hours '
Now lets combine this all into one extracting function :
>>> def extract_story ( data ) : ... d = {} ... d [ ' link ' ] = data [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] [ ' href ' ] ... d [ ' title ' ] = data [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string ... d [ ' score ' ] = data [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string ... d [ ' poster ' ] = data [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 1 ] . string ... d [ ' num_comments ' ] = int ( data [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 2 ] . string .
split ( " " ) [ 0 ] ) ... d [ ' time ' ] = " " . join ( data [ 1 ] .
contents [ - 2 ] . strip ( ) . split ( " " ) [ : 2 ] ) ... return d ... >>>
extract_story ( s ) {' title ' : u" The secret of the web ( hint : it 's a virtue ) " , ' poster ' : u'yangyang42 ' , ' time ' : u'5 hours ' , ' score ' : u'38 points ' , ' link ' : u'http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/08/the-secret-of-t.html', ' num_comments ' : 8}
There is only one slight flaw here , and that is when the number of comments for a story is zero , it has discuss displayed instead of 0 comments .
We can fix that up pretty quickly , and the improved function looks like this :
def extract_story ( s ) : d = {} d [ ' link ' ] = s [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] [ ' href ' ] d [ ' title ' ] = s [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string d [ ' score ' ] = s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string d [ ' poster ' ] = s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 1 ] . string try : d [ ' num_comments ' ] = int ( s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 2 ] . string .
split ( " " ) [ 0 ] ) except ValueError : d [ ' num_comments ' ] = 0 d [ ' time ' ] = " " . join ( s [ 1 ] .
contents [ - 2 ] . strip ( ) . split ( " " ) [ : 2 ] ) return d
A bit ugly , to be sure , but nothing too complex to understand .
Playing With The Data
Before we move on , lets take a look at how we can easily play with the data in its current form .
For example , we can rerank things by their number of comments :
>>> stories = [ extract_story ( x ) for x in stories ] >>> stories .
sort ( lambda a , b : cmp ( a [ ' num_comments ' ] , b [ ' num_comments ' ] ) ) >>> stories [ 0 ] [ ' num_comments ' ] 0 >>> stories [ - 1 ] [ ' num_comments ' ] 74 >>> stories . reverse ( ) >>> stories [ 0 ] {' title ' : u ' A Fundraising Survival Guide ' , ' poster ' : u'mqt ' , ' time ' : u '1 day ' , ' score ' : u'123 points ' , ' link ' : u'http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html', ' num_comments ' : 74} >>> stories [ 1 ] {' title ' : u' The Wrong Way to Get Noticed by YC ' , ' poster ' : u'matt1 ' , ' time ' : u '1 day ' , ' score ' : u'82 points ' , ' link ' : u'http://www.mattmazur.com/2008/08/the-wrong-way-to-get-noticed-by-yc/', ' num_comments ' : 49}
Or we could rank the posters using the highly proprietary PosterRank algorithm ( meaning , I just made it up , and its the the sum of the poster 's articles ' scores ) .
>>> posters = {} >>> for story in stories : ... score = getattr ( posters , story [ ' poster ' ] , 0 ) ... posters [ story [ ' poster ' ] ] = score + int ( story [ ' score ' ] . split ( " " ) [ 0 ] ) ... >>> posters { u' yangyang42 ' : 38 , u'ovi256 ' : 9 , u'epi0Bauqu ' : 32 , u'bootload ' : 11 , u'echair ' : 9 , u'matt1 ' : 82 , u'iamelgringo ' : 14 , u'prakash ' : 24 , u'gaika ' : 19 , u'ericb ' : 3 , u'pius ' : 106 , u'ml1234 ' : 30 , u'markbao ' : 26 , u'nickb ' : 5 , u'pauljonas ' : 20 , u'astrec ' : 22 , u'mqt ' : 123 , u'marvin ' : 3 , u'robg ' : 8 , u'jmorin007 ' : 39 , u' Anon84 ' : 2} >>> p = posters . items ( ) >>> p [ ( u'yangyang42 ' , 38 ) , ( u'ovi256 ' , 9 ) , ( u'epi0Bauqu ' , 32 ) , ( u' bootload ' , 11 ) , ( u'echair ' , 9 ) , ( u' matt1 ' , 82 ) , ( u' iamelgringo ' , 14 ) , ( u' prakash ' , 24 ) , ( u' gaika ' , 19 ) , ( u'ericb ' , 3 ) , ( u' pius ' , 106 ) , ( u'ml1234 ' , 30 ) , ( u' markbao ' , 26 ) , ( u'nickb ' , 5 ) , ( u' pauljonas ' , 20 ) , ( u'astrec ' , 22 ) , ( u'mqt ' , 123 ) , ( u' marvin ' , 3 ) , ( u'robg ' , 8 ) , ( u'jmorin007 ' , 39 ) , ( u' Anon84 ' , 2 ) ] >>> p . sort ( lambda a , b : cmp ( a [ 1 ] , b [ 1 ] ) ) >>> p [ ( u' Anon84 ' , 2) , ( u'ericb ' , 3 ) , ( u' marvin ' , 3 ) , ( u' nickb ' , 5 ) , ( u'robg ' , 8 ) , ( u'ovi256 ' , 9 ) , ( u'echair ' , 9 ) , ( u'bootload ' , 11 ) , ( u' iamelgringo ' , 14 ) , ( u' gaika ' , 19 ) , ( u' pauljonas ' , 20 ) , ( u'astrec ' , 22 ) , ( u' prakash ' , 24 ) , ( u' markbao ' , 26 ) , ( u'ml1234 ' , 30 ) , ( u'epi0Bauqu ' , 32 ) , ( u'yangyang42 ' , 38 ) , ( u'jmorin007 ' , 39 ) , ( u' matt1 ' , 82 ) , ( u' pius ' , 106 ) , ( u'mqt ' , 123 ) ] >>> p . reverse ( ) >>> len ( p ) 21 >>> p [ ( u'mqt ' , 123 ) , ( u' pius ' , 106 ) , ( u'matt1 ' , 82 ) , ( u'jmorin007 ' , 39 ) , ( u'yangyang42 ' , 38 ) , ( u'epi0Bauqu ' , 32 ) , ( u'ml1234 ' , 30 ) , ( u' markbao ' , 26 ) , ( u' prakash ' , 24 ) , ( u'astrec ' , 22 ) , ( u' pauljonas ' , 20 ) , ( u' gaika ' , 19 ) , ( u' iamelgringo ' , 14 ) , ( u' bootload ' , 11 ) , ( u'echair ' , 9 ) , ( u'ovi256 ' , 9 ) , ( u'robg ' , 8 ) , ( u' nickb ' , 5 ) , ( u' marvin ' , 3 ) , ( u'ericb ' , 3 ) , ( u' Anon84 ' , 2 ) ]
Looking at that data , of the thirty stories there are only twenty - one submitters , and mqt has the highest PosterRank score .
Certainly you could think of ( much ) more exciting things to do with the data , but the dictionary format makes it easy to play to your hearts content .
Caching , Caching , Caching
Now let 's backtrack a bit and look at how we can be more considerate about fetching pages .
Our first page fetching looked like this :
>>> import httplib2 >>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup >>> conn = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " ) >>> page = conn .
request ( u" http://news.ycombinator.com/ " , " GET " )
Lets create a helper function that handles those details for us .
import httplib2 from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup SCRAPING_CONN
= httplib .
Http ( " .cache " ) def fetch ( url , method = " GET " ) : return SCRAPING_CONN .
request ( url , method ) page = fetch ( " http://news.ycombinator.com/ " )
That does n't really improve things , but it opens the door for us to add some caching to our fetches .
import httplib2 , time from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup SCRAPING_CONN = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " ) SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR = 60 * 15 # cache for 15 minutes SCRAPING_CACHE = {} def fetch ( url , method = " GET " ) : key = ( url , method ) now = time .
time ( ) if SCRAPING_CACHE .
has_key ( key ) : data , cached_at = SCRAPING_CACHE ( key ) if now - cached_at < SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR : return data data = SCRAPING_CONN . request ( url , method ) SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] = ( data , now ) return data #
Fetch the page .
page = fetch ( " http://news.ycombinator.com/ " ) #
Fetch the page again , but use cached copy .
page = fetch ( " http://news.ycombinator.com/ " )
Now we 'll retrieve each individual page at most once every fifteen minutes , which will help cut down on us stressing the server2 .
Staggering Requests
Now , lets say we wanted to fetch the article that each story refers to .
Using our new fetch function thats pretty easy to do :
>>> pages = [ fetch ( x [ ' link ' ] ) for x in stories ]
Now , in this situation each of the stories will be on a different server , so staggering the request apart wo n't be terriably important , but lets imagine for a moment that they were all on the same server ( for example , if we wanted to fetch the comments page for each story ) .
We can modify the fetch function to be more considerate about its requests :
import httplib2 , time from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup SCRAPING_CONN = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " ) SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR = 60 * 15 # cache for 15 minutes SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
= 1.1 # in seconds SCRAPING_CACHE
= {} def fetch ( url , method = " GET " ) : key = ( url , method ) now = time .
time ( ) if SCRAPING_CACHE .
has_key ( key ) : data , cached_at = SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] if now - cached_at < SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR
: return data time .
sleep ( SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER ) data = SCRAPING_CONN . request ( url , method ) SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] = ( data , now ) return data
With that modification it'll return cached data as quickly as possible , but will stagger any new requests .
This is still a bit rough though , we really want to stagger requests by domain , not to stagger every single request .
import httplib2 , time , re from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup SCRAPING_CONN = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " ) SCRAPING_DOMAIN_RE
= re .
compile ( " \w+:/*(? P< domain >[ a - zA - Z0 - 9 . ] * ) / " ) SCRAPING_DOMAINS = {} SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR = 60 * 15 # cache for 15 minutes SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
= 1100 # in milliseconds SCRAPING_CACHE
= {} def fetch ( url , method = " GET " ) : key = ( url , method ) now = time .
time ( ) if SCRAPING_CACHE .
has_key ( key ) : data , cached_at = SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] if now - cached_at < SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR : return data domain = SCRAPING_DOMAIN_RE . findall ( url ) [ 0 ] if SCRAPING_DOMAINS . has_key ( domain ) : last_scraped = SCRAPING_DOMAINS
[ domain ] elapsed = now - last_scraped if elapsed < SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
: wait_period = ( SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
- elapsed ) / 1000 time .
sleep ( wait_period ) SCRAPING_DOMAINS
[ domain ] = time .
time ( ) data = SCRAPING_CONN . request ( url , method ) SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] = ( data , now ) return data
Now we have a convenient and compassionate fetch function written .
Now we can write the same barbaric code as before :
>>> pages = [ fetch ( x [ ' link ' ] ) for x in stories ]
And its no longer going to pound any servers , even if all the stories are located on the same domain .
Instead it'll sequentially download the stories , and will respect the 1.1 second pause between requests to the same domain .
This could be improved upon in a number of ways ( run the downloads in parallel , etc ) , but we 've created a nice foundation of a tool that we can use recklessly without inflicting our recklessness upon others .
Pulling the Code Together
Pulling the code that we 've written together we can write a simple and considerate script for displaying the top stories -- sorted by number of comments -- on HackerNews every five minutes , but that will only fetch the page at most once every fifteen minutes .
import httplib2 , time , re from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup SCRAPING_CONN = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " ) SCRAPING_DOMAIN_RE
= re .
compile ( " \w+:/*(? P< domain >[ a - zA - Z0 - 9 . ] * ) / " ) SCRAPING_DOMAINS = {} SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR = 60 * 15 # cache for 15 minutes SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
= 1100 # in milliseconds SCRAPING_CACHE
= {} def fetch ( url , method = " GET " ) : key = ( url , method ) now = time .
time ( ) if SCRAPING_CACHE .
has_key ( key ) : data , cached_at = SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] if now - cached_at < SCRAPING_CACHE_FOR : return data domain = SCRAPING_DOMAIN_RE . findall ( url ) [ 0 ] if SCRAPING_DOMAINS . has_key ( domain ) : last_scraped = SCRAPING_DOMAINS
[ domain ] elapsed = now - last_scraped if elapsed < SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
: wait_period = ( SCRAPING_REQUEST_STAGGER
- elapsed ) / 1000 time .
sleep ( wait_period ) SCRAPING_DOMAINS
[ domain ] = time .
time ( ) data = SCRAPING_CONN . request ( url , method ) SCRAPING_CACHE [ key ] = ( data , now ) return data def extract_story ( s ) : d = {} d [ ' link ' ] = s [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] [ ' href ' ] d [ ' title ' ] = s [ 0 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string d [ ' score ' ] = s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 0 ] . string d [ ' poster ' ] = s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 1 ] . string try : d [ ' num_comments ' ] = int ( s [ 1 ] . findChildren ( ) [ 2 ] . string .
split ( " " ) [ 0 ] ) except ValueError : d [ ' num_comments ' ] = 0 d [ ' time ' ] = " " . join ( s [ 1 ] .
contents [ - 2 ] . strip ( ) . split ( " " ) [ : 2 ] ) return d def fetch_stories ( ) : page = fetch ( u" http://news.ycombinator.com/ " ) soup = BeautifulSoup ( page [ 1 ] ) titles = [ x for x in soup .
findAll ( ' td ' , ' title ' ) if x . findChildren ( ) ] [ : - 1 ] subtexts = soup .
findAll ( ' td ' , ' subtext ' ) stories = [ extract_story ( s ) for s in zip ( titles , subtexts ) ] return stories while True : stories = fetch_stories ( ) stories .
sort ( lambda a , b : cmp ( a [ ' num_comments ' ] , b [ ' num_comments ' ] ) ) stories .
reverse ( ) for s in stories : print u " [ %s cmnts ] %s ( %s ) by %s , %s ago . " % ( s [ ' num_comments ' ] , s [ ' title ' ] , s [ ' link ' ] , s [ ' poster ' ] , s [ ' time ' ] ) print u "
" time .
sleep ( 60 * 5 )
If you enter that code into a Python interpreter , the output will look like this :
You can download a file containing the code here .
Sidenote about Httplib2
You probably noticed early on that we 're doing something cache related when we initialize our httplib2 .
Http object that we 're using for requests .
The initialization code looks like this :
import httplib2 SCRAPING_CONN = httplib2 .
Http ( " .cache " )
Whats happening there is that httplib2 understands http caching directives , and will locally cache and reuse the cached data if the server has the appropriate caching directives .
Thus there is an additional layer of caching underneath the caching layer that we wrote , and makes this stack even a bit friendler than what we 've put together ourselves .
Ending Thoughts
I feel pretty strongly that screen scraping someone 's website is like visiting their home : its not that hard to be considerate and polite , and the host will really appreciate it .
Hopefully this tutorial has given you some thoughts about other even more effective ways for reducing the load caused by your screen scraping .
Let me know if I 've made any mistakes , and I 'd be glad to hear any comments and thoughts on how you screen scrape responsibly .
I ’m happy the Professor is getting some recognition , but the interesting issues this piece raises are dropped as soon as they come up .
1 . The first issue that this article raises regards the status of public universities :
Auburn is a land - grant university : it became one in 1872 under a federal program geared toward helping the working class obtain practical college educations .
That mission continues largely to this day .
A public university with an annual tuition of less than $ 6,000 for Alabama residents , it accepts roughly 70 percent of those who apply .
Among its 20,000 undergraduates , business and engineering are the most popular majors .
When students choose liberal - arts majors , they tend to be the more practical ones — communications , criminology , psychology , prelaw … .
…. As he [ Jolley , Professor of Philosophy ] points out , the opening stanza of Auburn University ’s creed — “ I believe that this is a practical world and that I can count only on what I earn ” — conveys a certain kind of hostility to the world of ideas in which philosophy and for that matter the rest of the humanities plainly reside .
“ The creed is a fine document in many ways , ” he told me , “ but it reinforces a certain picture of what you ’re here for , and it can be very hard to break the grip of that with students . ” [ boldface added by me ]
Alright .
First question – if a university is devoted to things that are entirely practical , should it exist ?
“ I can count only on what I earn ? ”
That ’s openly anti-moral and unpatriotic in the extreme : it ’s Jack Nicholson ’s character ’s credo in The Departed .
If actually acted on , it promises to destroy civic life in this country once and for all for the sake of an individual ’s paranoia , much less his greed .
The entire Auburn creed can be seen as refuted by Plato ’s Hipparchus , where the basic requirements needed for commercial transactions – honesty , explicit law - abidingness , wisdom defined in terms of “ skills ” that can be bought – mark not only the acquirer of wealth but tyrannical rule .
Btw , I should say this : I do like Auburn , it has an awesome swimming program and if they can keep tuition that low , heck , I would have gone there .
But some traditions really are this thoughtless and need to be shown the door fast .
There is no way American life can continue if this is taken literally : either the contradictions in the creed will show the entire enterprise to be futile , and thus education to be worthless , or the parts that destroy morality will prove themselves supreme as they are held on an equal level with the parts that are simply empty moral rhetoric .
As we have discussed numerous times , education is anything but practical .
Real education approaches the useless even as it articulates a good – you do n’t “ use ” the highest good , after all .
2 . Of course , what ’s funny about practical endeavors is just how short - term they are .
You want a lasting good ?
You need people willing to work for it full - time , accept no pay , and search out other talent actively and unselfishly :
Jolley ’s early efforts to change the culture of the philosophy department at Auburn met with quite a bit of resistance from the university ’s administration .
Among other things , they rejected his requests for money for more upper - level philosophy classes .
Determined to build up Auburn ’s philosophy major , Jolley simply taught the courses himself , free of charge .
Many of Jolley ’s colleagues were similarly skeptical of what he was trying to do .
Several of them urged him to “ tone it down , ” he recalls , when they noticed the intimidating syllabus for his first class , the history of ancient philosophy , taped to the door of his office .
They advised Jolley against wasting his time trying to start a philosophy club at Auburn — the club now has about 30 members — and called his approach to teaching “ aristocratic . ”
In particular , they objected to the fact that he was grading students not on how well they learned philosophical terminology and definitions but on their ability to think philosophically .
Jolley gradually built allies within the department while at the same time looking to bring in like - minded professors .
He did n’t expect Auburn to be able to land top candidates , but he was convinced that a lot of talented young philosophers were slipping through the cracks , often because they had the misfortune of specializing in an especially popular area , or because they had been stigmatized for taking too long to finish their degrees .
( Jolley ’s latest hire , Arata Hamawaki , spent 18 years finishing his Ph.D. at Harvard . )
Auburn ’s philosophy department is now dominated by graduates of some of the nation ’s top philosophy programs .
The result you can already guess :
… it came as something of a surprise when , in the late ’90s , Auburn ’s college of liberal arts undertook an internal ranking of its dozen academic departments and philosophy came out on top .
The administration figured that there must have been a problem with the criteria it used , and a new formula was drawn up .
Once again , philosophy came in first .
This time , the administration decided to give up on the rankings altogether .
Why are practical endeavors trumped by theoretical ones this soundly ?
Part of me has always suspected Socrates ’ seeming knowledge of everything is some sort of joke – since he has knowledge of ignorance , and all men are ignorant in some way , he knows all men ’s natures and thus can comment on whatever they do rightfully .
When I ’m done the dissertation , I should have a more definite answer for you , but I suspect that Heidegger gets at the truth more directly when asserting that there are arts that a philosopher requires .
A good example of this is seen if we move one degree away from the philosopher , to the epic poet : Homer knowing everything is a major theme of several Socratic dialogues .
We know someone like Milton had his hands on multiple languages , mastery of diverse verse forms common to English and those languages , a working knowledge of the science of his day , was active politically and had read and understood Machiavelli .
All of that and more was required to make Paradise Lost , parts of which I think he dictated because he was literally blind then .
Practical endeavors have a definite end .
Theoretic ones probably demand more than any one person is capable of .
3 . I ’m making this article to be better than it is .
What set me off was this crap :
By any measure , Jolley has accomplished a great deal .
But in the service of what , exactly ?
During my stay at Auburn — and in our e-mail exchanges afterward — Jolley and I returned again and again to that very question .
Why does philosophy matter ?
Jolley could never seem to come up with a clear , settled explanation , and since clarity is a philosophical virtue , on one level this obviously bothered him .
Yet his failure to give a simple answer was , in a way , the best answer he could have given .
Philosophy is so much a part of how Jolley thinks , talks and writes that his attempts at an answer were themselves invariably philosophical , which is to say , aimed as much at exploring the assumptions behind the question as at answering it .
“ One reason it can seem so hard to see how philosophy relates to life is that we have often already decided that philosophy is thinking , not living , ” he once wrote me .
Explaining why philosophy matters , in other words , requires doing philosophy — the very thing the questioner wants explained .
I felt dumber after reading that , esp. when this was said above :
[ Jolley : ]
“ I am convinced that philosophy is not just about theory , ” he told me .
“ It ’s about a life well lived and thoughts truly thought . ”
The global economy faces a much more serious downturn than almost anyone has until now realised unless international governments take immediate co-ordinated action to deal with the credit crisis , the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday .
The IMF said it now believed the losses on US sub - prime assets and securities would ultimately total $ 1.45 trn ( £ 828bn ) , more than 50 per cent higher than its previous estimate of $ 945bn , and called for " a comprehensive set of measures that could arrest the currently destructive process " .
Britain , in particular , faces some of the worst fallout from the credit crunch , the IMF said , because it is particularly exposed to the problems of rapidly falling house prices and high personal indebtedness .
" With house prices falling rapidly , arrears and losses are likely to rise several times over , " it warned .
The IMF sounded the alert in its latest Global Financial Stability Report , which was published as it prepared for its annual meeting which begins in Washington today .
The body said the crisis which continues to jam up the world 's money markets was increasingly likely to lead to " severe and protracted economic downturns " around the world .
It was just these sorts of fears that haunted investors yesterday , and in the US there was another big sell - off in the stock market as it headed towards the close .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 508 points to 9,447 , taking its losses from five consecutive down - sessions to 13 per cent .
" Today 's report shows how serious a crisis we currently face , " Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF 's managing director , said .
" The time for piecemeal solutions is over – I therefore call on policymakers to urgently address the crisis at a national level with com-prehensive measures to restore confidence in the financial sector .
At the same time , national governments must closely co-ordinate efforts to bring about a return to stability in the international finance system . "
So far , however , such co-ordinated efforts have been relatively limited .
The Bank of England unveiled further injections of liquidity into the money markets yesterday in moves it said were timed to coincide with similar initiatives from other central banks , and Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , said that US interest rates could be reduced because " the combination of incoming data and recent financial developments suggests that the outlook for economic growth has worsened " .
However , the international response has been criticised for its lack of coherency .
Many economists believe a round of simultaneous interest rate cuts from central banks including the Bank of England , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are now necessary .
There has also been criticism of the infighting among members of the European Union over the extent to which savers should be given a legal guarantee about the security of their deposits .
The IMF warned that this sort of incoherency was likely to have devastating effects on the world economy .
" Co-ordination of early action to address problems should send a strong signal to boost market confidence and will also help avoid adverse effects that one country 's measures may have on others , or perverse incentives in international markets , " the IMF said .
" Without such co-ordination , the adjustment process is likely to be more painful and protracted , steps by individual institutions to defuse their own market pressures may spill over to other jurisdictions and concerns about inequitable burden sharing may prevent necessary and costly measures being taken . "
The scale of losses the IMF is now predicting from the credit crunch will shock many analysts given how dramatically it has risen since the body made its last forecast in April .
However , the IMF said house prices in the US had continued to fall heavily since that prediction was made .

W Magazine Features Angelina Jolie Breastfeeding Photos
graces the cover of W Magazine in a series of photos that were taken by her partner .
The pictures were captured in France , where the couple has been sequestered before and after the birth of their twins , Knox and Vivienne .
The issue will contain exclusive private photos of the 33 year old actress .
Angelina told W Magazine : " I do think I 'm in a good partnership now .... I think it just needed to be the right man .
It 's not just that I love being in Brad 's company , which obviously I do , but it's that we both roll up our sleeves and take on what we care about in the same way .
I have a lot of respect for him , and he helps me to be better and take on what we care about in the same way . "
The photos were taken in the backyard of the Chateau Miraval in mid August .

A German TV news show segment on YouTube is racing around the blogosphere .
Why ?
Because it is absolute proof that Hezbullah manipulates the media for their benefit .
Watch it , and be horrified , as you see “ Green Helmet Guy ” direct the taking of pictures of the victims of Qana .
The mainstream media insist they are far too savvy to fall for crude manipulation like this .
And yet , proof keeps coming up that that is exactly what is happening :
The media are falling utterly for all of the images coming out of Lebanon , and their critical thinking abilities are n’t even in gear .
Lame excuses are offered for serious breaches of editorial oversight .
When even the pictures of bodies being taken out of the rubble are turned into propaganda victories for Hezbullah , you have to wonder — how many pieces of rocket launchers and other evidence were removed from the sites of such bombings ?
This is standard operating procedure in the jihadi manuals .
That is not rhetoric .
We have their manuals on record , and there are whole sections that discuss the manipulation of the media .
And our media plays along , always .
A few days ago , the world press accused Israel of killing a child while going after terrorists .
Surprise — the palestinians lied .
Also Thursday , doctors said that a 5 - year - old Palestinian girl initially believed to have been killed by an Israeli military strike Wednesday apparently died after sustaining head injuries during a fall from a swing .
The girl suffered a fractured skull and there were no signs of shrapnel , said Kazim Abu Libda , a doctor at Gaza ’s Shifa Hospital .
Yasser Arafat learned his lesson well , and taught it to his successors .
He learned it at the feet of the Russians , who also had a field day manipulating world opinion against America and her allies whenever the choice was between them and the Soviet Union .
And they have the advantage in the fact that the average person does not like to engage critical thinking .
Skepticism is not incumbent on intelligence .
Some of the smartest people I know are absolutely unable to see beyond the surface of a situation that does not fit their worldview .
One of my closest friends falls for virtually all of the lies the palestinians have uttered , and when the truth contradicts her worldview , she simply shunts aside the facts for something that fits more closely to how she thinks the situation should be .
If I were to show her this video , no doubt her response would be , “ So? Israel still killed civilians . ”
Yes , she did .
By accident .
The bombs that dropped on that building in Qana were meant for Hezbullah rocket launchers that are threatening the civilian population of Israel .
Israeli civilians are dying , too , and yet there is no outrage from the UN .
I have been waiting daily to hear Kofi Annan express his profound sorrow at the deaths of innocent civilians in Israel .
He has finally broken his silence — to condemn civilian deaths in Gaza .
The message is clear .
Jewish lives have never counted for much in the history of the world , except to Jews .
Israeli lives — even Israeli Arab lives , apparently — do n’t muster a whit of sympathy from the world .
Part of it is due to the losses in the propaganda war .
Part of it is due to the hatred of Jews the world cannot seem to abandon .
But the effects would be lessened , I think , if the media did their jobs more thoroughly , and stopped playing into the enemy ’s hands by publishing their propaganda so readily , and so uncritically .
The Jihadis do n’t distinguish between combatants and civilians .
They have threatened journalists in Lebanon on more than one occasion .
I do n’t think they ’d hesitate to kill reporters , and if they did , I would n’t be at all surprised if they then put the body in a site hit by Israeli shelling .
And get Green Helmet Guy to direct the video .
This war has many fronts , and the propaganda front is not the least of them .
The Jihadis are winning .
Welcome , new readers .
