Three Myths of Viral Growth
Myth 1 : Viral Growth is Exponential Growth
Viral growth is n't exponential growth .
Your web product has a maximum audience , for example , but an exponential curve grows forever .
Instead viral growth follows a logistic curve .
The logistic curve comes from population biology where the growth of a population has an exponential component , e.g. , humans on average have 2.1 children each , but is dampened by competition for resources .
If the population is growing too fast eventually it reaches the limit where their environment can no longer support pure exponential growth .
This upper limit is called the carrying capacity .
Seth Godin misses this in his otherwise excellent Elephant Math essay .
He equates " perfect viral growth " with exponential growth , but no viral growth is exponential .
There are two variables at play : the rate of reproduction and the carrying capacity .
Sometimes the carrying capacity is obvious .
If you 're building a Facebook app the carrying capacity can't be any larger than the total size of Facebook , for example .
Other times you do n't know until you start feeling its effects .
This is what happens to every viral product , whether you like it or not .
Viral growth slows and you have to worry about retaining users rather than acquiring new ones .
If you do n't your product runs the risk of jumping the shark .
And here 's the kicker : the faster your app is growing the sooner you have to care about retention because you reach the carrying capacity much more quickly .
Myth 2 : Viral Growth is a Marketing Buzzword
Viral growth is n't a marketing buzzword , although I wo n't say marketers do n't occasionally misuse the word .
It has the potential to happen any time you 're in a situation where people can communicate .
In simple terms viral growth happens when a user comes across your product and recommends it to his friends .
If the average user recommends the product to more than one person you get viral growth .
What most people do n't understand is that viral growth is also a function of the viral substrate , or the underlying communication medium .
The easier it is to communicate with other people the more likely something is to go viral .
With modern technologies like email , Facebook , SMS , etc. , communication is virtually frictionless .
I could send an email to 1,000 people right now if I wanted , or text ten of my best friends simultaneously .
What 's more , these channels are actually easier to measure than word - of - mouth recommendations .
Instead marketers use vague terms like " word of mouth marketing . "
But every step in the viral process can and should be measured , and you should use mathematical models ( like the logistic growth curve , above ) to understand what is really happening .
Myth 3 : Viral Growth Can't be Engineered
Viral growth is one of many distribution strategies and that means it can be engineered .
Innovation in distribution might be boring , but it makes the difference between a K - Mart and a Wal - Mart .
Innovation in viral distribution means building and optimizing a viral loop .
Here is an example , taken from KISSMetrics ' Product Planner :
Simply put , your viral loop is the series of steps a user goes through before he invites his friends .
Each step in the loop costs you users .
Perhaps only 10 % of users click the " accept invitation " link , for example .
The efficiency of the funnel is the percentage of users who make it all the way through the funnel .
One of fundamental equations of viral growth is
k = e\cdot i
where " e " is the efficiency of your loop and " i " is the average number of invites per user .
k is the , or the average number of additional users each new user brings in .
If k > 1 you get viral growth .
Phrasing it like this makes " getting viral " into an optimization problem , one that you can A /B test .
Measure , Test , Repeat
Viral growth can be measured , tested , and modeled .
It 's not a fuzzy marketing term .
And if you can do it right you 'll have yourself a difficult - to - top distribution channel for your next product .
The Ministry of Defence has revealed it expects the cost of operations in Afghanistan to increase by 54.1 per cent next year .
A Commons report revealed the MoD was forecasting costs of £ 2.318 billion for 2008/09 , up from £ 1.505 billion in the previous 12 months .
According to the House of Defence Committee , much of the significant increase is attributable to the purchase of 700 armoured vehicles for Afghanistan operations .
In Iraq the MoD said operations would be down in cost by 4.1 per cent , but the committee says this does not tally with the anticipated withdrawal of UK troops in mid-2009 .
But committee chairman James Arbuthnot said he was recommending to the House that it accept the MoD 's funding requests .
" The investment being made in better facilities and equipment for our troops in Afghanistan is vital and we welcome it wholeheartedly .
We applaud the MoD for providing more information about these costs earlier in the financial year than it used to do , " he said .
" There has been real progress in this area , and the MoD has promised more improvements in the future .
However , the reasons for the increases and the magnitude of costs in general are still not transparent enough .
The MoD needs to provide a more coherent picture of what these costs really represent on the ground in future . "
This weekend the UK death - toll since operations began in Afghanistan rose to 132 with the deaths of Marine Damian Davies , Sergeant John Manuel , Corporal Marc Birch and Lance Corporal Steven Fellow .
Since the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , 178 UK servicemen and women have been killed in Iraq .

Last month , a California court awarded social networking giant Facebook US $ 873 million in damages arising from the activities of a single spamming organization .
The decision garnered headlines in Canada not only for the lofty award , but because of an important Canadian connection -- the spammer targeted in the lawsuit operates out of Montreal .
While Facebook acknowledges that it is unlikely to recover much of the awarded damages , the case has placed the spotlight on Canada 's ongoing failure to address its spam problem by introducing long overdue anti-spam legislation .
The fact that organizations are forced to use U.S. courts and laws to deal with Canadian spammers points to an inconvenient truth -- Canadian anti-spam laws are woefully inadequate and we are rapidly emerging as a haven for spammers eager exploit the weak legal framework .
Canada initially recognized the need to address the spam issue with formation in 2004 of a national task force on spam that included a broad cross-section of marketers , telecom companies and public policy groups ( I was a member of the task force ) .
The task force unanimously recommended that the government introduce anti-spam legislation .
Crooks target your inbox
Years later , the issue continues to languish on the legislative agenda .
Successive governments -- both Conservative and Liberal -- have failed to introduce legislation ( the notable exception is a private member 's bill introduced by Senator Yoine Goldstein earlier this year ) .
During this fall 's election campaign , the Conservatives promised to address the issue , yet a commitment to anti-spam legislation was missing from the recent speech from the throne that outlined the government 's forthcoming priorities .
The continuing delays are particularly problematic given the increasingly criminal nature of spam .
Once regarded as a mere nuisance , the recent flood of spam spoofing the Canada Revenue Agency that encouraged recipients to forward highly sensitive personal information highlights the very real dangers of identity theft that can result from spam activities .
The Facebook case is only the latest illustration that government inaction has had an impact .
Companies anxious to target Canadian - based spammers have been forced to turn to other countries to do the job , while international law enforcement investigations into criminal spam activities run the risk of stalling in Canada since authorities may lack the requisite investigatory powers .
Open season for spammers
As the only G - 7 country without anti-spam legislation , it was only a matter of time before spammers began to take advantage .
Cloudmark , a leading provider of anti-spam software , recently presented data on the origins of spam emanating from web - based e-mail providers such as Hotmail , Gmail , and Yahoo ! at an international anti-spam conference in Germany .
Its research indicates that the majority of e-mail -- often up to 80 per cent of traffic -- from these popular services is now spam and that Canada ranked fifth worldwide as the source of web - based e-mail spam , trailing only Iran , Nigeria , Kenya , and Israel .
Another recent study from California demonstrated how spammers profit from their activities by shifting the costs traditionally borne by marketers to the recipients of spam , namely Internet users .
Although many people immediately delete spam messages , the study found that spammers remain profitable even with very low response rates .
In light of its profit - making potential , no amount of anti-spam legislation will completely eliminate spam .
However , the experience to date in other countries has shown that tough new measures can reduce the amount of spam that originates from domestic sources .
Given the fact that there are still several major Canadian spamming organizations thriving under the current legal framework , the best way to reduce the amount of made - in - Canada spam is to change the law .

Price - slashing failed to rescue a bleak holiday season for beleaguered retailers , as sales plunged across most categories on shrinking consumer spending , according to new data released Thursday .
Despite a flurry of last - minute shoppers lured by the deep discounts , total retail sales , excluding automobiles , fell over the year - earlier period by 5.5 % in November and 8 % in December through Christmas Eve , according to MasterCard Inc. 's Spending Pulse unit .
When gasoline sales are excluded , the fall in overall retail sales is more modest : a 2.5 % drop in November and a 4 % decline in December .
A 40 % drop in gasoline prices over the year - earlier period contributed to the sharp decline in total sales .
But considering individual sectors , " This will go down as the one of the worst holiday sales seasons on record , " said Mary Delk , a director in the retail practice at consulting firm Deloitte LLP .
" Retailers went from ' Ho - ho ' to ' Uh - oh ' to ' Oh - no . ' "
The holiday retail - sales decline was much worse than the already - dire picture painted by industry forecasts , which had predicted sales ranging from a 1 % drop to a more optimistic increase of 2.2 % .
This article is like a third edition to “ Encrypted home in Ubuntu ( or Kubuntu … or Debian … ) ” , although I keep changing the name .
It ’s the 8.10 edition .
Many things changed and I updated the article for those , and the rest should work as well .
Motivation
Every day we put more and more personal information on our computers , and our computers become lighter , smaller , more mobile .
In other words , the importance of the information gets higher and the possibility of being loosed or stolen gets higher as well .
I think that if anyone gets a-hold of the information in my personal computer ( s ) he’d be able to impersonate me and make my life a mess .
That ’s why I like keeping all my information encrypted .
That is , I have a separate partition for / home and it is encrypted .
The level of security for this scheme is not very high and if you are a real paranoid you should be reading some other tutorials .
I am using just a pass - phrase for the encryption so I am susceptible to dictionary attacks , my swap is not encrypted , so some personal information would be available there .
But that ’s OK .
I am not trying to protect from the people with enough sophistication to perform the needed operations to retrieve that information .
Those are not many and they have other means .
My goal is to protect from the regular thieve or from loosing it … so I would mourn for some money being lost but I will sleep well at night .
Disclaimer : the information will be encrypted , you ’ll be able to access it with a key : a pass - phrase .
If you loose it , you wo n’t be able to access than information again , so , be careful and make backups .
Installation
You should install the operating system as you always do with a little detail : create the root partition , the swap partition and the home partition .
But do n’t assign any filesystem to the home partition , do not make or format it and do not set it as home .
After you did that you should be booting into a fresh system .
Be sure not to store any sensitive information now , because it ’ll be accessible to anyone .
Some thinks to take care , if you use a browser or some instant messaging client , do not make them save the password , if you can avoid typing the passwords at all , that will be better .
Once you got pass that you ’ll need two packages : cryptsetup and libpam - mount .
You can install them with a command like :
aptitude install cryptsetup libpam - mount
During installation , limpam - mount request to convert the previous configuration .
As we do n’t really have a previous configuration , I ’m not sure what it ’s going to convert so I just choose “ No ” ( the default ) and let it install a fresh configuration .
Partitioning
The encryption we are going to use works like this .
Linux puts a layer around a device and creates a new virtual device .
Whatever is written to this new virtual device is written to the real device but encrypted .
All this works at a very low level and it is called mapping .
There are other kind of mappings ( to perform other operations than encrypting … think for example as creating volumes of various partitions so they ’d be seen as one ) .
To create the mapping run :
sudo modprobe dm- crypt
sudo cryptsetup -- verbose --verify - passphrase luksFormat /dev/sda6
replacing / dev/sda6 with your particular ( real ) device .
A bit more about that command .
cryptsetup is a program to create this encryption mappings .
–- verbose is there because I like to see a lot of useless data and feel more geeky .
–- verify - passphrase is there to be asked twice for the pass - phrase , so we do n’t insert a wrong pass - phrase by accident .
luksFormat is the action .
luks is a new system that lets us have more than one password , change passwords , add passwords , etc to some encrypted device .
Very handy .
A complete execution of that command will look like :
sudo cryptsetup -- verbose --verify - passphrase luksFormat / dev/sda6 WARNING !
========
This will overwrite data on / dev/sda6 irrevocably .
Are you sure ?
( Type uppercase yes ) : YES Enter LUKS passphrase : Verify passphrase : Command successful .
The new partition
This new system , luks , also let us inspect what is in a luks - formatted partition .
It works like this :
sudo cryptsetup luksDump / dev/sda6 LUKS header information for / dev/sda6 Version : 1 Cipher name : aes Cipher mode : cbc-essiv: sha256
Hash spec : sha1 Payload offset : 1032 MK bits : 128 MK digest : ff c3 22 a1 d1 fe 5e e4 e3 37 26 a7 8e 93 43 22 fa 83 c5 91 MK salt : 27 59 46 c5 f2 21 5a 93 46 eb 2a cf 80 f1 46 95 b6 05 79 02 55 a4 49 33 87 d1 25 ae 49 74 40 b6 MK iterations : 10 UUID : 819cf83a-7c9b-49b8-9b74-e0d952aa1234 Key Slot 0 : ENABLED Iterations : 208350 Salt : be 31 c7 e3 c9 a8 d5 37 09 12 34 e2 4a 3f a3 85 e0 fd bc 1e e4 3a fb d6 70 7 c 7f 12 34 1a 6d 8e 43 Key material offset : 8 AF stripes : 4000 Key Slot 1 : DISABLED Key Slot 2 : DISABLED Key Slot 3 : DISABLED Key Slot 4 : DISABLED Key Slot 5 : DISABLED Key Slot 6 : DISABLED Key Slot 7 : DISABLED
Lot ’s of nice information , do n’t you feel super - geek ?
You can see there that you have 8 spaces for pass - phrases , you have 8 slots of which you are using one , the 0 .
To be able to access the encrypted partition you have to open it … and to do it you ’ll need a key of course ( your pass - phrase ) .
We ’ll see the mappings on / dev / mapper / , which should be empty by now ( except for a control file …
I would n’t name a mapping control , just in case ) :
ls / dev/ mapper / control
Ok !
Now open it :
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen / dev/sda6 home Enter LUKS passphrase : key slot 0 unlocked .
Command successful .
Great !
We have opened it .
The last parameter , “ home ” , is the name of the mapping .
Let ’s take a look at the mappings :
ls / dev/ mapper / control home
Good .
This device file is like a partition itself .
So , we ’ll make a file - system in there in the same way you ’d make it in sda6 ( from now on , do n’t do anything with sda6 except opening and other luks operations , your partition is / dev/ mapper / home now ) .
In my case I ’ve picked ReiserFS , but you can use whatever you want :
sudo mkfs.reiserfs -l home / dev/ mapper / home ... lot 's of geeky output ...
ReiserFS is successfully created on / dev / mapper / home .
and we are done .
We can mount it :
sudo mount / dev/ mapper / home / media
copy the current data ( the home of a user and a couple of files ) :
sudo cp - a /home /* / media / cp : ne povas trovi stato - informon pri '/home/pupeno/.gvfs ' : Permeso rifuzita
If you do n’t speak the international language , that mean : “ cp : cannot stat `/home / pupeno/.gvfs ’ : Permission denied ” .
Everything seems to be OK anyway .
Un - mount it :
sudo umount / media /
and close it :
sudo cryptsetup luksClose home
Automagically mounting
There are various ways to open and mount the encrypted file - system but after trying many different ones , this is the best one from my point of view .
I like that it is not intrusive : when you log in , your user password will be used to open the file - system and it ’ll be mounted automatically .
Of course , then , the password of your user should match the pass - phrase in at least one of the slots of the encrypted device .
You need to modify / etc / pam.d / common - auth adding , at the end :
@include common- pammount
And /etc / pam.d / common-session to add that same line .
In /etc/ security / pam_mount.conf.xml , around line 107 you have a list of “ Linux encrypted home directory examples ” , since what we are going to do is related to that it makes sense to put these lines after that comment ( around line 183 ) :
Of course replace “ pupeno ” with your username and “ / dev/sda6 ” with your device .
And that is the line that will make the magical mount happen .
Now just try it .
It is very simple , log out , log in again and that ’s it .
You should have you newly super - encrypted home partition mounted .
To check it out issue a mount command and among a huge amount of cryptic information you should see :
/dev/mapper/_dev_sda6 on / home type reiserfs ( rw )
You can also list the files on / dev / mapper to find the _dev_sd a6 mapping .
And that ’s it , it was n’t so hard , was it ?
More users , more pass - phrases
If there are more users add more lines to /etc/ security / pam_mount.conf.xml , I have n’t tested it but it should work .
Also just add more pass - phrases to the device using cryptsetup in this way :
sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda6
It ’ll ask you for a current pass - phrase as well .
This is also useful if you are changing pass - phrases , while you work on remembering the new one , do n’t delete the old one , so if you forget the new one you should still be able to access your information with the old one .
After you are confident of the new one , you can delete the old one with :
sudo cryptsetup luksDelKey / dev/sda6 0
where “ 0 ” is the slot where you have your old pass - phrase ( hint : use luksDump ) .
And here I want to remind you that if you lost the password you wo n’t be able to access the information .
There ’s no password recovery here : it is gone , forever , as scrambled , processed and destroyed as the dinner of Tuesday of the last week .
Be very careful and always make backups .
We have tracked for sev­er­al years the sci­en­tif­ic stud­ies pub­lished by Torkel Kling­berg and col­leagues , often won­der­ing aloud , “ when will edu­ca­tors , health pro­fes­sion­als , exec­u­tives and main­stream soci­ety come to appre­ci­ate the poten­tial we have in front of us to enhance our brains and improve our cog­ni­tive func­tions ? ”
Dr. Kling­berg has just pub­lished a very stim­u­lat­ing pop­u­lar sci­ence book , The Over­flow­ing Brain , that should help in pre­cise­ly that direc­tion .

Research and Tools to Thrive in the Cog­ni­tive Age
By Dr. Torkel Kling­berg
Do we all have atten­tion deficits ?
The infor­ma­tion age has pro­vid­ed us with high tech­nol­o­gy which fills our days with an ever increas­ing amount of infor­ma­tion and dis­trac­tion .
We are con­stant­ly flood­ed with on - the - go emails , phone calls , adver­tise­ments and text - mes­sages and we try to cope with the increas­ing pace by mul­ti task­ing .
A sur­vey of work­places in the Unit­ed States found that the per­son­nel were inter­rupt­ed and dis­tract­ed rough­ly every three min­utes and that peo­ple work­ing on a com­put­er had on aver­age eight win­dows open at the same time .
There is no ten­den­cy for this to slow down ; the amount and com­plex­i­ty of infor­ma­tion con­tin­u­al­ly increas­es
The most press­ing con­cerns with this envi­ron­ment are : how do we deal with the dai­ly influx of infor­ma­tion that our inun­dat­ed men­tal capac­i­ties are faced with ?
At what point does our stone - age brain become insuf­fi­cient ?
Will we be able to train our brains effec­tive­ly to increase brain capac­i­ty in order to stay in - step with our inex­orable lifestyles ?
Or will we be strick­en with atten­tion deficits because of brain over­load ?
In his arti­cle “ Over­loaded Cir­cuits : Why Smart Peo­ple Under­per­form , psy­chi­a­trist Edward Hal­low­ell coins the term “ atten­tion deficit trait ” to char­ac­ter­ize the sit­u­a­tion in which so many of us find our­selves .
This is not a new diag­no­sis of any use to doc­tors , but rather a descrip­tion of the men­tal state that infor­ma­tion tech­nol­o­gy , a faster pace , and chang­ing work pat­terns have induced .
Some would call it a lifestyle .
The point of Hal­low­ell ’s term is that it illus­trates how the mod­ern work sit­u­a­tion , with its pace and simul­ta­ne­ous demands , often gives us the feel­ing of hav­ing atten­tion dif­fi­cul­ties and of not quite hav­ing the capac­i­ty to do our jobs .
Our brains are being flood­ed .
But is it real­ly the case that the infor­ma­tion soci­ety gen­er­al­ly impairs peo­ples ’ atten­tion­al abil­i­ties ?
What are atten­tion­al abil­i­ties , any­way , and exact­ly what in our com­plex work sit­u­a­tions is men­tal­ly demand­ing ?
Cog­ni­tive Demands in the Infor­ma­tion Age
In my book “ The Over­flow­ing Brain : Infor­ma­tion Over­load and the Lim­its of Work­ing Mem­o­ry I try to pin­point the nature of the cog­ni­tive demands of mod­ern life and the psy­cho­log­i­cal and neur­al basis of our capac­i­ty lim­i­ta­tions .
One demand fac­tor in our work­ing lives is the inces­sant dis­trac­tions : all the impres­sions that buzz around us like mos­qui­toes and make it hard for us to con­cen­trate on what we ’re doing .
The tor­rent of infor­ma­tion increas­es not only the vol­ume of data we ’re expect­ed to take in but also the vol­ume we need to shut out .
Anoth­er impor­tant demand fac­tor is mul­ti­task­ing , which is the quick and easy solu­tion for all those who want to get more done in less time .
How­ev­er , doing ( or at least try­ing to do ) sev­er­al tasks simul­ta­ne­ous­ly is one of our most demand­ing every­day activ­i­ties .
Run­ning on a tread­mill while watch­ing TV usu­al­ly is n’t too tax­ing , nor is chew­ing gum while walk­ing in a straight line .
But even such a mun­dane sit­u­a­tion as talk­ing on a cell phone while dri­ving is not as easy as we ’d like to think .
Apart from the fact that its dif­fi­cult to hold the wheel and shift gears with the same hand , or to keep our eyes on the road and on the phone ’s dis­play at the same time , there ’s some­thing in the men­tal­ly demand­ing task of tele­phon­ing that makes us worse dri­vers .
Infor­ma­tion over­load , dis­trac­tions and mul­ti­task­ing are prob­a­bly the most impor­tant fac­tors in mak­ing the infor­ma­tion age so cog­ni­tive­ly demand­ing are .
The Role of Work­ing Mem­o­ry : chal­lenges and oppor­tu­ni­ties
There are plen­ty of indi­ca­tions that those three fac­tors are load­ing on our work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty , which is our capac­i­ty to hold on to rel­e­vant infor­ma­tion for short peri­ods of time .
The prob­lem is that our work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty is a scarce resource .
The increase in infor­ma­tion load thus meets a bio­log­i­cal con­straint in how much we can han­dle .
A ques­tion that has always fas­ci­nat­ed me is how this capac­i­ty con­straint is wired in our brain , and if we can in some way increase this capac­i­ty , and this ques­tion is a thread that I fol­low through­out the book .
In the research that my col­leagues and I have done at the Karolin­s­ka Insti­tute in Stock­holm , we have shown that train­ing on work­ing mem­o­ry tasks , close or above the lim­it of our capac­i­ty , can improve our work­ing mem­o­ry .
This improve­ment is not only con­fined to the trained tasks , but gen­er­al­izes to oth­er cog­ni­tive tasks requir­ing work­ing mem­o­ry and con­trol of atten­tion .
We have also shown that this train­ing improves the abil­i­ty to focus in every­day life .
The work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty lim­i­ta­tion is not immutable , but actu­al­ly pos­si­ble to stretch .
Fur­ther­more , it is pos­si­ble that the increas­ing infor­ma­tion load not only is harm­less , but might actu­al­ly improve our cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties through improve­ment of work­ing mem­o­ry .
The now well known Fly­nn effect tells us that flu­id intel­li­gence is increas­ing , pre­sum­ably due to envi­ron­men­tal demands on cog­ni­tion .
The most impor­tant cog­ni­tive demands of mod­ern life relates to work­ing mem­o­ry , and the most impor­tant cog­ni­tive func­tion under­ly­ing flu­id intel­li­gence is work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty .
The way envi­ron­men­tal demands improves flu­id intel­li­gence might thus be through improve­ment on work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty .
In oth­er words , mod­ern life itself may help make us more cog­ni­tive­ly able .
And emerg­ing tools may enhance our abil­i­ties and bet­ter pre­pare us for the demands of the Infor­ma­tion Age .
Reflec­tions for the Future
Train­ing our brains might thus be a way to keep up with the increas­ing demands of the infor­ma­tion age .
This might be espe­cial­ly rel­e­vant for those of us that are over 25 years of age , when work­ing mem­o­ry capac­i­ty starts to decline year by year , at the same time as the demands increase .
In my book I , half jok­ing­ly , sug­gest­ed that in the future we might see com­pa­ny - fund­ed cog­ni­tive fit­ness train­ing for employ­ees .
It was with a cer­tain sat­is­fac­tion that I recent­ly read in Sharp­Brains blog about a new ini­tia­tive by the USA Ice Hock­ey league to pro­vide com­put­er­ized cog­ni­tive train­ing ‑focused on impor­tant per­cep­tion and deci­sion - mak­ing skills - to its play­ers .
In the future we might be as aware of cog­ni­tive func­tion as we know are obsessed with calo­ries , diets , glycemic index and car­dio­vas­cu­lar train­ing , and brain train­ing might be a part of our every day life .

Advertisement Amnesty International has accused Israel of using white phosphorus in civilian areas of the Gaza Strip .
The substance can kill or cause serious injuries by burning through skin , and it is banned near civilians .
Armies may use it to create smoke screens .
The UN and Human Rights Watch have already accused the Israeli army of firing white phosphorus shells in Gaza .
Israel has said all the weapons it used in its three - week offensive in Gaza were permitted by international law .
Amnesty said a fact - finding team found " indisputable evidence of the widespread use of white phosphorus " in crowded residential areas of Gaza City and elsewhere in the territory .
" Yesterday , we saw streets and alleyways littered with evidence of the use of white phosphorus , including still - burning wedges and the remnants of the shells and canisters fired by the Israeli army , " said Christopher Cobb - Smith , a weapons expert with the Amnesty team in Gaza .
' Unusual burns '
The Amnesty group said one of the places worst - affected by white phosphorus was the UN Relief and Works Agency ( Unrwa ) compound in Gaza City .
WHITE PHOSPHORUS CLAIMS
UN accuses Israel over phosphorus Israel denies banned weapons use Israeli shell fire set the compound on fire on 15 January , burning stocks of food and other humanitarian supplies in a warehouse and coming close to stocks of fuel .
The head of Unrwa in Gaza , John Ging , said at the time that " three rounds that emitted phosphorus " hit the compound .
The Israeli military said it had come under fire from Palestinian fighters inside the compound and had fired back .
Human Rights
Watch also said it observed " dozens and dozens " of white phosphorus shells being fired by Israel at the Gaza Strip .
Palestinian medical officials have also said that large numbers of casualties with unusual burns , possibly consistent with exposure to white phosphorus , had been treated at Gaza Strip hospitals .
White phosphorus sticks to human skin and will burn right through to the bone , causing death or leaving survivors with painful wounds which are slow to heal .
Its ingestion or inhalation can also be fatal .

The secret is out for one of the world 's most recognizable lingerie brands , according to a potential class action lawsuit in which consumers claim they 've experienced very uncomfortable symptoms , like rashes , hives and permanent scarring from Victoria 's Secret bras .
" I had the welts ... very red , hot to the touch , extremely inflamed , blistery .
It itched profusely , " said Roberta Ritter , who describes herself as a longtime Victoria 's Secret shopper .
" I could n't sleep , waking up itching .
" I was just utterly sick , " she added .
Ritter , 37 , filed a lawsuit against the company May 14 in relation to the Angels Secret Embrace and Very Sexy Extreme Me Push - Up bras she said she purchased .
But the Ohio resident is n't alone in her complaint .
Her lawyers said dozens of other women have contacted them with similar claims involving a number of the intimate brand 's collections .
Many seek to be a part of the potential class action lawsuit .
" I was floored .
I thought , ' I have to come out with this .
The can of worms has to be opened because it's not just me , it 's other people as well , ' " Ritter said .
The medical Web site medhelp.org also features numerous complaints against the underwear company .
" I , too , had an awful itchy , red splotchy rash from the Secret Embrace bras , " one poster complained .
Victoria 's Secret 's Response
A Victoria 's Secret spokesperson admitted the company had received direct complaints from customers , but added the bras remain on store shelves .
The company said it is investigating complaints and released a statement that said , " We are sorry that a small number of people have had an issue and we want to help them determine the cause .
" Customer safety and satisfaction are always our primary concerns and we take seriously any issues our customers may have with our products , " the statement continued .
Moving Forward
The firm representing Ritter has done some investigating of its own .
The firm said it purchased the same bra types named in the suit from Victoria 's Secret and sent them to a lab .
It said the bras tested positive for the chemical formaldehyde .
But , Victoria 's Secret denied the accusation .
" We have strict quality controls around our products , and we do not use formaldehyde in our bras , " the company said in a statement .
But Ritter 's attorney said somehow the chemical is making its way into the bras .
" It may not be something that they 're specifying to put in their bra , but somehow it 's making its way into the manufacturing process because it was certainly present , " said attorney Dawn Chmielewski of Climaco , Lefkowitz , Peca , Wilcox & Garofoli Co. , L.P.A .
And though Ritter 's bra has not been tested , she said her doctor diagnosed her with an allergic reaction that could have been caused by formaldehyde .
" It 's not something you think about every day when you grab your underclothes , when you put them on , but it 's woken me up , and I just hope to wake people up to the reality that it can happen , " she said .
The class action paperwork already has been filed , but a judge wo n't decide until May if enough evidence exists to move the case forward .
Dozens of women are seeking compensation for medical bills and suffering as part of the claim .
This is n't the first time a consumer has sued Victoria 's Secret .
In June , a Los Angeles woman went after the retailer , claiming a thong malfunction injured her .
She is seeking unspecified damages and the case has yet to be resolved .
Editor 's Note : After this story was reported on Tuesday , Nov. 11 , " Good Morning America " was contacted by the trade group representing formaldehyde manufacturers with a response .
Read that response below and visit The Formaldehyde Council 's web site by clicking here .
Response From The Formaldehyde Council :
As the leading resource for information about formaldehyde we would like to offer a few additional points that might benefit viewers .
First , synthetic materials used to make clothing -- such as the bras in the story -- are not treated with any products derived from formaldehyde .
It 's even harder to imagine that the bras were inadvertently contacted with formaldehyde -- that 's because it quickly dissipates in air , water and sunlight .
It 's telling that the plaintiff 's lawyers have n't released their lab test specifics -- especially since false positives for formaldehyde are common in trace amounts .
But if the plaintiff and her doctor are concerned that she had an allergic reaction to formaldehyde , as the story indicates , there 's an easy way to find out .
Doctors typically give a simple , harmless allergy patch test to determine the precise cause of a reaction .
According to the public court documents in the case , plaintiff has inexplicably refused to take that test .
When serious health accusations are made publicly , journalists have an extra duty to apply verification and skepticism about the claims .
A story involving the Victoria 's Secret brand may have a certain sex appeal but viewers deserve to know that the claims made by the source are unproven , untested , and highly implausible .

Mr Shriteh said the more immediate threat was from Hamas , who would lure the ambulances into the heart of a battle to transport fighters to safety .
" After the first week , at night time , there was a call for a house in Jabaliya .
I got to the house and there was lots of shooting and explosions all around , " he said .
Because of the urgency of the call , Mr Shriteh said there was no time to arrange his movements with the IDF .
" I knew the Israelis were watching me because I could see the red laser beam in the ambulance and on me , on my body , " he said .
Getting out of the ambulance and entering the house , he saw there were three Hamas fighters taking cover inside .
One half of the building had already been destroyed .
" They were very scared , and very nervous …
They dropped their weapons and ordered me to get them out , to put them in the ambulance and take them away .
I refused , because if the IDF sees me doing this I am finished , I can not pick up any more wounded people .
" And then one of the fighters picked up a gun and held it to my head , to force me .
I still refused , and then they allowed me to leave . "
Mr Shriteh says Hamas made several attempts to hijack the al - Quds Hospital 's fleet of ambulances during the war .
" You hear when they are coming .
People ring to tell you .
So we had to get in all the ambulances and make the illusion of an emergency and only come back when they had gone . "
Eyad al - Bayary , 32 , lost his job as a senior nurse at the Shifa Hospital , the largest in Gaza City , about six months ago because he is closely identified with Fatah , the rival political movement of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Twice last year Mr Bayary was arrested by Hamas , and once he was jailed for six days for flying the Fatah flag above his house in Jabaliya .
He now works part - time as an English teacher at al - Azhar University .
" After the first day of the war , I go to the hospital to work , to help , but I was told to go away .
They tell me ' you are not needed here ' and they push me away , " Mr Bayary said .
Since the ceasefire was declared on January 17 , Hamas has begun to systematically take revenge on anyone believed to have collaborated with Israel before the war .
Israel makes no secret of the fact that it has a network of informants inside Gaza who regularly provide information on where Hamas leaders live , where weapons are being stored and other details that formed an important part of Israel 's battle plan .
According to rumour , a number of alleged collaborators have already been executed .
Taher al - Nono , the Hamas government 's spokesman in Gaza , told the Herald that 175 people had been arrested so far on suspicion of collaborating .
" They will be dealt with by the court and the judge and we will respect the judge 's decision , " Mr Nono said .
And if the sentence is death ?
" We will respect the decision . "
But the breakdown between Hamas and Fatah over the last 18 months did not prevent some co-operation between the two sides during the war .
The commander of one al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade unit - the brigades are a coalition of secular militia groups which operate under the loose umbrella of Fatah - said the real enemy remains Israel .
The unit commander , who used the name Abu Ibrahim , invited the Herald into his home .
On the wall of his lounge room hung the portraits of George Habash , who founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , a communist paramilitary organisation , and Abu Ali Mustafa , the man who succeeded Habash as leader of the PFLP and who was killed by Israeli forces in 2001 .
" Of course we fought together with Hamas because we all have the same aim : to liberate our homeland , " he said .
With his two - year old daughter on his knee , Mr Ibrahim , 30 , said he would never accept peace or negotiation , even if it might lead to the creation of a Palestinian state .
" I believe in the existence of Israel because it exists on my land - but the war with Israel will only end when I liberate all of my land .
This last war with Israel was not the first war , and it will not be the last . "
Rebuilding the Strip GAZA CITY : Hamas will begin a big reconstruction effort in the Gaza Strip today as the territory 's 1.5 million people start to recover from the devastating three - week war with Israel that claimed more than 1300 lives and destroyed thousands of buildings , factories and farms .
Life was beginning to return to a relative state of normality yesterday , with schools , universities and businesses back open .
But with most government buildings destroyed during the war , and piles of concrete rubble on street corners , Gazans face a huge effort to return the Strip to the impoverished state that existed before the war began .
Thousands of Gazans who lost their homes are still living in temporary accommodation provided in United Nations Relief and Works Agency schools , and electricity is being rationed , with homes receiving power for just a few hours a day .
A Hamas spokesman in Gaza , Ayman Taha , said his organisation would observe a truce with Israel for 18 months on the condition all the crossing points with Israel were opened .
With Hamas 's popularity apparently plummeting in as a result of the war , the movement 's leadership is using financial handouts to boost morale .
Hamas leaders from Gaza and Damascus , Syria , travelled to Cairo yesterday to meet Egyptian intelligence leaders and leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation for talks aimed at resolving Hamas 's dispute with the Fatah movement of the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
In Israel the appointment of George Mitchell as special envoy of the US President , Barack Obama , to the Middle East has met with caution and suspicion .
Israeli Foreign Ministry officials were scrambling to put together a brief for Mr Mitchell , who is due to visit Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah this week , as well as Egypt and Jordan .
Israeli officials believe Mr Mitchell 's first step will be to recommend the " road map for peace " plan announced by the former president George Bush in 2002 be extended .
Israelis have also begun to turn their attention to the general elections on February 10 .
With polls indicating the right - wing Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu is on track to return to the Prime Minister 's office he occupied in 1996 , the centrist Kadima Party leader , Tzipi Livni , warned yesterday that if the far - right won government it would lead to an inevitable rift with the US .
Comprehension consistency at last in Python 3.0 !
Date : 4 December 2008 Tags : computing , python
A new era is begun : Python 3.0 has been released , bringing the bright and burning lights of reason , consistency , and symmetry to bear on my favorite language .
Guido van Rossum , the creator of Python , has carefully guided this final attempt to remove the warts that have accumulated over the language 's 17 - year lifetime , and the result is magical .
Python 3.0 ( r30 : 67503 , Dec 4 2008 , 10 : 23 : 44 ) [ GCC 4.3 . 2 ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> >>> [ n * n for n in range ( 5 ) ] [ 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 ] >>> >>> { n * n for n in range ( 5 ) } { 0 , 1 , 4 , 16 , 9 } >>> >>> { n : n * n for n in range ( 5 ) } { 0 : 0 , 1 : 1 , 2 : 4 , 3 : 9 , 4 : 16 }
Magnificence !
Do you feel the waves of beauty crashing over you ?
No , no , not over the sequence of squares — over the fact that all three basic collection types now support comprehensions !
Comprehensions were first introduced in Python 2.0 , but with the terribly awkward stipulation that they were only possible for lists , not for dictionaries .
This meant teaching newcomers to the language that list construction was a special case , and that the collections that had deserved their own constructor syntax ( lists and dictionaries , at that time ; sets came later ) were not equally powerful .
It also made necessary the awkward and expensive technique of building , and then immediately discarding , a list of tuples to quickly construct dictionaries :
Python 2.5 . 2 ( r252 : 60911 , Nov 14 2008 , 19 : 46 : 32 ) [ GCC 4.3 . 2 ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> >>> dict ( [ ( n , n * n ) for n in range ( 5 ) ] ) { 0 : 0 , 1 : 1 , 2 : 4 , 3 : 9 , 4 : 16 }
The arrival of generator expressions in 2.4 did , at least , allow us to remove the ugly square brackets and avoid creating the list ( though all of the tuples still got created then immediately discarded ) .
But the problem remained that dictionaries made from inline generators did not look like dictionaries syntactically .
But , no more !
They have even updated the scandalously withdrawn PEP 274 to announce that the feature has finally arrived .
After the aching and painful years of the Python 2 series , the language once again shines bright and clear as a model of clever symmetries and low mental impedance .
Python 's famously tight " feature set " can , now more easily than ever , fit comfortably into the programmer 's brain .
What shall I write first in Python 3.0 ?
I wonder .
But you can be sure that my code will find lots of excuses for constructing dictionaries .

Though his son says he “ doodles ” every day , Leonard Cohen is only now opening his visual archives to the public
Sometime this morning , with dawn just a faint eastern glow , Leonard Cohen made himself a pot of coffee .
And once the coffee was done , he took his mug to a favourite table , sat down in front of a notepad or sketchbook or computerized drawing tablet , and began to make art , as he does every day .
Cohen , of course , is one of Canada ’s most revered songwriters .
Those with longer cultural memories will also know him as a novelist and poet of considerable consequence .
But over the past few months , with exhibitions in Manchester , Toronto , and now Vancouver , another side of this iconic figure has begun to emerge : the visual artist .
Cohen has often provided his own album artwork , but it ’s only now , in his 74th year , that he ’s opening his visual archives to the public .
And while revelations are few — his art is essentially a sympathetic commentary on the songs , and the life , that we already know — the pleasure he takes in drawing is readily apparent .
No one ’s taking this body of work too seriously .
Even Adam Cohen , Leonard ’s son and the de facto curator of Leonard Cohen Artworks , which runs at Linda Lando Fine Art from Friday ( December 5 ) until December 31 , is unwilling to paint his dad as a multimedia genius .
Yet , as Adam points out in a phone call from his Los Angeles home , the same qualities that animate Leonard Cohen ’s songs — warmth , colour , immediacy , and sharp observation — are present in his visual art .
“ My father ’s really just doodling , ” he says frankly .
“ But even when he ’s doing the equivalent of verbal doodling , at the dinner table , it ’s often wonderful or humorous or poignant or elegant .
So I think it ’s a high compliment to say that someone who is appearing to make little effort creates such powerful evocations — and one that I have no problem dispensing on my father , because he really is one of those characters who , with seemingly little effort , can dazzle . ”
The women in his life are regularly featured in Cohen senior ’s drawings , and he has an affinity for brightly coloured depictions of domestic interiors .
But it ’s arguable that Leonard ’s favourite subject is his own characterful face , with its strong features , hooded eyes , and deeply folded seams .
“ He ’s done hundreds of self - portraits , ” Adam explains .
“ He started them when he was on a trip to India , and he would do one every morning , both as an exercise and to combat whatever difficulty he was having in blackening pages the way he wanted to .
And like the rest of us , he realized that if he was going to make himself the protagonist on paper , it was going to have the maximum effect , and humour , if he was n’t making himself look like Clark Gable . ”
The self - portraits show that Cohen shares some traits with another part - time illustrator , John Lennon , and it ’s not surprising that the late Beatle ’s widow , Yoko Ono , was one of the first to argue that Leonard should go public with his art .
Cohen ’s fellow Buddhist Philip Glass is another supporter , having composed music to accompany giant projections of his friend ’s drawings .
But it ’s not only friendship that prompts their appreciation :
Cohen ’s best pieces can stand comparison to the visual artists whose work has inspired him .
“ I know he ’s a big fan of [ Henri ] Matisse , and he always has been , ” says Adam .
“ In fact , a couple of years ago ” ˜Dance Me to the End of Love ’ was turned into a book where Matisse drawings were attached to almost each sentence of the song .
It ’s a terrific and beautiful book — the elegance and the whimsy of my father ’s writing and the drawings and pictures and paintings of Matisse really do resonate with each other .
“ It was the first time I was forced to see a similarity between the two artists , ” he adds .
“ Not being an art expert , though , I ’d say that if there was to be an ancestor or a provenance , [ Jean ] Cocteau is probably closer to an artistic match . ”
Like Leonard Cohen , Cocteau mastered several different media , and as a visual artist was interested in lightness of touch and spontaneity of line .
Neither would be considered a master draftsman ; neither can be dismissed out of hand .
And in both cases their art serves more as commentary on their very full lives than as something to be considered entirely on its own .
“ My dad was n’t planning on ever publishing any of these drawings , ” Adam points out .
“ His ambitions were n’t to be remembered alongside any of the greats , visually speaking .
And so he permitted himself to really draw what he felt like drawing , and to annotate the drawings with whatever he felt was appropriate — notes that are often funny , self - effacing , and typical of his sense of humour .
“ And that ’s what I think is remarkable about my father ’s drawing , ” he adds , noting that Leonard Cohen Artworks might surprise those who still think of his dad as primarily an eloquent prophet of doom .
“ His voice is evident in his art .
Many , many visual artists struggle with that , let alone artists who have full - blown careers in other milieus .
So , more than anything , what I find admirable about it is how that distinct voice of his is really present — and he ’s one of the funniest men I ’ve ever met . ”
Earlier this year , Mark Cummuta walked away from a chance to become the No. 2 executive of a Chicago technology consultancy -- for less than $ 100,000 .
As the sole breadwinner and father of triplets , Mr. Cummuta could n't afford a nearly 20 % cut in pay , compared with what he was earning as an independent management consultant .
He 's still looking for a permanent position .
" Every now and then , I hit myself and say , ' I should have taken that offer , ' " concedes the consultant , who has helped several firms navigate difficult times since 2003 .
Bruce MacPherson for WSJ
Unfortunately , Mr. Cummuta is hardly unique .
More battered businesses are giving new hires less money than they made in their last job .
" I am seeing that a lot more , " says April M. Williams , a career coach in Algonquin , Ill .
Puny amounts flabbergast some of her clients .
" As the downturn deepens , an increasing number of job seekers will find themselves getting lower - paying offers , " says Mark Royal , a senior consultant at Hay Group .
" We are on the cusp of a trend . "
But excess eagerness to toil for fewer bucks sends the wrong signal .
Such applicants often " are really desperate , " says Niki Leondakis , chief operating officer at Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants , a boutique chain in San Francisco .
Rather than immediately reject or accept a lowball deal , you should mount a careful counterattack , experts recommend .
You could improve your chances of winning a satisfactory compromise , with tradeoffs ranging from a faster pay review to extra perquisites .
Arm yourself with data about the going rate for your position by trolling Web sites such as www.Salary.com, indeed.com/salary , salaryexpert.com and Glassdoor.com .
You 'll see whether a concern " has poor information about the external market " and rewards staffers below prevailing levels , says Robin Pinkley , a professor at Southern Methodist University 's business school and author of books about pay negotiations .
Just Say No ?
Reasons why you might want to reject a lower - paying job :
You could n't afford your rent
You old pay far exceeds prevailing rate for the new position
Your repeated efforts to negotiate alternative rewards fail
Boss - to - be wo n't let you make more money than him
The offer reflects a workplace that 's a poor fit for you
A better offer looms elsewhere Source : WSJ reporting Source : WSJ reporting
As part of your homework , you must grasp a potential employer 's problems so you can promote yourself as a problem solver worth more than the proposed skimpy pay .
" To negotiate in tough times , you have to be able to create a vision , " says Jim Camp , an author and president of Camp Group , a negotiation - consulting firm in Dublin , Ohio .
A big New York law firm recently agreed to hire an Ohio lawyer for $ 140 an hour , $ 40 an hour less than he was earning .
The firm blamed tough times .
But the attorney knew he could provide important client referrals , recalls Mr. Camp , who coached him .
" What number would I be paid if I brought a million - dollar client ? " the candidate asked firm officials .
" If you 're a rainmaker , the numbers change , " they replied , according to Mr. Camp .
After further interviews , the firm raised his starting pay to $ 240 an hour .
He began last summer .
A West Coast executive took this tactic a step further .
Keen to enter senior management several years ago , she hoped to accept a vice presidency at a midsize manufacturer -- and keep making over $ 300,000 a year .
But the concern offered less than $ 200,000 , the same cash compensation it gave other VPs .
The woman prepared a Power Point presentation for the chief executive , highlighting accomplishments he did n't know about and describing ways she might bolster customer satisfaction .
She says she also sold him on a quarterly bonus plan for herself , linked to measurable milestones needed for the manufacturer 's long - term growth .
The CEO enlarged her package by nearly $ 25,000 .
And she racked up bonuses fast enough that she was paid nearly $ 300,000 within a year .
" It was a win - win for the company , " she notes .
Some job hunters weighing lower offers bargain for alternative rewards , such as flexible hours , extra vacation , special training or a gym membership .
Not everyone can long survive on a shrunken paycheck , however .
PeaceKeeper Cause - Metrics , a small cosmetics distributor , offered Stephanie S. Hayano a $ 50,000 salary to be its chief operating officer starting last January .
She previously earned $ 300,000 a year running Natural Health Trends Corp .
The puny pay would n't have even covered mortgages for her three residences .
" Unless I was prepared to totally change my lifestyle , $ 50,000 was not in the cards , " Ms. Hayano says .
She assumed the COO title at the New York firm , but gets compensated as a part - time consultant and retains other consulting gigs .
It 's a good idea to assess the long - term career impact of toiling for less .
Younger individuals , for instance , might get a valuable opportunity to build their résumés .
That proved true for Sanjay Gupta .
In 1994 , the 26 - year - old senior marketing analyst accepted 10 % lower pay when he transferred to a database marketing job at his employer , FedEx Corp .
He and his wife were forced to dine out less often .
However , Mr. Gupta says that he gained experience " with every facet of marketing , " a critical skill for becoming a chief marketing officer of a big business some day .
He achieved that title last March , when GMAC Financial Services named him CMO .

Royal Bank of Scotland announced the biggest loss in British corporate history yesterday .
The news triggered fears the bank would be nationalised and caused a bloodbath in shares across the sector , overshadowing the Government 's latest financial bailout .
RBS stunned the market by predicting a loss of up to £ 28bn for 2008 , writing off as much as £ 8bn of toxic assets and £ 20bn from the value of acquisitions , including the disastrous takeover of the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007 .
The scale of the losses raised fears that RBS would be fully nationalised and that other banks , such as Barclays , could find themselves controlled by the state .
Shares in Barclays and the new Lloyds group also fell .
The Government was first forced to intervene in October with a £ 50bn recapitalisation of the major UK banks .
RBS , which owns NatWest , Direct Line and Coutts , the Queen 's bank – was already 58 per cent owned by the Government after it came close to collapse in October .
The bank , which was one of the world 's 10 biggest , swapped £ 5bn of preference shares held by the Government for new ordinary shares , giving the state a 70 per cent stake in the bank and making it more secure .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
RBS shares lost two - thirds of their value , closing at just 11.6 p .
Stephen Hester , the bank 's chief executive , said full nationalisation was a possibility and had been discussed " only as something we all wished to avoid " .
But with the economy so fragile , nationalisation was possible , he added .
Although some Labour MPs called for full state ownership , ministers insisted that was not their goal .
But the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , did not rule out the move as a last resort , saying : " The Government has to continue to do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing . "
The collapse in bank shares was embarrassing for ministers , who yesterday morning hailed a short - lived rise in share prices after they announced their second rescue package .
Last night , they insisted their plan was about saving the economy , not the banks , and that share prices were not in their minds when they drew up the latest measures .
The Government 's first bailout in October was meant to restore confidence by injecting more cash into the banks to protect against losses .
But shocking results from Bank of America , Deutsche Bank and others last week showed markets became worse than ever in December , battering the values of risky investments and loans stuck on lenders ' balance sheets .
The Treasury announced a raft of new measures yesterday , designed to further support confidence in the system and get the banks lending to support households and companies .
The plan included agreeing to sell the banks guarantees against losses on toxic assets , extending a Bank of England scheme that lets banks swap illiquid securities for Government bonds , and underwriting new issues of mortgages and other loans parcelled up as bonds to boost funding .
Gordon Brown , who said he was " angry " about RBS 's excessive lending , added : " I am not going to stand idly by and let people go to the wall because of irresponsible mistakes of a few bankers . "
He denied the new scheme amounted to a " blank cheque " but could not estimate how much taxpayers ' money would be at risk .
City experts said the gamble could run into hundreds of billions of pounds .
George Osborne , the shadow Chancellor , said : " It is the clearest possible admission that the first bailout of the banks has failed and now they have no option but to attempt a second bailout – a bailout whose size we still do n't know , whose details remain a mystery and whose ultimate cost to the people of Britain will only be known when this Government has long gone .

Jane Coffey , head of equities at Royal London Asset Management , said : " These were helpful measures but there was a realisation with RBS coming clean that this problem is even bigger than people had thought .
What these measures have n't done is get rid of concern about toxic assets because they do n't cover the worst of the stuff . "
Banking stocks were traded in huge volumes , indicating a mass flight from the sector , with nearly 743 million RBS shares changing hands and a total of 1.2 billion bank shares traded .
David Buik , of BGC Partners , said : " What has frightened us all this afternoon are the volumes – people looking to get out .
This is grown - up turnover . "
Lloyds Banking
Group shares tumbled on their first day of trading , losing a third , after Lloyds TSB bought Halifax Bank of Scotland ( HBOS ) last week in a government - brokered deal to save HBOS from imploding .
Investors fear that HBOS 's losses on credit investments and commercial property could seriously damage Lloyds .
RBS 's shocking loss hit confidence in Barclays , whose shares had already lost a quarter of their value on Friday and fell 10 per cent yesterday .
Barclays is one of the biggest players in the debt markets that have damaged RBS .
Many investors believe Barclays could suffer losses that force it to be nationalised , though it issued a statement on Friday predicting a £ 5.3 bn profit for 2008 , saying it was financially strong .
Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort said a possible future shortage of capital following further asset deterioration could eventually push [ Barclays ] into the arms of the Government if existing shareholders were unwilling or unable to provide yet further support and share price weakness persists .
HSBC , the only UK bank not to raise new capital in the crisis , said it had no plans to accept government capital and could see no circumstances in which doing so would be necessary .
Its shares fell by 6.5 per cent yesterday .
Here 's something to give you a laugh over the holidays .
Chesley B. Sullenburger : Miracle On The Hudson River ( Video , Photos )
, who piloted US Airways Flight 1549 in Manhattan on Thursday , is being touted as a true hero by the 155 passengers who walked away from what could have been a deadly disaster .
The commercial flight left LaGuardia Airport in New York City en route to Charlotte , North Carolina .
Two minutes after take off a flock of birds damaged the planes engines and pilot Sullenburger had a major emergency on his hands .
Unable to return to the airport and in a major metropolitan area , he told his passengers to brace for landing and he put the Airbus A320 down in the Hudson River .
The downed plane 's close proximity to nearby boats and barges enabled passengers to be swiftly rescued from the aircraft wings and rubber rafts .
All were wet from the icy waters that quickly entered the plane and a few suffered minor injuries but there were no casualties .
Sullenburger , known as " Sully " , is a 29 year veteran pilot .
New York City Mike Bloomberg spoke to the pilot last night and called his flat landing on the water a " masterful job . "
According to reports , the US Airways captain walked up and down the plane 's aisle twice to ensure that everyone had escaped before he made his own exit .
Truly a miracle on the Hudson River .

It was the ultimate inside job .
While springing her husband , George Hyatte , from jail last year , prison nurse Jennifer Hyatte shot and killed a guard .
The couple then set off a two - day interstate manhunt .
They met while George , convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated assault , was serving a 35 - year sentence at the Riverbend maximum - security prison in Nashville , Tenn .
Relationships between corrections staff and inmates , experts say , can upset a prison 's delicate balance and lead to escapes , murders and other violent crimes .
" Sex between inmates and staff is illegal in all states and a felony in some , " said Jamie Fellner , director of the U.S. Program at Human Rights Watch .
" It 's bad for professional management , bad for safety and bad for the well - being of officers .
You can't run a prison well if there are sexual relationships between guards and inmates . "
According to government statistics , most sexual contact between corrections staff and inmates occurs between female employees and male prisoners .
" One misconception about staff sexual abuse of inmates is that it only involves male staff engaging in sexual relations with female inmates .
As the statistics … indicate , the scope of the problem also includes female staff with male inmates , male staff with male inmates and female staff with female inmates , " wrote the Department of Justice in a report by its Office of the Inspector General .
Forty - seven percent of all cases of sexual abuse cases from 2000 to 2004 involved women employees and their male charges .
Men were 4 percent less likely to abuse female inmates .
Last week Magdalena Sanchez , 35 , a former psychologist at a federal prison in Brooklyn , N.Y. , was arraigned and freed on $ 100,000 bail after being charged with having sex for several months in 2005 with a prisoner in her care .
Prison staff are " not even supposed to ' fraternize ' with inmates in fear of being manipulated .
From a staff perspective , it puts other staff at risk and undermines the prison 's mission , " Fellner said .
Experts say more women have sex with male prisoners than men have with female inmates for one simple reason :
There are far more men in jail than there are women .
" The sheer number of men is so much larger , " said Brenda Smith , a law professor at American University and director of a national project that studies prison rape .
" In the U.S. , 93 percent of prisoners are men . "
In 2005 , there were 6,241 reported allegations of sexual violence in prisons and jails , up from 5,386 in 2004 , according to the Justice Department .
The exact number of prisoners who have been sexually abused by guards or other prison employees , however , remains unknown .
The government only began keeping tabs on abuse by staff -- as well as by other prisoners -- in 2003 , when Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination Act , which established a commission that would study the issue .
Prisoner rights advocates estimate " that one in five prisoners gets sexually assaulted in some way , " said Margaret Winter , associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's National Prison Project .
Sex in prison between guards and inmates remains difficult , said Todd Clear , a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York .
" Most prisons for men are staffed by men and prisons for women are staffed by women . …
There is limited time without someone else in the room and there is limited space .
There is also a lot of pressure to learn [ about these relationships ] .
Staff members are extremely vulnerable because the power roles have now shifted .
The prisoner now has something the staff person needs .
— Cooperation and quiet , " Clear said .
American University 's Smith said that part of the reason women formed sexual relationships -- and why the public was likely to hear about those relationships -- with prisoners was related to the male - dominated prison culture .
" These environments are really awful to work in and often female staff have to form alliances with male staff and inmates just to get by .
…
Women have a lot less protection in these environments than men . …
They 're not a part of the old boys network .
They 're not a part of management and they do n't have the same sort of networking systems .
…
Women are n't helped in the same way , " Smith said .
Sexual relationships between prison employees -- regardless of their gender -- and inmates is taken so seriously by the government and prisoner rights activists because there is " widespread recognition that there is no such thing as consent in prison , " Winter said .
While sexual abuse initiated by male guards is " very much a combination of intimidation and coercion , " experts said , female employees very often feel they have established emotional connections with the inmates with whom they have sex .
Sex outside of prison is incredibly complicated , Clear said .
" Any instances of sexual contact behind bars is equally fraught with nuance .
It runs the range of all things that occur outside : love , lust , subjugation , brutality , worship . "

Pirates in Somalia are making a fortune by hijacking ships and demanding ransoms to set them and their crews free - one official estimates the total this year to be around $ 150 m .
There are conflicting reports about how much they want for the Saudi oil tanker they seized last month , the Sirius Star , and its cargo of two million barrels of oil , but how do you negotiate and deliver a pirate ransom in the 21st Century ?
The owner hires people to take the money ... for the handover of the big bags of cash .
Same like the movies .
Fahid Hassan , Harardhere From what can be gleaned - how the negotiations run their course and how the ransoms are paid - what goes on would be worthy of a Hollywood action movie script .
" No matter what process is taken , they always go through a middleman , " advises BBC Somali service analyst Said Musa .
" And trust is at the heart of everything . "
Fahid Hassan , who has experience of the negotiations , says that after boarding the ship , the first step for the pirates is to make contact with its owners .
" All the important documents are there on the ship , so the pirates can know easily all the information they need , " he says .
" The talks are by telephone , mostly satellite phone but sometimes even SMS / text messages are sent .
The pirates do not negotiate themselves .
They hire someone and often this person is a relative ; someone they can trust . "
See satellite images showing the hijacked super - tanker , Sirius Star

" For the Sirius Star , there are two negotiators .
Sometimes they are on the ship , sometimes they are in town .
The negotiator must work and work and work to get the money which is a very difficult job .
It is very difficult to please the owner and please the pirates , " he adds .
" But once the money is delivered the negotiator gets a share , the same as a pirate .
Everyone on the ship gets an equal share . "
Mr Hassan says that in the past , the ransom was delivered by money transfer , but that now owners hire a third party to hand over the money directly .
" They come onto the ship or the pirates get onto their boat for the handover of the bags of cash , " he says .
" The men who bring the money then go ; they leave the ship to let the pirates count and check .
Some of the pirates have counting machines and also machines to detect fake notes . "
Security firms Roger Middleton , a Horn of Africa specialist at the Chatham House , says the ship - owners hire professionals , from specialist negotiators to private security firms , to transfer the ransoms .
' World only cares about pirates '
On patrol with the pirate hunters Q&A : Somali piracy " They are mostly ex-SAS and British or Australian .
A lot are also South African , " he says .
Not much more is known for certain , however , as it is an unwritten rule among members of such firms that there are no kiss - and - tell stories .
Understandably , those involved are also aware of the needs of their clients and the strict demand for secrecy with people 's lives being at stake .
However , Mr Middleton says that such operations cost about $ 1 m , not including the ransom .
" The professional negotiators , acting on behalf of the ship owners , get about $ 100,000 for their services and the lawyers receive a fee of about $ 300,000 for ensuring that the shipping companies are not putting themselves in any dubious positions , " he explains .
Regarding what goes on behind closed doors , be it the negotiations and the legal and insurance matters as a result of these hijackings , Mr Middleton says it would be fair to say that , " most of it happens in London , " he adds .
The EU 's first ever naval mission will patrol the pirate - infested Gulf of Aden
Gavin Simmonds , head of international affairs at the British Chamber of Shipping , agrees this assumption is " highly likely " as London is the centre of the global maritime industry .
" It seems perfectly plausible that the actual facilitation of ransom money is being done by London - based insurers , " he says .
However , Mr Simmonds says he has also heard rumours that some exchanges have taken place in Dubai .
Bags of cash
The pirates ask that the ransom is all in used dollar bills - normally $ 50 or $ 100 notes - according to those with experience of such negotiations .
Kenyan sailor Athman Said Mangore , who was held captive for more than 120 days by Somali pirates , says they are known to make many demands and put in place a number of restrictions .
Pirates have generally treated the crew they seize well - so they are paid " They sometimes say they want $ 208,000 exactly in $ 100 bills only , " he says .
" I do n't know why they make those demands .
They usually also do n't like dollar bills that were printed in 2000 or the years before .
If it was printed in 1999 , they say : ' This is not fit to be used in our shop ' , " he adds .
Once the ship 's owners have sourced cash , a private security firm takes over .
They then hire a tug boat , often from the Kenyan port of Mombasa , which they take further north up the coast towards Somali waters .
The security personnel then board the boat with the bags of cash and enough weaponry to keep it safe .
When the ransom has been paid , the pirates are left to count the money and are allowed to leave the vessel freely .
" The navies in the Somali waters of course must have a pretty good idea of what goes on , as they have spy drones and they are watching the hijacked vessels , " Mr Middleton says .
" Whether there 's any coordination between the ransom payers and the navies is unknown . "
The BBC's Joseph Odhiambo in Mombasa says that on at least two prior occasions the ransom money was delivered to the hijacked vessels via air - drops .
He also says that other payments were flown from Wilson Airport in the Kenyan capital , Nairobi , into Somalia on cargo planes transporting the stimulant , khat .
No - one knows how long it will be until the Sirius Star is set free , but it is fair to say the ransom negotiations will be both complicated and delicate , with its cargo believed to be worth $ 100 m .
And the families of its 25 crew members , who are being held hostage , will be hoping that the pirates stay true to their word that they have no intention of harming them .

Pumping compressed air underground so it can be extracted later to generate electricity could prove one of the most effective ways in the short term for Ontario to add vast amounts of renewable energy to the power system , industry experts say .
So - called compressed - air energy storage , or CAES , has been around for more than 20 years and while only two facilities have ever been built – a 110 - megawatt plant in Alabama and a 290 - megawatt plant in Germany – officials from New York , California , Texas and a number of other U.S. states are beginning to seriously explore the potential .
Iowa has already taken the leap .
The basic concept is that cheap , surplus electricity available overnight is used to compress air and inject it into underground reservoirs , like a salt cavern or depleted gas field .
When power is needed during the day and can fetch a higher price on the market , the air is released , exposed to heat and put through an expansion turbine that generates electricity .
" It 's beginning to capture people 's imagination , " says Mark Tinkler , an energy consultant with Emerging Energy Options and former manager of distributed energy technologies at Ontario Power Generation .
Five years ago , Tinkler did a study for OPG on the economics of using CAES and at the time he concluded it did n't make sense .
Looking back , he says , enough has changed in the world to revisit the idea .
" My personal feeling is that the time is right to do another assessment . "
The reason ?
In a word , wind .
The wind blows intermittently , so unlike a coal - fired power plant that can dispatch electricity when we need it , a wind farm often generates electricity when we do n't need it ( or it fails to when we do ) .
Energy storage can level the playing field between renewables and fossil fuels , allowing us to capture wind energy whenever it blows and dispatch the power as demand dictates – much like a coal plant operates today .
It turns out the wind blows best at night , when there 's little or no demand for it .
Wind - farm operators will often shed the energy or sell it for practically nothing to other utilities .
" It comes down to what the value of electricity is at night , " says Tinkler .
" Five years ago we did n't have any wind .
Now , it 's a completely different equation . "
Geologically , Ontario is well equipped to embrace CAES – particularly southwestern Ontario .
It 's often forgotten the region was once the hub of oil and gas exploration in North America and was home to the world 's first commercial oil well .
More than 50,000 wells have been drilled in Ontario over the past 150 years and slightly more than 2,000 still produce today .
Union Gas and Enbridge Gas Distribution already use depleted gas fields in southwestern Ontario to store natural gas for the heating season .
In fact , the Sarnia - Lambton region accounts for 60 per cent of Canada 's natural gas storage capacity .
Andrew Hewitt , manager of the petroleum resources centre in Ontario 's Ministry of Natural Resources , says the region is also rich in wind resources .
He 's currently studying the CAES option , having decided several months ago the opportunity was ripe for consideration , particularly as the province moves to shut down its coal plants .
" The compressed - air component does n't have to be in the same area as a wind farm , it just has to be hooked into the same region of the province , " says Hewitt , who hopes to brief the minister on his findings once his research is complete .
" The oil and gas industry has been doing this kind of storage for years .
You 're using the same technology and just substituting it ( natural gas ) with air . "
The problem is , engineers from power utilities know little about geology and underground technologies .
Likewise , engineers from the oil and gas sector are not as knowledgeable about the above - ground machinery that generates electricity .
" You 've got to bring teams of these people together to make compressed - air storage happen , " says Robert Schainker , a senior technical executive and CAES expert at the Palo Alto , Calif . - based Electric Power Research Institute .
Schainker says it 's worth the effort if the geological conditions are right and the goal is bulk energy storage , such as a CAES facility that can store 200 megawatts for 10 hours or more – the equivalent of powering two million 100 - watt light bulbs or 400,000 dishwashers for half a day .
True , a number of advanced battery - storage technologies are becoming economical for much smaller applications – for example , one megawatt for one to three hours of storage .
These technologies include zinc - bromide , sodium - sulphur , lithium -ion and vanadium flow battery chemistries .
But at much larger scales batteries are simply too expensive .

CAES , on the other hand , is n't economical on a small scale since the bulk of capital costs relates to the compressors and other turbo- machinery .
The underground storage costs are the same whether you 've got a small or large reservoir .
Adding an additional hour of storage to a CAES project will only cost $ 1 ( U.S. ) or $ 2 per kilowatt - hour , compared with $ 350 to $ 500 per kilowatt - hour of additional battery storage , says Schainker .
Still , there are a few wild cards that could influence the future cost of compressed - air storage .
The current generation of CAES facilities still require fuel , typically natural gas , to heat the air before it enters the expansion turbine .
Generally , a CAES plant consumes a third less natural gas for every kilowatt - hour it generates , compared with a simple - cycle natural gas or " peakier " plant .
Tinkler says when Ontario Power Generation studied the economics of CAES , the cost of natural gas was $ 3 per thousand cubic feet .
At the time , " we were looking at a $ 5 break - even point , " he says .
" As the price of natural gas goes up , compressed - air storage looks better and better . "
Today , natural gas is above $ 5 per thousand cubic feet .
The National Energy Board is projecting it could go as high as $ 9 over the winter and the U.S. Energy Information Administration is projecting it will hit $ 6.25 in 2009 .
As recently as this summer it was higher than $ 13 .
Another factor that would make CAES even more attractive is carbon pricing .
Both Canada and the United States plan to introduce a continental cap - and - trade system for carbon emissions .
CAES , by increasing our use of wind energy and reducing our consumption of natural gas , would become more economical over time by lowering carbon dioxide emissions in the province .
" You should redo your studies , " says Schainker , referring to OPG 's initial study in 2003 .
" CO2 costs will be a big one . "
The fact that a CAES facility , like wind farms , can also be built in two or three years also makes it attractive when compared with building a nuclear facility , which , because of more rigorous regulatory requirements , can take 10 years to plan and build .
And the technology continues to mature , Schainker adds , pointing to next - generation designs that can take the waste heat that results from compressing the air and use it in place of natural gas to reheat the air during the electricity generation process .
No facility has ever been built around this design , but it 's only a matter of time .
" There would be no fuel used whatsoever , no CO2 emissions , " he says .
" On paper , it looks very attractive .
We 're working on it . "
Andrew Hewitt at the natural resources ministry says making it happen in Ontario would necessarily require the participation of OPG .
He says wind developers in the region could get together and build a facility to share , or a single operator of a large wind farm may decide to pursue such a project alone .
" It does n't have to be the big utilities , " he says .
" Commercializing it would depend simply on who wants to get into that business . "
This blog is momentarily interrupted to bring you a snippet of recently received email .
" ... observed one of my students with a group of other children gathered around his laptop .
Upon looking at his computer , I saw he was giving a demonstration of some sort .
The student was showing the ability of the laptop and handing out Linux disks .
After confiscating the disks I called a confrence with the student and that is how I came to discover you and your organization .
Mr. Starks , I am sure you strongly believe in what you are doing but I cannot either support your efforts or allow them to happen in my classroom .
At this point , I am not sure what you are doing is legal .
No software is free and spreading that misconception is harmful .
These children look up to adults for guidance and discipline .
I will research this as time allows and I want to assure you , if you are doing anything illegal , I will pursue charges as the law allows .
Mr. Starks , I along with many others tried Linux during college and I assure you , the claims you make are grossly over - stated and hinge on falsehoods .
I admire your attempts in getting computers in the hands of disadvantaged people but putting linux on these machines is holding our kids back .
This is a world where Windows runs on virtually every computer and putting on a carnival show for an operating system is not helping these children at all .
I am sure if you contacted Microsoft , they would be more than happy to supply you with copies of an older verison of Windows and that way , your computers would actually be of service to those receiving them ... "

Hmmmm ....
I suppose I should , before anything else , thank you .
You have given me the opportunity to show others just what a battle we face in what we do .
" We " being those who advocate , support and use Free Open Source Software and Linux in particular .
If you find my following words terse or less than cordial , take a breath and prepare yourself ... what I have to say to you are soft strokes to your hair in comparison to what you are about to experience .
First off , if there was even the slightest chance that I was doing something illegal , it would not have been done .
To think that I would involve my kids in my " illegal " activities is an insult far beyond outrage .
You should be ashamed of yourself for putting into print such none sense .
And please ... investigate to your heart 's content .
You are about to have your eyes opened , that is if you actually investigate anything at all .
Linux is a free as - in - cost and free as - in - license operating system .
It was designed specifically for those purposes .
Linux is used to free people from Microsoft .
The fact that you seem to believe that Microsoft is the end all and be -all is actually funny in a sad sort of way .
Then again , being a good NEA member , you would spout the Union line .
Microsoft has pumped tens of millions of dollars into your union .
Of course you are going to " recommend " Microsoft Windows " .
To do otherwise would probably get you reprimanded at the least and fired at the worst .
You are only doing what you 've been instructed to do .
You 've been trained well .
I do n't know when you attended college Karen but the Linux of even two years ago pales in feature and ability to what there is available now ... and that in turn will pale in a year 's time .
linux is superior to MS windows in so many ways , they are too numerous to mention here ... I am weary of enumerating them .
Unlike Microsoft who meters their " improvements " and then shovels them to you every five years or so for purchase ; Linux releases their improvements upon their completion .
We receive the newest and the best of the system when it is tested to be usable and stable .
Karen , you have no idea the slavery you work under ... but you do n't know any better .
The shame of it is , you are trapped with millions of other teachers in obeying the NEA and preaching the goodness of Windows and Microsoft .
A superior , free and absolutely entertaining method of operating your computer is within reach and you are unable to grasp it .
The most disturbing part of this resides in the fact that the AISD purchases millions of dollars of Microsoft Software in a year 's time when that money could be better spent on educating our children .
A dedicated School Teacher would recognize that fact and lobby for the change to Free Open Source Software and let the money formally spent on MS bindware be used on our kids .
A teacher who cared about her students would do that .
That is sad past my ability to express it to you .
Do n't shackle your students in your prison Karen .
Now .
You give that boy his disks back .
Aaron is a brilliant kid and he 's learned more using Linux than he ever did using Windows .
Those disks and their distribution are perfectly legal and even if he was " disruptive " , you cannot keep his property .
I have placed a call to the AISD Superintendent and cc'd him a complete copy of your email .
It looks like we will get to meet in his office when School starts again after the holiday .
I am anxious to meet a person who is this uninformed and still holds a position of authority and learnedness over our children .

Michigan unemployment benefits system in crisis
By Debra Watson and D’Artagnan Collier
30 January 2009
The wave of recent layoffs has overwhelmed the state of Michigan ’s unemployment insurance system , with thousands of workers unable to get through online or by telephone to file claims .
The state ’s official unemployment rate reached 10.6 percent in December , the highest in the United States .
Last week laid off workers waited in long lines at unemployment offices across Michigan .
Workers outside one unemployment office in Metro Detroit started an impromptu protest , chanting “ Hey Jennifer , answer the phone ! ” referring to Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm .
Despite repeated promises , Michigan officials have failed to resolve problems with the state ’s online and telephone system for registering for unemployment insurance .
According to one report , the unemployment call center was receiving 1 million calls a day .
Some laid off workers are redialing 20 times and still not getting through .
Beginning in the 1990s , Michigan closed all 43 unemployment claims offices statewide , replacing them with a telephone system for accepting unemployment claims .
By 2004 half the staff of the state ’s unemployment agency had been laid off .
Over the last few years the Granholm administration has opened a handful of Michigan Unemployment Agency Problem Resolution offices , where workers can resolve claims issues in person .
These are now swamped .
Unemployed workers , many without a check since losing their jobs late last year , are furious at the breakdown .
According to the Grand Rapids Press , on January 8 the only unemployment center in all of western Michigan had five - hour waits .
State officials promised at that time to add another Internet server and put state workers on overtime , but workers trying to collect benefits have seen little relief in the ensuing two weeks .
Workers are now being told to register bi-weekly online rather than by phone , and to go to the library if they have no computer access .
The glut of online claims has already crashed the computer system for unemployment insurance in three other US states —
Ohio , New York and North Carolina .
There were over 400,000 people collecting benefits in Michigan in December , with 100,000 added to the rolls in November alone .
The greatest drops in employment occurred in the construction , motor vehicle and vehicle parts sectors , according to a recent report from the Michigan League for Human Services ( MILHS ) .
Part - time workers now account for one in five jobs in the state , according to MILHS .
The World Socialist Web Site spoke to unemployed workers at the Problem Resolution Office in Livonia , Michigan , a suburb of Detroit .
Ramonte
Ramonte was laid off along with hundreds of other young workers at Huron Valley Steel in early December .
He was back for the second time in a week to try to get his benefits straightened out .
“ I came up and waited on Tuesday , and they finally said it was resolved , but when I got the money it was only half of what I was owed .
I have a family , a daughter and rent to pay .
And it is n’t looking good out here .
We need more jobs so these people can go back to work instead of standing around here .
“ We all saw how it was so easy for the banks to get that money , but they did not want to give it to the Big Three .
They have all this money , and they do n’t want to give it to the people .
I am laid off now after a year at the plant , and now I do n’t know when any of us are going back to work . ”
Raquel
Raquel was laid off from her job as an Internet sales representative for a major auto dealer in the area .
“ I filled out my application online , ” she told the WSWS .
“ I was able to complete the form and actually received paperwork back , but I still have no money on my card .
I drove in today from Sterling Heights , a distance of 35 miles , to try to get this resolved .
They used to have an unemployment office in Sterling Heights , but it is now closed .
“ You know about the fall in car sales , so the dealership where I worked just had nothing .
Now I am here waiting to find out about my benefits . ”
Mike works for an auto supplier and is on a two - week furlough .
He said , “ I had to drive all the way up from Toledo , Ohio .
I work in Michigan , so I have to file here .
Mike
“ I tried to do everything online or on the phone , but neither one worked .
I was able to get all the way through the online application , but when I got to the end it told me I would have to appear in person in order to sign up .
Then I tried to get through on the phone to talk to someone about it , and all that happened is you call and you do n’t get anything .
“ I started the layoff on the 5th .
I called to register on my day , which goes according to your Social Security number , and could not get through .
Then I tried on Thursdays and Fridays .
They tell you these are days anyone can call .
I would make 15 to 20 calls each day , with no results .
It is clear they are just forcing people to come up here .
It is really a waste of time , but I have a family to support and I have to get it straightened out .
“ I have 10 years working in the auto industry .
I went into the service when I graduated , and when I got out I went to college .
I got my BA when I was 28 and an MBA when I was 32 .
I am actually in a better situation than others who are here , because I know I have a job to go back to .
“ The company saved two - and - a - half million dollars with this furlough .
They had let go 2,200 people already because of the problems in the auto industry .
My buddy at Eaton said they just eliminated 5,500 jobs .
You have to think about how much it will take to bring back that many people .
If I had to go out looking for a job right now , it would be almost impossible to make anywhere near my current pay . ”
In 1996 the Republican administration of Governor John Engler instituted a cap on unemployment benefit payments and limits on eligibility .
If benefit payments had been indexed to inflation since the 1990s , the maximum would be close to $ 475 .
But the maximum benefit is now $ 380 a week , and the average weekly benefit of $ 295 provides a monthly income well below the poverty level for a family of four .
Michigan has one of the strictest eligibility requirements of any state in the US .
Low - wage workers are often excluded , with a minimum wage worker requiring 29 hours a week or more to qualify .
Since cutbacks began , the unemployment insurance system has eliminated one billion dollars in payments due to workers .
According to MILHS , from 1995 to 2001 alone unemployment taxes on businesses were cut by one billion dollars .
Tax rates levied per employee dropped almost in half , from $ 446 in 1994 to $ 237 in 2001 .
The state has paid out more in unemployment benefits than employers paid to the insurance fund for eight years straight .
Small and likely inadequate increases in insurance payments from employers will not be fully implemented until 2010 .
In little over a decade , the state ’s unemployment reserve fund has been drained of all resources .
Since 2006 the state has had to borrow money from the federal government to pay claims , and finished 2008 with $ 772.5 million dollars of loans due .
Even the fund set aside to pay the interest on the unemployment insurance fund loans from the federal government is underwater , and the state is expected to dip into the its General Fund to pay the interest , which threatens more cuts in social services .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President George W. Bush granted pardons Tuesday to 19 citizens charged with a variety of crimes , but none was prominent .
President Bush walks down the White House Collonade on Tuesday as he departs for Camp David .
Presidential pardon lists are being closely monitored in the final weeks of the Bush administration , particularly to see whether former vice presidential aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby will be granted the presidential favor .
One of the men pardoned is Charles Winters , who died almost 25 years ago .
His son had worked on winning a presidential pardon for his dad , who had helped smuggle weapons to Jews fighting in what was then Palestine in the late 1940s .
A Protestant from Boston , Massachusetts , Winters spent 18 months behind bars .
He was the only U.S. citizen to serve time for helping fly weapons to Jews struggling to create Israel .
A 20th person received a commutation of a life sentence for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute .
That individual , Reed Raymond Prior , was ordered released from prison in February 2009 .
He will have served more than 12 years .
" We commend President Bush 's decision to grant a commutation to Reed Prior , who is deserving of a second chance , " Julie Stewart , president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums , said in a written statement .
" Of course , clemencies only underscore the larger problem -- the systemic injustice caused by mandatory minimum sentences that fill the prisons with low - level drug offenders in the first place . "
Bush has granted 191 pardons and nine commutations , far fewer than Presidents Clinton and Reagan in their two - term administrations .

• Former Rep. Randall " Duke " Cunningham , Republican from California , who was convicted of receiving bribes .
• Publishing executive Conrad Black , who was found guilty of fraud .
• Former junk bold salesman Michael Milken .
• Former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers , convicted of accounting fraud .
The parents of John Walker Lindh , who was given a 20 - year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan , held a news conference last week urging Bush to commute their son 's sentence .
It is unclear how many more requests Bush may grant before leaving office , although administration officials have said they do not expect any last - minute announcements , as was seen when President Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich , setting off a firestorm of controversy .
A commutation reduces a convict 's prison term , but the conviction remains on the person 's record .
A pardon , however , wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction .
A president has the sole authority to grant clemency and to whom , although a Justice Department office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering standards such as a person 's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release .
Those applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement .
Roughly 1,300 requests for commutation and 860 pardon applications are still pending .
There is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during the holiday season .

Since Hackney backed out of allowing four criminal charges against Janet to go before a jury next month , all that remains is for her to win her appeal in February against eight convictions which now look quite absurd ( including those for selling veg by the bowl , as thousands of other London market traders do every day ) .
The final goal , as Neil Herron of the Metric Martyrs Defence Fund insists , must then be a pardon for the late Steve Thoburn and the four other original " martyrs " who were found guilty in 2002 – after a legal battle also made possible by this column 's readers – of breaking laws so ridiculous that the EU Commission has even denied they existed ( but which are still on the statute book ) .

HOLYOKE - It must be Christmas : An ardent Yankee fan just saved the day for a member of Red Sox Nation .
Springfield resident Robert K. Preble faced a Christmas
Eve shopper 's nightmare at the Holyoke Mall on the morning of Christmas Eve when he reached for his wallet , and it was n't there .
Preble had just arrived at the mall to buy Christmas presents when he realized that his wallet - with more than $ 1,100 inside - was likely still inside the Yellow Cab taxi that had taken him there .
Preble said he lives on a fixed income , and the money represented a year 's worth of scrimping and saving .
Preble said he promptly canceled his breakfast order at the food court and was in the early stages of a heart - thumping panic as he frantically dialed Yellow Cab of Springfield in an effort to track down his wallet and the gifts to others that it represented .
" I was starting to freak out pretty good , " Preble said .
A Christmas
Eve angel quickly appeared , however , in the form of cabbie Joseph J. Galano wearing a smile and bearing the wallet - with contents intact .
It was not lost on Preble , an ardent Red Sox fan , that Galano was also wearing a Yankees jacket .
Galano , an Agawam resident , said he discovered the wallet after stopping his cab , post - Preble , to clear ice off the window .
A quick glance at the cash inside told Galano that its owner must be frantic with worry .
" I said ' Oh , this guy must be having a heart attack , ' " he said .
Galano drove back to the mall , parked and walked inside , in an effort to find his cashless customer .
After some time , Galano found Preble at the food court .
" He was probably looking a good 15 to 20 minutes , " Preble said .
" He smiled like hell when he saw me , " Galano said .
" I felt more like Santa Claus than a cabbie . "
Preble praised ( and tipped ) Galano for saving his Christmas .
" In this age , where everybody is getting laid off and short on money , you know that has got to be a temptation , " Preble said .
Preble said he was n't surprised at all to find a Yankees fan with a big heart .
" Not really , it 's all in good fun , " he said of the often hard - core rivalry between the two baseball dynasties .
Galano , who knows a thing or two about loss - he lost his voice to throat cancer seven years ago and requires a voice box to communicate - said he had no doubt about doing the right thing .
" I knew that it meant a lot to him , " Galano said .
Obama campaign wants Attorneygate prosecutor to probe GOP's ' sham anti-fraud campaign ' Nick Juliano

The current spate of trumped - up allegations of " voter fraud " coming from John McCain 's campaign and his Republican allies and the FBI 's decision to investigate represents exactly the same sort of politicization of justice that is at the root of an ongoing investigation into the firing of federal prosecutors , Barack Obama 's campaign alleges .
Obama attorney Bob Bauer has asked Attorney General Michael Mukasey to expand the authority of the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the US Attorney firings to also include the fraud allegations .
The campaign released a seven - page letter ( .pdf ) Bauer wrote to Mukasey on Friday requesting the investigation .
" Now , on the emerging evidence of recent conduct undertaken by Bush Administration officials , Republican Party officials , and representatives of the McCain - Palin campaign , " he wrote , " it appears that further misconduct of the same nature , directly relevant to the work of the Special Prosecutor , requires that the scope of the Special Prosecutor 's assignment be expanded . "
Bauer cites the case of former US Attorney David Iglesias , who represented the District of New Mexico until 2006 .
Bush administration officials reportedly conspired to sack Iglesias in part because of his unwillingness to bring specious voter - fraud charges before an election .
Iglesias this week called the voter fraud investigations a scare tactic and said he was shocked to see the FBI was pursuing an investigation based on similarly unmerited accusations of fraud .
On a conference call with reporters Friday , Bauer slammed the " illicit involvement of senior law enforcement officials " in leaking the details of the so - called fraud investigation .
The Obama lawyer noted that the leak came " literally within 24 hours " of McCain 's statement at Wednesday night 's debate that ACORN was threatening the " fabric of our democracy . "
The McCain campaign has turned attacking ACORN into a central theme of its campaign in recent weeks , with vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin continuing the assault at a rally in Ohio on Friday .
The community organization , witch which Obama has previously been involved , has produced a relatively small number of inaccurate registration forms in connection with its drive to sign up a million new voters , but it has not been registering voters directly on Obama 's behalf and there 's no evidence that it 's actions in this or any previous election cycle have led to widespread voter fraud .
Bauer said the " reckless and incendiary " attacks from the McCain campaign were aimed more at intimidating voters than at ferreting out fraud .
ACORN primarily registered low - income and minority voters , and voting rights advocates fear those voters might not turn out on Election Day to avoid potential harassment at the polls .
The Supreme Court also delivered a setback to the GOP on Friday , ruling against Ohio Republicans who have been feuding with the Secretary of State over registration rules .
Bauer said the conduct he outlines is " directly relevant " to the special prosecutor 's investigation and requested a meeting with Mukasey to discuss expanding the investigation .
" Once is more than enough , " he wrote .
" The Department has yet to recover its credibility after the calamitous politicization of its mission in this Administration and the documented misconduct ... that resulted from the corrupt injection of politics into federal law enforcement . "

//TODONT : Use a Windows Service just to run a scheduled process Monday , October 24 , 2005
A common requirement in business application is a scheduled process - call a webservice , process the data , and FTP the results to a business partner , for instance .
Developers kick around possible solutions - BizTalk 's overkill , DTS wo n't handle it well , what to do ?
Invariably , someone suggests a Windows Service with a timer .
Just as invariably , when you try to talk them out of it , they 'll condescendingly tell you that Windows Services are easy to write in .NET .
" Trust me , it 's not hard - we 'll write a simple service with a timer which will do a simple time check ... "
A Windows Service is the wrong solution to scheduling one - off custom processes .
The right solution for scheduling simple processes is the Windows Task Scheduler .
Let 's look at what Windows Services are designed for .
From the Windows Help documentation :
Service A program , routine , or process that performs a specific system function to support other programs , particularly at a low ( close to the hardware ) level .
When services are provided over a network , they can be published in Active Directory , facilitating service - centric administration and usage .
Some examples of services are the Security Accounts Manager service , File Replication service , and Routing and Remote Access service .
Web servers qualify as services , databases qualify as services , and the above Windows system features qualify as services .
The Task Scheduler qualifies as a service .
Possibly , custom server applications may qualify as a service if it needs to run round the clock and is written with the greatest sobriety , responsibility , and respect .
Your scheduled file FTP does n't qualify as a service .
A Windows Service which runs a timer needs to run Automatically , which means it will start up before you can log onto the machine and churn away until the machine is shut down .
If they hang or have a slow memory leak , they 'll continue to be a drag on the system until the service is restarted ( or they crash the machine ) .
I can't tell how many times I 've heard the following in production meetings : " The cause of the outage was the WhamoInhouse Service .
The resolution was to restart the service . "
Or , worse , application servers need to be restarted regularly because they 're hosting poorly written services , but the IT shop blames the operating system .
Windows Services do offer sophisticated Recovery actions ( on first , second , and subsequent failures you can specify that a program to be executed , or that the service or computer be restarted ) , but they 're geared towards hard failures of the executable rather than business process failures , and they do n't respond to things like memory leaks or hanging network connections .
They offer absolutely no scheduling , because services are designed to run all the time .
On the other hand , Windows Scheduled Tasks have advanced scheduling features which can be accessed administratively .
If the business requirements for my scheduled FTP task change two years down the road so the FTP should happen twice a day every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , the change can be made by an administrator .
The task schedule has been tested across leap years , daylight savings time , and clock changes ; most custom timer routines I 've seen have n't .
Scheduled console applications are easier to design , build , test , deploy , and install - especially compared to a professional service which can run reliably for weeks end .
This would n't by itself be a compelling argument if a Windows Service were the right solution by other criteria , but since it 's not , this is another nail in the coffin .
Consider , then , that your extra time spent building a service is wasted development time .
Maybe fun " I am a bigtime coder now " development time , but not of any business value .
Scheduled console applications are easier to run in an ad hoc manner when necessary .
Let 's say the webservice vendor calls three hours after our process ran to inform us that he had a data corruption problem which has been corrected and we should re-run our process .
In the case of a Windows Service with a timer , we'd be scratching our heads ; with our console application we can run it manually whenever we want .
Finally , running separate Windows Services with their own timers is just plain inefficient with server resources .
Ignore for the second the fact that we 're hogging CPU and memory space 24/ 7 for a process that runs occasionally ; multiple independant timers which check the time every few seconds is dumb .
If I kept writing Windows Services with timers , eventually I 'd start to think about writing a single host system with a timer .
Then I 'd want to add in some more advanced scheduling features ; perhaps even some logging .
Eventually , I 'd have a Windows Service that handles scheduling of child processes , and if I devoted years to enhancements and testing , I 'd eventually arrive at ... the Windows Task Scheduler .
If you 're writing a Windows Service that runs a timer , you should re-evaluate your solution .
As a Social Media Strategist , I spend more time than most setting - up and managing social media accounts ; both for myself and for my clients .
As more and more “ brick and mortar ” businesses have flocked to the popular social sites over the past couple of years , I have seen an increasing discrepancy between the typical business owner ’s use of these sites ( for marketing purposes ) , and their understanding of how those sites work .
The adaptation of the right strategy should be there to Buy YouTube subscribers that are real .
The scams about the subscribers are required to be in the notice to get the potential benefits .
The selection of the scam website is avoided to get the desired increase in the sale .
Despite the almost constant barrage , offered up by gurus of all stripes , of the “ latest and greatest , whiz - bang secrets ” that promise to unleash the proverbial “ flood of hungry customers to your web site via social media sites ” , few , if any , of the promises come true , and the expected flood of sales leads coming from the typical marketing campaign usually turns out to be a mere trickle .
The problem is n’t the social media channels ; it is true that there are untold millions of potential buyers out there .
The problem lies in how the media is being used – or misused – when trying to attract those potential buyers .
This is where the business owners are being misled , and where they make their fatal mistakes in the social media circles .
These mistakes are almost always a result of a faulty , linear mindset .
Business owners are used to viewing marketing activities as a linear , cause and effect relationship ; i.e. place an ad , pull in some leads , distribute some flyers , see more walk - in traffic , that sort of thing .
Social media marketing , on the other hand , does n’t operate in such a linear fashion ; it is far more dynamic than that .
Social media marketing is about developing relationships .
It is about engaging the prospect , helping to solve problems , offering useful and timely information , and allowing the prospect to develop trust with the business and their products and services .
In short , social media is not about selling the prospect ; it is not about taking the customary direct approach that so many business owners and marketing managers are used to in other forms of marketing .
Rather , to be effective , these campaigns needs to take an indirect approach ; and it is this indirect approach to marketing that is so misunderstood by , and so frustrating to , many business owners .
In my opinion , this is why many business owners eventually throw up their hands and claim that marketing through social channels is a waste of time .
OK , if the direct route in social media does n’t work well , are there any specific ways in which you can use this media to increase sales leads for your company ?
Yes !
Here are a few specific steps to take :
Develop a personal style –
Your posting style can be funny , serious , professional , or any of a number of other styles .
Just pick one that is natural for you .
Do n’t try to be something – or someone – that you are not .
People really can spot the disingenuous speaker ( or writer ) and that will turn your prospects off .
Speak like you are speaking to a friend –
Imagine you are at a cocktail party .
Most people would n’t walk up to a complete stranger and start selling them something ; at least if they did n’t want the other person to get up and walk away .
Instead , speak to the other person like you were speaking to friend .
Get to know them – what they like and dislike , what they want and need .
Offer solutions .
Point them in the right direction .
Be helpful .
That is how you develop a relationship .
Build out your network –
Many businesses set up a page on , say , Facebook , and then sit back waiting for the multitudes to stop by and “ like ” their page .
Unfortunately , it does n’t work that way .
Social media marketing is a lot like dating : you have to get out there and introduce yourself .
Start with people you already know , and that are already on - line .
Invite them over to your new page and ask them to like , follow , or link - up .
Then , branch out and search for others who match your core demographic and find out where they are hanging out ( hint : search on - line for blogs , forums , groups , etc. ) .
Listen to their conversations .
Comment where appropriate .
Seek out the problems they are having and offer solutions .
Build credibility and trust and they will start to show up on your page .
Think beyond the obvious –
If you ca n’t figure out where your prospects are hanging out , then start liking , following , and linking - up with groups and organizations that are likely filled with your best prospects .
For most off - line businesses , a natural starting point would be pages sponsored by local Chambers of Commerce , business organizations , and community service organizations ( like Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs ) and other non-profits .
Depending on your particular type of business , city government pages might be a good resource as well .
The point is that all of these organizations , and thousands like them , are probably already in the social media circles with their own pages .
Your job is to connect with them , join the conversations and offer value through your postings ( again , DO NOT jump in and start selling here – that activity should be reserved for your home web site ) .
A security alert posted this morning by antivirus vendor Intego reveals that the company has discovered a new Trojan horse that is being carried by pirated copies of iWork '09 circulating on a number of torrent sites .
The Trojan , which Intego has classified as a " serious " risk and named OSX .
Trojan .iServices .A , allows a malicious user to connect to an infected machine and perform various functions , as well as download additional software to the machine .
This software is installed as a startup item ( in / System / Library / StartupItems / iWorkServices , a location reserved normally for Apple startup items ) , where it has read - write - execute permissions for root .
The malicious software connects to a remote server over the Internet ; this means that a malicious user will be alerted that this Trojan horse is installed on different Macs , and will have the ability to connect to them and perform various actions remotely .
The Trojan horse may also download additional components to an infected Mac .
Intego reports that over 20,000 users had downloaded the package as of 6:00 AM Eastern time this morning , and an update to an entry posted on Intego 's Mac Security Blog notes that the Trojan now appears to be actively downloading new code to infected machines and using them to carry out denial - of - service attacks on certain websites .
Update : Despite significant publicity surrounding this incident today , the infected iWork package remains active in the torrent community .
In light of this continued activity , we have moved this report from Page 2 to our front page and are providing instructions for deactivating and removing the Trojan from infected systems .
1 ) ( open Terminal.app )
2 ) sudo su ( enter password )
3 ) rm -r / System / Library / StartupItems / iWorkServices
4 ) rm / private/tmp/.iWorkServices
5 ) rm /usr/bin/iWorkServices
6 ) rm -r / Library / Receipts/iWorkServices.pkg
7 ) killall - 9 iWorkServices
OSX .Trojan.iServices .
A appears to be the first significant OS X Trojan to advance beyond the proof - of - concept or pranking stage to engage in truly malicious behavior .
Update 2 : MacScan has released a free utility to remove the Trojan from infected systems .
Mr Madoff did not respond to reporters ' questions Bernard Madoff , the hedge fund boss accused of a $ 50 bn ( £ 32 bn ) fraud , has put up $ 10 m bail and in effect been placed under house arrest .
Mr Madoff turned up at New York 's federal court to sign some papers but did not answer reporters ' questions .
He signed over his New York flat and his homes in Long Island and Palm Beach , Florida to make up the bail .
He will also be fitted with an electronic tag and will have to seek permission to leave his flat .
In addition to surrendering his own passport , Mr Madoff has also agreed to hand in that of his wife Ruth .
The bail conditions were tightened after Mr Madoff failed to find the required four people to co-sign his bail agreement .
If the correct documents are supplied , Mr Madoff will not have to make another court appearance until 12 January .
Attorney withdraws Also on Wednesday , US Attorney General Michael Mukasey removed himself from the investigation .
It was announced by the Justice Department , which declined to discuss the reasons for the decision .
Mr Mukasey 's son , Marc , has said that he represents a senior official at Mr Madoff 's firm , Frank DiPascali .
" I represent Mr DiPascali , for the record , we are trying to sift through the facts like everybody else , " he said .
The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission - the top US financial regulator - has said there was no evidence that the staff had acted wrongly in failing to pursue suggestions that Mr Madoff was engaged in fraudulent activity .
" I want to emphasize that there is no evidence that anyone is aware of at this point that any personnel did anything wrong , " Christopher Cox said .
' Veil of secrecy ' Meanwhile , Harvey Pitt , a former SEC chairman said it would not be enough to impose greater regulation on hedge funds for its own sake .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" What is really critical is that the veil of secrecy that covers a lot of these hedge funds be removed , " he told the BBC's World Tonight programme .
He added that there has to be , " an effort to understand what effect they are having in the marketplace , what their conduct and activities are like , and whether they raise significant issues for the regulators " .
In response to questions about how regulators should realise when fraud is happening , he said it is not always as obvious as it seems with hindsight .
" People intent on defrauding others have a very high likelihood that they wo n't get caught for a fairly long period of time , " Mr Pitt said .

I noticed this up on Friday over at Qt3 on Friday .
And it ’s my favourite profanity - based coding thing since that list of porn - sites got onto B - 17 all those years back .
Basically , going through ATV - racer Pure ’s file structure , gamers have found an entire folder full with extensive lists of swearing .
In several languages .
What ’s up ?
Well , it appears to be the word - filters for the game ( A Qt3 poster claims it ’s Pure - publisher Disney ’s standard one ) .
I suspect for an age - rating - 3 - and - over game , this was n’t exactly planned .
It ’s quite the list .
And here ’s some of our favourites .
NSFW , clearly .

I like that the English list finds time to crack down on German swearing .
Loads more , obvious , including some we had to look up because American swearing is strange and underdeveloped compared to the mother tongue .
Generally speaking , you suspect the list was pushed up to full size by someone clicking through Urban Dictionary and selecting words at random .
Of course , we ca n’t understand the foreign ones , so RPS ’ overseas contingent should feel free to point out their own .
Er… with some asterisks , because they ’ll turn up in the comments thread to the right and we do n’t want RPS to become Gaming ’s hotbed for non-English - profanity .
... that was the subject line from Sheldonista Andy K , who wrote in to say :
I just wanted to send you an extra thanks .
I had ordered an Artist Edition copy of both the most recent book and " Pugs " .
When the package showed up I saw the little sticky note on the Pugs book that said " 300 " and I got all fanboy excited .
I have been giving your books to my wife as Christmas and Valentine gifts ( we just got married on Dec 4th ) since we were first dating [...]
I had remembered that back on November 26th you had talked about how you had an extra special sketch in that one and I had thought to myself " Boy !
It would be neat to get that . " then promptly forgot about it until I saw that little sticky note with " 300 " on it .
I peeked inside before I wrapped it and it _is_ awesome .
I know she will be even more excited than I am when she gets it .
I will send you a picture of her with the book after Christmas .
So thanks again for a wonderful present and for making me look good on our first married Christmas .
Making good on his promise , Andy sent in this photo , today .
Thanks ,
Andy !
Speaking of Artist Editions ... there are only 21 Artist Edition copies of " Nerds on Parade " left , including that final # 300 with the super - panoramic drawing in it !
You can grab one of the remaining Artist Editions either by itself , or with the rest of the collection !
And with luck , you 'll snag that last one , and get #300 like Andy did !
In the eerie green glow of flashing lasers in a darkened University of Michigan lab , a cylinder on springs moves methodically up and down in a giant tank as water flows over it , simulating a stream .
Whirligigs of illuminated particles form as the water pours over and under the cylinder in rhythmic patterns .
It looks simple , but it 's revolutionary .
This is VIVACE , a device to harness energy in slow - moving water currents across the globe and turn it into electricity .
VIVACE , which mimics the way fish swim in currents , is to debut next year in the Detroit River , powering the light for a new wharf between Hart Plaza and the Renaissance Center .
" Everybody is excited by this , " said Mike Bernitsas , director of the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory at the University of Michigan and inventor of the device .
It 's one of a handful of new techniques - the first in more than 100 years - to use water to create clean , renewable energy .
Since late November , the device has been filmed by Canada 's Discovery Channel and discussed in science blogs , journals and the British Sunday Telegraph .
Unlike water - driven mills , turbines or dams , VIVACE does n't require fast - moving water - most streams on the globe are slow - moving - and does n't harm the environment .
VIVACE means " lively " on a musical score , but in this case is an acronym standing for Vortex - Induced Vibrations for Aquatic Clean Energy .
Bernitsas said he is thinking small so far , but someday an array of 1,000 cylinders offshore could produce the same energy as a large nuclear plant .
A smaller grouping , as big around as a running track and as tall as a two - story building , could power 1,000 homes .
He came up with the idea four years ago and is developing it with a team of more than 30 students and researchers for commercial use .
He patented it and started a company that hopes to manufacture it in Michigan in a few years .
In a stream , small eddies , or vortices , are created above and below an object the current hits .
These vortices alternate , creating an up and down lift .
For example , a moored boat will bob up and down , and a stick caught underwater in a stream will quiver .
Vortices in the air make your car antenna shake if you drive fast .
In air or water , the vibrations can be dangerous if not controlled .
Bernitsas , 57 , has worked for two decades on ways to control these vibrations on offshore oil rigs .
" He was famous for how to kill vortex - induced vibrations , " said U - M doctoral student Jim Chang , who works on VIVACE .
" Now he 'll be known for using them . "
What Bernitsas envisions is groups of cylinders in frames on the ocean bed or in streams , perpendicular to currents .
As the water flow hits the cylinders , it creates vortices that cause the cylinders to move up and down .
That energy drives generators to make electricity , which goes through cables to the electrical grid on land .
The size , number and placement of the cylinders depends on the body of water .
In the Detroit River , he plans 21 cylinders , each about 10 inches in diameter and 16 feet long , suspended in frames mid river on the U.S. side , which will create 3 kilowatts of energy around the clock to power lights on the dock .
This electricity is clean , infinitely renewable - " as long as the sun , the Earth and the moon move as they do now , " he jokes - and does n't harm the environment .
The cylinders will be far enough apart that fish can swim through them and deep enough to avoid ships , boats and fishing lines .
" It 's a really creative project , " said John Kerr , director of economic development for the Detroit / Wayne County Port Authority .
VIVACE 's electricity will be cheaper to produce than solar or wind energy - at 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour - and cheaper than coal plants if controlling their carbon emissions is accounted for , he said , because the devices are simple and require little maintenance .
The cylinders should go into the Detroit River within 12 to 14 months , followed by further testing .
Bernitsas said he can't jump up and down until then , since challenges remain .
" Once it 's in the Detroit River , I 'll be screaming , ' Eureka ! ' " he said .

Cholera Deaths Top 1,500
In Zimbabwe
UN MEDICAL SUPPLIES ARRIVE IN ZIMBABWE AS CHOLERA DEATHS TOP 1,500
New York , Dec 26 2008 12:10 PM
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) is providing local hospitals in Zimbabwe with critical medical supplies and money to treat pregnant women , amid a collapsing health system and the worst cholera outbreak in the sub -Saharan African country ’s history which has now claimed over 1,500 lives .
Over the past week , UNFPA , in partnership with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare , has delivered emergency reproductive health kits , medicine and surgical supplies to the maternity care units of Zimbabwe ’s central hospitals – many of which are on the verge of collapse .
“ The total consignment can meet the needs of a population of about 900,000 for at least three months , ” UNFPA announced in a statement .
The agency has also handed out enough drugs to prevent pregnancy - related complications such as haemorrhaging and eclampsia throughout the country for the next six months , as well as pay incentives to maternity care medics , many of whom have gone without salaries and cannot report to work .
The moves are intended to throw a life - line to maternity units suffering from severe shortages of staff and supplies that have put the lives of thousands of pregnant women at risk .
The Government has declared the cholera outbreak a national emergency , but the healthcare situation remains dire – with many families unable to afford treatment – and may worsen during the current rainy season .
As of 25 December , 1,518 people have died from cholera and another 26,497 cases are suspected , according to the UN World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Large numbers of internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) , ex-farm workers and the poor have lost their livelihoods , leaving them cut off from basic social and healthcare services and dependent on humanitarian aid .
The HIV and AIDS pandemics are compounding the problem .
UNFPA said that more than one million Zimbabweans – an estimated 15.6 per cent of the population – are living with those killer diseases .
HIV prevention and access to safe delivery , including emergency obstetric care services , are critical to their survival .
During a ceremony to hand over emergency kits at Harare - based Parirenyatwa General Hospital , Zimbabwe ’s largest hospital , Gift Malunga , UNFPA ’s Assistant Representative there , urged the Government , donors , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and others to urgently support medical staff .
The UN Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) has already flow in intravenous fluids , drip equipment , essential drugs , midwifery and obstetrics kits to boost the Government ’s cholera response .
On 22 December , four independent UN human rights experts called on Zimbabwe ’s Government and the international community to do more to rebuild the country ’s health system , end the cholera epidemic and ensure adequate food for all people .

Several countries are relying on their own limited reserves of gas
Exports of Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine appear to have completely stopped amid a dispute over gas supplies between the two countries .
Heating systems shut down in some parts of central Europe , as outdoor temperatures plunged to - 10 C or lower .
Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other , and the EU says it wants its own monitors to check the flow of gas .
The EU depends on Russia for about a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 % of which is pumped through Ukraine .
The list of countries that have reported a total halt of Russian supplies via Ukraine includes Romania , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Bosnia - Hercegovina , Bulgaria , Croatia , Greece , Hungary , Macedonia , Serbia , and Austria .
Italy said it had received only 10 % of its expected supply .
The row comes amid a cold snap across Europe that is likely to push up demand for gas .
Bulgaria says it has sufficient supplies for just a few more days .
Many other countries are now tapping strategic reserves , built up to cope with just such a development , says the BBC 's central Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe .
Power stations have been told to switch to fuel oil where possible , while big industrial users have been told to prepare to limit or halt use .
Some 12,000 households in the eastern Bulgarian city of Varna had been left without central heating , authorities said .
Nearby Dobrich was also affected .
In many former Soviet bloc countries whole towns and areas rely on a single centralised heating system , so that when that shuts down , every household is affected .
Venting anger
Russia and Ukraine have been blaming each other for the disruption to Europe 's energy supplies .
Russia 's gas company Gazprom has accused Ukraine of shutting off the final pipeline carrying gas to Europe , but Ukraine 's Naftogaz said that would be impossible , since the taps are in Russia .
Correspondents say the differing versions offered by the two countries show how far apart they are , and that the row is rapidly becoming a means for venting anger caused by poor political relations .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso accused the two countries of taking the EU 's gas supply " hostage " and urged them to resume supplies immediately .
He said the EU was ready to send monitors to the Russian - Ukrainian border , and at Ukrainian exit points , to determine where the shortfalls originated .
Russia has called for such monitors and Ukraine 's prime minister said they could start work " immediately " , according to the AFP news agency .
Talks between Naftogaz and Gazprom aimed at resolving the crisis are due to resume in Moscow on Thursday - after the Christmas public holiday on Wednesday in Russia and Ukraine .
Gazprom will also discuss the matter with the EU on the same day .

Deny me three times , Rick ?
So Rick Warren pulled the anti-gay language from his church Web site .
The site used to explicitly ban gays from membership in the church .
Now the offending language is gone , but you can still find the anti-gay language via Google ’s cache .
So does Rick Warren now welcome gays , all gays , as members of his church ?
Or is he simply embarrassed of his views – embarrassed of God ’s views , per Warren ’s own admission ?
And if Warren is embarrassed of God ’s views , then what is he doing as a public spokesman on religion ?
And whose idea was it to remove the anti-gay language ?
Warren ’s , or Obama’s ?
Coda.fm is a new music torrent indexer that looks surprisingly good for a torrent site , and one that combines great design and functionality like we 've never seen before .
Yet another great way to discover new music - if only the RIAA approved .
Coda.fm is a torrent indexer , meaning that the site does not operate its own tracker .
Those browsing through the site will immediately notice that it ’s unlike any other indexer .
It focuses on the music niche , and has several features that make it stand out when compared to other torrent sites .
The navigation of the site can be compared to some of the better e-commerce sites , with listings of popular and new artists and albums , and the option to browse through different genres .
On top of that , the site has a full - blown recommendation engine that makes it a great tool to discover new music , especially when combined with the album reviews and artist bios .
The site is open to everyone , and users are not required to sign up .
However , those who take a few seconds to create an account can post comments , and track the status of any torrents they upload .
To make sure that the site remains free from spam , every uploaded torrent has to be approved by one of the moderators .
Recommendations , Artist Details and Track Listing
“ I ’m a music lover , ” the Coda.fm founder told TorrentFreak .
“ I always use BitTorrent to get my fix , but I was disappointed with all the public indexers and private trackers . ”
“ I found the experience of searching for music on public trackers very tiresome , always having to navigate through a lot of irrelevant search results and dead torrents , and was tired too of the strict rules of most of the private trackers and the elitism of some of their communities , ” he added .
This encouraged the founder to build Coda.fm , which he released to the public only a few days ago .
The only downside is that the site will be a major target for the RIAA and IFPI , especially because all the torrents are manually approved before they are added to the site .
The “ we are a search engine just like Google ” argument does n’t quite hold up here .
That aside , Coda.fm is truly an amazing site , and it is quite refreshing to see a new indexer that thinks outside the box .

UPDATE : BRAD BLOG Credited for Original Findings in Academic Study ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/5/2008 , 1:13 pm PT
[ Ed Note :
Be sure to see the second of two UPDATES added to the bottom of the story below for Prof.
Scott Althaus email sent in to note that his University of Illinois report does indeed cite The BRAD BLOG , several times , for our original contribution to their findings . ]
Today's " news " that the White House altered Iraq
War documents on its website regarding " the coalition of the willing " is not actually news at all .
The BRAD BLOG broke that story --- the first such scoop of ours to be noticed and picked up by the national media --- back in 2004 , prior to the Presidential Election .
At the time , the noise we helped cause with the revelations led to the WH being forced to restore terrabytes of documents , audio and video to their website in the week prior to the election .
You 're welcome .
We initially made the discovery of the missing WH website documents on the night of the Vice - Presidential Debate , after Dick Cheney claimed to be offended by John Edwards ' assertion that the U.S. had " taken 90 percent of coalition casualties " in Iraq .
Cheney faked indignation in response , arguing that it was " beyond the pale " that Edwards was ignoring the sacrifices of Iraqis .
Not recalling that Iraq was ever named as part of the " Coalition of the Willing , " we checked the WH website , only to find the link to the list still there , but the page itself missing .
Afterwards , we found many other pages , as well as audio and video , had been illegally removed from the website .
Here 's our Special Coverage page , indexing our series of reports on the " White House Website Scrubbing " scandal , beginning in October of 2004 .
We 're very happy , in any case , that it 's now " officially " news , and that the violation of the federal Presidential Records
Act that we noted at the time is also confirmed , now that a professor at a university has found the same , and written about it .
Guess we 'll have to find a professorship somewhere .
Have n't gotten to read his original report yet , but I 'll assume he offered us the hat - tip we 're due .
UPDATE : The above benefit - of - the - doubt , concerning credit where its due , may not be a safe assumption .
The rather irony - laden coverage of professor of political science and communication Scott Althaus ' findings , as reported by the Daily Illini today , follows .
Get a load of this ...
...
On Nov. 24 , Thom Shanker wrote an article in the New York Times , outlining these findings .
Keith Olbermann of MSNBC has also recently mentioned the findings on his show .
When the U.S. invaded Iraq , the U.S. government released a statement on the White House Web site listing the nations involved in the " Coalition of the Willing . "
However , over a period of several years , different versions of the three releases all appear to be originals .
In the case of two releases from the U.S. government Web site , the original document is completely missing from the site .... On Nov. 24 , Thom Shanker wrote an article in the New York Times , outlining these findings .
Keith Olbermann of MSNBC has also recently mentioned the findings on his show .
The feelings students have about the publicity and the findings include mixed reactions .
" I think that it 's cool to see your professor make a finding like this , " said Eric Lavine , senior in LAS [ University of Illinois College of Liberal Arts and Sciences ] .
" However , I am not surprised the Bush Administration was involved in this activity . "
Other students were surprised with the revelation , hoping that mainstream news media would pay closer attention to the findings .
" I was surprised by Professor Althaus 's findings , " said Jenn Rice , senior in LAS .
" I was also surprised the story was not made into a bigger deal in other news sources . "
Sigh ... The BRAD BLOG ... always the bridesmaid ...
UPDATE 12/6/08 : We dropped Prof .
Althaus an email this morning to see if he'd cited our reporting in his findings , and to ask for a copy of the report ( since the student - written Daily Illini article had n't offered an URL for it ) .
He quickly replied back with the following note , mentioning that , indeed , he does cite The BRAD BLOG , as we 'd originally hoped and suspected , in his complete report .
Much appreciated .
His full report , which looks very good , though we 've not yet gotten to read it in full , is posted here .
Dear Brad , I was just in the process of emailing you .
As you know , student reporters are in school to learn and the stories they write can sometimes have unfortunate framing .
The study we conducted focused not on the removal of a single version of the coalition list , but on chronicling the entire revisionary history of the list across all its primary incarnations we could locate on the White House website .
We are certainly aware that others have discovered deletions or isolated edits to the list in the past , and we actually cite your 2004 blog posting in our report .
One argument made in the past has been that these deletions and edits were isolated events .
Our study , therefore , focused on showing the extent of the revisionary history of the list , showing how the list has undergone 7 major changes over time , starting within weeks of the ground invasion , and continuing to 2005 - 2006 .
In particular , we show that not only were the two oldest versions of the list removed from the White House site , but , more troubling , countries were added and removed from the list over time without updating the date on the press releases , making it seem that those countries were always ( or never ) part of the original coalition list .
I would like to invite you to read our complete report ( the Daily Illini article unfortunately did not include the URL ) at http://www.clinecenter.u...edu/airbrushing_history/.
I think you will be very interested in the extent of the revisionary history to the coalition list .
Best regards , Scott
In a followup email , Althaus also noted that while the Daily Illini coverage focused on him as the author of the report , in fact , it was co-authored along with with Kalev Leetaru , the Coordinator of Information Technology and Research at the University of Illinois ' Cline Center for Democracy .
How many tourists in Times Square does it take to light up the “ 2009 ” sign on New Year ’s Eve ?
137,228 .
That ’s how many people it took to generate enough electricity to light up the numerical display that will blaze after the clock strikes midnight and the ball drops over Times Square in Manhattan on Wednesday night .
Beginning Dec. 2 , holiday visitors stopping by the Charmin public restrooms on Broadway and 45th Street could ride the escalator two flights up and hop on one of six stationary bicycles that looked like snowmobiles and were rigged to electric generators .
The generators charged a set of four large batteries that will light the sign and help green the annual event .
Duracell , the battery manufacturing company that set up the “ power lodge , ” said the electricity was generated using rotary technology — pedal power and spinning wheels , similar to systems used on wind farms .
By Dec. 27 , the original goal of 230 pedaled hours had been surpassed by more than 20 percent .
On Sunday , the batteries were transported to a new location for safekeeping until Wednesday night .
Some visitors to the power lodge Monday , like Megan Coakley , 13 , were disappointed they were too late to help fuel Wednesday ’s festivities .
“ It would ’ve been awesome to try the bikes , ” said Miss Coakley , who traveled from Tinton Falls , N.J. , with her twin sister and parents , Beth and John , to visit New York for the day .
Although the bikes are no longer in use and now available for viewing only , visitors to Duracell ’s hub can still recharge gadgets at power terminals , hang out in front of an artificial fireplace or play one of several Nintendo Wiis stationed in the lodge .
Ms. Coakley and her family declined to linger , saying they had game consoles at home .
Jeremy French , 21 , a field manager for Gigunda , the marketing team staffing Duracell ’s lodge , said that the facilities were even popular with local Manhattanites .
“ A group of elderly women came in several times to ride the bike , ” said Mr. French .
“ They brought water bottles and would go at it for 20 minutes or so a day . ”
The “ 2009 ” sign is made up of 608 halogen bulbs that will require 7.25 kilowatt - hours of electricity to light up after the famous ball drop .
By comparison , in 2006 , the average residence in the United States consumed 920 kilowatt - hours per month .
The human - generated electricity will deliver enough juice to keep the bulbs blazing during the televised portion of the evening ’s broadcast , or about 15 minutes .
Afterward , the sign will revert to the utility grid for power for the remainder of the night .
The numerical display is n’t the only New Year ’s Eve sign in Times Square getting a green makeover :
This year ’s dropping ball , made of crystal triangles and illuminated by 32,256 LED bulbs , is 20 percent more energy - efficient than last year ’s glowing sphere .
Human - powered innovation has been popular throughout 2008 : Dance clubs in London and the Netherlands installed piezoelectric flooring to generate power from the motion of dancing revelers , and the East Japan Railway Company recently announced plans to update the platforms of its Tokyo Station with similar materials to harvest kinetic energy generated by crowds to power ticket gates .
Jessica Simpson Wishes She Was God ?
Oh brother .... country singerwas scheduled to be in New York last night to sing " Happy Birthday " toat Macy 's 150th anniversary party .
She was way more than fashionably late , citing the weather as her excuse .
She arrived just as the gig was wrapping up .
When the singer finally arrived at the event , which was attended by celebrities Eva Mendes , Tommy Hilfiger and Martha Stewart , she was very apologetic .
Jessica lamented : " I wish I could be God and control the weather . "
If that was n't bad enough , she went on to say that her boyfriend Tony Romo had hoped that she would not be able to make the event because he had planned a special evening for the two of them .
In true Jessica fashion , she told People magazine : " Tony was just praying that I would n't make it out .
I 'm like , ' Honey , I have to go . ' "
Blah !
We 're guessing that Elmo was thrilled that the singer did n't sing .
Word has it , he had earplugs in his pocket just in case .

Bush Spins Scandalous Neglect of Vets
It ’s not uncommon for Presidents to embellish their accomplishments upon leaving office , but George W. Bush , who will exit the White House leaving the country in the worst shape since Herbert Hoover , has gone a step further , moving past exaggeration into outright lying .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Last month , trying to change the emerging historical consensus about a failed presidency , the White House published two lengthy reports , “ Highlights of Accomplishments and Results of the Administration of George W. Bush , ” and “ 100 Things Americans May Not Know About the Bush Administration Record . ”
One of the surprising claims that stood out among the combined 90 pages of so - called accomplishments was the White House ’s glowing assessment of Bush ’s record on veterans ’ issues .
Bush claims he “ provided unprecedented resources for veterans ” over the past eight years and provided “ the highest level of support for veterans in American history . ”
“ The President also increased the benefits available to those who have served our Nation and transformed the veterans health care system to better serve those who have sacrificed for our freedom , ” both reports claim , adding that he “ instituted reforms for the care of wounded warriors ... and dramatically expanded resources for mental health services . ”
The White House made these claims in the face of what former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld might have called a “ known known ” – that the treatment of veterans returning from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan has been a national disgrace , highlighted most dramatically by the neglect and substandard care given wounded troops at Walter Reed and other military hospitals .
The budget increases that have occurred mostly were enacted over Bush ’s opposition or related to the fact that injuries from the Iraq War far exceeded the administration ’s rosy projections in early 2003 .
The Bush team especially underestimated how many cases of post - traumatic stress disorder to anticipate as well as the number of brain injuries , which have been endemic to the Iraq
War where insurgents made effective use of “ improvised explosive devices , ” or IEDs .
Before Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , documents released by the Department of Veterans Affairs said it expected a maximum of 8,000 cases of post - traumatic stress disorder .
However , according to a study released last year by the RAND Institute , there are more than 320,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars suffering from major depression , PTSD and / or traumatic brain injury .
The report found that the VA has been and continues to be ill - equipped to deal with these cases when soldiers return from combat , especially after multiple tours .
An Army task force last year also found major flaws in the way the VA treated and cared for veterans suffering from traumatic brain injuries .
Bush ’s Record on VA Funding For his part , Bush stacked the VA with political cronies , such as former Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson , who as VA Secretary defended a budget measure that sought major cuts in staffing for healthcare and at the Board of Veterans Appeals ; slashed funding for nursing home care ; and blocked four legislative measures aimed at streamlining the backlog of veterans benefits claims .
Of the 84,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder by VA , only half , about 42,000 , had their disability claim approved by VA .
Instead of expediting PTSD claims , Bush 's political appointees at VA actively fought against mental health claims .
Bush 's appointees also obstructed scientific research into the causes of Gulf War illnesses dating back 18 years to Operation Desert Storm and opposed medical research on treatment for 210,000 of those veterans .
As for funding , Bush proposed a 0.5 percent budget increase for the VA for fiscal year 2006 , which amounted to a “ cruel mockery ” of Bush ’s promises to do everything to support veterans and soldiers , Rep. Lane Evans , D - Illinois , said at the time .
Evans called Bush ’s proposed budget increase for the VA “ grossly inadequate , ” saying it would force the VA to “ ration ” healthcare to veterans .
VA officials had testified in 2005 that the agency needed at least a 13 percent increase to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of war veterans wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan and others who needed long - term mental health care .
In early 2007 , the Washington Post put a spotlight on the human consequences resulting from the combination of Bush ’s wars and the budget squeeze .
The Post published a series of articles documenting the substandard conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center , which is located only 4.7 miles from the White House .
Wounded vets were housed in rooms with moldy walls , leaky plumage and an infestation of vermin , underscoring how out of touch Bush had become regarding the nation ’s veterans .
In response to complaints that some veterans under VA care were being neglected , Nicholson said in March 2007 that such cases were “ anecdotal exceptions . ”
“ When you are treating so many people there is always going to be a linen towel left somewhere , ” he said .
In May 2007 , the AP revealed that while Nicholson was pinching pennies on treatment costs and coping with a $ 1.3 billion budget shortfall , he awarded “ $ 3.8 million in bonuses to top executives in fiscal 2006 ″ — many as much as $ 33,000 .
Simultaneously , Bush was resisting congressional efforts to beef up the VA ’s budget .
In May 2007 , Bush threatened to veto legislation that sought a 10 percent — $ 3.2 billion — increase , calling it too expensive .
Bush proposed a 2 percent increase , far below what lawmakers and VA officials said was needed to treat a dramatic increase in traumatic brain injury and PTSD cases .
After Congress passed the legislation with the higher VA spending , Bush backed down on his veto threat but that was largely due to the fact that every Republican in the Senate with the exception of Jim DeMint of South Carolina , supported the measure .
Amid the growing scandals about substandard VA treatment and inept management , Nicholson resigned in July 2007 .
Suicide Epidemic
Even after Nicholson ’s resignation , the Department of Veterans Affairs continued to be buffeted by scandals , including a cover - up in an epidemic of veterans ’ suicides and attempted suicides .
Last year , internal VA e-mails surfaced that showed how top agency officials tried to conceal the information from the public about the sudden increase in suicides and attempted suicides among veterans that were treated or sought help at VA hospitals around the country .
And last November , internal watchdogs discovered 500 benefits claims in shredding bins at the 41 of the 57 regional VA offices around the country .
Paul Sullivan , the executive director of Veterans for Common Sense , a veterans ’ advocacy group that sued the VA in federal court , said attempts by the White House to portray Bush as an advocate for veterans is beyond shameful .
“ Bush is the worst failure for our veterans since Hoover , ” Sullivan said , expressing shock that the President “ would shamefully continue his legacy of lies to the American people as he and his political cronies are forced to leave office on Jan. 20 . ” Sullivan disputed some of Bush ’s claims as misleading , such as the assertion that he doubled funding for the VA .
“ However , President Bush failed to disclose that the number of veterans seeking VA healthcare doubled , from 2.7 million to 5.5 million , and that rising healthcare inflation actually resulted in a net decrease in spending per veteran by VA during the past eight years , ” he said .
“ If not for the intervention of Congress to substantially increase VA funding beyond Bush 's inadequate budget requests , especially in the past two years , the situation would have deteriorated from a serious crisis to a catastrophe at VA . ”
Sullivan , who worked at the VA for five years as a project manager , said Bush failed to the implement the VA ’s proposed Mental Health Strategic Plan , a program aimed at identifying and quickly treating veterans suffering from major depression and were on the verge of suicide .
“ Without implementation , funding , and oversight of the plan , several suicidal Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans were illegally refused emergency medical care by VA , ” Sullivan said .
“ Veterans for Common Sense brought this issue to the attention of VA , and VA refused to act .
“ Therefore , VCS sued VA for turning away suicidal veterans .
After we filed our lawsuit , and only after we filed our lawsuit , the VA began a suicide prevention hotline .
In the first 15 months of operation , the hotline received 85,000 calls and rescued more than 2,100 suicidal veterans . ”
As of September 2008 , 330,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans have filed disability claims to the VA , according to the agency .
Yet , 54,000 are still waiting for the VA to confirm their claims were received .
The average wait for a disability claim is more than six months .
Additionally , according to VA 's Inspector General , 25 percent of the VA 's 5.5 million patients have to wait more than 30 days for a doctor ’s appointment .
As costly as the treatment of Iraq and Afghan war veterans already has become , Bush is leaving an even greater budget hole for his successors .
In the book , The Three Trillion Dollar War , authors Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes wrote that future treatment of veterans would continue adding to the total cost of Bush ’s conflicts and would put extraordinary stresses on the VA .
“ Even in 2000 , before the war , ” they wrote , the VA was the subject of numerous Government Accountability Office studies that “ identified long - standing problems , including large backlogs of pending claims , lengthy processing time for initial claims , high rates of error in processing claims , and inconsistency across regional offices . ”
But the problems only have grown worse .
“ In a 2005 study , ” Stiglitz and Blimes wrote , “ the GAO found that the time to complete a veteran ’s claim varied from 99 days at the Salt Lake City Office to 237 days in Honolulu .
In a 2006 study , GAO found that 12 percent of claims were inaccurate . ”
Homeless Veterans
The White House reports on Bush ’s so - called accomplishments also claimed that Bush “ reduced the number of homeless veterans by nearly 40 percent from 2001 to 2007 .
Established VA homeless - specific programs , which constitute one of the largest integrated networks of homeless treatment and assistance services in the country . ”
That statement rankled Aaron Glantz , a journalist , author and the Rosalynn Carter Fellow for Mental Health Journalism at the Carter Center .
“ What kind of President pats himself on the back with 200,000 veterans sleeping homeless on the street every night ? ” Glantz said in an interview .
“ What kind of administration puts out self - congratulatory press releases while over 6,000 veterans commit suicide every year ?
“ We can only hope that President elect Barack Obama takes a very different course once he 's in office .
Otherwise , our government will repeat the shameful disgrace that was its treatment of wounded veterans returning home from Vietnam . ”
Glantz spent three years in Iraq reporting on the war and recently published The War Comes Home : Washington 's Battle against America 's Veterans , which documents the heart - wrenching stories of homeless Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans and the plight of other veterans who , upon returning home , have been neglected by the country they served .
Last week , Glantz published a report , “ Did You Know 200,000 Vets Are Sleeping on the Streets ? , ” that contradicts the Bush self - congratulations about veterans ’ homelessness .
On his transition Web site , change.gov , Obama said he intends to “ Fix the Benefits Bureaucracy :
Hire additional claims workers , and improve training and accountability so that VA benefit decisions are rated fairly and consistently .
Transform the paper benefit claims process to an electronic one to reduce errors and improve timeliness . ”
To meet that challenge , Obama tapped retired Gen. Eric Shinseki , a Vietnam War veteran who sustained combat - related injuries , to lead the VA .
Shinseki made headlines back in February 2003 when he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and predicted that several hundred thousand soldiers would likely be needed to maintain order in post- invasion Iraq .
After facing public criticism from Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and his deputy , Paul Wolfowitz , Shinseki was forced into early retirement .
His judgment has since been vindicated , both in regard to likely ethnic strife in Iraq and on the costliness of the war .
Yet , Bush ’s White House is now hoping that its last - minute propaganda barrage will , if nothing else , cloud some of the memories about its failures and misjudgments .
Bush ’s critics , however , are not willing to so easily forget .
“ Contrary to his Administration 's latest spin , George W. Bush 's legacy on veterans is one of shameful neglect , ” author Glantz said .
“ Rather than care for the tens of thousands of American service members wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Bush Administration has thrown up a series of barriers to prevent veterans from getting the care they need . ”
Simply put – White House propaganda aside – veterans ’ healthcare has become worse , not better , under Bush ’s leadership .

LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) --
Attention audiophiles , old - school vinyl listeners and the very rich :
Do we have a piece of stereo equipment for you .
Angelis Labor 's Gabriel turntable is made from bronze and steel and can be customized with up to four arms .
It 's called the Gabriel Turntable , and you wo n't find it at Wal - Mart .
Crafted in limited editions by an Italian company that will engrave each buyer 's name on it , the Gabriel is to a Kenner Close 'N Play what a Ferrari is to a Yugo .
" When I look at it , " said Placido Pappalardo , co-owner of maker Angelis Labor , " the only word that comes to mind is love . "
Angelis Labor executives proudly unveiled their turntable last week at the International Consumer Electronics
Show , where its retro appearance and mechanical design set it apart from the cacophony of digital gadgets on display .
That , and the price : up to $ 64,000 , depending on which model is ordered .
The Gabriel is made from aluminum , bronze and stainless steel and can be customized with up to four arms .
Each arm is made in a Modena , Italy , factory that also builds Ferrari parts .
A one - armed model costs about $ 27,000 , while a four - armed version runs for $ 64,000 , including installation .
Watch the Gabriel in action »
" It is a thing of beauty , " said Jonathan Valin , executive editor of The Absolute Sound magazine , who saw the turntable in Las Vegas but did n't get to hear it .
" Whether it is a world - class turntable , I do n't know . "
Why would anyone want four arms on their record player ?
Different pickup cartridges produce different types of sound , and some audiophiles like to match their record players ' arms to different genres of music without going through the hassle of swapping cartridges .
The Gabriel is a magnetic suspension turntable , meaning that calibrated magnets are used to lift the platter a few millimeters above its bearings .
This helps reduce vibration , which can affect sound quality .
" It 's as if the whole turntable is floating in air , " Pappalardo said .
The entire device rests on a custom - built , vibration - dampening table .
It takes half a day for an Angelis Labor technician to set the whole thing up and calibrate the turntable .
The Gabriel is not yet in stores .
Angelis Labor is now seeking a distributor to sell the turntable through specialty audio retailers who can demonstrate it personally for customers .
Unlike most manufacturers , the company has no interest in selling it on the Web .
" We will never allow anybody to sell our products on the Internet , " said Pappalardo , perhaps the only business executive at CES this year to make such a statement .
The Gabriel is not the only four - armed record player on the market .
Nor is it the most expensive : the German - made , 770 - pound Clearaudio Statement turntable costs twice as much .
But with vinyl making a comeback , the Gabriel may appeal to audiophiles who believe that listening to old records on a high - end player is like going back in time .
" They 're not just eye candy .
They actually sound better , " said Valin , who prefers analog sound to the digital sound produced by CDs and MP3 files .
But even Valin wonders what kind of person would pay $ 64,000 for a turntable .
" You 'd have to be very wealthy , very much into vinyl or very crazy , " he said .
" Or all three . "
During their research project , undergraduates Francis Vuijsje , Meta de Hoon , and Remco van der Burg ( left to right ) , discovered an extrasolar planet orbiting a fast - rotating hot star .
Threeundergraduate students have discovered a large planet orbiting a fast - rotatingstar .
Extrasolar planet discoveries like this have become common , but this oneis unusual both for who found it and the type of star it orbits .
" It isexciting not just to find a planet , but to find one as unusual as this one ; itturns out to be the first planet discovered around a fast - rotating star , andit 's also the hottest star found with a planet , " said one of the planet ' sdiscoverers , Meta de Hoon of Leiden University in The Netherlands .
The otherLeiden - student team members included Remco van der Burg and Francis Vuijsje .
The planet , which is about five times as massive as Jupiter , circles its host star every 2.5 days .
It lies at only three percent of the Earth - sun distance from itsstar , making it very hot and much larger than many otherplanets .
The hoststar is about 12,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 6,700 degrees Celsius ) .
Forcomparison , the part of the sun we see reaches temperatures of 10,000 degrees F ( 5,500 degrees C ) .
The planet is officially tagged as OGLE2 - TR - L9b .
" Butamongst ourselves we call it ReMeFra - 1 , after Remco , Meta , and myself , " Vuijsjesaid .
Thestudents detected the exoplanet while testing a method for investigating lightfluctuations of thousands of stars in the OGLE database in an automated way .
The planethas not been seen directly .
But the brightness of one of the stars decreasedfor two hours every 2.5 days by about one percent , suggesting a planet wastransiting in front of the star as seen from an earthly point of view .
Follow - upobservations with ESO 's Very Large Telescope in Chile confirmed that the dip inlight was caused by a planet passing in front of the star , blocking part of thestarlight at regular intervals .
" Thisis the first planet found around a fast - rotating star , because it is verydifficult to confirm planets around these objects , " the project supervisor Ignas Snellen of Leiden told SPACE.com .
He added , " So there must be many planets orbiting fast - spinningstars , but they are just difficult to find .
This is because the fast spinmakes it difficult to measure the stellar ' wobble ' needed to determine the massof the object orbiting it , and confirming it to be a planet . "
Most of the300 - plus exoplanets identified to date were detected by the so - called radialvelocity method , in which astronomers look for a star 's wobble produced by thegravitational tug of an orbiting planet .
But the transit method of detection isgaining steam .
And recently , the firstactual photos of planets around other stars were made .
Thediscovery will be detailed in a forthcoming issue of the journal Astronomyand Astrophysics .
There are some images that simply need no elaboration .
This is one of them .
It ’s a prayer session in a government building in Belgrade in May 1999 , taken after the Yugoslav government graciously agreed to release three American soldiers it had taken hostage .
From left to right : Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , who was later charged with war crimes but died before his trial ended ; the Rev. Jesse Jackson ; and U.S. Rep .
Rod Blagojevich , who is now governor of Illinois and facing federal corruption charges for allegedly trying to sell Barack Obama ’s vacant Senate seat , among other things .
Where is the government 's bank - bailout money going ?
In part to pay for Wall Street banker Peter Kraus 's $ 37 million Park Avenue spread .
Kraus had excellent timing .
He signed on as a top executive at Merrill Lynch in May , negotiating a $ 50 million pay package , with much of that guaranteed if the company was sold .
He did n't officially start until September .
A couple of days later , Merrill CEO John
Thain sold the company to Bank of America for $ 50 billion , triggering a $ 25 million payout under Kraus 's contract .
Bank of America got a $ 25 billion capital injection from the government .
Kraus resigned and collected his cash , taking a job as CEO of AllianceBernstein , a money - management firm .
And then he bought , for an estimated $ 37 million , an apartment at 720 Park Avenue from Democratic fundraisers Carl Spielvogel and Barbaralee Diamonstein - Spielvogel .
Let 's be clear : Kraus got this apartment fair and square :
He suckered Merrill Lynch into a pay guarantee , and had the gall to hold Merrill and Bank of America to his contract , even though he only worked a couple of days .
Bankers deserve bonuses — but only when they really earn them .
Thain , who arguably saved Merrill Lynch from the disastrous fate of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns , declined to seek a bonus this year , but he would have been justified in getting one .
Kraus got a bonus , but he did n't earn it .
He did nothing illegal .
He just did something unseemly .
The 5 - bedroom spread technically belongs to Kraus 's wife , who was listed as the purchaser .
But given the circumstanced of its sale , I like to think it belongs to all of us .
Behold the splendor of the People 's Palace .
Barclays existing shareholders are not universally overjoyed at the deal it has struck with the Abu Dhabi and Qatar .
Apart from anything else , if Barclays had raised the capital from HM Treasury - from all of us as taxpayers - it would have sold the new shares at just above 189 p per share ( assuming that it could have had the capital on the same terms as Lloyds TSB ) .
Now that price of 189p is almost a quarter higher than the price which Qatar and Abu Dhabi is in effect paying for 1.8bn new Barclays shares ( which they 'll receive when the mandatorily convertible notes are converted into shares before June 30 next year ) .
For the avoidance of doubt , Qatar and Abu Dhabi are paying much less than what was on offer to Barclays from the Treasury , from taxpayers , just over a fortnight ago .
So the wealth of Barclays ' existing shareholders has been eroded by the refusal of Barclays to take the money on offer from taxpayers .
And it 's worth noting that the Treasury was not undermining the important pre-emption rights of existing shareholders in the way that the deal with Abu Dhabi and Qatar has done .
The Treasury was offering to underwrite the issue of new shares at 189 p , but taxpayers would have had the ability to buy the lot at that price .
That 's very different from what Barclays has announced today .
Its existing shareholders have only been given the right to buy a fraction of the new equity on offer .
Barclays ' big investors ( and only the big ones ) can today purchase up to £ 1.5 bn of the mandatorily convertible notes , which is the equivalent of buying new shares at 153.3 p each .
They have no ability to claw back the £ 2.8bn of these notes that have been sold to Qatar and Abu Dhabi at that low price .
And , as I said in my earlier note ( " Why Barclays prefers Abu Dhabi to GB " ) , existing shareholders do n't get even a crumb of the attractive warrants sold to Abu Dhabi and Qatar with the £ 3bn of reserve capital instruments ( these warrants can be converted into 1.5 bn new Barclays shares at any time in the next five years , at a conversion price of 197.8 p ) .
What 's more Barclays is paying a whacking coupon , loads of income , to Abu Dhabi and Qatar .
They get 9.75 % on the convertible notes , and 14 % ( oh so loverly , a time of falling interest rates ) on the reserve capital instruments .
And the 14 % coupon is tax deductible ( and , before you ask , the coupon on the prefs being sold by HBOS , Lloyds TSB and RBS to the Treasury is not tax deductible ) .
That means we as British taxpayers are subsidising the payment to these oil - rich states to the tune of £ 120 m per annum - which presumably wo n't please Alistair Darling at a time when tax revenues are too tight to mention .
Oh , and by the way , while Qatar and Abu Dhabi are receiving this fat income stream , Barclays ' existing shareholders have been told they can't have a dividend for the second half of this year ( bye bye to £ 2bn ) .
So , to re-state the bloomin ' obvious , Barclays is paying an arm and a couple of legs for this money from Abu Dhabi and Qatar ( with a little bit of a contribution from British taxpayers ) , when it could probably have paid just one arm and one leg for the money from the Treasury , from taxpayers .
Why has it been so desperate to avoid taking taxpayers ' cash ?
Well , it wants to avoid making itself vulnerable to being bossed around by the chancellor and prime minister - which it fears would have happened it had taken taxpayers ' moolah .
But what 's really at stake ?
Is this about protecting its right and ability to pay many millions of pounds , even tens of millions , to its superstar bankers ?
After all , Barclays - following its takeover of the US bits of bombed - out Lehman - is in some ways more investment bank , more Wall Street , than retail bank these days .
And , famously , Bob Diamond , the head of Barclays Capital - its investment banking arm - has received double figure millions in annual remuneration for some years now .
I 've already been rung this morning by sore investors and bankers who allege that Barclays has tapped Abu Dhabi and Qatar because it does n't want Gordon Brown and Darling putting a ceiling on what it can pay its top execs .
Barclays tells me that it is motivated by a desire to protect its commercial freedom , which is about more than how it rewards its stars , but also includes that cherished freedom .

Scala is clearly an interesting language , well suited for showing off nifty new ideas in language theory and innovation , but at the end of the day , for it to be of any " real " use , it has to be able to meet practicing developers halfway and have some applicability in the " real world . "
Now that we 've looked at some of the core features of the language , can recognize some of Scala 's linguistic flexibility , and have witnessed Scala in action creating DSLs , it 's time to start reaching out to the environments that real applications use and show how Scala fits .
We 'll begin this new phase of the series by starting with the heart of most Java™ applications : the Servlet API .
A review of servlets
Recall , if you will , from your Servlet 101 classes and tutorials , that the heart of the servlet environment is essentially a client - server exchange over a socket ( typically port 80 ) using the HTTP protocol .
The client can be any " User - Agent " ( as defined by the HTTP specification ) and the server is a servlet container that finds , loads , and executes methods on a class I write that ultimately must implement the javax .
servlet .
Servlet interface .
About this series Ted Neward dives into the Scala programming language and takes you along with him .
In this new developerWorks series , you 'll learn what all the recent hype is about and see some of Scala 's linguistic capabilities in action .
Scala code and Java code will be shown side by side wherever comparison is relevant , but ( as you 'll discover ) many things in Scala have no direct correlation to anything you 've found in Java -- and therein lies much of Scala 's charm !
After all , if Java could do it , why bother learning Scala ?
Typically , the practicing Java developer does n't write classes that implement the interface directly .
Because the initial servlet specification expected to provide a generic API for other protocols beyond HTTP , the servlet namespace was split into two parts :
A " generic " package ( javax . servlet )
) An HTTP - specific one ( javax.servlet.http )
As a result , some basic functionality was implemented in the generic package in an abstract base class called javax .
servlet .
GenericServlet ; then further HTTP - specific functionality was implemented in the derived class javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet , which typically served as the base class for the actual " meat " of the servlet .
HttpServlet provided a complete implementation of Servlet , delegating GET requests to an expected - to - be- overridden doGet method , POST requests to an expected - to - be- overridden doPost method , and so on .
Hello , Scala .
Hello , Servlets .
Naturally , the first servlet anyone writes is the ubiquitous " Hello , World " servlet ; Scala 's first servlet example should be no different .
Recall from the introductory servlet tutorials of many years ago that the basic Java " Hello , World " servlet simply prints out the HTML response in Listing 1 :
Listing 1 .
The expected HTML response
< HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE > Hello , Scala !</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY > Hello , Scala !
This is a servlet .</ BODY > </HTML >
Writing a simple servlet to do this is almost absurdly easy in Scala and looks almost identical to its Java equivalent , as shown in Listing 2 :
Listing 2 . Hello , Scala servlet !
import javax.servlet.http.{HttpServlet , HttpServletRequest => HSReq , HttpServletResponse => HSResp} class HelloScalaServlet extends HttpServlet { override def doGet ( req : HSReq , resp : HSResp ) = resp.getWriter ( ) .print ( " < HTML > " + " < HEAD >< TITLE > Hello , Scala !</ TITLE ></HEAD > " + " < BODY > Hello , Scala !
This is a servlet .</ BODY > " + " </HTML > " ) }
Notice that I use some well - placed import aliases to shorten up the type names of the request and response types ; other than that , this looks almost identical to the Java servlet version .
When compiling this remember to include a reference to the servlet - api.jar ( which usually ships with the servlet container ; in the Tomcat 6.0 release , it hides in the lib subdirectory ) or the servlet API types wo n't be found .
This is n't quite ready for use yet ; according to the servlet spec , it must be deployed into a Web application directory ( or in a .war file ) with a web.xml deployment descriptor that describes what URL this servlet should be married up against .
For such a simple example , it 's easiest to use a pretty simple URL to go along with it , shown in Listing 3 :
Listing 3 . web.xml , the deployment descriptor
<!DOCTYPE web -app PUBLIC "-// Sun Microsystems , Inc.//DTD
Web Application 2.3//EN " " http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd " > < web-app > < servlet > < servlet-name>helloWorld</servlet-name > < servlet-class>HelloScalaServlet</servlet-class > </ servlet > < servlet - mapping > < servlet-name>helloWorld</servlet-name > < url - pattern>/sayHello</url-pattern > </servlet - mapping > </web-app>
From this point forward , I 'm going to assume that readers will adapt / modify the deployment descriptor as necessary because it really has nothing to do with Scala .
Not surprisingly , well - formed HTML looks a great deal like well - formed XML ; this is one place where Scala 's XML literal support can make writing this servlet much , much easier .
( See the article " Scala and XML " in Related topics . )
Instead of embedding the message directly in a String passed to the HttpServletResponse , Scala can achieve a ( simplistic , perhaps overly so ) separation of logic and presentation by making use of this support to put the message itself into an XML instance and passing that back :
Listing 4 . Hello , Scala servlet !
import javax.servlet.http.{HttpServlet , HttpServletRequest => HSReq , HttpServletResponse => HSResp} class HelloScalaServlet extends HttpServlet { def message = < HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE > Hello , Scala !</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY > Hello , Scala !
This is a servlet .</ BODY > </ HTML > override def doGet ( req : HSReq , resp : HSResp ) = resp.getWriter ( ) . print ( message ) }
Because of Scala 's inline expression evaluation facilities where XML literals are concerned , this means that making the servlet a bit more interesting becomes much easier .
For example , adding the current date to the message becomes as easy as adding a Calendar expression into the XML itself , something along the lines of :
{ Text ( java.util.Calendar.getInstance().getTime ( ) .toString ( ) ) }
Or if that feels a little too verbose , something like Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . Hello , timed Scala servlet !
import javax.servlet.http.{HttpServlet , HttpServletRequest => HSReq , HttpServletResponse => HSResp} class HelloScalaServlet extends HttpServlet { def message = < HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE > Hello , Scala !</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY > Hello , Scala !
It 's now { currentDate }</ BODY > </ HTML > def currentDate = java.util.Calendar.getInstance().getTime ( ) override def doGet ( req : HSReq , resp : HSResp ) = resp.getWriter ( ) . print ( message ) }
In essence , the Scala compiler is stitching together the XML object message into a single scala.xml .
Node , then turning that into a String when passed into the print method of the response 's Writer .
Do n't downplay this — in a very real way , this is a powerful separation of presentation from logic that takes place entirely inside of one class .
The XML message will be compile - time checked to make sure that it is syntactically correct and well - formed , something we do n't get with standard servlets ( or JSP , for that matter ) .
Thanks to Scala 's type - inferencing nature , the actual type information around message and currentDate can be left off , making this almost read like a dynamic language a la Groovy / Grails .
For a first outing , it 's not a bad result .
Of course , read - only servlets are pretty boring .
Hello , Scala .
These are parameters .
Most servlets do n't just hand back simple messages like static content or the current date and time ; they take POST ed form content , examine the contents , and respond accordingly .
For example , perhaps the Web application wishes to know the identity of the individual using it and asks for a first name and last name :
Listing 6 . Challenge !
< HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE >Who are you ?</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY >
Who are you ?
Please answer : < FORM action= " / scalaExamples/sayMyName " method = " POST " >
Your first name : < INPUT type =" text " name = " firstName " />
Your last name : < INPUT type =" text " name = " lastName " /> < INPUT type =" submit " /> </ FORM > </ BODY > </HTML >
OK , so it 's not going to win any user - interface design contests , but it serves the purpose : it 's an HTML form and it will be looking to send its data to a new Scala servlet ( bound against the sayMyName relative URL ) .
The data , as per the servlet specification , will be stored in a name - value - pair collection , obtained via the HttpServletRequest.getParameter ( )
API call where we pass in the name of the FORM element as a parameter to the API call .
It would be relatively easy to do the direct translation from the Java code like in the servlet in Listing 7 :
Listing 7 . Response ! ( v1 )
class NamedHelloWorldServlet1 extends HttpServlet { def message ( firstName : String , lastName : String ) = < HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE >Hello , { firstName} {lastName} !</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY > Hello , { firstName} {lastName} !
It is now { currentTime} .</ BODY > </ HTML > def currentTime = java.util.Calendar.getInstance().getTime ( ) override def doPost ( req : HSReq , resp : HSResp ) = { val firstName = req.getParameter ( " firstName " ) val lastName = req.getParameter (" lastName " ) resp.getWriter().print ( message ( firstName , lastName ) ) } }
But this starts to take away from some of the advantages of the message separation I cited before because now the definition of the message has to take the parameters firstName and lastName explicitly ; this could get unwieldy if the number of elements used inside the response gets larger than three or four .
Plus , the doPost method is going to have to itself extract each and every one of those parameters before handing them off to message for display — that kind of coding gets tedious and is potentially prone to error .
One way to approach this is to factor the extraction of the parameters and the invocation of the doPost method itself into a base class , such as in version 2 shown in Listing 8 :
Listing 8 . Response ! ( v2 )
abstract class BaseServlet extends HttpServlet { import scala.collection.mutable .{Map =>
MMap} def message : scala.xml .
Node ; protected var param : Map [ String , String ] = Map.empty protected var header : Map [ String , String ] = Map.empty override def doPost ( req : HSReq , resp : HSResp ) = { //
Extract parameters // val m = MMap [ String , String ] ( ) val e = req.getParameterNames ( ) while ( e.hasMoreElements ( ) ) { val name = e.nextElement ( ) .asInstanceOf [ String ] m += ( name -> req.getParameter( name ) ) } param = Map.empty ++ m //
Repeat for headers ( not shown ) // resp.getWriter ( ) . print ( message ) } } class NamedHelloWorldServlet extends BaseServlet { override def message = < HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE >Hello , { param ( " firstName " ) } { param ( " lastName " ) }!</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY > Hello , { param ( " firstName " ) } { param ( " lastName " ) } !
It is now {currentTime} .
</ BODY > </ HTML > def currentTime = java.util.Calendar.getInstance().getTime ( ) }
This version keeps the actual display servlet relatively simple ( compared to its predecessor ) and has the added advantage that the param and header maps are immutable .
( Note that we could have defined param to be a method that referenced the request object , but that request object would have had to have been defined as a field , which would have introduced a concurrency concern in a big way because the servlet container intrinsically considers each of the do methods to be re-entrant . )
Of course , error handling is generally an important part of the processing of a Web application FORM and the fact that Scala , as a functional language , holds that everything is an expression means that we can write message to be either the results page ( assuming that we like the input ) or an error page ( if we do n't ) .
Thus a validation function that checks the non-empty status of firstName and lastName could look something like Listing 9 :
Listing 9 . Response ! ( v3 )
class NamedHelloWorldServlet extends BaseServlet { override def message = if ( validate ( param ) ) < HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE >Hello , { param ( " firstName " ) } { param ( " lastName " ) } !
</ TITLE ></HEAD > < BODY > Hello , { param ( " firstName " ) } { param ( " lastName " ) } !
It is now { currentTime} .</ BODY > </ HTML > else < HTML > < HEAD >< TITLE >Error !</ TITLE ></HEAD> < BODY >How can we be friends if you do n't tell me your name ?!?</ BODY > </ HTML > def validate ( p : Map [ String , String ] ) : Boolean = { p foreach { case ( " firstName " , " " ) => return false case ( " lastName " , " " ) => return false // case ( " lastName " , v ) => if ( v.contains ( " e " ) ) return false case ( _ , _ ) => ( ) } true } def currentTime = java.util.Calendar.getInstance().getTime ( ) }
Notice how pattern matching ( with its ability to bind against either raw values such as the previous case or to bind to a local variable such as a case where we want to exclude anybody with an " e " in their name like in the previous comment ) makes it easy to write fairly straightforward validation rules .
There 's obviously more that could be done here .
One of the classic problems that plagues Java Web applications is the SQL injection attack , carried via unescaped SQL command characters passed in via a FORM and concatenated against raw strings containing SQL structure before being executed against the database .
Verifying that the FORM input is correct could be done using the regular expression support in the scala .
regex package or even some of the parser combinator ideas discussed in the last three articles in this series .
In fact , the whole validation process could be lifted into the base class using a default validate implementation that simply returns true by default .
( Just because Scala is a functional language , let 's not overlook good object design approaches . )
Conclusion
While it 's not nearly as full featured as some of the other Java Web frameworks out there , this tiny little Scala servlet framework I 've created here serves two basic purposes :
To demonstrate that Scala 's features can be leveraged in some interesting ways to make programming for the JVM easier .
To serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of using Scala for Web applications , which naturally leads to a reference to the " lift " framework , referenced in the Related topics section .
That 's it for this installment ; until next time , enjoy !

It looks like Stardock 's strategy of ignoring game pirates has paid off , as the publisher has announced that it has sold around 500,000 units of Sins of a Solar Empire .
Broken down , this number includes 400,000 via retail , with the rest being sold through digital distribution .
Part of the reason for the games success in the supposedly struggling PC market is its low system requirements , explains Stardock CEO Brad Wardell .
" Sins of a Solar Empire was explicitly designed to work on a wide variety of machines , " Wardell told Gamasutra .
" It will run on a four - year - old video card , and it looks great . "
" You make those kinds of design decisions ( to lower systems specs ) , and you greatly increase the number of people who can play your game , " he added .

When I use Emacs for my work , I usually have dozens of buffers open : every file I edited , plus different consoles , process outputs etc .
Emacs allows to handle this volume easily because it does n’t have stupid tabs which I need to scroll and click , but instead every buffer is accessible by entering a couple of chars from its name .
The main problem I encountered is that when I ’m working simultaneously on several versions of the same project , I ’m starting to have many similarly named buffers .
I already set up uniquify plugin to have file names prepended with directory names , but the risk of changing a file from other version of project is still high .
The obvious solution to get rid of unneeded buffers is to close Emacs and open again , but for Emacs this is analogous to OS reboot — ideally , you do n’t need this .
The better solution is to close all files that were opened from a specific directory .
What is the easiest way to do this ?
As I ’ve learned from Emacs wiki , the Ibuffer plugin offers a great interface for such operations .
So , how I delete all buffers that has files opened from a particular location ?
First , I ’m opening Ibuffer :
M-x ibuffer - list - buffers
A fancy colored table of buffers is shown .
Now I ’m marking buffers having a filename to satisfy a specified regular expression criteria : % f and then pressing D to delete them .
That ’s all !

Over five years ago Sean Goldman was abducted to Brazil by his mother Bruna Bianchi Goldman and her parents , Silvana Bianchi Ribeiro and Raimundo Ribeiro .
After her death in August 2008 , the man recently married to Bruna , Joao Paulo Lins e Silva , was shockingly awarded custody by a Brazilian court .
Ever since the kidnapping , David Goldman has waged a legal battle to have Sean returned as required by U.S. law and an international treaty signed by both the U.S. and Brazil .
Even after a Federal Judge ordered Sean 's immediate return in June 2009 and cited the violent form of parental alienation Sean has been subjected to , Sean remains with his abductors with no end in sight to this gross injustice .
On June 16th , 2004 , Bruna Goldman traveled with her son Sean from their home in New Jersey to her native Brazil .
The next day , she informed her husband David Goldman that their marriage was over and that she and Sean would be living in Brazil .
This unilateral action was a violation of the Hague Treaty on International Child Abduction , a treaty signed by many countries including both the United States and Brazil .
It states that Sean should have been returned to the United States for a joint custody hearing within six weeks .
Instead , Bruna Goldman was granted custody by a local court in Brazil .
According to the United States Department of State and the Brazilian Central Authority , this decision was also a violation of the treaty .
However , the Brazilian Central Authority which oversees the treaty is advisory only .
As a result , David began the appeals process , which in Brazil can take years to complete .
In August 2008 , Bruna died tragically in Brazil .
After Bruna 's passing , David Goldman assumed he would finally be reunited with Sean .
Unfortunately , David finds himself in the midst of another custody battle , this time with Bruna 's new husband , Joao Paulo Lins e Silva .
Mr. Lins e Silva has also filed to replace David Goldman 's name with his own on a birth certificate issued for Sean in Brazil , claiming " socio-affective paternity " which would effectively erase Sean 's true paternity .
Since 2004 , David Goldman has fought a desperate and expensive legal battle for custody of his son , first with his wife and now against Joao Paulo Lins e Silva , a prominent lawyer specializing in international family law and child abduction .
It has been over five years since Sean 's abduction , almost a year and a half since Sean 's mother 's death , and almost six months since a federal judge ordered Sean returned to his father in the US , and yet father and son remain apart as the seemingly endless appeals process drags on in Brazil .
It is long past time that we end this nightmare for the Goldman family and reunite this father and son .

Quatro anos atras , Sean Goldman foi sequestrado pela propria mae , Bruna Bianchi Goldman , e levado para o Brasil .
Recentemente , apos sua tragica morte , seu segundo marido conseguiu , para a surpresa de todos , a custodia temporaria de Sean atraves da Justica do Estado do Rio de Janeiro .
Desde o sequestro do filho , David Goldman ( o pai ) vem lutando para recuperar seu filho , conforme decisao da Justica Americana e de acordo com Convencoes Internacionais , nas quais tanto o Brasil como os Estados Unidos sao signatorios .
Em 16 de Junho de 2004 , Bruna Goldman viajou com seu filho Sean desde sua casa em Nova Jersey para sua terra natal , Brasil .
No dia seguinte , ela telefonou informando ao marido , David Goldman , que o casamento estava acabado e que ela e Sean ficariam morando no Brasil .
Essa acao totalmente unilateral foi considerada uma violacao da Convencao de Haia , no que diz respeito a Sequestro Internacional de Criancas , um tratado assinado por varios paises , inclusive Brasil e Estados Unidos .
Esse tratado diz , claramente , que Sean deveria ter retornado a sua casa nos Estados Unidos para a Audiencia de Custodia .
Ao inves disso , Bruna ganhou a custodia de Sean atraves da Vara da Familia no Rio de Janeiro .
De acordo com o Departamento de Estado Americano e a Autoridade Central Brasileira , essa decisao foi uma violacao da Convencao de Haia .
No entanto , a Autoridade Central Brasileira , que controla os Tratados e Convencoes Internacionais , so tem poder de recomendacao .
Como resultado disso , David iniciou um serie de acoes e apelacoes , as quais todas estao sendo processadas de forma morosa no Brasil .
Em Agosto de 2008 , Bruna , tragicamente , faleceu .
Apos sua morte , David Goldman acreditou que , finalmente , teria seu filho de volta .
Infelizmente , David agora se encontra no meio de uma nova batalha pela custodia de seu filho , desta vez com o novo marido ( agora viuvo ) de Bruna , Joao Paulo Lins e Silva .
O Sr. Joao Paulo tambem abriu processo para retirar o nome de David Goldman da Certidao de Nascimento Brasileira da crianca e substituir pelo seu , alegando paternidade socio-afetiva .
Isso , na verdade , apagaria a verdadeira paternidade da crianca .
Desde 2004 , David Goldman luta desesperadamente pela custodia do filho , primeiro com sua esposa e , agora , com Joao Paulo Lins e Silva , um renomado advogado especializado em Direito Internacional da Familia .
Desde o sequestro , David nao recebeu permissao de visitar Sean , Como exemplo , em Outubro de 2008 , o Dr. Joao Paulo nao entregou Sean para uma visita marcada pela Justica Federal e ainda nao foi processado por violar uma decisao da justica .
De acordo com a Convencao de Haia , sobre os Aspectos Civis de Sequestro Internacional de Criancas , Sean deveria ter retornado aos Estados Unidos em 6 semanas para as audiencia de definicao de custodia , sob os Tribunais onde a familia residia habitualmente .

For a dashboard upgrade supposedly aimed at attracting the ' casual ' audience , New Xbox Experience actually has a lot of love for the core 360 enthusiast gamer .
The Party mode craved by Live users has been incorporated , tweaks long asked for have been made to the VGA / HDMI video outputs , but perhaps most surprisingly of all , Microsoft has allowed gamers to optionally install their games to hard disk .
This is - potentially - a very good thing .
Eurogamer has never been a massive fan of the mandatory installations required on many PlayStation 3 releases .
It has a fundamental impact on the ' plug and play ' nature of console gaming , especially when you can be sitting about for up to 25 minutes waiting to play your brand new release .
It also forces you to manage hard disk space efficiently , especially if you have a lower - capacity drive in your PS3 .
There 's also the fact that once you 've deleted your game install , as you inevitably will in order to get more mandatory installs onto your hard disk , you 'll need to wait another 25 minutes if , for example , you fancy a one - off late - night blast on Devil May Cry 4 sometime in the future .
That said , we 've always been fan of the optional installs found in PS3 games like Ridge Racer 7 , Virtua Fighter 5 , and more recently , Disney 's excellent Pure .
You 've still got that instant accessibility that is a fundamental part of console gaming , but if you want your games to load faster , and you 're willing to deal with the hassles of deleting content to let your new games run , the option is there .
With NXE , remarkably , that option is available for every single game in your library - except Crackdown or Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 , which bizarrely are n't compatible with the new hard disk function .
NXE launches on 19th November .
But will HDD sales go into overdrive on the 20th ?
The only other PS3 comparison worth mentioning is the question of install and deletion times .
The 360 stores its files as disc images - whatever the Xbox version of an ISO may be .
It 's literally one file .
That means that installation times are basically the same for any given amount of data , and deletion is virtually instant ( as just one file is being erased from the table of contents ) .
PS3 on the other hand uses variable installation techniques depending on the developer - the reason Devil May Cry 4 takes so long to install is that it 's copying across multiple files rather than just one sustained write .
It 's also why it takes a long while to delete too .
But the real question for 360 owners is : just how much of an impact does the optional install make ?
With so many games streaming data from the DVD on the fly , do we actually see any improvements to gameplay as well as loading times ?
Do all games benefit with shorter loading times ?
We set out to find out .
The methodology for the tests was remarkably straightforward - my workhorse Xbox 360 Elite ran a carefully selected range of ten top games , first from DVD , then from hard disk .
Video captures of both gameplay run-throughs allowed us to get frame - accurate loading times ( rounded up to the nearest half - second ) and the comparison of the selected footage could also be used to judge any differences in game performance .
As the vast majority of the userbase would be running NXE from the 20GB hard disk , that 's what we did too .
In truth , I 've never got around to moving my content over from the launch era hard disk to the 120 GB drive that came with the Elite .
This aged drive has never been formatted and never had its cache cleared .
It 's basically had three years of everyday heavy use , and for the purposes of this test , we left just 7GB free - in short , we 're filling the hard disk to capacity , just to make things even more challenging .
As the opportunity to install to HDD is obviously a compelling argument for upgrading the hard disk ( and probably a key reason for adding the feature in the first place ) we also did some tests on the default 120 GB drive , unused and unloved since I bought the Elite , but perhaps now worth a bit more respect .
Enough small talk .
Let 's get to work .

Sky has filmed several sporting events using the new technology
Sky TV says it has made a significant step towards bringing 3D television to British viewers .
The satellite broadcaster says it has successfully tested the delivery of 3D programming to a domestic television , via a high - definition set - top box .
Sky has been filming a number of events using 3D cameras over recent months .
Such broadcasts would require the use of 3D televisions , not yet available in UK stores , and viewers would need to wear 3D polarising glasses .
Earlier this year BBC engineers broadcast a Six Nations rugby union international in 3D to an audience at a theatre in London .
Sky says it has gone further by showing that 3D could be delivered into homes , straight to its Sky + HD set - top box , without much difficulty .
Sky is stressing it is not making a product launch , but producing a technological demonstration .
" We have shown it is a technical reality , " Sky 's director of strategic product development , Gerry O'Sullivan , told BBC News .
" Now we have to find a way to bring it to viewers . "
The approach requires new recording as well as playback equipment
At a demonstration at its West London headquarters , the company showed clips from programmes it had filmed in 3D , including a Ricky Hatton boxing match , a rugby union international and an episode of Gladiators .
Mr O'Sullivan said major TV manufacturers were beginning to look at building 3D sets and at January 's Consumer Electronics Show , in Las Vegas , a number of prototypes are expected to be on display .
He explained that for broadcasters , the move to 3D would not be anything like as expensive as the investment the industry had made in high - definition television .
" It 's not hugely costly , " he explained , " because it piggybacks on the investment in HD . "
Hollywood is beginning to invest heavily in 3D movie production and in Japan some television channels are already broadcasting in 3D .
It is a technology that first surfaced in the 1950s , but modern digital technology has brought new interest from producers and manufacturers .
Mr O'Sullivan dismissed the idea that it would appeal only to a small minority of viewers .
" I heard HD described as a niche product , " he said .
" Now we 've got nearly 600,000 HD customers . "

For a B - team , Los Mapaches sure seemed to be living it up .
The soccer club from the small town of Nueva Italia in western Mexico had the finest vehicles , new uniforms every game and unusually high salaries .
Little wonder , then , when the team ’s owner was arrested and accused of laundering millions of dollars for one of Mexico ’s most powerful drug gangs .
The team was one of many covers , federal prosecutors allege , that Wenceslao Alvarez , alias El Wencho , used to hide and move millions of dollars for the so - called Gulf cartel .
In the Mexican government ’s bloody , 2 - year - old war on drug traffickers , one component of the trade remains largely untouched : money laundering .
The network that helps turn ill - gotten gains into legal tender is a crucial linchpin that enables traffickers to live large , expand their operations deep into the U.S. , pay off cops and politicians and buy increasingly sophisticated weaponry .
“ You can arrest thousands of [ traffickers ] but if you do n’t touch the financial enterprises , the business just goes on . . . and becomes more violent , ” said Edgardo Buscaglia , an expert on organized crime who has advised both the United Nations and Mexican officials .
Until the government goes after traffickers ’ cash , Buscaglia and other critics say , the networks will continue to grow and fortify themselves , no matter how many state security forces are thrown at them .
Money - laundering is the process of concealing the origin of illicit drug profits by funneling them into businesses ( legitimate or fake ) , real estate and financial institutions .
Estimates vary widely , but as much as $ 20 billion is laundered and stays in Mexico annually , with up to four times that amount continuing to other destinations , experts and Mexican officials say .
Some of the money is stuffed in suitcases and walked across the border into Mexico , or hidden in cargo containers and shipped .
But investigators also suspect international courier services are moving the cash .
Banking controls are notoriously lax in Mexico , making it easier for money to be wired or deposited into accounts , then spent on goods or services .
All - cash transactions are common , especially for big - ticket items such as mansions , and Hummers and armored BMWs , and to pay the legions who work for the drug mafias .
The money also is increasingly being sunk into artwork , gems , gold and commodities .
Blacklisted
Every year , the U.S. Treasury Department blacklists scores of individuals and companies , most of them Mexican or Colombian , believed to be involved in money - laundering or other activities supporting drug - trafficking networks .
Rarely has the Mexican government acted on the information .
Mexican authorities cannot easily confiscate traffickers ’ property and assets , a practice common in the U.S. and one that helped give the Colombian government an upper hand in cracking that country ’s cartels .
“ It is a very powerful tool against narco - traffickers because it hits their interests -- their purchasing power and their ideal way of life , ” Colombian Vice Minister of Defense Sergio Jaramillo Caro said during a recent meeting here of Latin American public security officials .
A new law that would give Mexicans that authority has been passed only in Mexico City ; a national version is languishing in Congress .
The two main agencies that investigate and prosecute suspected money launderers are hamstrung and underfunded .
The Finance Ministry ’s Financial Intelligence Unit and the attorney general ’s office are required to communicate with each other in writing , a clumsy process , and they are not allowed access to federal police reports , financial records or other key databases to build organized - crime cases .
The case of the Mapaches ( Raccoons ) was more exception than rule .
Federal agents arrested El Wencho in October while he was in Mexico City at the headquarters of a top soccer club .
In addition to the Mapaches , El Wencho ’s holdings included car dealerships , an avocado export firm , hotels and restaurants , prosecutors say .
The alleged money - laundering operation , which authorities say extended into six U.S. states and parts of Central and South America , came to light in September as part of a U.S. federal indictment that named top leaders of the Gulf cartel and led to the arrests of more than 500 people in the U.S. , Mexico and Italy .
An estimated $ 7.6 million of El Wencho ’s assets were seized by U.S. authorities in Atlanta and other U.S. cities , according to a senior Mexican official who did not want to be named because such investigations are kept secret until a formal indictment is issued .
Mexican and U.S. agents spent a year tracking El Wencho ’s movements through tapped telephones and other surveillance , the official said .
The official said the soccer team was more of a “ whim ” and not particularly effective at laundering large amounts of money because it was too junior .
It may have been a way for El Wencho to curry favor in Nueva Italia , a typical ploy of traffickers who do good works for their hometowns as a way to buy loyalty and protection .
Shrouded in secrecy
Mexican officials say their financial system is relatively unregulated , shrouded in secrecy laws and so complex that it is difficult to penetrate .
But critics wonder if politicians blanch at changing those laws because too many of the country ’s elite would be implicated .
They note that the interior minister , the second most powerful person in the Mexican government , once helped defend a prominent banker who was acquitted in one of the few high - profile laundering cases to reach the courts .
There is also a general , if unspoken , tolerance of laundered money among many Mexicans , who reason that if the dollars have passed through other hands , it no longer is dirty money .
“ It has been relatively useless to try to determine the amounts of money being laundered in Mexico , ” President Felipe Calderon told Congress last month .
An official report that Calderon submitted to lawmakers said the Finance Ministry had detected 60,000 suspicious financial transactions in the 12 - month period ending in June .
But only 0.5 % ended up in court .
A handful of money exchange houses are being prosecuted , but the gradual dollarization of the Mexican economy has diminished the role of exchange houses in suspect transactions , experts say .
Five years ago , Mexican authorities arrested accused money - launderer Rigoberto Gaxiola .
Yet , from prison , he continued to wash money for traffickers from Sinaloa , the cradle of Mexican drug- running , as recently as summer , U.S. and Mexican officials say .
At that point , the U.S. Treasury Department ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control blacklisted Gaxiola along with 17 associates , including his wife and three children , and 14 of his businesses .
However , the Mexican government has not made further arrests , shut down the businesses nor announced any other sanctions .
Efforts to obtain comment from officials of the Financial Intelligence Unit or from investigators with the attorney general ’s office were unsuccessful .
U.S. officials , meanwhile , worry that money - laundering operations could have deeper security implications .
“ Once you ’ve set up the scheme , you can launder anything , ” a senior U.S. law enforcement official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because of security concerns .
“ Human slavery , arms trafficking -- even terrorists . ”

Six Ways to Boost Brainpower
The adult human brain is surprisingly malleable : it can rewire itself and even grow new cells .
Here are some habits that can fine - tune your mind
Many analysts had predicted the army would take over after Mr Conte died A Guinea army statement has announced the dissolution of the government , after President Lansana Conte 's death .
An army officer said on state radio a " consultative council " of civilian and military chiefs would be set up .
The EU and African Union condemned the move .
A BBC correspondent in the capital Conakry says tanks have been seen on the streets .
But Guinea Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare said the government had not been dissolved and " continues to function " .
And National Assembly Speaker Aboubacar Sompare , the constitutional successor , told French TV there had been an attempted rebellion but he did not think the entire military was behind it .
' Long illness '
He announced earlier that President Conte , who ruled the West African country with an iron fist for 24 years , had died on Monday night after a " long illness " .
Forty days of national mourning have been declared .
The cause of his death is unknown , but Mr Conte , 74 , was a chain - smoker and diabetic who is also believed to have suffered from leukaemia .
BBC West Africa correspondent Will Ross says it is important to see whether the army is united , as a power struggle could be extremely dangerous given the country 's ethnic divisions .
Guinea 's neighbours - Liberia , Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast - are enjoying relative stability after years of conflict and there are fears any unrest there could spread and embroil the sub-region in fighting once more .
' Stay at home '
Only hours after the announcement of the president 's death , a junior army officer went on state radio to say the army had taken over , and a body called the National Council for Democracy and Development ( CNDD ) set up .
Lansana Conte seized power in 1984 and won three controversial elections
Fear in Guinea at army takeover Obituary : Guinea 's Lansana Conte Guinea army statement in full Guineans face uncertain future Voices : Reaction to new era " As of today , the constitution is suspended as well as political and union activity , " said Capt Moussa Dadis Camara .
" The government and the institutions of the republic have been dissolved . "
Capt Camara , who is head of the army 's fuel supplies unit , said an interim council would be set up to root out corruption and organise fair elections .
" Public assemblies are formally forbidden , " he said .
Announcers said the officer was speaking on behalf of the entire military , although this has not been independently confirmed .
Ministers were later ordered to present themselves at the Alpha Yaya Diallo military base " to guarantee their security " , while civilians were told to stay indoors and refrain from looting .
African Union peace and security commissioner Ramtane Lamamra told the BBC : " This is a blatant violation of the Guinean constitution and a violation of African legality . "
Former colonial power France - in its capacity as the current holder of the European Union 's rotating six - month presidency - said it would oppose any attempted putsch in Guinea and called for free and transparent elections .
Relying on military
The BBC's Alhassan Sillah in the capital , Conakry , said soldiers have set up check - points along the main roads into the city centre , but so far there have been no reports of them being heavy - handed .
Vehicles are checked briefly and waved through , he says .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We need a change , change that will benefit all Guineans .
We pray for a good leader Amara , Nzerekore Earlier , the leader of the Union for the Progress of Guinea and the secretary of the opposition alliance , Frad , Jean - Marie Dore , called for a peaceful transition of power .
Veteran opposition leader Alpha Konde returned to Guinea on Sunday after 15 months of self - imposed exile in France .
He left Guinea after being released from jail .
According to the constitution the National Assembly speaker should be in charge until a presidential election is held within 60 days .
The BBC's Will Ross says many analysts had predicted the army would try to take over following Mr Conte 's death because he had been increasingly relying on it to shore up his oppressive rule .
Despite Guinea 's mineral wealth , it is one of West Africa 's poorest nations General Conte came to power in 1984 at the head of a military coup to fill the vacuum left by the sudden death of his predecessor , Sekou Toure , who had been president since independence from France in 1958 .
He eventually oversaw a return to civilian rule and was elected three times , although critics said the votes were never free or fair .
As his health declined over the last five years , it was often unclear who was in charge and the government barely functioned , our correspondent says .
Although Guinea 's mineral wealth makes it potentially one of Africa 's richest countries , its population of about 10 million is among the poorest in the region .

Accelerating Web Page Analyzer
The free Web Page Analyzer tool we provide has become popular ( see Figure 1 ) .
In fact , it has become so popular that the traffic and load caused by the analyzer have started to effect the response times of the rest of the site .
As the average web page has grown over the years , the analyzer finds itself working harder , dealing with larger and more complex pages .
The size of the average web page has more than tripled in the last five years , and the number of objects has nearly doubled .
The tool is used hundreds of thousands of times each month , grabbing and analyzing web pages for users testing sites .
All of these analyses of growing web pages add up to many HTTP requests .
The tool provides some side benefits for WSO , giving us leads and links , but it comes at a price since it is currently hosted on the same server as the site proper .
Figure 1 : Web Page Analyzer 0.98 Screenshot
While we 've updated the software of the analyzer over the years to improve performance ( moving from Perl to PHP for example ) , this hardware upgrade focused on improving the performance of our dedicated server .
We 'll address the software updates , such as CAPTCHA and throttling , that we added in a future tweak .
Server Upgrade Performance Goals
The goal with this upgrade was to improve the response times of both the site and the web page analyzer tool .
In our previous tests we found that the large number of requests required to grab and analyze web pages was memory and processor intensive .
Before upgrading , our server had the following specifications :
WebsiteOptimization.com Dedicated Server Specifications Circa September 2008 :
Intel P4 3.0 Ghz Dual
6 GB RAM
2x160 GB SATAII Harddrives in Raid 0+1
100 Mbps NIC .
Enterprise Linux 4
Some users were reporting slow response times when using the tool during peak hours .
We benchmarked the tool using Pylot , which gave the response time results shown below ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 : Response Time Graph - Before Server Upgrade
Figure 2 shows the results from Pylot load testing the site by ramping up responses per second and agents .
The response time averaged 17.97 seconds , and once ramped up to 2 or more requests per second the response time averaged about 47 seconds !
This jibed with our other tests of the Web Page Analyzer during higher loads , the response time would average 30 - 40 seconds to return results .
Figure 3 shows the corresponding throughput for the initial benchmark test of the old server .
Figure 3 : Throughput Graph - Before Server Upgrade
Upgraded WebsiteOptimization Server
In an effort to improve response times we upgraded to a new server with faster processors ( and more cores , from 2 to 8 ) , faster hard drives ( from ATA to solid - state drives in a RAID 1 ) , and twice the bandwidth .
The specifications of the new server were as follows :
WebsiteOptimization.com Upgraded Dedicated Server Specifications Circa October 2008
Processor : Dual Xeon E5310 Quad Core ( Clovertown )
Memory : 4GB DDR Registered ECC Hd1 RAM
Drives : Dual 32 GB SSD ( solid state drives ) Hardware Raid 1
Hd2 : 120 GB 7200 RPM
SATA / 8MB Cache RemoteBackup
OS : Linux - CentOS 4 ( +64 Bit )
This new server setup promised to be a screamer , with solid - state drives that could theoretically be orders of magnitude faster than SCSI or ATA drives for some operations .
The only question was the amount of memory that went down from 6 to 4GB , but everything else had improved .
The ATA drives in particular are slower to seek and deliver data as they work sequentially , not in parallel like SCSI drives can .
Solid state drives are relatively new , so we chose to configure a RAID 1 of two of them , in case one failed ( highly unlikely ) .
The new sever benchmarked as follows , tested at the same time of day under similar loads ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 : Response Time Graph - After Server Upgrade
Figure 4 shows the results from Pylot load testing the new server by ramping up responses per second and agents .
The response time averaged 11.87 seconds ( 34 % faster ) , and once ramped up to 2 or more requests per second about 30 seconds , about 36 % faster .
In timed tests after the upgrade the analyzer itself ran about twice as fast when analyzing large home pages like CNN.com .
The difference was not as significant for smaller pages such as Useit.com .
Figure 5 shows the corresponding throughput for the initial benchmark test of the new server .

Conclusion
Upgrading your dedicated server can make a significant difference in response times for your website .
However , the performance improvement of your site will not be linearly related to the performance improvement of your processors or hard drives .
By upgrading our server to have more and faster processors and faster hard drives , we realized about a 35 % improvement in performance .
Even though the drives were 10 to 100 or more times faster than normal ATA or SCSI drives for some operations and the effective number of processors grew by a factor of 4 ( not to mention the clock speed ) the overall performance of our site and tool grew by 35 % to 50 % respectively .
Next , we plan on testing a separate server to host the analyzer tool to see the effects on the main website .

Few Wall Street gurus or members of the financial press , if asked on December 11 , would have said that the news of Senate Republicans spurning Bush and killing the automotive bailout would not be the next day 's top headline .
They would have been sadly mistaken .
News broke on December 12 that Bernard Madoff , former chairman of the NASDAQ stock market , was arrested for committing fraud .
This was not in the form of some minor chicanery , but a fifty - billion - dollar scam .
Lest the reader think that the word scam is too harsh , I will put it in Madoff 's own words ; he referred to his operation as " all just one big lie " and " basically , a giant Ponzi scheme . "
For those unfamiliar with the nature of a Ponzi scheme , it relies on funds from new investors to pay falsified , and abnormally high , returns to existing investors .
As Madoff demonstrated , as long as there is sufficient money coming in , it can reach massive proportions and continue for years .
Madoff managed to lure billions of dollars away from huge charities , as well as wealthy individuals in both the United States and Europe by getting them to invest in his hedge fund .
He did so by claiming extraordinary returns ( generally in the low double digits ) .
His scheme eventually reached a staggering $ 50 billion under " management . "
This all came crashing down around him after market conditions led to a considerable amount of redemptions ( investors asked for their money back ) .
Hedge funds are different from mutual funds in many respects .
Most notably , hedge funds are not burdened by the same government regulatory requirements that mutual funds are .
They also generally have much different compensation structures and considerably higher barriers to entry for potential investors .
Due to hedge funds ' relative freedom from excessive government intervention and regulatory burden , they are often able to generate higher returns than the average mutual fund ; indeed , most mutual funds underperform compared to the S&P 500 benchmark .
As shocking and unprecedented as this scandal is , many in the financial press are beginning to ask " Where was the SEC ? "
This is perhaps the most important lesson to be gleaned from this tragedy , which has left countless bankrupt .
It seems that everyone wants to know how anyone could be so clever as to run a fifty - billion - dollar Ponzi scheme without the SEC — which has seemingly limitless power and resources at its disposal — ever noticing .
After all , if the government could n't protect people who could ?
The answer is simple : the free market .
This is not a case in which free - market proponents are forced to theorize countless what - if scenarios regarding a solution that would not involve the government .
The free market did spot the problem ; it even reported it to the SEC .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , all of the warnings were ignored by the SEC , which failed its fiduciary obligation to investors .
Due to the lack of government intervention and regulation with respect to hedge funds , consumers demanded some sort of policing of hedge funds in order to protect investors who lack the knowledge or resources to properly investigate the funds in which they plan to entrust their money .
The free market responded to the consumer demand and so - called " due- diligence firms " emerged .
Individuals seeking to invest in a hedge fund frequently pay one of these due - diligence firms for their opinion about specific hedge funds .
Due - diligence firms use the fees collected from their clients to hire professionals to meticulously review hedge firms for signs of deceit .
One such firm is Aksia LLC .
After painstakingly investigating the operations of Madoff 's operation , they found several red flags .
A brief summary of some of the red flags uncovered by Aksia can be found here .
Shockingly , Aksia even uncovered a letter to the SEC dating from 2005 which claimed that Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme .
As a result of its investigation , Aksia advised all of its clients not to invest their money in Madoff 's hedge fund .
This is a perfect case study showing that the SEC is incapable of protecting investors as well as free - market institutions can .
The SEC is becoming increasingly irrelevant and people are beginning to take notice .
It failed to save investors from the house of cards made up of mortgage - backed securities , credit default swaps , and collateralized debt obligations that resulted from the housing bubble .
Now it has failed to protect thousands more individuals and charities from something as simple and old as a Ponzi scheme !
It seems that this event will place people into one of two camps .
Either people will be disillusioned with the SEC and realize that the only function that it seems to be able to do well is to stand in the way of the free market 's self - policing mechanism , or they will come to the erroneous conclusion that there is too little regulation and that the SEC needs more power to protect investors .
I fear that the latter will be the majority , but even so , many will come to see that less government is the real way to protect people .
Tragically , it is in the nature of government , when its failures are exposed , to claim that if only it had more power it could have performed its duties in the manner it had promised .
While the crop circle " phenomenon " has more or less faded into distant memory , every now and then something occurs in nature that wows us in similar ways .
Mississauga photographer Brook Tyler was out walking a few days ago , and stumbled upon this amazing natural " creek circle " forming on the surface of the water .
Presumably , serendipitous conditions of the flow of water and freezing temperatures were responsible for the formation of the floating , rotating disk of ice .
With about 150,000 views and counting ( due to being Dugg ) , it seems that people are impressed by what amounts to a marvel in thermo- and fluid - dynamics .
Be sure to check out the many other lovely nature images in Brook 's Flickr page .
I 'm particularly fond of the icy red oak leaf , pictured above .

Prosecutors at the murder trial of 17 - year - old Daniel Petric claim that the teen shot both of his parents , killing his mother , because they would n't let him play Halo 3 .

According to prosectors , Petric , 16 at the time of the shooting , was forbidden to buy Halo 3 by his parents , Mark and Susan Petric .
The teen snuck out to purchase the game anyway , and was caught by his parents upon his return .
The game was locked up in Mark 's lockbox , along with a 9 mm handgun .
Mark Petric , a minister at the Life Assembly of God in Wellington , Ohio , testified that soon after on the evening of October 20th , 2007 , his son entered the family room with a request .
" Would you guys close your eyes , " Daniel Petric asked .
" I have a surprise for you . "

It was then that Daniel Petric allegedly shot both of his parents in the head , killing his mother instantly .
Mark Petric survived due to the timely arrival of his daughter and her husband , who had arrived to watch a Cleveland Indians game .
It 's just an amazingly heart - wrenching story , made even more so by the following exchange between father and son related by Mark Petric during testimony :
" Dad , I 'm so sorry for what I did to Mom , to you and to the family , " Daniel Petric said , according to his father .
" I 'm so glad you are alive . "
" You 're my son , " Mark Petric responded .
" You 're my boy . "
Lawyers for the accused delivered a brief statement at the opening of the trial , explaining that their client had be under a large amount of stress after being homebound for a year due to a snowboarding accident with nothing to do but watch television and play video games .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
I really do n't know what to think about this case .
The parents were doing what I always suggest parents do , monitoring their son's gameplay and making sure he does n't play what they do n't approve of .
Sadly in this case it backfired .
Without knowing more about the family - specifically about Daniel Petric - there 's no real way of knowing why this happened .
I suspect the boy 's lawyers might have a point about being homebound for a year , especially if Daniel was an active teen , as the snowboarding incident seems to suggest .

It 's a tragic story that really leaves me with conflicting emotions .
On one hand , the fact that a teenager can feel so entitled to something that he'd kill for it worries the hell out of me .
At the same time , the fact that the father can forgive him for what he had done is a strong testament to the power of both family and forgiveness .
Interpret it how you will .

Israeli military lays siege to Gaza City
By Jerry White
16 January 2009
Israeli military forces carried out a ferocious assault on densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza City Thursday , forcing thousands of civilians to flee their homes as ground forces , backed by a steady barrage of heavy artillery , helicopter gunships and tanks made their deepest foray into the city of 500,000 people .
Three hospitals and the United Nations Gaza headquarters were bombed and set ablaze on the 20th day of the assault , which has left at least 1,095 Palestinians dead and more than 5,100 wounded .
Nearly half of those killed have been civilians , including 330 children , according to the health ministry in Gaza .
Seven hundred Palestinians were seeking shelter and food at the UN complex when at least three shells filled with white phosphorus , a napalm - like incendiary chemical , struck two buildings , wounding two staff members .
Adnan Abu Hasna , a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , told Al Jazeera that fires continued to rage for hours after the attack , destroying " tens of millions of dollars worth of aid , " including food , medical supplies and other emergency material at the warehouse .
Like the previous shelling of the UN school compound in Jabaliya in northern Gaza , which killed at least 40 men , women and children , Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) , which were given the GPS coordinates of all UN facilities in Gaza , deliberately targeted the headquarters as part of its campaign to cut off all relief to the besieged population .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon was in Tel Aviv discussing a possible cease - fire at the time of the attack .
Christopher Gunness , another spokesman for the UN relief agency , rejected Israeli claims that Hamas fighters had fired from inside or near the compound .
" With every false allegation , the credibility of those accusing us is incrementally diminished , " Gunness told the New York Times .
The aid group CARE also reported that its warehouses and distribution centers in Gaza were under bombardment and that it had been forced to cancel the distribution of food and medical supplies it had intended to deliver to hospitals and clinics .
Martha Myers , CARE 's director for the West Bank and Gaza , told the Times " our staff had to drop and run " after bombs rained down near their warehouse Wednesday .
Al Jazeera reported that 500 people were in the Al - Quds hospital in the city 's southwestern Tal Al - Hawa district when it was bombed by US - made jets and set on fire Thursday morning .
The last hit was on the Red Crescent 's operations building , destroying the pharmacy .
" There 's a hole in the roof and a fire is still burning , " Sharon Locke , a hospital volunteer , told Al Jazeera .
Two other hospitals , east of Gaza City , were also hit by shells , as was the Al Shurouq Tower , a high - rise building housing Reuters and several other media organizations , wounding a journalist for the Abu Dhabi television channel .
An Israel Air Force strike in Gaza City killed three of Hamas 's most senior officials Thursday , Palestinian sources reported .
Interior Minister Said Siam , the head of its security apparatus , Salah Abu Shreh , and the head of its military wing , Mahmoud Watfah , were killed in the targeted assassination organized by the security agency Shin Bet .
The air strike , which hit Siam 's brother 's home , also killed his brother and son and wounded six other Hamas members .
Siam was the founder of the Hamas - led police force , which played a key role in defeating the US - backed coup by Mahmoud Abbas , the Fatah president of the Palestinian Authority , who sought to depose Hamas after it won parliamentary elections in Gaza in 2006 .
In an interview in November 1995 , Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Siam saying , " I do not hate [ Israelis ] for being Jewish or Israeli but because of what they have done to us .
Because of the acts of occupation . "
In response to a question about whether he saw a chance for change in relations between Palestinians and Israelis , he said , " It is difficult to forget what was done to us .
If the reason for the hate will not exist , everything is possible . "
The air strike on Siam , the paper wrote Thursday , " was apparently an attempt by Israel to deliver an image of victory in the offensive against Hamas .
The Israel Defense Forces understands that Hamas agreement in principle to the Egyptian proposal for a cease - fire in Gaza signals that the campaign is nearing its end . "
Hamas representatives announced an agreement in principle on Wednesday to an Egyptian proposal for a 10 - day truce .
Amos Gilad , a senior Israeli envoy , traveled to Cairo Thursday to review the cease - fire proposal before returning to brief Israeli leaders .
The Egyptians joined the Israelis in imposing a crushing blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control of the coastal strip and ousted Abbas 's forces in June 2007 .
The cease - fire reportedly includes demands for a return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza , in the form of its renewed presence at the Rafah crossing with Israel .
The most Cairo is offering , Haaretz reported , " is a timetable for the opening of the crossing points , and even that depends on negotiations due to begin after the cease - fire is reached , and it 's tough to know how or when they will end . "
The Israeli Defense Ministry and top generals — concerned that sustained urban warfare could lead to a politically destabilizing spike in military casualties — have reportedly expressed reservations about expanding the ground incursion in Gaza and support bringing the war to a quick end .
The thrust into Gaza City is aimed at carrying out as much carnage and damage to the infrastructure of the area as possible before a cease - fire takes hold , in all likelihood before or shortly after the inauguration of the new administration in Washington .
Meanwhile , reports of the impact on the civilian population continue to emerge , despite the efforts of the IDF to silence all but embedded media .
Mays al - Khatib , a Gaza resident , was speaking to Al Jazeera on the telephone when her building came under attack .
" The shelling is continuous since last night , we are here in this place , we are around 500 families here under bombardment , " she said , when the telephone went dead .
Al Jazeera sources said she survived , though her building collapsed .
The Arab news agency continued , " Much of the fighting was centered in the Tel al - Hawa neighborhood , where some residents fled on foot while others remained in the precarious shelter of their homes as a nighttime attack stretched into the morning ....
Tanks and bulldozers rolled into a neighborhood park , apparently seizing it as a kind of command center , witnesses said .
" Residents were seen fleeing their homes in pajamas , some wheeling elderly parents in wheelchairs .
Others were stopping journalists ' armored cars or ambulances pleading for someone to take them to safety . "
The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem received the following statement from the parent of three children in Gaza City .
" I swear that tonight I prayed for the Israelis that someone will save them from their leadership .
No one is safe .
They 're not doing a thing to Hamas .
Hamas is only getting stronger .
After this thing , Hamas will have 50,000 suicide bombers .
" I see children running , fleeing in the streets , these children are one , two , four years old .
They are running in the streets .
What have they done ?
" It was a truly terrible night .
Truly .
No more than 200 meters from my house .
They 're failing .
Israel is failing .
Israel has cursed leadership ....
What are they doing ?
What are they doing ?
They are not protecting the Israeli nation , they are only harming it .
A child whose entire family has been killed will go to commit suicide in a few years .
Why not ?
He has nothing to care about in life .
He has nothing to live for . "
The bloodletting has provoked disgust and anger in Israel as well .
In a rare critical article in Haaretz Thursday , correspondent Gideon Levy wrote , " God does not show mercy on the children at Gaza 's nursery schools , and neither does the Israel Defense Forces .
That 's how it goes when war is waged in such a densely populated area with a population so blessed with children .
About half of Gaza 's residents are under 15 . "
Noting that even before the war , the IDF had had already killed 952 Palestinian children and adolescents since May 2000 , Levy wrote , " One can say Hamas hides among the civilian population , as if the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv is not located in the heart of a civilian population , as if there are places in Gaza that are not in the heart of a civilian population .
One can also claim that Hamas uses children as human shields , as if in the past our own organizations fighting to establish a country did not recruit children .
" A significant majority of the children killed in Gaza did not die because they were used as human shields or because they worked for Hamas .
They were killed because the IDF bombed , shelled or fired at them , their families or their apartment buildings .
That is why the blood of Gaza 's children is on our hands , not on Hamas 's hands , and we will never be able to escape that responsibility . "
But what really derailed Disney 's involvement with " Narnia " was a nasty feud between the studio and Phil Anschutz , the real estate baron and supporter of Christian conservative causes who seems to own half of America .
Anschutz has a stake in or outright ownership of Regal Entertainment Group ( the nation 's biggest movie theater chain ) , Staples Center , the Kodak Theatre , the Los Angeles Galaxy , the L.A. Kings , London 's Millennium Dome , a string of U.S. newspapers ( including the San Francisco Examiner ) and Walden Media , which has produced such films as " Journey to the Center of the Earth , " " Nim's Island " and " Because of Winn - Dixie . "
So when Anschutz gets into an ugly dispute with Disney , we 're talking about a true battle of the titans .
But it turns out that " Prince Caspian " did n't just bring in less money , but it cost more to make and market - - a lot more .
Disney acknowledges that the film cost roughly $ 225 million , with nearly $ 100 million of that going for the film 's elaborate special effects .
Even worse , because the studio was trying to expand the series ' audience by going after teen moviegoers as well as families , Disney overspent on marketing , with some insiders estimating that the studio spent as much as $ 175 million on worldwide marketing for the film .
So why would Disney walk away from such a valuable property ?
The back story is complicated , to say the least .
The obvious reason was that compared to the astounding success of the first film , 2005 's " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , " which amassed nearly $ 750 million in global business , the second film in the series , 2008 's " Prince Caspian , " was a big disappointment , grossing roughly $ 420 million .
Still , $ 420 million is nothing to sneeze at , being way more money than any Disney film , except for " Wall - E , " made all year .
On the night before Christmas , when all of Hollywood was in Aspen or Hawaii on vacation , Disney quietly announced that it was bailing out on the " Chronicles of Narnia " franchise that the studio had co-financed and co-produced with Phil Anschutz 's Walden Media .
I was blissfully snoozing on the beach when the story broke in the trades myself , so it was only after I started analyzing Disney 's 2008 for our continuing Studio Report Card series that I realized what a shocker it was .
Totaled together , the first two " Narnia " films grossed nearly $ 1.2 billion around the world , making it one of the most successful box - office franchises in recent years .
According to multiple sources , the once - close relationship between Disney and Walden began to unravel when , after the first " Narnia " film cleaned up at the box office , Anschutz essentially put a gun to Disney 's head and demanded that the studio renegotiate its deal with Walden .
Anschutz insisted that Disney either gave back a sizable chunk of the studio's lucrative distribution fee or Anschutz would distribute the " Narnia " series on his own .
Believing the franchise was too good to give up , Disney reluctantly changed the terms of its Walden deal , but the renegotiation poisoned relations between the two behemoths .
When the second film faltered , there was so little good will left over that Disney had far less qualms about cutting its ties with the franchise .
To be fair , Walden was n't all that happy with the way Disney handled the film .
The first movie had been released at Christmas , which seemed a logical slot for a family - oriented picture .
But when Disney saw that " Prince Caspian " was an edgier , more youth - oriented film , it decided to go after teenagers as well as family filmgoers .
That decision led to what , in hindsight , appears to be a huge blunder , releasing " Prince Caspian " in May , at the start of summer .
Sandwiched between " Iron Man " and " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , " " Prince Caspian " not only failed to attract many teenagers , but it lost a large piece of its family following , who were turned off by the edgier , not especially well - focused marketing materials .
" We felt that , for that film , we had to try to appeal to every audience , " says Disney studio chief Dick Cook .
" The movie was edgier and tougher and the marketing materials reflected that .
Sometimes when you do that , you risk alienating the families and maybe that 's what happened . "
Cook defended the studio's decision to put the movie into the summer .
" Warners has always been able to move ' Harry Potter ' back and forth , so we thought we had just as good a chance of doing well .
Honestly , who knows -- it may have been a factor .
In the summertime , you do n't get always get many second chances .
But release dates are funny -- they never seem to effect a movie people really want to see . "
Walden is moving ahead with plans to make a third book in the series , " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , " which will have a new director , Michael Apted , at the helm but much of the cast , including Ben Barnes ( Prince Caspian ) , from the previous films .
The book is said to be far more commercial than the last installment , being more of a classic boy 's seagoing adventure story , complete with fantastic sights , dragons , wizards and sea serpents , not to mention Eustace Scrubb , who I hear on good authority is one of the most inspired rotten kids in English literature .
The real fascinating question is :
Who will release it ?
Walden could announce a new deal as early as later this week .
It does n't have a lack of suitors .
The studio with the inside track is 20th Century Fox , which has first dibs on the project , since it already markets and distributes Walden projects under its Fox -Walden banner .
Fox has plenty of interest , having seriously considered acquiring the movie rights to the C.S. Lewis books even before Walden originally landed the franchise .
Fox has a strong marketing department , with lot of success with family entertainment -- the studio's biggest hits last year were both family films , " Horton Hears a Who " and the year - ending " Marley & Me . "
But Fox is famous for driving hard bargains and exercising fiscal discipline , so do n't expect to see " Dawn Treader " costing anywhere near $ 225 million .
Walden has been aiming to bring the new film in at around $ 140 million , which would be a far more enticing price tag for a 50/50 studio partner .
If Fox passes , both Sony and Warners have expressed strong interest in the project .
It would be a good fit for either studio , giving Sony something it has n't had in recent years - - a fantasy - oriented family franchise , while it could provide Warners with a ready - made family - oriented franchise to replace the soon - to - be completed " Harry Potter " series .
Whatever happens , it seems likely that " Narnia " fans will soon have another chance to visit the enchanted world of Narnia and other distant lands .

DISNEY BLUNDERS IN DUMPING " NARNIA " SERIES :
It is n't often that one gaming publisher takes another to court .
However , that 's just what happened last week , when THQ filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard over a dispute involving the box art for their respective racing titles Baja : Edge of Control and SCORE International Baja 1000 .
Baja : Edge of Control
THQ 's complaint , which was filed on October 23 in the US District Court of Central California , was first spotted by Patent Arcade .
According to a copy of the suit obtained by GameSpot , THQ claims that the cover art for Activision Blizzard 's upcoming SCORE International Baja 1000 too closely resembles that of Baja : Edge of Control .
THQ says it has spent more than $ 1 million on marketing since the box shot was unveiled in June .
In the art for the THQ game ( pictured top ) , two rally cars , one red the other blue , are shown in profile in the foreground careening through a desert landscape , with another car flipping forward and one more racing to catch up .
A helicopter surveys the scene in the background .
Activision 's box art ( pictured bottom ) also shows two race cars in profile in the foreground , one red and the other silver with touches of blue .
However , the similarities seem to end there , as the landscape is a canyon environment , and the two front - runners are trailed by a dirt bike .
In THQ's complaint , the publisher claims that the offending art is " likely to confuse , cause mistake , or deceive the public " into thinking that Activision Blizzard 's game is " sponsored or approved " by THQ and that there is an affiliation between the two companies .
THQ also notes in its complaint that it contacted Activision Blizzard through both written and verbal communication , but the SCORE International Baja 1000 publisher refused to comply with a request to make changes .
SCORE International Baja 1000
" If Activision releases the Activision Game to consumers with the packaging art depicted ... THQ will suffer harm for which it has no adequate remedy at law , and which is irreparable , " reads THQ 's complaint .
The publisher is therefore seeking to bar the sale of Activision 's game .
Were the court to not grant this request , THQ's complaint seeks damages as determined by a jury .
A THQ representative declined to comment on the ongoing litigation .
Activision Blizzard had not responded to requests for comment as of press time .

Mario Livio's book , Is God a mathematician is reviewed in this issue of Plus .
In 1960 , physics Nobel Laureate Eugene Wigner wrote a famous article entitled The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences .
In this article , Wigner referred to the uncanny ability of mathematics not only to describe , but even to predict phenomena in the physical world .
He wrote :
" The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics to the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve " .
Unreasonable effectiveness : how come mathematics describes nature 's mysteries so well ?
This image shows the Orion Nebula as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope .

Indeed , how is it possible that all the phenomena observed in classical electricity and magnetism can be explained by means of just four mathematical equations ?
Furthermore , physicist James Clerk Maxwell ( after whom those four equations of electromagnetism are named ) showed in 1864 that the equations predicted that varying electric or magnetic fields should generate propagating waves .
These waves — the familiar electromagnetic waves — were eventually detected by the German physicist Heinrich Hertz in a series of experiments conducted in the late 1880s .
And if that is not enough , the modern theory of electrodynamics , known as quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) , is even more astonishing .
In 2006 a group of physicists at Harvard University determined the magnetic moment of the electron ( which measures how strongly the electron interacts with a magnetic field ) to a precision of eight parts in a trillion .
Calculations of the electron 's magnetic moment based on QED reach the same precision and the two results agree !
What is it that gives mathematics such incredible powers ?
In the present short article I will not even attempt to answer this intricate question .
I will rather present some less familiar aspects of the problem itself .
The puzzle of the power of mathematics is in fact even more complex than the above example of electromagnetism might suggest .
There are actually two facets to the " unreasonable effectiveness , " one that I will call active and another that I dub passive .
The active facet refers to the fact that when scientists attempt to light their way through the labyrinth of natural phenomena , they use mathematics as their torch .
In other words , at least some of the laws of nature are formulated in directly applicable mathematical terms .
The mathematical entities , relations , and equations used in those laws were developed for a specific application .
Newton , for instance , formulated the branch of mathematics known as calculus because he needed this tool for his equations of motion .
Similarly , string theorists today often develop the mathematical machinery they need .
The passive effectiveness , on the other hand , refers to cases in which abstract mathematical theories had been developed with absolutely no applications in mind , only to turn out decades , or sometimes centuries later , to be powerfully predictive physical models .
In what follows I will describe a wonderful example of the continuous interplay between active and passive effectiveness .
To be or knot to be
In the Greek legend of the Gordian knot Alexander the Great used his sword to slice through a knot that had defied all previous attempts to untie it .
Knots , and especially maritime knots , enjoy a long history of legends and fanciful names such as " Englishman 's tie , " " hangman 's knot , " and " cat 's paw " .
Knots became the subject of serious scientific investigation when in the 1860s the English physicist William Thomson ( better known today as Lord Kelvin ) proposed that atoms were in fact knotted tubes of ether ( that mysterious substance that was supposed to permeate space ) .
In order to be able to develop something like a periodic table of the elements , Thomson had to be able to classify knots — find out which different knots are possible .
This particular need sparked a great interest in the mathematical theory of knots .
This is a perfect example of what I dubbed the active aspect of the effectiveness of mathematics .
In other words , physicists and mathematicians thought that knots were viable models for atoms , and consequently they enthusiastically engaged in the mathematical study of knots .
Figure 1 : A selection of knots .
Image created by Ann Feild .
A mathematical knot looks very much like a familiar knot in a string , only with the string 's ends spliced ( a few examples of knots are shown in figure 1 ) .
In Thomson 's theory , knots such as the ones in figure 1a ( the unknot ) , figure 1b ( the trefoil knot ) and figure 1c ( the figure eight knot ) could , in principle at least , model atoms of increasing complexity , such as the hydrogen , carbon , and oxygen atoms , respectively .
For knots to be truly useful , however , mathematicians searched for some precise way of proving that what appeared to be different knots ( such as the trefoil knot and the figure eight knot ) were really different — they could n't be transformed one into the other by some simple manipulation .
Towards the end of the nineteenth century , the Scottish mathematician Peter Guthrie Tait and the University of Nebraska professor Charles Newton Little published complete tables of knots with up to ten crossings .
Unfortunately , by the time that this heroic effort was completed , Kelvin 's theory had already been totally discarded as a model for atomic structure .
Still , even without any other application in sight , the mathematical interest in knot theory continued at that point for its own sake .
The only difference was that , as the British mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah has put it , " the study of knots became an esoteric branch of pure mathematics . "

One of the main goals of knot theory has always been to identify properties that truly distinguish knots — to find what are known as knot invariants .
A knot invariant acts very much like a " fingerprint " of the knot ; it does not change by superficial deformations of the knot ( for example , of the type demonstrated in figure 2 ) .
At first blush , you may think that the minimum number of crossings in a knot could serve as such an invariant .
After all , no matter how hard you try , you will never be able to reduce the number of crossings of the trefoil knot ( figure 1b ) to fewer than three .
However , the minimum number of crossings is actually not a very useful invariant .
As figure 1 demonstrates , there are three different knots with six crossings and no fewer than seven different knots with seven crossings .
Two major breakthroughs in knot theory occurred in 1928 and in 1984 .
In 1928 , the American mathematician James Waddell Alexander discovered an algebraic expression ( known as the Alexander polynomial ) that uses the arrangement of crossings to label the knot .
For example , the Alexander polynomial for the trefoil knot is t2−t+1 .
Two knots that have different Alexander polynomials are indeed different ( e.g. , the Alexander polynomial for the figure eight knot is t2−3t+1 ) .
Unfortunately , two knots that have the same Alexander polynomial may still be different .
Consequently , while it was certainly very useful , the Alexander polynomial was still not perfect for classifying knots .
Decades of work in the theory of knots finally produced the second breakthrough in 1984 .
The New Zealander - American mathematician Vaughan Jones detected an unexpected relation between knots and another abstract branch of mathematics ( known as von Neumann algebras ) .
This led to the discovery of a more sensitive invariant than the Alexander polynomial , which became known as the Jones polynomial .
The Jones polynomial distinguishes , for instance , even between knots and their mirror images ( figure 3 ) , for which the Alexander polynomials were identical .
Figure 3 : A knot and its mirror image .

More importantly , the flurry of activity that ensued following Jones 's discovery suddenly connected a bewildering variety of areas in mathematics and physics , and penetrated even into string theory — the current most promising attempt to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics .
In particular , string theorists Hirosi Ooguri and Cumrun Vafa discovered that the number of complex topological structures that are formed when many strings interact is related to the Jones polynomial .
Furthermore , the leading string theorist Ed Witten demonstrated that the Jones polynomial affords new insights in one of the most fundamental areas of research in modern physics , known as quantum field theory .
Knots leading the way , from the atom to pure maths and back to physical matter .
The lesson from this very brief history of knot theory is remarkable .
First , it was the active effectiveness of mathematics that came into play .
Physicists needed a model for the atom , and when knots appeared to provide the appropriate tool , a mathematical theory of knots took off .
When a better mathematical model ( in the form of the Bohr atom ) was discovered , mathematicians did not abandon knot theory .
Driven only by their curiosity , they continued to explore the properties of knots for many decades .
The mere possibility of understanding the properties of knots and the principles that govern their classification was seen by most mathematicians as exquisitely beautiful and essentially irresistible .
However , then came the surprising passive effectiveness of mathematics .
Unexpectedly , the Jones polynomial and knot theory in general turned out to have wide - ranging applications in string theory .
What makes this story even more striking is the following fact .
Recall that Thomson started to study knots because he was searching for a theory of atoms , then considered to be the most basic constituents of matter .
By a remarkably circular twist of history , knots are now found to provide answers in string theory , our present - day best effort to understand the constituents of matter !
So knot theory emerged from an attempt to explain physical reality , then it wandered into the abstract realm of pure mathematics — only to eventually return to its ancestral origin .
Is n't this absolutely amazing ?

With the approval of widow Yoko Ono , former Beatle and peace activist John Lennon , who was killed 28 years ago , appeared digitally in a 30 - second television ad in support of the " One Laptop per Child " campaign .
The spot was launched on Thursday and will play in donated broadcast and cable time slots .
The voice of Lennon says : " Imagine every child , no matter where in the world they were , could access a universe of knowledge .
They would have a chance to learn , to dream , to achieve anything they want .
" I tried to do it through my music , but now you can do it in a very different way .
You can give a child a laptop and , more than imagine , you can change the world . "
The One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) Foundation , created in 2005 , started producing the XO laptop at a production cost of less than $ 200 for the purpose of distributing those computers to the world 's poorest chlildren .
Their mission statement is as follows :
To create educational opportunities for the world 's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged , low - cost , low - power , connected laptop with content and software designed for collaborative , joyful , self - empowered learning .
When children have access to this type of tool they get engaged in their own education .
They learn , share , create , and collaborate .
They become connected to each other , to the world and to a brighter future .
More information is available at laptop.org .

Bowdlerizing in New Rochelle :
Students at New Rochelle School High School are going to find it difficult to complete their next assignment : comparing the film adaptation of " Girl , Interrupted " to the best - selling book .
In the book , Kaysen recounts her confinement at a Massachussets mental hospital in the 1960's .
Pages from the middle of the book have been torn out by the school district after having been deemed " inappropriate " by school officials due to sexual content and strong language .
Removed is a scene where the rebellious Lisa ( played by Angela Jolie in the movie ) encourages Susanna ( played by Winona Ryder ) to circumvent hospital rules against sexual intercourse by engaging in oral sex instead .
" The material was of a sexual nature that we deemed inappropriate for teachers to present to their students , " said English Department Chariperson Leslie Altschul , " since the book has other redeeming features , we took the liberty of bowdlerizing . "
Sources at the school says that after receiving complaints from an as yet - to - be- identified person or group , the school district ordered students to return the book to the chairperson of the English department who then personally tore out pages 64 through 70 before returning the books to students .
Ironically , news of the school censorship first broke during the same week as the school district 's annual Literary Festival .
" Bowdlerizing is a particularly disturbing form of censorship since it not only suppresses specific content deemed ' objectionable , ' but also does violence to the work by removing material that the author thought integral , " said Joan Bertin , Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Censorship .
" It is a kind of literary fraud perpetrated on an unsuspecting audience .

Microsoft announced this week its first - ever layoffs , which brought out the naysayers and predictors of doom , but not me .
I see cutting these 5000 jobs as good , with my only caution being that it really should be 20,000 at least .
Fifty thousand would be better .
I am not , nor have I ever been , a big fan of Microsoft .
Lots of smart people at Microsoft do great work and lots of other people at Microsoft do not do great work .
It would be nice if most of the 5000 being let go were the latter variety , but who really knows ?
This is a complex subject so I am going to take it one piece at a time .
First there is the issue of Microsoft having never before had a layoff .
In one sense why would they ?
The company makes so darned much money – or at least they have historically – that layoffs in the traditional sense of cutting fixed costs have hardly been necessary .
But there is a problem with not having layoffs and that ’s the sad fact that it makes it difficult to get rid of people who simply do n’t belong .
There are a lot of folks at Microsoft who should have departed long ago , but why ?
It ’s comfortable in a way , the benefits are good , and once you ’ve been around for a few years , heck , there ’s not much they could ever do to get rid of you .
There are people – possibly thousands of people – coasting at Microsoft because of the company ’s policy of simply allowing it .
Next let ’s consider how big a layoff this really is – 1400 people right away and up to 5000 by sometime in 2010 .
Microsoft has , depending on how you count it , about 100,000 employees .
If the average time in service is 10 years that implies that 10 percent of the Microsoft workforce leaves every year , which feels about right .
That ’s 10,000 folks leaving of their own accord EVERY YEAR .
So what does this layoff mean , anyway ?
“ Over the next two years we ’ll be eliminating 5000 positions . ”
It means nothing .
The company ’s intent MIGHT BE to permanently eliminate 5000 jobs over two years , but all that would mean under this scenario is that their hiring during that period would be limited to 15,000 replacements .
The real problem at Microsoft is one that every other public company would love to have – they make too much profit .
So unlike every other public company , Microsoft traditionally manages its earnings not by cutting expenses but by increasing spending .
It ’s a legacy technique invented years ago by legendary CFO Frank Gaudette and embraced by Bill Gates and Jon Shirley because it accomplished the task of meeting Wall Street expectations , allowed the company to hide spectacular true profit margins , while still generally keeping anti-trust officials off Microsoft ’s back .
The problem at Microsoft typically has n’t been , “ Oops , we ’re not going to make enough money this quarter ; how do we boost earnings ? ”
It has been , “ Oops , we ’re going to beat Wall Street estimates by too much ; what can we spend money on to bring our numbers into proper alignment ? ”
It ’s a great problem for a CFO to have .
But what happens , then , when you finally do have a bad quarter ?
For Microsoft it triggers a number of interconnected decisions and events .
If it were run like a normal company Microsoft could simply cut a bunch of expenses , move some money around and – like IBM does right now – look terrific to Wall Street .
But Microsoft does n’t want to do that for a number of reasons , most of them familiar to erstwhile Y2 K vigilantes who hid in the mountains in late 1999 waiting for the end of the world .
Simply put , Microsoft ’s current system has built into it about $ 100 BILLION in hidden financial resources in the form of accounting rules that could be changed and whole businesses that could be jettisoned or even sold .
But having spent all these years building up that fat in case it might eventually be needed , Microsoft is loathe to make the changes required to start burning that fat in fears that the whole technique will be compromised and the fat burned before it is truly needed .
So they leave things pretty much as - is , announce a first - ever layoff that ’s as close to meaningless as possible , and cut a few expenses to generate a projected $ 1.5 billion savings .
Why not ?
We ’re in the worst economy of our lives .
Making ONLY $ 4 billion in profit last quarter will be quickly forgiven .
I ’m not saying here that Microsoft has fudged any numbers .
Just the opposite , I ’m saying that for maybe the first or second time ever they AREN ’T fudging numbers .
Microsoft is in trouble .
While they do n’t this year need any of the doomsday techniques they ’ve carefully built into the system , eventually they will .
Its simply inevitable as the world goes more and more mobile and Microsoft ca n’t control a majority of that mobile business .
It ’s not that the PC is dying but that it is being supplanted – supplnated by platforms and business models that Microsoft does not control .
Anything less than majority market share in every segment means Microsoft is losing and losing big .
Steve Ballmer does n’t appear to have any sense what to do about this and should leave the company .
Certainly the “ beat Google ” war is already over and Microsoft lost , whether Ballmer knows it or not .
Google , too , will fail in time , but not to Microsoft .
Redmond can continue to own the desktop but what happens when desktops disappear ?
The company will eventually start whittling itself down , earnings will continue to look good , Wall Street will continue to be impressed ( sort of ) but it wo n’t make any difference at all to the endgame , which is oblivion or — worse still — irrelevance .
Instead of 5000 positions , the company should drop 50,000 .
It should decide what businesses it is in and close or sell the rest .
It should be a lot better than it is at running its true core – the muscle that ’s been hiding beneath all that fat .
The big question is whether Microsoft will do it , or even CAN do it ?
I have my doubts , one of which is that it even matters .
Brangelina has landed in Japan .
And the couple has brought its babies along for the ride !
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt made a rare public appearance at Narita International Airport in Tokyo on Tuesday , each cradling a different twin child .

According to research from ContentNext , news
Web sites have a future -- if they can wrangle up about 200 million pageviews each month .
" Based on our research , the conversation [ with advertisers ] gets interesting at 200 million page views plus a month , but much more so around 800 million , " ContentNext 's Lauren Rich Fine writes in a report .
For big operations , like at Yahoo ( YHOO ) , AOL ( TWS ) or the New York Times ( NYT ) , that bar needs to be even higher .
In order to survive as a Web - only news product , for example , Fine says the New York Times needs about 1.3 billion pageviews a month .
That 's about 1.1 billion more pageviews than the 173 million ComScore says NYTimes.com saw in October .
But Fine figures with that much traffic , the Times could earn about $ 300 million per quarter in ad revenues .
Yahoo News and AOL News get near a billion pageviews per month , and while their products and brands pale comparison to the Times 's , those sites have hundreds of millions of daily email users to rely on for clicks .

Oil ’s fall pinches Latin nations
Oil ’s fall pinches Latin nations
BOGOTÁ , COLOMBIA — During the five - year bonanza of rising oil prices , resource nationalism took hold across Latin America , and energy - producing countries boosted spending , raised taxes on foreign oil companies and salted away billions in petrodollars .
But with the onset of the global economic crisis and the collapse in oil prices , Venezuela , Mexico and other regional energy producers are feeling the squeeze .
If prices do n’t rebound soon , the countries will be forced to cut spending on popular programs or dig into their reserves .
Governments also will probably see slowdowns or cancellations of energy pro-jects ranging from explorations to biofuels plants .
" The old assumptions are out the window , " said RoseAnne Franco , a Latin America analyst at PFC Energy in Washington .
Lower prices " are forcing a very strong readjustment for all concerned . ’’
Benchmark light , sweet crude has dropped to near $ 40 a barrel from its record close above $ 145 in July .
Venezuela , the world ’s seventh - largest exporter , saw the price of its oil — which sells for less than the benchmark crude because of its higher viscosity and sulfur content — drop to $ 39 per barrel , its lowest level since May 2005 .
Venezuela uses oil revenue to fund much of its $ 77 billion annual budget .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has said the country , which has built up reserves of some $ 76 billion , will practice " austerity " in the 2009 budget .
If Chavez decides to cut the budget , he likely will slash foreign aid to other countries in the region before cutting domestic spending programs .
Chavez , who wants to remain in office " as long as God wants and the people demand it , " is trying to overturn a constitutional limit on presidential terms .
His supporters are working on getting a referendum to the voters by February , and Chavez does not intend to alienate poor and working - class voters who are the spending programs ’ recipients .
After passing laws to take over privately managed energy projects , Venezuela and other Latin American countries are once again courting international oil companies .
In the past , Chavez has focused on deals with state energy companies in Russia , China and Iran .
But recently his oil minister announced that 21 international companies were preparing bids to develop fields of heavy crude in the Orinoco belt in central Venezuela .
Reforms in Mexico
Elsewhere , Mexico ’s Congress approved a long - awaited package of energy reforms last month to allow limited foreign investment in the state oil monopoly , Petróleos Mexicanos , or Pemex .
Yet some experts described the move as too little , too late for the Mexican government , which derives 35 percent of its total revenue from oil income .
The new legislation , they said , will do little in the short term to boost oil production , which is rapidly declining .
Mexico ’s output has fallen from 3.4 million barrels per day in 2004 to the current 2.8 million barrels .
Increased demand and declining production could turn Mexico into a net oil importer by 2015 , according to Pemex estimates .
New enterprises will take years to come on line .
Yet Mexico ’s expensive deep - water projects in the Gulf of Mexico now look less profitable for outside companies .
" When oil is at $ 140 per barrel , there is a lot of expensive oil that ’s worth producing , " said Michael Goldberg , a senior partner at the Houston office of Baker Botts , the international law firm whose clients include major oil companies .
" At $ 50 , it is not .
So projects that were being considered just six months ago are now on hold . "
A recent report from the Eurasia Group , a global consulting firm , seemed even more bleak .
" President Felipe Calderon and Pemex bureaucrats all say the reform package will help the company undertake badly needed exploration projects and boost declining production , " it said .
" However , there is a strong argument that Mexico ’s energy reform will do little to help improve the company ’s condition in the near , medium or long term . "
To cope with the twin plagues of falling production and prices , Mexico ’s Finance Ministry announced that it had hedged all of the country ’s oil exports for next year , a deal that will guarantee the country at least $ 70 per barrel on an estimated 330 million barrels .
Brazil ’s deep finds
In Brazil , Latin America ’s third - largest oil producer , state energy company Petrobras has announced a string of discoveries .
But most are deep - water reserves far beneath the sea bottom and will require a massive infusion of capital to bring on line .
The credit crunch , however , has hurt Petrobras ’ ability to raise money and finance huge investments , said Erasto Almeida , who tracks the region for the Eurasia Group .
And in a case of bad timing , Brazilian lawmakers are planning to consider an energy bill that would give the government more control over the industry , not less .
Brazil ranks as the world ’s second - largest producer of ethanol after the United States , and a leading exporter .
But in Brazil , ethanol is no longer profitable when oil prices fall below $ 40 per barrel , said Johanna Mendelson Forman , an expert on biofuels at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
Colombia also has invested heavily in ethanol and biodiesel plants , but interest could diminish if oil prices continue to drop .
" The big question is : How will this stimulate or inhibit investment in ethanol in Colombia and Brazil ? " Mendelson Forman said .
" We could see a reduction , which is also happening in the United States . "
Flat prices predicted
How long will the low oil prices last ?
The U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast that world prices will be relatively flat in 2009 .
The global economy ’s condition , it said , is expected to remain the most important factor driving world oil prices .
The Latin American energy producers have some wiggle room .
Because oil prices rose to record heights this year and some countries based their spending on conservative revenue estimates , they may not face a severe shortfall for several months , some analysts said .
" This will allow them to resist for some time , and then it becomes a matter of how long the world economic crisis lasts , " Almeida said .
" If it lasts more than one or two years , then we will start seeing a serious impact . ’’
This time of year , some hospitals see a small uptick in baby deliveries thanks to families eager to fit the blessed event in around holiday plans or in time to claim a tax deduction .
Conventional wisdom has long held that inducing labor or having a Caesarean section a bit early posed little risk , since after 34 weeks gestation , all the baby has to do was grow .
But new research shows that those last weeks of pregnancy are more important than once thought for brain , lung and liver development .
And there may be lasting consequences ...
From HaskellWiki
A ( no longer theoretical ) module which contains implementations / combinators for implementing every possible method of list - splitting known to man .
This way no one has to argue about what the correct interface for split is , we can just have them all .
This has been brought up many times on the mailing lists , and there 's a summary of the split proposals on List function suggestions .
Just for reference :
Some possible ways to split a list , to get your creative juices flowing :
what to split on ?
single - element separator sublist separator use a list of possible separators instead of just one use a predicate on elements or sublists instead of giving explicit separators use approximate matching ?
chunks of fixed length
how to split ?
discard the separators keep the separators with the preceding or following splits keep the separators as their own separate pieces of the result list what to do with separators at the beginning / end ?
create a blank split before / after , or not ?
keep blank splits between consecutive delimiters , or merge multiple consecutive delimiters into one delimiter ?
An important caveat : we should strive to keep things flexible yet SIMPLE .
The more complicated things get , the closer this gets to just being a general parsing or regex library .
So the right balance needs to be struck .
Add your implementations below !
Once we converge on something good we can upload it to hackage .

A combinator approach ?
Here are some initial thoughts on a combinator approach .
The trick is to find nice implementations of the declarations below .
Please add your own thoughts , other combinators , etc .
data Splitter a split :: Splitter a -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] onElts :: [ a ] ->
Splitter a -- split on any of these elements onSublist :: [ a ] ->

on Elts splitWhen = split .

Splits of known lengths
I frequently require two types of splits , splitting into blocks of fixed length and splitting into lists of sizes of increasing powers of 2 .
My implementation was designed to be fold / builded as much as possible , so here goes :
splitEvery :: Int -> [ e ] -> [ [ e ] ] splitEvery i l = map ( take i ) ( build ( splitter l ) ) where splitter [ ]
_ n = n splitter l c n = l ` c ` splitter ( drop i l ) c n
For more general splits with foreknown lengths , splitPlaces :: [ Int ] -> [ e ] -> [ [ e ] ] splitPlaces ls xs = build ( splitPlacer ls xs ) where splitPlacer [ ] _ _ n = n splitPlacer _ [ ]
_ n = n splitPlacer ( l : ls ) xs c n = let ( x1 , x2 ) = splitAt l xs in x1 ` c ` splitPlacer ls x2 c n splitPowersOf2 :: [ e ] -> [ [ e ] ] splitPowersOf2 = splitPlaces ( iterate ( * 2 ) 1 )
To be sure , neither is a good consumer , but I do n't think that 's avoidable , given that drop is n't a good consumer either .
Here splitEvery is equivalent to " chunks " above , but it is a much better producer , I think .
( It is also intended to be mapped on , given that the ( map ( take i ) ) makes every element of the list into a producer .
Break on Nothing
import Data .
Maybe import Data .
Either import Data .
List ( find , is PrefixOf ) breaks :: [ Maybe a ] -> [ [ a ] ] breaks xs = ( if null cur then id else ( ( map fromJust cur ) : ) ) ( if null rem then [ ] else breaks ( tail rem ) ) where ( cur , rem ) = break isNothing xs replaces :: ( Eq a ) => [ ( [ a ] , [ b ] ) ] -> ( a -> b ) -> [ a ] -> [ b ] replaces reps f = process where process [ ] = [ ] process l @ ( x : xs ) = case find ( ( ` is PrefixOf ` xs ) . fst ) reps of Nothing -> f x : process xs Just ( pat , rep ) -> rep ++ ( process $ drop ( length pat ) l ) split :: ( Eq a ) => [ ( [ a ] , [ Maybe a ] ) ] -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] split reps = breaks .
replaces reps Just onSeq , onSeqKeep :: ( Eq a ) => [ a ] -> ( [ a ] , [ Maybe a ] ) on Seq xs = ( xs , [ Nothing ] ) onSeqKeep xs = ( xs , Nothing : ( map Just xs ++ [ Nothing ] ) ) on Elt , onEltKeep :: ( Eq a ) => a -> ( [ a ] , [ Maybe a ] ) on Elt x = onSeq [ x ] onEltKeep x = onSeqKeep [ x ] insertAfter :: [ Int ] -> a -> [ a ] -> [ a ] insertAfter [ ] _ xs = xs insertAfter ( i : _ ) _ [ ] | i > 0 = [ ] insertAfter ( i : is ) x xs = pre ++ [ x ] ++ insertAfter is x post where ( pre , post ) = splitAt i xs splitEvery :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] splitEvery i = splitPlaces ( repeat i ) splitPlaces :: [ Int ] -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] splitPlaces is xs = breaks $ insertAfter is Nothing $ map Just xs splitPowersOf2 = splitPlaces ( iterate ( * 2 ) 1 )
Implements all of the above ideas ( except predicate matching ) .
In order to split up an arithmetic expression , for example :
split ( on Elt ' ' : map onEltKeep " +-/*^ ( ) " )
Split of known lengths again
I 've written once something simply :
fixFields :: [ Int ] ->
String -> [ String ] fixFields _ [ ] = [ ] fixFields ( n : ns ) ls = xs : fixFields ns ys where ( xs , ys ) = splitAt n ls fixFields _ ls = [ ls ]
Simple split at known length

chunk :: Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] chunk n [ ] = [ ] chunk n xs = ys : chunk n zs where ( ys , zs ) = splitAt n xs

If we 're going to study cities , in other words , then we should also study that which is radically anti-city .

Astronomers think that many - perhaps all - galaxies in the universe contain massive black holes at their centers .
New observations with the Submillimeter Array now suggest that such colossal black holes were common even 12 billion years ago , when the universe was only 1.7 billion years old and galaxies were just beginning to form .
The new conclusion comes from the discovery of two distant galaxies , both with black holes at their heart , which are involved in a spectacular collision .
4C60.07 , the first of the galaxies to be discovered , came to astronomers ' attention because of its bright radio emission .
This radio signal is one telltale sign of a quasar - a rapidly spinning black hole that is feeding on its home galaxy .
Artist 's conception of the 4C60.07 system of colliding galaxies .
The galaxy on the left has turned most of its gas into stars , and the black hole in its center is ejecting charged particles in the two immense jets shown .
The galaxy on the right also has a black hole causing the galaxy 's central region to shine , but much of its light is hidden by surrounding gas and dust .
Vast numbers of stars are forming out of the gas and dust , and some of the material is being pulled away from the galaxy .

When 4C60.07 was first studied , astronomers thought that hydrogen gas surrounding the black hole was undergoing a burst of star formation , forming stars at a remarkable rate - the equivalent of 5,000 suns every year .
This vigorous activity was revealed by the infrared glow from smoky debris left over when the largest stars rapidly died .
The latest research , exploiting the keen vision of the Submillimeter Array of eight radio antennas located in Hawaii , revealed a surprise .
4C60.07 is not forming stars after all .
Indeed , its stars appear to be relatively old and quiescent .
Instead , prodigious star formation is taking place in a previously unseen companion galaxy , rich in gas and deeply enshrouded in dust , which also has a colossal black hole at its center .
" This new image reveals two galaxies where we only expected to find one , " said Rob Ivison ( UK Astronomy Technology Centre ) , lead author of the study that will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
" Remarkably , both galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers , each capable of powering a billion , billion , billion light bulbs .
The implications are wide - reaching : you can't help wondering how many other colossal black holes may be lurking unseen in the distant universe . "
Due to the finite speed of light , we see the two galaxies as they existed in the distant past , less than 2 billion years after the Big Bang .
The new image from the Submillimeter Array captures the moment when 4C60.07 ripped a stream of material from its neighboring galaxy , as shown in the accompanying artist 's conception .
By now the galaxies have merged to create a football - shaped elliptical galaxy .
Their black holes are likely to have merged and formed a single , more massive black hole .
The galaxies themselves show surprising differences .
One is a dead system that has formed all of its stars already and used up its gaseous fuel .
The second galaxy is still alive and well , holding plenty of dust and gas that can form new stars .
" These two galaxies are fraternal twins .
Both are about the size of the Milky Way , but each one is unique , " said Steve Willner of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , a co-author of the paper .
" The superb resolution of the Submillimeter Array was key to our discovery , " he added .
Thinking positive is the key to your success .
All successful people have one thing in common : Positive thinking and passion for what they are doing !
Watch the successful professionals and try to understand their dedication and sacrifices they do in their effort to reach that point that will bring them professional recognition .
All the major successes start from a simple idea and if there is real desire and positive thinking then they become a reality …!
Many of the ideas may temporarily give us incentives to try them but few of these ideas can keep our desire for success at high levels in order to overcome the obstacles that are found in the way .
Take for example our personal goals and objectives regarding our career , personal life , education , our looks etc .
How committed we are to achieve these goals ?
Do we set goals but we give up when things are difficult ?
Are we getting enthusiastic with an idea , which bursts on the road and cannot ever be converted into real objective ?
How can we keep this enthusiasm and desire for success until we meet our goals ?
Always think positive and believe in your abilities
The difference of people that remain enthusiastic and loyal to their goals is simply that they know they will achieve their goal , they do not hope , they know it .
They always think positive about achieving their targets and they do not leave a negative thought to pass their minds , not even for a moment .
They do not give up easily but fight to the end regardless of obstacles or difficulties that they encounter .
For them dropping their goals is not an option as there is no sacrifice large enough so as to prevent them from achieving them .
These people if they do not find a way to achieve their goals , then they create one !
What is the origin of this passion – this ceaseless desire – for success ?
Perhaps these are talented people and all different from us ?
It may seem strange but each one of us can cultivate inside our minds the flame of success that will help us to concentrate in our targets .
In order to achieve this you have to approach life in a positive way .
This is the first and most important step for success .
If you are not optimistic and a positive thinker then the chances that you will meet your goals are minimum , even if you try all the available techniques .
Thinking positive will show you the way for success .
Set clear and precise goals
To be able to achieve a goal , you first have to define one !
Setting clear and precise goals is a very important step in the whole process .
If you do not take the decision and set a target then clearly there is no way to be able to achieve it .
If for example , you decide to lose weight you should throw all the unhealthy food from home until you achieve your goal .
You can set a bet with friends or your family .
After announcing your decision , you can agree with them that if they see you neglecting your diet then you would have to buy them something that really expensive !
In short , you should burn all the “ bridges ” that can help you escape from your goal .
If you put your self the illusion that there is no return from this target , then you will fight with all your forces to achieve it .
Thinking positive that at the end you we will be able to achieve your goals will help you work towards the right direction .
Be reminded and informed
You should remind your self constantly about the goal and your desire for success .
If you want to lose weight you can stick on the refrigerator door a picture of you in which you were thin .
If you are to achieve a business target then you should plan your next steps and put the diagram at a point where you can see it continually .
Everyone can find their own ways to get reminded of their goals and the reminder is important and necessary because it wont allow you to be carried away and forget what you want so much to achieve .
In parallel , you should not forget to fetch your self with information and knowledge which will encourage you but will also help you understand more about your goals .
The books and web sites that are relevant to your goal is a good start .
If for example you want to succeed in sales , you would be watching on seminars related to sales .
Get inspiration
Even when you feel your batteries empty , there are thousands of articles and books that can encourage you to remain focused on your goal .
The enthusiasm of people who have achieved their goals , are important for you to maintain your own enthusiasm at high levels !
It is a great personal success if you cannot treat successful people competitive but if you can start thinking positive and see them as examples and as sources of knowledge that will help your personal improvement and success .
The biggest mistake is to think that nobody has to offer you anything and that you know everything .
Those who are successful have done something better than you , so learn from them and try to improve your defects .
Avoid people with negative thinking
Many of you might have never thought about it , but most often the people who surround you or the people who consort with you can unconsciously and consciously make you fail your goals .
If your environment consists mainly of negative people who are not thinking positive and are not trying for anything and who believe that everything is in vain and life is in a path doomed to failure … will certainly have an impact in your effort to meet your goals .
Why ?
Because such people simply discourage you , can make you tired psychologically and can « suck » all the positive power from your soul .
Conversely , if you are close to cheerful , optimistic and positive thinkers who always look on the positive side of life and encourage you , then your objectives can be achieved more easily !
Do not share your goals and your dreams with the wrong people because you will be disappointed with the cynicism and their attitude !
Share your goals with people who will understand and support you or who may have similar goals with you .
With these people you can exchange experiences and knowledge and support each other even in moments of weakness or difficulty .
If you want to achieve a goal you need socialize with people who have similar objectives and culture similar to yours : the culture of positive thinkers , the culture of success !
Feel good and care about your self
Another important success factor is how you naturally feel about your self .
Do you feel good with your self or do you avoid the mirror ?
Do you take care of your looks , clothes , weight , cleaning or you do not have time to deal with this ?
Let ’s see the issue differently , if you had achieved your goals how would you deal with these things ?
Same as now or different ?
If the answer to that question is « different » then you have from now to start thinking that you have achieved your goals and start taking care and look after your self .
You should feel that you are on the road to success and if you think and believe that you are successful , and behave like one , then you are closer to becoming successful !
Prepare your self for your success
Take for example the manager of a company that has the ambition to go higher .
Have you noticed that most of the time ( there are exceptions ) managers are always wearing nice and clean clothes and shoes , have trimmed hair , have self confidence and generally can be distinguished on the way they look ?
If your goal is to become one of them , then the time has come to begin to dress and behave in this way .
If your goal is to lose weight you should start from now to take care of your neglected self until you reach your goal : you can wear comfortably but not 5 numbers larger clothes , you can buy narrow pants that you will wear once you become slimmer , you can make a new haircut or buy better shoes .
All are in our minds !
This is another example of how positive thinking can help you visualize your success .
If you can create the right image in your minds then you start to behave as if you have already achieved your goal .
Start NOW
On vital step in achieving your goals is to be able to manage and defeat your tendency to postpone it until tomorrow , the day after tomorrow … .
On Monday , perhaps ?
The procrastination shows apart from weakness in your character , also inability to commit to your goals .
If you really want to achieve something then start to get it done NOW !
This is the right time .
Each and every move , each and every step , each and every thought should lead you to your goals .
If you plan to do diet from « tomorrow » , then you should get rid of all those nice sweets you eat now and start your diet from now , this time , otherwise , you will never start !
You should recognize what is the first move that will lead you to your goal and to do it NOW .
The success of our goals is associated with the effort , time and the faith that we devote to them .
The effort is usually the result of will based on incentives that lead us in the desire to achieve our goals .
We should not despair , we should not give up , we should believe in our selves and also believe that is simply a matter of time to achieve what we have dreamed off .
If we betray our objective , it will betray us back !
Let us not focus on difficulties that we will encounter on the way but let us focus on how much we will be pleased with our victory – whatever that is .
The positive thinking will soon lead us to the desired results .
If we keep the flame on you will be able to achieve everything that will make you happy and confident .
The time has come to make our largest desire and biggest dream a reality … and the only thing that can stop us from doing so is our self !
Good luck !
About
Yesterday ’s piece on information and how it affects the endowment effect of hope might have been too philosophical for most readers , so today I am trying to give a neuronal substrate for the abstract idea of hope .
Hope is defined as : “ To wish for something with expectation of its fulfillment . ”
Hope is a very powerful force in humans .
I think we can all think of examples – from the heroic to the everyday life .
Have scientist studied hope – not really but I will try to link several pieces of research to possibly shed light on the ‘ power ’ of hope .
Hope seems to be an energy source for humans .
With hope we can walk across deserts , survive years under deplorable conditions in war camps , survive cancer , etc .
Could there be a possible link between hope and energy ?
I know this sounds strange but give me the benefit of the doubt and read on ( I am not proposing some metaphysical entity – or I do n’t think I am ) .
In a previous blog piece I outlined to you how the D2 dopamine receptor plays a role in the energy efficiency of the brain ( see also this post on your brain : it all comes down to energy and information ) .
Blocking D2 decreases the brain ’s energy efficiency .
Placebo effect and hope :
Now what is something close to hope that scientist study in the lab ?
I suggest at least one that is in the ballpark is the placebo effect .
The placebo effect is : the act of receiving a treatment ( active or non-active ) may produce a positive effect because of an expectation of a benefit .
That sounds a lot like the hope definition : “ To wish for something with expectation of its fulfillment . ”
( I did n’t even realize the two definitions were this close until I sought them out )
In humans there are real neurochemical changes when given the ‘ sugar pill ’ as we think we are getting the treatment and our brain changes due to this piece of information – thinking your are getting the treatment ( see my information pieces , here and here ) .
One very impressive placebo study published in Science was ( Fuente - Fernandez et. al. , 2001 ) ( I ca n’t believe it was that long ago I read that paper ) in which a placebo given to Parkinson ’s disease caused dopamine ( DA ) activation in the striatum and in a follow up study observed activation of the nucleus accumbens in the ventral striatum and concluded that it was this region responsible for the expectation of reward ( Fuente - Fernandez et. al. , 2002 ) .
Placebo effect and pain :
Scott et. al. , 2007 in a Neuron paper took a closer look at the placebo effect and subsequent pain response .
The subjects were either given a pain medication or placebo ( cross over study ) and their brains scanned .
The level of DA D2 / D3 ( the only reason the call it D2 / D3 is because the molecule they use can bind to both the D2 and D3 receptor – but in general for this situation you can think of it as mostly the D2 receptor ) activation in the nucleus accumbens ( ventral striatum ) region was correlated both with anticipated and experienced placebo effect ( reduced pain ) .
Next they added the anticipation of receiving money ( the hope of money ) .
For people that had a high placebo effect there was a very sharp rise in nucleus accumbens activation ( DA – D2 / D3 ) * as the money increased ) and anticipation of receiving money ( very similar to what was observed with the placebo effect ) .
However , in the group that had less than normal placebo effect there was no rise in nucleus accumbens activation as the money increased ( $ 0.20 , 1.00 , 5.00 ) .
What this says overall is the higher the placebo effect in an individual the higher the nucleus accumbens activation along with the anticipation of winning / receiving money .
Or to put it in reverse the subjects that had a higher response to money also had a higher DA D2 / D3 activation of the nucleus accumbens , and greater reduction of pain when given the placebo .
This to me suggests that the higher the level of the DA D2 / D3 system in the nucleus accumbens ( many factors go into this including several polymorphic genes D2 , DAT , COMT , etc ) the higher ‘ hope ’ is .
This is under the assumption that the anticipatory placebo effect is related to what we humans call hope .
Now taking this to another level – who do you think has more hope in society the ones at the top or the ones at the bottom ?
Primate social hierarchy study and DA D2 levels :
In a landmark primate study ( Morgan et. al. , 2002 , Nature Neuroscience ) singly housed monkey brains were scanned for D2 binding capacity ( n = 20 ) .
Next the primates were allowed out of their individual cages for the first time so all the animals were now together , and as you can guess a social hierarchy was formed .
After a stable hierarchy was formed they re-scanned the primates brains .
The high ranking animals D2 binding capacity increased by approximately 20 % ( the authors believe based on rat studies that singly housed animals have a lower than normal D2 levels at baseline , and therefore suggests that falling lower in the social hierarchy would cause a reduction in D2 levels if the animals start at a ‘ normal ’ baseline ) , however D2 levels in the low ranking individuals did not change .
According to the early piece I wrote the lower ranked animals would have a less energy efficient brain .
What do you think – would you have less hope if you find yourself near the bottom of the social ranking – where you had less access to food and sexual partners ?
To see if the changes in D2 levels had a functional effect in these animals they then offered the addictive drug cocaine to the animals .
The high ranking animals with high D2 levels were resistant to addiction while the low ranking animals with low D2 levels were more addictive .
These results are consistent with a large body of additional research that find low D2 levels is related with higher addiction rate .
Take home preliminary questions and message :
Is the level of DA and D2 in the nucleus accumbens a measure of hope ( and brain energy efficiency ) ?
Is there a direct link between your brain energy efficiency based on D2 levels and the amount of inherent hope in individual humans ?
Several polymorphism can affect the overall activation capability of this system ( DA – D2 ) .
But also environmental situation – such as lower or higher in social ranking can alter this system ( along with potentially things like exercise ) .
Does a loss of hope in humans cause a reduction in D2 levels ( most likely temporary ) similar to what happens with primates that are on the lower end of the social hierarchy ?
We all know hope is a powerful force – how much hope do you personally have ?
Are individual differences in hope ( and possibly persistence ) related to DA – D2 levels ?
And we have all been in situation when our hopes are on the up or down swing .
We can go a long ways on hope – but also the loss of hope can be crushing .
However , maybe a brain with high energy efficiency via high D2 levels may not only produce higher levels of hope , but also resist a decrease in hope after negative news or situation .
Okay here is my new ( far as I know ) biological based theory of human hope .
Hopefully it will give you something to ponder this weekend .

Here is your foolproof guide to navigating your breakup .
Follow these simple directions and I can guarantee a minimum of stress and heartbreak .
If you desire , this technique will ensure your probability of reconciliation is maximized .
Want her back ?
Listen well : 1 . On the day you get the news , listen very calmly .
Say as little as possible .
You will probably hear some BS like , " It 's not you - it 's me " or " I just need some space for a while " or " let 's still be friends " ... blah blah blah .
Do not argue .
Accept everything s/he says .
S/he may become emotional .
Make no move to comfort him or her .
When s/he has finished , do not linger .
Say goodbye and leave .
If you are in your own home , show him or her the door .
A chaste hug is OK , but under NO circumstances should you offer or accept a goodbye kiss , a final quickie , or any of that shit .
If you 're at a restaurant , do not hang around to split the tab : guys - pay the bill and leave .
Ladies - just bail .
There is no need to be sterile or brusque , by all means be courteous and kind .
Understanding even .
But wait until your ( now ) ex is out of earshot to cry like a bitch .
If you get the news over the phone ( ouch ) , the same rules apply .
Just hang up .
If you get a voice / email message , DO NOT respond .
Chances are a relationship that ends electronically can't be salvaged , but do n't make things worse by taking the bait .
2 .
The bad news is , this is the hard part .
The good news is , this is the part of the Ultimate Guide to Breakups over which you have the most control .
It is the centerpiece of the method , and your stamina during this phase will determine your success later on .
Want the secret ?
Here is is : DO NOTHING .
At first you will be sad .
Possibly very sad .
Get out of the house .
Distract yourself .
Hang out with your friends - preferably the ones your ex does n't know too well , because s/he will be checking up on you .
Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you contact your ex .
For anything .
Chances are after a few days s/he will contact you , " just to see how you 're doing . "
Do not respond .
Let it go to voicemail .
Do n't call back .
Delete the email .
It 's that simple .
It 'll be hard , but hang in there .
Do n't let your curiosity get the best of you .
You are under no obligation to respond to someone who has kicked you to the curb .
Maybe you 've been together for a while and s/he has left personal items in your home .
This is the only circumstance under which it 's ok to respond .
Wait at least 24 hours before you reply .
Tell your ex that you will FedEx his / her stuff .
Pay for the fastest method you can afford .
If s/he insists upon picking it up , leave it someplace safe and make sure you 're NOT there when s/he arrives .
Make your interaction courteous and brief .
Get off the phone as quickly as possible .
If you do not receive a call within a month , you probably wo n't get a call until s/he drunk dials you many years from now .
Move on .
The sooner s/he calls you after dumping you , however , the better your chances are for reconciliation .
Again , do not call back .
Stay tough .
You are now in control of the situation .
3 .
The sooner the first post - breakup call comes , the more calls / texts / emails you will likely receive .
DO NOT RESPOND to any of them ... yet .
In these modern times you may also be privy to his / her evocative facebook updates , blog posts , reality TV show episodes , whathaveyou .
Make no contact .
If you absolutely must be in the same place at the same time , try to look fit and happy and surrounded yourself with people s/he does n't know .
Right around this time ( unless you were dumped for someone else ) your ex is beginning to experience the downside of singleness .
S/he may be feeling lonely and horny , and start wondering if s/he made the right choice .
That is exactly what you want .
Let him / her fucking stew in it .
Your patience will be rewarded .
4 .
By now , your ex is curious about you .
Maybe s/he 's even been seeing some new people .
But the fact that you have made a clean break with such poise will be a blow to the ego .
Remember , the opposite of love is not hate .
The opposite of love is indifference .
S/he will be thinking , " Was I really so easy to get over ? " and " Gee - maybe it really WAS me . "
If you 've done this right , you will receive a call ( or email ) inviting you to " hang out . "
Perhaps the tone will be casual , perhaps it will be desperate .
Either way , congratulations for getting this far .
The ball is now in your court .
5 . Proceed carefully from here .
Eagerness could lead to a booty call , but little more .
Ask yourself : what do I want ?
If you want to resume a relationship , wait 48 - 72 hours before responding .
Say you 're unavailable at the time your ex suggests , but recommend another meeting time at least a week in the future .
You name the place .
From here on out , everything is on your terms .
6 . Let nature take its course .
If your ex is ready to give it another shot , s/he will be dressed like it 's a first date .
If the sexual tension is palpable , you may choose to knock boots and sort out the details in the sticky afterglow .
If you can contain yourself , feign trepidation and ask him / her to meet you again - also in a place you select .
Build anticipation .
Make him / her work for it .
If executed correctly , your ex will be so grateful to have you back s/he will be on his / her very best behavior , possibly for years to come .
7 . Repeat as necessary .

Several dozen people protested the New Orleans Police Department on Thursday morning to demand justice for Grimes ' death .
A mix of people walked paced in front of a police station carrying signs with slogans like " Down with the government " and shouting to passers - by " You could be next ! "
A group of black ministers and advocates has called for the department to be purged of " trigger - happy " officers and the Grimes family 's attorney , Richard Jenkins is certain an investigation will show rogue cops and sloppy police work .
" I just think it was some bad officers who were out there and imposing their will on the community , " Jenkins said .
I had taken my daughter to New Orleans for New Years .
Right after it had gotten dark , ( about 6 pm ) we were headed to Cafe DuMont , but stopped in a store on the way .
Cops were going by ( about 5 cars ) with their sirens on , then there was what I thought was a shot right in front of the store as a police car was going by .
I still do n't know if that was what it was , but I grabbed my daughter and was about to throw her to the ground ( she is 9 ) .
Even though I am from New Orleans originally - I realized even though it was early - we were getting out of there immediately .
My daughter had approached various officers earlier that day , asking for Junior police badges and trying to talk to them .
One thing I noticed ( which is rare ) is none of them were nice to her , nor were they interested in any of her compliments to them etc .
I think the police are very hardened in New Orleans now , they are not as they used to be .
I guess with everything the city has gone through - they may react in a negative way faster now .
I know there are many problems it seems with the police there , and though I pretty much spent my teenage years being in the French Quarter a lot with friends - I do n't think I want to be down there after dark anymore .( visit the link for the full news article ) [ edit on 10 - 1- 2009 by questioningall ]
In a time when we 're hearing bad news coming from basically every company out there , Sony 's 4th quarter numbers are a notch below the rest : a 95 % drop in profits .

Yes , they pulled in 10.4 billion yen during the 4th quarter compared to 200.2 billion yen the previous year .
These dismal figures reflect a downright - disastrous holiday season for Sony , with TVs and PS3s not exactly flying off the shelves .
It 's your fault , really .
I mean , if you 'd been spending money on Sony products , none of this would have happened .
For shame !
Think about someone other than yourself , why do n't you ?

Avi sez , " Nassim Nicholas Taleb , gadfly author of The Black Swan , gives his 10 rules for surviving an unpredictable world with dignity . "
1 Scepticism is effortful and costly .
It is better to be sceptical about matters of large consequences , and be imperfect , foolish and human in the small and the aesthetic .
2 Go to parties .
You can't even start to know what you may find on the envelope of serendipity .
If you suffer from agoraphobia , send colleagues .
3 It 's not a good idea to take a forecast from someone wearing a tie .
If possible , tease people who take themselves and their knowledge too seriously .
4 Wear your best for your execution and stand dignified .
Your last recourse against randomness is how you act – if you can't control outcomes , you can control the elegance of your behaviour .
You will always have the last word .
5 Do n't disturb complicated systems that have been around for a very long time .
We do n't understand their logic .
Do n't pollute the planet .
Leave it the way we found it , regardless of scientific ' evidence ' .
6 Learn to fail with pride – and do so fast and cleanly .
Maximise trial and error – by mastering the error part .
7 Avoid losers .
If you hear someone use the words ' impossible ' , ' never ' , ' too difficult ' too often , drop him or her from your social network .
Never take ' no ' for an answer ( conversely , take most ' yeses ' as ' most probably ' ) .
8 Do n't read newspapers for the news ( just for the gossip and , of course , profiles of authors ) .
The best filter to know if the news matters is if you hear it in cafes , restaurants … or ( again ) parties .
9 Hard work will get you a professorship or a BMW .
You need both work and luck for a Booker , a Nobel or a private jet .

Turley : Most people abroad will view Bush as a war criminal David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Barack Obama has now been inaugurated as president , and the fear expressed by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Monday night that George Bush might issue last - minute pardons of administration officials involved in torture , possibly including himself , has not come to pass .
However , the torture issue itself is not going to go away so easily .
As Maddow also noted , " The calls for a reckoning are growing by the day -- and not just from progressives outside the government . "
" Do you think that Obama and his team realized how hot an issue this would become and would stay ? "
Maddow asked Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley .
" I do n't think so , " Turley replied .
" I do n't think the people in that building thought it , " he added , pointing to the Capitol .
" I mean , that building is where principles go to die .
And they have n't , because there 's been this groundswell of people saying , ' Look , you might be able to get away with an electronic surveillance program and say that 's just a crime we 're not going to allow to be prosecuted , but these are war crimes . , these are a special category . ' "
" I think that the new Barack Obama , the President Obama , is going to find it very hard to go round the world and to say that we 're now again the nation of rules of law , " Turley suggested , " if the first act he commits as president is to walk away from a confirmed war crime . "
" Are we literally looking at a possibility , " Maddow asked , " where administration officials from this [ previous ] administration cannot travel abroad to the other 145 countries that have signed the torture treaty because they might get arrested ? "
" Most certainly , " Turley replied .
" The status of George Bush is not that different from Augusto Pinochet .
They 've both been accused of running a torture program .
And outside this country , there 's not this ambiguity about what to do with a war crime .
...
Most people abroad are going to view you not as former President George Bush , they 're going to view you as a current war criminal . "
" And they 're going to view us as an outlaw regime for not arresting him on our own soil , " Maddow remarked .
" I think so , unfortunately , " Turley agreed .
" A lot 's at stake . "

Throughout history , poverty is the normal condition of man .
Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded — here and there , now and then — are the work of an extremely small minority , frequently despised , often condemned , and almost always opposed by all right - thinking people .
Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating , or ( as sometimes happens ) is driven out of a society , the people then slip back into abject poverty .
- Robert Heinlein
The secret sauce of Silicon Valley is the tradition of leaving established companies to start or join new ones , secure funding from venture capitalists , build the company to a suitable size , and then either float or sell the company for a windfall to the founders and early employees .
The incentive to continue this practice is the engine that keeps the fire of human technological innovation alive .
Silicon Valley 's unique ecosystem has so far been nearly impossible to eclipse .
The combination of research universities , the best and brightest immigrants from India and China , a culture of entrepreneurship , and a nearly perfect climate has kept the competitors to Silicon Valley at bay .
In the 1990s , the prevalent belief was that the high cost of living in Silicon Valley would enable Austin , Dallas , Seattle , and Phoenix to attract technology workers and cultivate their own tech sectors .
This did not happen , as the Silicon Valley ecosystem just had too strong of a gravitational pull .
This , however , should not be an excuse for complacency , or a belief that Silicon Valley is a bottomless supply of tax revenue .
There are four steps that would make Silicon Valley prohibitively inhospitable to the formation of new ventures .
Any one of these by itself would not be enough to dent the might of the Silicon Valley engine , but all four combined would exceed the breaking point .
The first two of these four steps have already happened , and the final two are set to happen , barring direct intervention .
The four steps are :
1 ) Sarbanes - Oxley :
This attempt to reduce the risk of another Enron - style fraud has inflicted a cost on the US economy greater than 100 Enron collapses .
In Silicon Valley , the crushing costs of Sarbanes - Oxley compliance ( up to $ 3 M a year ) have dried up IPOs to a trickle , as the prospect of spending money of compliance that could otherwise be spent on R&D is unappealing .
IPOs are less frequent than they were even in the early 1990s , before the bubble , and start - ups can only hope to be acquired by a larger company .
In the last 8 years , only two IPOs were large enough to be considered ' blockbuster ' : Google and VMWare .
This crushes the incentive to leave stable jobs to go work at a new venture .
2 ) Tortuous Immigration Process :
Any list of the most successful people in the history of Silicon Valley will quickly reveal that at least one third of them were born outside of the US .
In response , America has chosen to make it much harder for more such people to come here , even as the quality of life in their home countries is rising .
While politicians pander to illegal immigrants with minimal education , they somehow refuse to make immigration easier for legal , highly - skilled immigrants who start new ventures in America .
This is significant given the fact that about half of Silicon Valley 's skilled workforce is Indian or Chinese .
Many are choosing to return to their home countries in exasperation , and are advising their younger relatives that the US immigration process is so tedious that it is better to pursue their careers at home , working for Indian or Chinese branches of HP or Microsoft .
Under current procedures , an engineer from India or China has to be on an H1 - B visa for 6 years before he can get a greencard .
If he changes employers during that period , he has to start the clock again .
The immigrant 's spouse cannot work during this period .
Even after the greencard , it takes 5 more years to become a US citizen .
Unsurprisingly , the best and brightest are deciding that this 11 - year limbo is not worth it , and return to their home countries ( eventually starting companies there rather than in Silicon Valley ) .
In the 1990s , Americans had not even heard of Bangalore or Suzhou .
I have written up a detailed solution to this problem over here .
___________________________________________________________________________
If these two factors were n't bad enough , two more negatives are about to be piled on .
3 ) California State Income Taxes are Set to Rise :
The budget shortfalls and underfunded pensions in California are a ticking time bomb .
CalPERS , which invests in many of the top venture capital funds that nurture the growth of start - ups in Silicon Valley , is in a shambolic state , and has to add $ 80 billion in assets just to meet present obligations .
The top income bracket in California is already taxed at 9.3 % , and this is set to rise .
Sales taxes are also set to rise .
Due to this horrendous mismanagement worthy of a banana republic , California will soon reach a tipping point where taxes are so high as to destroy California 's private sector , which until now has been the envy of the world .
It would , of course , be better to reduce CA state expenditures , but government officials have made it clear that raising taxes is their preferred course of action .
Victor Davis Hanson explains California 's black hole in more detail .
4 ) Federal Income Taxes are Set to Rise :
If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire , then from 2011 onwards , the top income bracket will be taxed at 39.6 % rather than the current 35 % .
Here , too , the concept of reducing expenditures is not palatable to Washington decision - makers .
While this does affect the entire US equally , when this is combined with the increase in California Sate tax , the combined marginal tax rate in California rises several percentage points , and possibly rises well above 50 % .
The danger here is that each of these factors by themselves are not life - threatening .
But all four of them in cumulative combination are deadly .
So on top of the difficulty of conducting an IPO , and the brain drain out of Silicon Valley back to Asia , if the financial windfall that a worker receives after his startup makes a successful exit is taxed at a grand total of 50 - 55 % , fewer and fewer people will aspire to toil away for years in a startup .
As a result , fewer startups will form in Silicon Valley , and instead will form in Bangalore , Shanghai , and Taipei .
Furthermore , after these forces have been in effect for a few years a simple reversal of the higher tax rates , dysfunctional immigration policy , and Sarbanes Oxley will not simply restore Silicon Valley to its prior grandeur .
The technology centers in Asia will have achieved critical mass by then , and Silicon Valley will have permanently lost its exclusivity .
It would never recover the dominance it once had .
Silicon Valley will be reduced to a location that still hosts the headquarters of HP , Intel , Cisco , and Google , but 90 % of the employees of these corporations will be overseas , and startups will be rare .
Silicon Valley will effectively become like Cleveland or Pittsburgh , which even today host the headquarters of more than 20 Fortune 500 corporations each , but still have a lower population than they each had in 1960 , and cannot attract new young people to come and live there .
Cleveland and Pittsburgh are still functioning societies , of course , but their economic vibrancy is irretrievably dead .
This bleak outlook can certainly be reversed if prompt action is taken now .
Sadly , the current path is one that is set to have a smothering effect on Silicon Valley .

The fragile truce in the Gaza Strip continues to endure .
The Israeli invasion force has left … the bodies have largely been recovered from the rubble that used to be the cities and refugee camps of Gaza .
This is the time when a war torn nation would begin its reconstruction efforts .
Yet the Israeli government ’s continued blockade seems an insurmountable obstacle .
The international community has pledged an enormous amount of cash to the effort , but Israel ’s defense ministry maintains that “ we are not interested in rebuilding Hamas at any stage , ” and has kept its pre-war blockade to prevent steel , cement and glass from entering the strip , effectively preventing the reconstruction of homes and buildings at all .
If there is , as some have suggested , a race between the West and the Iranian government to win the good will of Gaza ’s populace through reconstruction , it ’s taking place at a snail ’s pace .
Iran has vowed to rebuild the destroyed schools and homes , as well as the parliament building , but they would seem no more able to import the needed goods than the Saudis or any of the other groups that have promised to rebuild Gaza .
At the end of the day , Gaza can not be rebuilt without the permission of either Israel or Egypt , and neither seems in a tremendous hurry to allow it .
According to Israel ’s Minister of Welfare “ Israel helps fully on the humanitarian issue .
Thereafter it ’s a red line . ”
Indeed , the Israeli government has allowed relatively minor amounts of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip .
But if there ’s a red line after that , how long will the residents of Gaza be expected to live in the ruins of their former cities ?
The self - styled king of beers has been toppled by a drink that most Budweiser lovers have never heard of : Snow .
The ascension of Snow , which is expected to outsell world leader Bud Light this year , is due to the growing thirst of Chinese drinkers for beer .
While beer consumption is on the wane in developed markets such as the UK , the Chinese have been developing a taste for home - grown lagers and there is plenty of scope for growth in a country with more than 1.3 billion inhabitants .
Average beer consumption in China is about 28 litres per person per year and that figure is growing fast .
It compares with consumption figures of almost 100 litres per person per year in the UK and about 70 litres in Japan .
Last year , Bud Light sold 5.18 bn litres – about 9bn pints - while Snow sold 5.12bn litres , according to industry statistics provider Plato Logic .
In the first nine months of this year alone , Snow has sold 5.1 bn litres , according to the third - quarter results of its maker , China Resources Snow Breweries ( CR Snow ) .
And while sales of Snow are growing at about 20 % , sales of Bud Light , according to industry estimates , are down in the first nine months of this year in its biggest market , the US .
As a result , Snow is believed to already be bigger than Bud Light and its position at the top of the global booze league is expected to be confirmed at the end of the year .
It will mark a meteroric rise for Snow 's brewer .
Since it was founded in 1994 , CR Snow , has grown from a regional brewer with a single plant , in Shenyang in the north - eastern Liaoning province , to one of China 's biggest drinks companies .
CR Snow is a joint venture between China Resources Enterprise and UK - based brewer SABMiller , owner of Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell in the UK .
It now has more than 30 brands and more than 60 breweries in China .
It remains to be seen , however , how much of an export market there is for Snow .
Reviewers at the monthly beer magazine Beeradvocate gave it a D describing it as " unimpressive " and " extremely drinkable , like water " .
But its succession to the throne marks a significant success for SABMiller .
A lot of Western brewers went into China in the 1990s and built breweries , expecting to make a killing with their premium brands .
They met with limited success because price is so critical in a country where almost one person in five lives on less than $ 1 a day .
A 640 ml bottle of Snow costs less than 30 US cents and , as a result , the premium beer sector is only worth about 2 % of the entire Chinese market .
Instead , most Chinese drinkers are sticking with local brews .
China has a clutch of super - brewers such as Beijing Yanjing Brewery and Tsingtao Brewery and western companies are increasingly getting involved with local partners as they look to offset slowing growth in more mature markets .
Earlier this month , InBev , which makes Stella Artois and Beck's , warned that the UK was among its worst - performing markets , with its brands falling 5.3 % in UK sales volumes over the three months to September .
That followed a similarly gloomy statements from Molson Coors , maker of the UK market - leading lager Carling , and Carlsberg – both noted a marked slowdown in British beer drinking .
Molson Coors ' UK brands fell 3.1 % in volume over the third quarter of the year , while Carlsberg , which is closing its Tetley brewery in Leeds , West Yorkshire , said a sharp downturn in pub trade had led to a revision in full - year earnings forecasts .
Earlier this week , China 's ministry of commerce approved the acquisition of Budweiser 's owner Anheuser - Busch by InBev and both companies are already involved in the country 's brewing industry .
Anheuser - Busch has a 27 % stake in Tsingtao Brewery , while Inbev owns 28.56 % of Zhujiang Brewery .
Neither company will be allowed to increase their stakes or get involved in either Beijing Yanjing or CR Snow for fear of reducing competition in the market .
Couple arrested for ' having sex ' on crowded train
A couple have been arrested for allegedly having sex in a crowded train carriage .
Other passengers en route from Liverpool to London appear to have sat in embarrassed silence as the 41 - year - old woman allegedly committed a sex act on her male partner .
The pair were arrested by police on arrival at Euston station .
Officers are believed to have been called after a guard on the Virgin intercity train spotted the couple on CCTV .
A man has been charged and a woman bailed for allegedly having sex on a crowded Virgin train , like this one
Businessman Gregory Sim , 49 , has been charged with unacceptable behaviour while the unnamed woman , from Essex , has been bailed while inquiries continue .
A spokesman for British Transport Police said the session took place on Wednesday , October 22 , at 2.45 pm .
' The man , Gregory Sim , from Richmond , Surrey , has been charged with unacceptable behaviour on a train and is due to appear at City of Westminster magistrates on November 16 , ' he added .
Quizzed by reporters last night , Mr Sim confirmed his arrest but refused to give any more details .
Being the living incarnation of two thousand years of religious tradition has got to be rough on a guy .
Popes of the modern era have been burdened with the additional task of traveling to tend to the flock , heading out from the confines of the Vatican City to exotic places like Venezuela , Africa and Hamtramck .
Look it up .
Anyway , the task would be insurmountable if not for Poppa 's trusty and reliable sidekick , the Popemobile .
Serving duly as a perch from whence to greet the masses — and as protection from said masses for the Holy See , the Popemobile has gone through many iterations , some of which you 'll have a hard time believing .
Popemobiles come in two varieties .
The locally made , customized versions , often hewn from the host nation 's finest home - grown automobile and turned into a rolling vista fit for a king — or at least the head of a sovereign nation .
Then there are the official Popemobiles , now the only kind after the attempt on John Paul II 's life in 1981 .
Some are made for daily open - air service in St. Peter 's Square and others are bullet - proof Popequariums which travel with the high pontiff to locations far and wide .

The 1930 Mercedes - Benz Nürburg 460 is the first car acknowledged as a formal Popemobile , built specifically for Pope Pius XI as a gift from Daimler Benz AG .
The big Benz was equipped with a central rear - mounted throne and custom interior , which the Pope called “ a masterpiece of modern engineering . ”
1960 : Mercedes - Benz 300D Landaulet

The 300D Landaulet was the first new Popemobile in thirty years , with Mercedes spanning the gap during the tumultuous period .
The 300D was stretched some 450 mm , with hard top up front and soft top in the rear layout of the Landaulet body style allowing El Papa to take in the sunshine and wave to the crowds .
This car retained the single - throne seat setup in the rear , but added amenities like air conditioning and a two - way radio to the driver .
1964 : Lincoln Continental Lehmann - Peterson

Everybody knows you have to roll in style when you visit New York City , so a stretched 1964 Lincoln Continental was in order .
Also customized in the Landaulet style , in this case the Pope 's throne seat was equipped with a hand crank which elevated the Pontiff 12 inches into the air so the crowds could get a better look .
1965 : Mercedes - Benz 600 Pullman

The Landaulet version of the 1965 Mercedes - Benz 600 was delivered to Pope Paul VI .
The car was equipped with an enormous folding top as well as a huge set of rear doors and an additional two and three - quarter inches of head room .
1966 : Mercedes - Benz 300 SEL Landaulet

The basic concept of the previous car was retained , however , the papal seat was set with a sliding mechanism which allowed the Pope to slide to the side , allowing added seating in the rear for a Papal aid .
1967 : Mercedes - Benz 300 SEL

This Benz was more of a Papal limo than a Popemobile , as it was equipped with occasional seating for up to six in addition to the longer doors and elevated roof line .
1979 : FCS Star

Following his elevation to the Papacy , Karol Józef Wojtyła returned to his native Poland as John Paul the Second , with an impressive Popemobile in tow .
The FCS Star is a Polish - built industrial truck normally outfitted for firefighting duty , but for his home swing , it was converted to the baddest Popemobile ever .
The platform rode atop the chassis and remained open to the crowds .
In fact , the design was one developed with the guidance of JPII himself .
Seriously , epic Pope win .
1979 : Ford Transit

JP the Deuce was a busy guy following his Popification , making tours of many points of the globe to greet the flock .
When he visited the Ireland in 1979 , the first time a Pope had set foot in that soil , a Ford Transit , of all things , was converted for Pontiff - toting duties .
It was outfitted in the papal colors of yellow and white with a tall cabin with large windows in addition it was fitted wit silk - and - teflon carpet said cost over a thousand dollars a yard .
1980 : Mercedes - Benz 230 G

During a trip to Germany in 1980 , Mercedes provided a customized Mercedes G230 which would become the guidepost for Popemobiles to come .
With a transparent superstructure and elevated viewing position , the G230 made crowd - surfing with the Pope look good .
1981 : Peugeot 504

Believe it or not , there was a Peugeot 504 converted for holy - rolling .
The 504 was used by John Paul II in a visit to Lyon , France , and still exists in a Peugeot Museum in Sochaux .
Go made a pilgrimage to see it .
1982 : Seat

The Spanish Papamóvil was an all - open - air Seat designed with a grab handle in front so El Papa could stand and greet the crowds .
This may also be the smallest Popemobile ever .
1982 : Range Rover

The first bullet - proof Popemobile was built following the first assassination attempt on John Paul II in 1981 .
The Rover took the precedent set in the design of the 230 G and enclosed the cabin , adding bulletproof glass for a visit to the UK .
1982 : Leyland 24 - ton

This most massive of Popemobiles was built by Leyland Truck for the Popes visit to Scotland as well as additional travels around the UK in 1982 .
The 24 ton monster has a cool glass room at the top of the vehicle and logged 11,000 miles during its services .
Our personal favorite of the Popemobiles was donated to the British Commercial Vehicle Museum , in Leyland , Lancashire in 1988 , but was sold at auction in 2006 for the bargain price of $ 70,000 .

Here 's a working class Popecar , a converted GMC Sierra used for the Pope 's travels during a visit to Canada in 1984 .
No doubt it was professional - grade even then .
1985 : Mercedes - Benz 500 SEL W126

The Vatican ’s fleet of limo - style Popemobiles grew with the inclusion of the first fully armored car , a Mercedes - Benz 500 SEL .
Just because it was armored does n't mean it was n't crowd friendly .
The sunroof opened , a windscreen elevated , and the floor lifted to a platform position below to allow the Pontiff to do his crowd - waving thing .
This car is actually still in use and ferries Pope Benedict XVI during official outings .
1997 : Mercedes - Benz S500 LWB

Here 's a thoroughly updated Landaulet Mercedes complete with electro - hydraulic top , two rear - facing occasional seats , and a center mounted throne which can power - elevate half a meter when the top is down .
1999 : A Freakin Bus

In a visit to Mexico during 1999 , JPII rode in a glassed - up bus through unprecedented crowds of onlookers .
Following John Paul the Second 's death in 2005 , this Popemobile was put on permanent display in Mexico City at the Basilica of Guadalupe , where the faithful made pilgrimages to pay respect to the passed pontiff in - lieu of a trip to Vatican City to do the same .
2002 : Mercedes - Benz ML430

Here 's the thoroughly modern Mercedes ML 430 Popequarium which has been the standard bearer until recently .
The fully enclosed , bullet - proof , air - conditioned , platformed car served major duty during the last years of John Paul II .
2004 : Fiat Campagnola

A Fiat !?
Yep .
This open - top SUV was used during transit within Vatican City , primarily during masses at St. Peter 's Square , usually accompanied by a phalanx of burly security guards .
2007 : Mercedes - Benz G500

That Fiat did n't have a terribly long run , as it was supplanted by a far more stylish G500 right at the end of 2007 .
This one is the first that can be converted from open - air duty to bullet proof class as well .
The G500 is also the first Popemobile exclusively used by the current Pontiff , Pope Benedict XVI .

McCain said the election showed that Americans “ want us to work together , and get to work . "
( The Washington Post )
What the commentators said
It looks like McCain is Obama ’s new best friend in the Senate , said Chris Cillizza in The Washington Post .
The Arizona senator immediately and publicly praised Obama for announcing the closure of Guantánamo , and Obama has returned the favor with lavish praise for McCain .
Maybe McCain sees himself as a bridge between Obama and Republicans , which could make him a “ major player ” in the fights ahead .
“ If McCain becomes a lone public GOP ally of the Obama administration on questions like immigration or faith in its appointees , that 's useful , ” said Eve Fairbanks in The New Republic .
“ If he can rally a troupe of mavericks — longtime devotees of his in the Senate , like Susan Collins , Olympia Snowe , Lindsey Graham , and Joe Lieberman — that 'd be very useful . ”
There ’s nothing mavericky about getting swept up in Obamania , said Paul Mirengoff in Power Line .
McCain scolded Republicans over Clinton ’s confirmation despite legitimate questions of a potential conflict of interest arising from her husband ’s charitable foundation .
McCain is n’t doing the country any favors , he ’s just reverting to “ what seems to make him happiest — sticking it to conservative Republicans and assisting liberal Democrats . ”
“ Stickin ’ it to the far right ” is the thing so many people admired in McCain all along , said Dennis Sanders in The Moderate Voice .
Instead of criticizing him for it , Republicans should be asking themselves why they have “ become so afraid of any other flavor of conservatism that it forces people , even the irascible McCain , to conformity . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Detroit's Big
Three are n't the only automotive companies that want to see the government step in with some much - needed financial help .
Overseas automakers , most notably Toyota Motor , all endorse some form of federal aid to keep General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Chrysler LLC and possibly Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) out of bankruptcy .
The Senate killed an effort to get the automakers a stopgap loan last week and now the Bush administration has said it is looking at providing the automakers help from the $ 700 billion approved to bail out banks and Wall Street firms .
" We support measures to help the industry , " said Toyota Motor ( TM ) spokeswoman Mira Sleilati .
" We just want a strong , competitive healthy industry . "
This may seem surprising at first , especially considering that much of the opposition to the auto bailout was from senators from Southern states that are home to auto plants operated by Asian auto companies , such as Alabama and South Carolina .
But the Asian automakers insist they never lobbied against such help for the Big Three .
And this makes sense after taking a closer look at the dynamics of the auto industry and the intertwined fates of its companies .
Here 's why Toyota , Honda Motor ( HMC ) and other Asian auto manufacturers clearly believe they are all better off if GM and Chrysler survive .
Collateral damage
The overseas automakers , who between them produce more than 3 million vehicles a year at U.S. plants , all worry their production would be hurt if one of the U.S. automakers went under .
That 's because a Big Three failure would likely lead to widespread bankruptcies in the auto parts supplier industry .
Erich Merkle , lead auto analyst with the consulting firm Crowe Horwath LLP , said there is much overlap between the automakers ' suppliers .
Since most parts in an automobile have only a single supplier producing them , the disruptions in production will be severe and prolonged .
" It could take months for a Toyota to work through that and resume normal production , " he said .
Merkle said the current network of auto suppliers , manufacturers and dealerships has worked well for the overseas automakers , who have posted steady gains in their U.S. market share during the past few years .
Besides sharing suppliers , many dealers sell both U.S. and overseas brands .
So the failure of a U.S. automaker could hurt the overseas manufacturers ' dealer network and their sales as well , Merkle said .
" There would be a severe disturbance in the force , " he quipped .
Economic shockwaves
A collapse of one of the Big Three would also probably cause an even more severe hit to the U.S. economy .
That would further eat into demand for U.S. auto sales , which hit a 26 - year low in November .
" The U.S. economy would be in shambles , " Merkle said .
" The robust U.S. economy that Toyota and the others depend on would suddenly not be as lucrative . "
The overseas automakers agree that the last thing they need is for the U.S. economy to slow further .
The U.S. is the largest market for Toyota , Honda and Nissan ( NSANY ) .
All are expected to report lower U.S. sales this year for the first time ever .
" We want to get the economy back , " said Michael Stanton , CEO of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers , which represents most of the Asian automakers with plants in the U.S. " Everyone is hurting at this level of sales .
Everybody is either cutting back or shutting down . "
The latest cutbacks came Monday , when Toyota announced it was putting plans to open a new plant in Mississippi on hold indefinitely , even though it is about 90 % complete .
The plant was set to start building the first domestically produced Prius in 2011 .
While the overseas automakers would be certain to eventually pick up more U.S. market share if a U.S. automaker stopped doing business , Merkle said the need to sell off the inventory of the failed automaker at fire - sale prices would depress all prices in the industry in the short term .
Enter new competition
The final concern for the overseas automakers is a longer - term problem .
The failure of a U.S. automaker could open the door for a Chinese or Indian automaker to buy up the assets of the failed company and create a new low - cost competitor in the U.S .
" You could open the door for foreign companies to buy distressed assets at rock - bottom prices , " he said .
He pointed to India 's Tata ( TTM ) and China 's Geely as two automakers in the developing world that are already on record as being interested in expanding into western markets like the United States .
" Tata and Geely would be incredibly open to brownfield sites , " he said , using the term that describes companies that buy discarded industrial facilities .
Toyota and Honda have already felt the effects of competition from other upstarts firsthand in the U.S .
Korean manufacturers Hyundai and Kia have eaten into the sales of Toyota 's and Honda 's small , inexpensive vehicles , but that growth has taken decades .
Merkle said it might take a year or more for a new competitor to get off the ground .
But by grabbing U.S. automakers ' assets , vehicle designs and dealerships , an incoming Indian or Chinese manufacturer could quickly become a low - cost threat much quicker than the Koreans .
The established automakers like Toyota and Honda are also unlikely to look to buy the distressed assets themselves because they have never used acquisitions or purchases of other companies ' assets as a method of growing .
Instead , they have always built their own facilities from the ground up in order to expand .
Merkle said that is unlikely to change , even if the more productive facilities of U.S. automakers were put up for sale by a bankruptcy court .
While companies such as Tata or Geely are likely to eventually enter the U.S. anyway , Merkle said the vacuum caused by the failure of GM or Chrysler could jumpstart those efforts and bring them to the market years earlier than expected .
Children of Foreclosure
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : M Shane
Losing your home is a stressful and disheartening experience , especially if you feel you were duped into a sub prime mortgage by a shady lender .
For children however , a foreclosure will take an emotional toll that can have a lasting impact on all areas of their lives .
According to the report , " The Impact of the Mortgage Crisis on Children , " more than two million children around the country are being directly affected by a foreclosure , while thousands more are affected indirectly via foreclosures of rental properties .
With so many of our young people experiencing foreclosures firsthand , it 's important to consider what impact this sudden upheaval and financial trouble has on our nation 's children .
The main consequence of a foreclosure is the loss of the family home .
Not only is the loss of the home itself difficult for children , but they 're also forced to leave the familiar sanctuary of the neighborhood , say goodbye to friends , and in some cases , leave behind their schools .
This loss of peer relationships and important teachers can leave a child heartbroken , anxious , and scared .
Often a foreclosure proceeding and its immediate aftermath happens so quickly that there 's no time to really prepare the child for the swift changes about to occur .
The entire family is swept up in the current of monetary concerns , grief , and overwhelming stress .
With parents preoccupied with finding an affordable place to live , the children 's emotional state is often brushed aside .
Dealing with the logistics of a foreclosure is more than enough for parents to worry about , and the children usually know it .
When parents are dealing with stress and depression , kids can feel it .
They see you sad , irritable , and under pressure .
Children are n't equipped to understand what 's causing your stress , so they internalize it as being their fault .
Even if they understand that you 're losing the house because you 've run out of money , they will likely still see the situation as being their fault .
They feel like a burden on you ; that if you did n't have to feed and clothe them , you 'd be able to keep the house .
In you think your children are dealing with feelings like these , it 's imperative that you explain that the foreclosure is not their fault , and that everything will work out all right .
Since a child 's stability is being threatened , you need to reiterate the fact that no matter where you end up , you 'll always be there for them .
Try to maintain routine as much as possible , and if you can , keep them enrolled in their current school so that they have something familiar to turn to every day .
For a child , their teachers , parents , and friends will be much needed touchstones in this difficult time .
Even if you have children who are old enough to know that they 're not responsible for the situation , a feeling of powerlessness and frustration can develop .
They see that you 're upset and struggling , but as they 're only children , they can do little to remedy the situation .
Teenagers can take care of their younger siblings , or get a part - time job to help out the household , but younger kids ' hands are tied .
This kind of self - imposed emotional responsibility is a heavy burden for a child .
Kids need to know that they 're living in a safe , stable environment .
A consistent environment , and strong connections are vital to proper development , and a foreclosure can take those away .
Many children of foreclosure are forced to live in temporary quarters like motel rooms , emergency shelters , or even vehicles .
Homelessness in children has risen by leaps and bounds this past year , as foreclosures and high rents have pushed families out of their homes .
Regardless of the cause of the foreclosure crisis , it 's clear that the ones losing out are the children .
If you 're a parent facing foreclosure , remember to pay attention to your child 's emotions .
You can ease the transition simply by being there for them , and by maintaining as much normality as possible .

The chicken industry 's No. 1 producer , Pilgrim 's Pride , filed for Chapter 11 on Monday .
The economic pressures facing the U.S. chicken industry came into full view Monday when the No. 1 producer , Pilgrim 's Pride , ( PPC ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - court protection .
Pilgrim's , which produces 25 % of U.S. broilers , suffered a triple whammy of large debt , high feed prices and lower prices for chicken amid weakening demand in the U.S. and abroad .
" Pilgrim 's Pride stretched and got caught , " says Len Steiner , owner of meat and food consulting firm Steiner Consulting .com .
While other producers are in stronger financial shape , the hangover from high feed costs and weak demand is affecting all producers , he says .
Pilgrim 's Pride shares fell 46 % Monday to 62 cents before trading was halted pending its announcement .
Shares of No. 2 Tyson Foods ( TSN ) fell 10 % to $ 6.03 .
Steiner expects higher wholesale prices for chicken in the coming months as producers continue to cut production .
It 's unclear whether those increases will get to consumers given the weak economy , he says .
Pilgrim 's Pride 's filing was n't a surprise , but there was hope last week that it could be avoided .
It said in September it would post a significant loss in its fiscal fourth quarter .
Pilgrim 's Pride , which employs 48,000 , says it'll operate as usual while it restructures .
It has n't said whether it will cut production .
JPMorgan Securities analyst Ken Goldman said in a research note Monday that cuts were likely .
A steep reduction would help the " downtrodden industry " lift prices , he wrote in a note last month .
The economics facing the industry have been brutal .
Corn prices were more than triple their five - year average in June , Steiner says .
Meanwhile , wholesale chicken prices were off their five - year average by 16.2 % .
Corn prices have fallen 55 % since then , and producers , except for Tyson , have cut production .
The Chapter 11 filing will help the company to sell assets , because buyers will have a clearer view of Pilgrim 's future .
Its substantial Mexican operations were n't included in the filing .

HISTORY may be repeating itself .
Until the mid-20th century , many European countries grew rich on the resources of their colonies .
Now , countries including China , Kuwait and Sweden are snapping up vast tracts of agricultural land in poorer nations , especially in Africa , to grow biofuels and food for themselves .
The land grabs have sparked accusations of neocolonialism and fears that the practice could worsen poverty .
Yet some organisations think this could be …
Obama is finding it difficult to give up his BlackBerry .
David Gewirtz | BIO
Editor - in - Chief , ZATZ Publishing
President - elect Barack Obama is apparently still getting used to the limitations the Presidency will place on his life , including restrictions or even a ban on his cherished BlackBerry device , which he says he 's " still clinging to . "
So what if Barack kept his BlackBerry ?
The answer is n't nearly as complex as solving some of the nation 's more serious problems , but it also can't be answered in a sound bite .
There are security , legal , personal , even political issues that all come into play .
BlackBerry Communication Security
The security required by a sitting - or in this case , a very mobile - U.S. President is far greater than that required by you or I , or even a U.S. Senator .
BlackBerry communications are encrypted , but while the level of encryption for is good , it 's not the best the U.S. government has .
Now Mr. Obama 's a very astute dude , so we can be pretty sure he'd be able to decide what 's too sensitive to send out over BlackBerry 's airwaves .
But then there 's the issue of the BlackBerry Infrastructure network itself .
The BlackBerry device is produced by Research in Motion ( or RIM ) , a Canadian company .
Even though organizations can operate their own BlackBerry Enterprise Servers , all BlackBerry traffic ultimately travels through the RIM network .
As you may recall , the RIM network suffered outages in April 2007 and February 2008 that left all BlackBerry users without connectivity .
The company , whose 2007 annual report claims it processes over a billion wireless data packets each day , was heavily criticized because all communication traffic was routed through its Waterloo , Ontario data center .
In June , the St. Louis Business Journal wrote that RIM had purchased a 150,000 - square - foot facility in Plano , Texas that reportedly will also handle BlackBerry traffic .
Even so , does the United States want personal communications from the President of the United States to travel over a communications network operated and controlled by a company in a foreign sovereign nation , even one as friendly as Canada ?
RIM now appears to be decentralizing that data routing .
That means , maybe , that BlackBerry traffic originating in the U.S. is likely to route through the Plano operations center .
But that decentralizing leads to another security question .
If the President travels outside the country , say to China , will his BlackBerry traffic be routed through a data center in China ?
Do we want personal communications to and from an American President running over a data center operating at least under the nominal control of a possibly unfriendly foreign power ?
What if he loses the thing ?
In Where Have All The Emails Gone ?
I discussed how Karl Rove lost his BlackBerry repeatedly , and what could happen if information on that device got into the wrong hands .
Even a simple draft press release about an upcoming ( but , for now , top secret ) attack could cost lives .
What else could be on such a device ?
Plenty !
Old - school BlackBerry phones - from a year ago or so - could store about 64 megabytes of data .
How much is 64 megabytes ?
The King James Bible is about 1,120 pages , or about 2.5 megabytes .
So a typical 64 megabyte BlackBerry could hold about 25 King James Bible 's worth of information .
That 's the equivalent in private Presidential information of about 28,000 printed pages , or seven complete sets of all seven Harry Potter novels .
Admittedly , if Mr. Obama 's BlackBerry has a good password , the data would be hard to extract , even if it fell into the wrong hands .
And if the BlackBerry does get lost , it can be remotely locked and erased .
Even so , do we really want to pit the security technology of some company in Canada against the full might and resources of any enemy nation - state determined to extract secrets from an American President 's BlackBerry ?
Mr. Rove is n't the only senior White House official to have lost BlackBerry devices .
Last April , Rafael Quintero Curiel , lead press advance person for the Mexican delegation , was caught stealing BlackBerry devices belonging to White House staffers who were attending meetings between U.S. President George W. Bush and Canadian and Mexican leaders in New Orleans .
He had control of those devices for at least 25 minutes before they were returned to the Secret Service .
Is your BlackBerry spying on you ?
That 's an important detail , because it brings us to a new question .
What could be put on Mr. Obama 's BlackBerry if he happens to set it down or hand it to someone for " safe " keeping ?
The answer , which on the surface seems wildly paranoid , is actually quite disturbing .
There is software easily obtainable on the Internet for about $ 250 that can turn pretty much any smartphone into a remote bugging device .
Think about it .
The typical BlackBerry has a microphone .
What if everything said in proximity of the President was relayed to a remote listener ?
The typical BlackBerry has email .
What if every email message sent and received by the President was relayed to a remote observer ?
Most BlackBerrys have GPS .
What if the location of the President was dynamically relayed to bad guys in waiting ?
This software is real and can be installed on most BlackBerry devices .
Once installed , it 's completely undetectable .
And it would n't require President Obama 's password to install .
All a bad guy needs is to have hands - on access to the phone for about five minutes and the software is downloaded and installed from a remote Web site .
Here 's a tip : do n't ever let anyone else hold onto your phone .
Scary stuff .
Securing Presidential Records
Legal issues will also crop up if Obama keeps his beloved BlackBerry .
Two immediate considerations : the Hatch Act of 1939 and the Presidential Records Act .
The Hatch Act is a strange beast .
It was originally created as a way to prevent federal employees from joining any organization whose goals included the overthrow of the United States government .
Today , the Hatch Act allows federal employees to participate in political parties , but prohibits them from engaging in political activity while on duty .
The goal behind the use of the Hatch Act was honorable , and its goal of preventing federal funds from being used for political purposes is laudable .
Unfortunately , it has had two unintended side effects with regard to White House email :
* It forces White House staffers to use private - sector resources for communication , bypassing the government 's security resources .
* It gives politicians in the White House an excuse for bypassing Presidential Records Act requirements .
Fortunately for Mr. Obama 's BlackBerry cause , the Hatch Act specifically exempts the President from these requirements .
But if Rahm Emanuel wants to keep his BlackBerry , he 's going to need to send some messages over the government network and others over a private network .
I 've recommended the Hatch Act be amended so that all senior - level government email communication , political or otherwise , go across secured government systems , but that 's a discussion for another day .
This brings us to the Presidential Records Act .
This Act governs how Presidents must manage their records .
The key here is the definition of the term " record . "
A two - line email message to Mr. Emanuel would probably be considered a " record " that requires long - term archiving .
An email praising Malia for her latest " A " at Sidwell Friends probably does not .
Private thoughts and presidential access
And that brings us to the personal question .
BlackBerry email is among the least filtered , least considered , and most off - the - cuff communication method of any in use today .
It may or may not be wise for the President - elect to quickly jot off responses or comments - since everything he says or does will be subject to the most minute scrutiny .
Finally , there is the political question and the issue of access .
Access to the President of the United States is considered the most elemental of political currency in Washington .
If Mr. Obama has a BlackBerry at his side , that may well change the equation of access .
Normally , for someone to get to the President , that person has to pass through a gauntlet of gatekeepers .
But if Mr. Obama has a BlackBerry , anyone to whom he gave his BlackBerry email address would be able to gain some level of his attention - bypassing the gatekeepers completely .
So , what if Mr. Obama kept his BlackBerry ?
What procedures would need to be put into place to make sure he 's safe and secure while using it ?
Electronic communication protection detail
Obviously , security is the biggest issue .
Imagine if each President had to hire " some guy " to protect him while out in public .
That was the case for all Presidents before Teddy Roosevelt .
In fact , Roosevelt created Secret Service protection for Presidents because of the McKinley assassination in 1901 .
Now , however , the exceptionally professional Presidential Protective Detail protects the President of the United States and his family .
The Secret Service uses sets of very carefully established procedures to ensure the protection of the President and is run by career professionals who have years of expertise and experience in Secret Service operations .
Sadly , nothing with the professionalism of the Presidential Protective Detail exists for managing White House email and gadgets like the BlackBerry .
Internal email management is left to the whims of the IT staff currently employed by the sitting administration .
I recommend the establishment of a career Electronic Communication Protection Detail , managed under the auspices of the Secret Service , with the same level of mission - centric attention to detail and professionalism as the Presidential Protective Detail .
With the electronic detail in place , some security concerns could be overcome .
If he has to set down his device , he could hand it to someone on the detail staff .
Members of this group can take direct responsibility for managing the device .
I believe the Secret Service is uniquely qualified to establish this detail because of its dual missions of Presidential protection and computer - based criminal investigation .
The Secret Service operates a network of Electronic Crimes Task Forces and Working Groups , so most technical expertise needed to establish an electronic detail is already in place .
The mission of the Electronic Communication Protection Detail needs to include the safeguarding of White House email security , the safeguarding and reliable archiving of all messages , and the overall management of email , instant message , cell phone , and BlackBerry communications within the White House staff - and if Mr. Obama keeps his BlackBerry , with special attention to the President .
Having one group managing electronic communication across administrations - and one with an excellent track record of protecting the President and the White House - would make both White House email and Mr. Obama 's BlackBerry far more secure .
I 've included management of cell phones and BlackBerry - style handheld PDAs within the mission of the proposed Electronic Communication Protection Detail because these devices are more powerful than many full - sized computers were during the Reagan Administration , and there 's huge risk if these devices are mismanaged .
Since email , computer files in the form of attachments , key contact lists , phone numbers , home addresses , and so much more are stored within these tiny potential nightmares , they need the same careful and integrated oversight that White House email should be getting .
Finally , there is one other option .
If Mr. Obama is willing to switch brands and use a Windows Mobile device instead of a BlackBerry , General Dynamics offers the Sectera Edge , an NSA - certified Type 1 ruggedized smartphone , developed for the National Security Agency 's SME PED ( Secure Mobile Environment Portable Electronic Device ) .
The operating system is not as refined as his BlackBerry , but this device might go a long way to providing the security he will need .
More important than the famous red telephone
If Mr. Obama wants to keep his BlackBerry , I think that 's great .
Presidents often get too cut off from the real world , and Mr. Obama 's BlackBerry may well be his lifeline to the living , breathing world outside the bubble .
That said , if the President - elect does get to keep it , he 's going to have to keep in mind the resulting changes .
He 'll have to remember , for example , that every " OMG " and " ROFLMAO " may become part of the public record .
But , most important , he would need to approach his Blackberry communication with the same careful deliberation he 's shown in his campaign and in the transition .
It 's not just a piece of office equipment or a decorative accessory .
And if Mr. Obama keeps his BlackBerry while President , that BlackBerry will become one of the most strategic communications devices operated by the United States of America .
It will vastly eclipse the famous red telephone .

For a year and a half , Ibrahim Makhlouf , a Palestinian school teacher , has been recording on video attacks on homes in his West Bank village by Jewish settlers .
He says they are getting more frequent and more violent .
" It 's frightening .
My children do n't sleep well at night .
They wake up from nightmares of Israelis attacking us , " he says .
" They are doing this so we will leave our homes , " he adds .
On his computer , Mr Makhlouf shows us footage taken earlier this month .
In it , settlers dressed in white , run down the hillside towards Palestinian houses , shouting .
They enter part of the village and surround homes , pelting windows with stones and rocks .
But some of settlers are also armed .
At several points , gunshots can clearly be heard .
Doctors say 10 Palestinians were injured in this incident , four with gunshot wounds .
None of the settlers has been held to account .
Law and order Mr Makhlouf points out figures wearing green fatigues on the screen .
These , Israeli soldiers , are seen for long periods standing amongst the attacking settlers , seeming to do little to intervene .
Hatred and aggression from the Arabs towards us is nothing new
Elan Ben-Shlomo Jewish settler
The Israeli army gave us a statement saying it " sees the wounding of Palestinian civilians as severe , and will continue to enforce law and order " .
Mr Makhlouf says the soldiers do not do enough .
" This has been going on for years , but nobody stops the settlers , the soldiers just stand and watch , and force us to stay in our homes , " he says .
" I decided to start recording the attacks because I wanted people to see what they are doing to us . "
Warped and gutted Mr Makhlouf lives in the village of Asira al - Qabiliya , in the heart of the northern West Bank .
Looking just a few hundred metres up the hill , from his living room window , we can see the tip of a Jewish settlement , Yitzhar .
The rest of it is out of view , high , over the ridge .
Jewish settlers say this house was burnt down by a Palestinian
In places like Yitzhar , hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers are now living on occupied Palestinian land , under the protection of the Israeli army .
Their presence is seen as one of the biggest obstacles to peace here .
We drove up to Yitzhar , and there , people told us it was they who were the victims , not the Palestinians .
From Elan Ben-Shlomo's home in the settlement , we can look down over Asira al - Qabaliya in the valley below .
But his house is warped and gutted .
Mr Ben -Shlomo tells us that , while he and his family were out , it was burnt down by a Palestinian .
He says the same man then attacked a nine - year - old boy with a knife .
" Hatred and aggression from the Arabs towards us is nothing new , " he says .
" But we have received a lot of support from people all over Israel and we will rebuild our house . "
Molotov cocktail Mr Ben - Shlomo told me it simply was not true that settlers had been attacking Palestinians .
He insisted that any footage we had must have been fabricated .
When I put it to him that , aside from Israel , all countries in the world considered settlements like his , built on occupied Palestinian land , illegal , he said he would never leave .
" This is the land God gave us , if you read The Bible you can know it , " he says .
" The Arabs and all the people around , have no right to be here . "
A couple of buildings away , along the ridge , is an Israeli army post , built to protect the settlers .
Despite heavy security , there are still attempts by Palestinians to attack settlements like this .
Only this week , Israeli soldiers shot dead a 14 - year - old Palestinian boy , who they say was trying to throw a molotov cocktail towards Yitzhar .
The complaint from Palestinians is that , for years , settlers have been attacking their villages , burning their farmlands , and injuring their people .
And they say , for them , there is no protection and their attackers go unpunished .

At TOPP there ’s a lot of traffic discussion , since a substantial portion of the organization is dedicated to Livable Streets initiatives .
One of the traffic ideas people have gotten excited about is Woonerf .
This is a Dutch traffic planning idea .
In areas where there ’s the intersection of lots of kinds of traffic ( car , pedestrian , bike , destinations and through traffic ) you have to deal with the contention for the streets .
Traditionally this is approached as a complicated system of rules and right - of - ways .
There ’s spaces for each mode of transportation , lights to say which is allowed to go when ( with lots of red and green arrows ) , crosswalk islands , concrete barriers , and so on .
A problem with this is that a person can only pay attention to so many things at a time .
As the number of traffic controls increases , the controls themselves dominate your attention .
It ’s based on the ideal that so long as everyone pays attention tothe controls , they do n’t have to pay attention to each other .
Of course , if there ’s a circumstance the controls do n’t take into account then people will deviate ( for instance , crossing somewhere other than the crosswalk , or getting in the wrong lane for a turn , or the simple existance of a bike is usually unaccounted for ) .
If all attention is on the controls , and everyone trusts that the controls are being obeyed , these deviations can lead to accidents .
This can create a negative feedback cycle where the controls become increasingly complex to try to take into account every possibility , with the addition of things like Jersey barriers to exclude deviant traffic .
At least in the U.S. , and especially in the suburbs or in complex intersections , this feeling of an overcontrolled and restricted traffic plan is common .
So : Woonerf .
This is an extreme reaction to traffic controls .
An intersection designed with the principles of Woonerf eschews all controls .
This includes even things like curbs and signage .
It removes most cues about behavior , and specifically of the concept of “ right of way ” .
Every person entering the intersection must view it as a negotiation .
The use of eye contact , body language , and hand signals determines who takes the right of way .
In this way all kinds of traffic are peers , regardless of destination or mode of transport .
Also each person must focus on where they are right now , and not where they will be a minute from now ; they must stay engaged .
So , I was reading a critique of Python where someone was saying how they missed public / private / protected distinctions on attributes and methods .
And it occurred to me : Python ’s object model is like Woonerf .
Python does not enforce rules about what you must and must not do .
There are cues , like leading underscores , the __magic_method__ naming pattern , or at the module level there ’s __all__ .
But there are no curbs , you wo n’t even feel the slightest bump when you access a “ private ” attribute on an instance .
This can lead to conflicts .
For example , during discussions on installation , some people will argue for creating requirements like " SomeLibrary > = 1.0 , < 2.0 " , with the expectation that while version 2.0 does n’t exist , so long as you install something in the 1.x line it will maintain compatibility with your application .
This is an unrealistic expectation .
Do you and the library maintainer have the same idea about what compatibility means ?
What if you depend on something the maintainer considers a bug ?
Practically , you ca n’t be sure that future versions of a library will work .
You also ca n’t be sure they wo n’t work ; there ’s nothing that requires the maintainer of the library to break your application with version 2.0 .
This is where it becomes a negotiation .
If you decide to cross without a crosswalk ( use a non-public API ) then okay .
You just have to keep an eye out .
And library authors , whether they like it or not , need to consider the API - as - it - is - used as much as the API - they - have - defined .
In open source in particular , there are a lot of ways to achieve this communication .
We do n’t use some third party ( e.g. , a QA team or language features ) to enforce rules on both sides ( there are no traffic controls ) , instead the communication is more flat , and speaks as much to intentions as mechanisms .
When someone asks “ how do I do X ? ” a common response is : “ what are you trying to accomplish ? ”
Often an answer to the second question makes the first question irrelevant .
Woonerf is great for small towns , for creating a humane space .
Is it right for big cities and streets , for busy people who want to get places fast , for trucking and industry ?
I ’m not sure , but probably not .
This is where a multi- paradigm approach is necessary .
Over time libraries have to harden , become more static , innovation should happen on top of them and not in the library .
Some times we create third party controls through interfaces ( of one kind or another ) .
I suppose in this case there is a kind of negotiation about how we negotiate — there ’s no one process for how to build negotiation - free foundations in Python .
But it ’s best not to harden things you are n’t sure are right , and I ’m pretty sure there ’s no “ right ” at this very - human level of abstraction .
Denver , CO – Arnold Zaler stood before a federal magistrate judge on the morning of March 11 , about to pull off one of his best scams yet .
The businessman known to most as “ Arnie ” was charged with 30 counts of bank and wire fraud for a scheme involving his kosher hot dog company and Denver ’s biggest sports venues .
If convicted , he faced more than 30 years in prison .
The judge , with no objection from prosecutors , set Zaler ’s bail at $ 25,000 , unsecured .
Zaler could go free without posting any money or property , but he had to agree not to leave the state of Colorado .
That same day Zaler turned over his passport and temporary travel documents issued by Israel , where he has told people he has dual citizenship .
Thirteen days later , he boarded a Delta Air Lines flight in Atlanta , bound for Jerusalem , the FBI has since learned .
Authorities Colorado have n’t seen him since .
The slip did n’t surprise some people who know Zaler , nor some of his previous victims .
Since making an unsuccessful run for Denver City Council in the 1970s , Zaler has devised a string of creative and convincing schemes , swindling people out of millions of dollars , according to court records .
In the mid-1990s , for example , he convinced a disabled woman distraught over her daughter ’s death .
He took her for about $ 100,000 , the woman told a judge in 1997 .
He forged a U.S. senator ’s signature on paperwork for business loans in Arizona and got his fraud trial there delayed by telling the judge his father had died – although he was very much alive .
And upon his return to Denver after serving time in an Arizona prison , Zaler persuaded some of the city ’s brightest business minds – many of them fellow Jews moved by his commitment to the community – to invest in his latest venture .
Then , using a scheme almost identical to the one that landed Zaler behind bars in Arizona , he scammed them to the tune of more than $ 2 million , prosecutors say .
The U.S. Attorney ’s Office has since started the process of trying to have Zaler extradited from Israel to the United States , spokesman Jeff Dorsch ner said this week .
But doing so is complicated .
It requires the involvement of the Department of Justice , the U.S. State Department , the American Embassy in Israel and the Israeli government .
“ It ’s a slow process , ” Dorschner said .
Meanwhile , sources in Israel said this week that Zaler is living free in Jerusalem , looking for money to open a new restaurant .
Smooth operator
Much of the 59 - year - old Zaler ’s success – legitimate or not – can be attributed to his uncanny ability to charm .
Described as an eloquent speaker who is highly personable , Zaler knew how to tell people just what they wanted to hear , several people close to him said .
Among the Jewish community , he spoke fervently of his love for Israel .
He sometimes flashed photos of himself with well - known politicians , including former President Jimmy Carter .
Outside the federal courthouse in Denver before his March 11 court appearance , Zaler said he wished he could talk about the allegations but that his attorney would n’t let him .
He then said he regretted that the story of his indictment had been in the newspaper and could be hurtful to his two children .
A family member later said Zaler has been estranged from his kids for some time .
Zaler grew up in Denver , where his grandfather ran a kosher deli for more than 50 years .
After graduating from North High School in 1967 , he went to the University of Colorado , where he became a leader in the left - wing group Students for a Democratic Society .
It was a tumultuous time , and Zaler started making his first headlines – he faced expulsion for holding an unauthorized meeting after SDS had been banned from campus and led a group of students who tried to disrupt ROTC drills .
He later left the SDS , saying he did n’t agree with the violent turn it was taking nationally .
By then Zaler had caught the politics bug .
In 1974 , he quit his job as a traveling salesman for a company that made Snoopy toys to work as an unpaid volunteer for Gary Hart ’s bid for U.S. Senate .
Five years later , at just 29 , he challenged a longtime city councilman nearly 40 years his elder for a chance to represent an east Denver district .
During the campaign Zaler touted his role in raising money for Denver ’s Babi Yar Park , a memorial to the 100,000 people killed and dumped in a ravine in the Ukraine by Nazis and their collaborators .
Several people confirmed that he did indeed raise money for the park but that his role was likely minor .
Zaler lost the election .
He soon turned his sights back to making money , this time in Arizona .
‘ Something ’s wrong ’
Zaler and his then - wife moved to the Phoenix area in the early 1980s .
Looking to capitalize on the “ computer revolution , ” they started a company called Softie and began creating computer games that were educational and nonviolent , Zaler told The Arizona Republic .
They included versions of Wheel of Fortune and The New York Times crossword , he said .
As in Colorado , Zaler was active in the community .
He started a group that pushed to get the state to recognize the federal Martin Luther King holiday , and he was a member of the Phoenix Jewish Federation .
At one point his name was floated as a possible candidate for Congress .
Among his connections Zaler also found investors .
He told them he had more orders for computer games than he could fill , with companies like MTV , Nickelodeon and Merv Griffin Enterprises , court records show .
Zaler told investors their money would finance the production of the games and result in quick profit .
According to the The Arizona Republic , he predicted gross revenues of $ 5.7 million in 1993 and $ 11.4 million in 1994 .
In reality the company was losing money , and sales never exceeded $ 500,000 .
Prosecutors said Zaler faked orders and befriended a manager at a local bank , who would vouch for the company ’s financial standing if any investor questioned it .
Investors sued in 1994 , and Zaler left the state , spending time in Denver and Israel , according to The Arizona Republic .
Maricopa County prosecutors concluded the business was a pyramid scheme , and in 1996 Zaler was charged with more than 50 counts of fraud and other crimes .
Authorities said he bilked at least 15 investors out of more than $ 15 million .
He also was charged with selling $ 35,000 in fake Arizona Cardinals and Phoenix Suns tickets .
The following year he was sentenced to 14 1/2 years in prison .
Zaler told the judge he had been afraid to tell friends and family that he could n’t make the numbers , according to a newspaper account .
He said he was a changed man .
But he also implied that his investors should have been more skeptical .
“ Somebody should have said ‘ Something ’s wrong with this picture , ’ ” Zaler said .
Back in Denver
With credit for time served and good behavior , Zaler was paroled in 2002 .
He returned to Denver , where he decided to get back in the old family business .
He also began ingratiating himself back into the Denver area ’s Jewish community .
The color scheme inside Zaler ’s Kosher Meats in Tamarac Square was blue and white , to show his support for Zionism , and he used the same logo his father and grandfather had used , according to a news story at the time .
He donated gift certificates to Jewish charities , and sponsored events such as a Jewish family picnic and a soup kitchen to raise money to end hunger in Israel .
In a story about the deli posted on a Web site run by the Allied Jewish Federation of Colorado , Zaler said at least five rabbis had announced the opening of his deli from the podium of their synagogues .
In 2005 , Zaler got a contract to open a concessions stand at the Pepsi Center .
He also had stands at Coors Field and Invesco Field at Mile High .
Zaler ’s contact at the Pepsi Center was a salesman named Ryan Smith , who worked for arena operator Kroenke Sports Enterprises .
Zaler recruited Smith to help with his scam , just like he had the Arizona bank manager , and he turned to his friends in the Jewish community for capital .
In a plea agreement filed this year in federal court , Smith admitted he and Zaler falsified purchase orders for hot dogs to be sold at the Pepsi Center then used the fake orders to persuade people to invest .
When investors demanded more documentation , Zaler and Smith faked delivery confirmations and letters from higher - ranking Kroenke Sports employees , Smith admitted .
The paperwork stated that Kroenke Sports would pay for the hot dogs up front , which the company does not do .
When one of the investors , Jay Spivak of Spivak Funding , grew angry that he was n’t being paid , Zaler said he would set up a meeting with Kroenke Sports owner Stan Kroenke , according to the plea agreement .
Zaler later lied and told Spivak that Kroenke – with whom he never spoke – had canceled the meeting because he needed more time to gather money , which was a lie .
He also said Kroenke was refusing to speak to Spivak by phone .
A few days later , the jig was up .
One of Spivak ’s partners called Kroenke Sports ’ general counsel , who informed them that the company had n’t been buying hot dogs from Zaler .
Spivak filed a civil lawsuit against Zaler in 2006 .
The following year , well - known Denver developer Jordon Perlmutter also sued , saying Zaler had taken him for more than $ 300,000 .
The federal indictment handed up in March accused Zaler of taking more than $ 2.2 million from investors based on the fake orders .
It named Donald Slupsky and MEP Group as additional victims , and said Zaler also committed fraud on his own , faking orders for hot dogs at places such as Target and Invesco Field .
Still seeking investors
Smith was fired from Kroenke Sports four days after Spivak ’s attorney called the company lawyer .
This year he entered a guilty plea in federal court .
He was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $ 2 million of restitution .
The FBI learned of Zaler ’s whereabouts in April after a Denver - area man reported that his daughter met Zaler while eating in a restaurant in a Jerusalem hotel .
Zaler told the young woman he was “ making aliya ” , according to an affidavit filed in federal court by an FBI agent .
It ’s unclear whether Zaler flew to Israel using travel documents other than those he turned in to the court or if he used a different name .
This week , two people who have met Zaler in Jerusalem said he is planning to open a restaurant there next month .
One person said Zaler has befriended several wealthy businessmen and is trying to get them and others to invest in his latest project .
Among his main selling point , the person said , are tales of his success in Denver .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Many U.S. troops in Iraq were overjoyed to see President Barack Obama take his oath , but some were unhappy about one thing the Democrat has promised to do : permit gay and lesbian soldiers to serve openly .

Obama said during his campaign he opposed a 1993 law stating that homosexuals are not eligible to work in the U.S. military , widely referred to as the “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” rule .
This month , Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs , when asked whether the new administration planned to scrap the law , replied on the president ’s transition website : “ You do n’t hear politicians give a one - word answer much .
But it ’s ‘ yes ’ . ”
But some of the 140,000 troops still in Iraq almost six years after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein appear uneasy about the prospect .
Specialist Joseph Watson , from Texas , was “ pretty excited ” to see America ’s first black president sworn in , he said , after watching Obama ’s inauguration on a big TV screen at the dining hall of Forward Operating Base Prosperity , in Baghdad .
But the 30 - year - old was a lot less excited about Obama ’s inclination to repeal the ban on gay men and women serving .
“ Ah , I think that might cause a lot of problems , ” he said .
“ It ’s a big moral issue .
It ’s giving the OK , saying that being gay is alright .
Personally , I do n’t think being gay is OK . ”
Each year , the U.S. military kicks out hundreds of soldiers for “ homosexual conduct , ” although numbers have fallen from 1145 in 1998 to 627 in 2007 , according to its own figures .
Many U.S. soldiers hail from Republican - voting “ Red States , ” where opposition to abortion and homosexuality runs deep and many are concerned that a Democratic administration means higher taxes , gay marriage and laws restricting gun ownership .
Even soldiers from “ Blue , ” Democrat - leaning U.S. states often hold Christian values they say clash with Obama ’s proposal .
Specialist Justin Scharan , from Washington State , battled to contain a smirk on his reddening face when asked his view .
“ I ’m Christian , so I really do n’t believe it ’s a good thing .
But if it happens , there ’s not much we can do , ” he said .
Obama opposed California ’s ban on gay marriage in November .
He has said he supports equal legal rights for same - sex couples , a topic of vociferous debate between liberals and conservatives .
He is expected to reverse many of former President George W. Bush ’s policies , including by closing the U.S. military ’s Guantanamo Bay detention center , banning interrogation techniques seen as torture , and scrapping funding restrictions on stem cell research .
But he may be mindful of former President Bill Clinton ’s early days , when he failed to push through a change of policy on gays serving in the military and drew fire from Christian groups .
Some soldiers questioned on inauguration day in Iraq thought it would be the wrong time to bring up such a sensitive issue with the United States facing multiple crises , from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to a U.S. recession and global economic turmoil .
“ I do n’t agree with it , ” said Staff Sargeant Tavar Cradle .
“ I think there ’s other , bigger issues that could be dealt with . ”
But one U.S. soldier , who asked not to be named or identified by rank , said he agreed with Obama on gays .
“ Put it this way : if they ’re willing to fight for their country , to me , it does n’t make a difference .
Everybody has a right to defend their country , even if they are gay . ”

Steam cycles are popping up in so many appliances like clothes washers , dryers , and dishwashers .
Why would I want steam ?
Ovens too , by the way .
People like the idea of sanitizing their clothes and utensils , so appliances with steam cycles have started to become popular .
The cycles are on a lot of top - of - the - line appliances as well , so many people assume they need it , which is n't always the case .
The most popular are laundry machines and clothes dryers ( as you can see in yesterday 's blog post ) .
For me , the one that makes the most sense is a dryer with steam .
What can they do ?
They can dry your clothes without leaving them wrinkled .
Use one as you would a normal dryer and during the final cycle , anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes of steam is injected and the clothes spin a few more minutes to get the extra mist out .
It 's also good if you have a garment you want to wear right away but it's all wrinkled , or a load of clothes for that matter , you can run a shorter steam cycle on the dryer and it will make them all wrinkle - free .
The steam feature really does add something and people may want to consider spending more for a steam - equipped dryer .
Can I use a steam dryer to dry - clean my clothes ?
Well no , they wo n't clean your clothes , but they will get out the wrinkles .
If you want to do that , use a Dryel bag .
You just put your delicate or permanent press garments in the bag and chuck it in the dryer , and it will clean them .
I 've read that steam in a dryer cuts down on static cling .
Yeah , it 's true .
But I 'm positive that it's an extra benefit .
There is no way some engineer sat in the corner and planned to use steam to reduce static .
It has to be a side effect of the steaming process , but either way , it is true .
What about steam in a washing machine ?
A steam cycle is a good add - on if you 're an allergy sufferer .
In that case , the steam is hot enough to kill dust mites and other allergens that hot water from your pipes might not take care of .
But one thing to keep in mind is that a lot of customers have a misconception about a steam cycle on their washer - that it will give them the same results as dry-cleaning .
It wo n't
The steam cycle is just another cycle before you put your clothes in the dryer , but one that can kill germs .
Do you recommend steam for dishwashers ?
For dishes , I personally think steam is less essential .
All higher - end units in the same price range heat the water to 165 - 170 degrees anyway , which is a disinfectant wash , much less the fact that you use detergent .
And I do n't see steam improving how clean your dishes will get .
In terms of using water , all washers today are more efficient due to efficiency laws .
Old dishwashers used 40 gallons of water to do a load of dishes , which is incredibly wasteful , whereas today it 's around 12 gallons or less .
You mentioned there are steam ovens .
How do they work ?
There 's a German company , Gaggenau , that makes a wall unit that does both regular and steam cooking .
You pour water into it much like you would a coffee machine , and that gives you enough steam to cook for about an hour .
So you can do your vegetables , or shrimp , and seafood , or use it just to refresh food that has cooled down .
Are they popular ?
Not yet !
Most people in the U.S. do n't cook using steam .
Heck , they 're still afraid of convection ovens , much less steam ones .
Old - fashioned steam is the hottest new thing .
But is the extra cycle worth it ?
That depends on what you want it for ...

President elect Barack Obama was cautious with his comments about the Gaza crisis while appearing on ABC’s This Week program on Sunday morning .
Obama agreed with Israel ’s right to self defense , while calling the violence heartbreaking .
He also hinted at a return to Clinton era Middle East policy .
Obama reiterated his belief that Israel has a right to defend itself against rocket attacks , “ I think that ’s a basic principle of any country is that they ’ve got to protect their citizens .
And so what I ’ve said is that given the delicacy of the situation , the one area where the principle of one president at a time has to hold is when it comes to foreign policy . ”
The president elect answered Arab critics about his silence on the issue , “ Well , look , I have said — and I think I said this a couple of days back , that when you see civilians , whether Palestinian or Israeli , harmed , under hardship , it ’s heartbreaking .
And obviously what that does is it makes me much more determined to try to break a deadlock that has gone on for decades now . ”

He also said that the United States needs to be more engaged and involved in the peace process , “ And I think that players in the region understand the compromises that are going to need to be made .
But the politics of it are hard .
And the reason it ’s so important for the United States to be engaged and involved immediately , not waiting until the end of their term , is because working through the politics of this requires a third party that everybody has confidence , wants to see a fair and just outcome . ”
Obama is limited in his ability to comment on the crisis , because he is not president yet .
By appointing Hillary Clinton as Sec. of State , he sent a strong signal that his Middle Eastern policy is going to be focused on getting the peace process back on track .
I believe that the most effective role for the United States is not to be a unilateral cheerleader for Israel .
Instead , the president should be using his influence to broker a lasting peace .
Notice the little shot that Obama took at Bush for waiting until the end of his term to work for peace .
I suspect that Obama has an idea of what he wants to accomplish , but getting the two sides to trust each other might be impossible .
Full This Week Transcript
So far , Obama has only nominated one ambassador - career professional Susan Rice as ambassador to the UN .
Here she is in September talking about Obama 's foreign policy .
Following up on reports of Obama 's intended Herculean cleaning of the Agean Stables at the Department of Defense , where the entire body of Bush - appointed deputies and under - whatevers are expected to be fired , the Washington Post now reports that the incoming Obama administration has told every single Bush political appointee as an ambassador that their services will no longer be required come January 20th .
That 's an awful lot of ambassadors .
An unusually high percentage of Bush 's ambassador picks throughout his presidency - about half - have been " political appointees , " as opposed to career foreign officers and without fail those political appointees have been big campaign donors , each raising over $ 100,000 for Bush and lots more for the Republican Party .
Nations that have had these , usually clueless , ambassadors foisted upon them just so that Bush could thank his biggest funders with a prestige sinecure include : Canada , Mexico , Britain , Sweden , the Netherlands , Spain , Australia , Belgium , Hungary , Ireland , Saudi Arabia , France , Portugal , Switzerland , Singapore and the European Union as well as a host of smaller nations .
The United States is the only nation which habitually staffs its top diplomatic positions in other countries with check - writing rank amateurs rather than professional diplomats .
Back in 2006 , in American Diplomacy magazine , retired senior Foreign Service officer Alan Berlind wrote :
[ T ]he day will dawn when our elected leaders rediscover the need for dialogue and reasonable accommodation in our international relationships .
When that happens , the job of repairing the enormous damage done to those relationships and restoring our reputation , credit , and influence in the world will fall in large part to America ’s diplomats , most particularly , American ambassadors , i.e. , the senior representatives of the American government and people abroad .
What better time , then , to re-examine the almost uniquely American practice of including among those representatives large numbers of people only rarely qualified for the job .
What better time indeed .
If Obama actually breaks with the tradition of the last three presidents and appoints more than two thirds of his ambassadors from the pool of foreign service professionals , then that will definitely be change I can believe in .

A Radical Perspective on Jurisdiction
by Gregory Allan
The subject of this report is " Jurisdiction , " and how it is commonly obtained by the various courts .
Although this author does not claim to have exhausted that question , it is my prayer that enough information is contained here to help the student to better understand the issue .
The material found here is based on my study of law , and the Holy Scriptures , and is Christian in perspective .
My main premise is that we have the duty and the right , to settle our own disputes , and to stay out of the courts of the ungodly .
Jurisdiction has been a subject of study and debate since long before I became involved in law reform , and seems to be most popular among those who are suspicious of establishment courts .
Each year brings more numerous reports of judicial misconduct , fraud and theft , on a scale ranging from minor traffic offenses , to multi-million dollar inheritance settlements .
Many students of law have seen jurisdiction ( or the absence of same ) as a possible answer to a seemingly impossible problem : how to avoid personal or financial ruin at the hands of judges and attorneys ?
Let 's begin with an understanding of the term .
What is Jurisdiction ?
Black 's Law Dictionary , sixth edition , defines jurisdiction as follows : " A term of comprehensive import embracing every kind of judicial action .
It is the power of the court to decide a matter in controversy and presupposes the existence of a duly constituted court with control over the subject matter and the parties .
Jurisdiction defines the powers of courts to inquire into facts , apply the law , make decisions , and declare judgment .
The legal right by which judges exercise their authority .
It exists when court has cognizance of class of cases involved , proper parties are present , and point to be decided is within powers of court . "
This is expanded upon in Anderson 's " A Dictionary of Law , A.D. 1893 " as follows : " Power to hear and determine a cause .
Power to hear and determine the subject - matter in controversy between parties to a suit , to adjudicate or exercise any judicial power over them .
( Relates to the exercise of judicial powers . )
Refers to the power of the court over the parties , the subject - matter , the res or property in contest , and the authority of the court to render the judgment or decree which it assumes to make .
( By jurisdiction over the " subject - matter " is meant the nature of the cause of action or relief sought ; and this is conferred by the sovereign authority which organizes the court , and is to be sought for in the general nature of its powers or in the authority specially conferred .
Jurisdiction of the " person " is obtained by the service of process , or by the voluntary appearance of the party in the progress of the cause .
Jurisdiction of the " res " is obtained by seizure under process of the court , whereby it is held to abide such order as the court may make concerning it .
Hence want of jurisdiction may be shown as to the subject - matter , the person , or , in proceedings in rem , as to the thing . )
In a nutshell , these definitions tell us that jurisdiction is the power of a court to make binding decisions with regard to people , and peoples ' rights in property ; that in order for the court to secure that power , it must have control ( authority and / or power ) over :
The people , or parties to the controversy .
This is called " in personam jurisdiction " ; and The property in controversy .
This is called " in rem " jurisdiction ; and The specific kind of controversy .
This is known as " subject - matter . "
For instance , a traffic court cannot hear a divorce case .
This is also known as the " nature " of a matter , as in the phrase " nature and cause " found in the Sixth Article of the " Bill of Rights . "
A very important aspect not mentioned in the dictionaries , is that jurisdiction never becomes a question for consideration until a dispute arises between people .
What is a Court ?
We are led to understand that jurisdiction " presupposes the existence of a duly constituted court . "
But there is no discussion of how a court becomes duly constituted .
Black 's definition of court is lengthy , and leaves the reader more confused than when he started .
Anderson 's has this to say about courts : " 1 . According to Cowel , the house where the king remains with his retinue ; also , the place where justice is administered .
( These two meanings , in the beginning , were closely connected .
For , in early history , when the king was actually the fountain and dispenser of justice , nothing could be more natural than that subjects who had complaints of ill - treatment to make should use the expression ' the court , ' in speaking of the journey to the place where the king was domiciled , and the application to him preferred , usually in the court of the palace , for interference and redress .
Anciently , then , the ' court , ' for judicial purposes , was the king and his attendants ; later , those who sojourned or traveled with him , to whom he delegated authority to determine controversies and to dispense justice . )
A tribunal established for the public administration of justice , and composed of one or more judges , who sit for that purpose at fixed times and places , attended by proper officers .
An organized body , with defined powers , meeting at certain times and places for the hearing and decision of causes and other matters brought before it , and aided in this by its officers , viz. , attorneys and counsel to present and manage the business , clerks to record and attest its acts and decisions , and ministerial officers to execute its commands and secure order in its proceedings . "
Before we can understand the full scope of an issue , we must begin at its roots ; ask the important questions .
Why are things the way they are , and how did they get this way ?
Who did these things , and who said that they could ?
In other words , " by what authority ; " or in more ancient terms , " quo warranto . "
Am I a Radical ?
By consistently examining every issue through the looking - glass of quo warranto , I have found a razor , which can cut to the heart of almost any issue .
Try it for yourself , but do n't be surprised if people begin to call you a radical .
Did you know that " radical " is defined as : " Fundamental ; going to the roots of anything . "
( Webster 's Unabridged Encyclopedic Dictionary , A.D. 1957 )
So what 's so bad about being radical ?
In going to the roots of jurisdiction , the first questions which come to my mind are , who is the " sovereign , " and what is a " retinue ; " how does a " tribunal " become " established ; " who " organized " the " body " of a given court , and by what authority ; and how does a " judge " become " charged " with deciding anything ?
I believe that the root definition of a lawful " court " is as follows : " A man , or group of men , lawfully delegated the authority to settle a dispute arising among two or more other men . "
Please note that the usage of the words " man " and " men " is inclusive of all people ; men , women , and children .
Courts exist because people inevitably have disputes .
" Jurisdiction , " in essence , is nothing more , or less , than the " lawfully delegated authority " to settle disputes .
Therefore , the study of jurisdiction must begin with the question of who has the right to settle disputes , and then follow through to how that right can be lawfully exercised , and delegated to others .
Where do rights come from ?
A lot of people claim to have Constitutional rights .
Those people have obviously never read the Constitution .
Read it yourself , and you will find that there is not a single article which grants rights to the people .
Rather , the people are acknowledged to possess certain rights , which pre-date the Constitution , and to which officers of the Union are required to take an Oath to protect , and not to violate .
Any so - called right , which is dependent upon a Constitution , a contract , or any other piece of paper , is more accurately described as a " delegation of authority , " or " privilege . "
If the paper is lost , destroyed , revoked , or amended , then the privilege which it created disappears .
In contrast , the laws of our One True God can not be lost or destroyed , and will never be revoked or amended .
Those who tell you that the law changes constantly , have forsaken our One True God , and embraced the Beast .
They would have you do the same .
In agreement with most of the founders of these united States of America , I believe that all rights originate from the Creator of all things , the One True God . ( Genesis 1:1 )
How do we know what rights
God gave us ?
This question stumps most people who claim God -given rights .
When asked the question , " Do all people have the same rights ? " most will answer " yes . "
When asked , " how do you know which rights God gave you ? " the most common answer is a blank stare .
The Holy Scriptures do not talk much of rights , with the exception on one : the right to choose , or free agency .
" Behold , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse ; A blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day ;
And a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known . "
( Deuteronomy 11 : 26 - 28 )
" And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood , or the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but as for me and my house , we will serve the Lord . " ( Joshua 24:15 ) Free agency is the one un alienable right given to us by the One True God .
We all have it , to a greater or lesser degree .
Even slaves have this right .
It is our right to choose .
The right to contract , or not to contract .
Unalienable means that it cannot be taken away by anyone except God , and cannot even be permanently given away by its owner .
This concept is even honored and upheld by modern statutes which allow anyone the right to revoke powers of attorney .
When people turn away from God 's laws ,
He makes them slaves , thereby taking away a large measure of their free agency .
He does this because He loves us .
Only the master is responsible for the acts of a slave .
Thus are many slaves saved from the burden of their sins .
All other rights are in alienable , meaning that they can be contracted away .
Any right , other than free agency , which could not be contracted away , would infringe our right to choose .
But which comes first , the rights , or the duties ?
Notice these other examples of the right to choose : " Now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . "
( Exodus 19 : 5 - 6 )
" If ye walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ;
Then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
And I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : . . .
But if ye will not hearken unto me , and will not do all these commandments ; . . .
I also will do this unto you ; I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it . "
( Leviticus 25 : 3 - 16 ) Clearly , the duty to follow God 's law precedes any blessings ( rights ) which He might bestow .
Just as clearly , those who follow God 's laws will be given more blessings ( rights ) than those who do not .
If you obey the commandment to not murder ( Deuteronomy 5:17 ) , you are given the blessing of safety .
If you violate that commandment , you are to be put to death ( Leviticus 24:17 ) .
Many of these examples can be enumerated .
If you steal another man 's property ( Exodus 20:15 ) , are you secure in the right to your own ( Exodus 22:1 ) ?
If you judge other men unrighteously , what right do you have to righteous judgment ( Matthew 7:2 ) ?
Stated another way , when we violate the law , we give up our rights to protection under the law .
What is law ?
This was a big shocker for me .
Who would think to look up the word " law , " even in a law dictionary ?
Black 's Sixth Edition devotes more than a whole page to the definition of law , but this part is the most striking :
In old English jurisprudence , " law " is used to signify an oath , or the privilege of being sworn ; as in the phrases " to wage one 's law , " " to lose one 's law . "
So , the " radical " definition of " law " is " oath . "
Other words with a similar meaning as " oath " include " contract , " " agreement , " " covenant , " " treaty , " " pledge . "
You get the idea .
So in essence , " law " is nothing more than a man 's agreement to behave in a certain way .
Even God 's law is rooted in His covenants with Abraham , Isaac , and Israel .
In the early days of this nation , most people followed God 's laws .
As a result , each man was blessed with sovereignty over his own affairs ; a large measure of free agency .
Unlike slaves or subjects , we became responsible for our own judgments ( Leviticus 18:4 ) , and became obligated to stay out of the courts of the ungodly .
If each one of us is sovereign , then does not each of us have our own court ?
Do n't we all possess the inherent right to settle our own disputes ?
Of course .
Which brings us back to the question : " How does someone else 's court gain jurisdiction over us , our property , and the operation of our affairs ? "
Property Ownership
Just because you have control over something does n't mean you necessarily own it .
Conversely , you may not necessarily have complete control over everything you " own , " unless you hold the highest title .
For example , a man who sells a parcel of land by way of a " land contract " holds legal title to the land until it is paid for , at which time he must then pass the title to the buyer .
But while the land is being purchased over time , the buyer has possession of the land , and in most ways uses it as his own .
He has what is called an " equitable interest . "
However , if the buyer does n't make his payments on schedule , then all rights in the land return to the seller , who has legal title , as well as a " reversionary " interest .
Do you own land ?
If you answered yes , here 's another question :
Do you pay yearly property taxes on that land ?
What happens if you do n't pay the taxes ?
How can you claim to own something that you only have the right to use , as long as you pay a yearly rental ?
We usually think of " property " in terms of land , money , or other tangible wealth , but property is always ultimately defined as " an aggregate of rights . "
The One True God owns everything , but we have rights in some of those things .
When we accept the duty of following God 's laws , and trust Him to help us protect our own rights ,
He asks us to pay a tithe ( tenth ) of our increase .
Note that He never asks for a portion of anything from which we have already paid a tithe , and He warns us that any government which does this is not following His law ; their authority is not legitimate , because it is " not of God . "
( See Romans 13:1 ) The power to tax is the power to destroy ; to confiscate .
This is what makes the so - called " property tax " one of the most evil ideas possible in a free society .
The ultimate conclusion is obvious :
Whoever has the power to tax property will eventually own all property ( all rights ) .
The governments in America today do not yet possess all of our rights , but in most ways they behave as though they do .
And most people , agents of government and common folk alike , have come to believe the lie .
These governments now behave in the same way as the lords of old England .
All the land and the fruits thereof are presumed to belong to the " king , " and at each level " down " toward the common folk ( serfs ) is a lord , or group of lords to administer the " fiefdom . "
The serfs have a limited privilege of sale or inheritance in property , so long as they continue to pay tribute ( tax ) to the king .
He who holds the highest title to property has the final say as to what becomes of that property .
This explains " in rem " jurisdiction .
Free agency in settling disputes Personam jurisdiction , as far as I understand it myself , is limited to some very basic principles .
Initially , it is determined as follows : Sovereigns , or freemen are those men who are not bound by oath to serve other men .
Subjects are those men who have given an oath of service to another man , or group of men .
Every freeman who follows
God 's laws , is blessed with the right to settle his own disputes , i.e. he holds his own court at will .
Freemen may bring suit against other freemen , though each has equal standing , and is not bound by any other man 's court unless by oath , or voluntary delegation .
A freeman is generally empowered to settle disputes between his subjects .
This is dependent upon the oath between the freeman and the subject .
A freeman may bring suit against his own subjects .
Subjects have no standing in any court , save that of their master .
They may sue their master only at his pleasure , unless the oath between the master and subject specifically allows it , which is not common .
No subject may directly sue another freeman , but must appeal to his master to sue for relief on his behalf .
Settling Disputes
In any dispute the parties have three choices : Forgiveness .
This choice works well when the party who perceives himself as damaged has not suffered too great a loss , and especially where the cause of the dispute is not likely to re-occur .
Sometimes if the other options are more costly than the expected relief , it is a choice which helps to preserve a man 's sanity .
However , no man can bear unlimited trespass , and will eventually seek other options .
Bloodshed .
This is one of the oldest methods of settling disputes .
It is forbidden in the Holy Scriptures , except under very specific circumstances .
This method of dispute resolution almost always eventually destroys the man who uses it in any way contrary to God 's law , which is why it is forbidden .
Lawful Process .
This is the preferred method of dispute resolution , without which we would have no need of discussing jurisdiction .
Lawful process can be divided into three sub-processes , which are listed in the Holy Scriptures , in the Book of Matthew , chapter eighteen , verses fifteen through sixteen .
It is important that we understand lawful process , because our only alternatives are forgiveness , or bloodshed .
Between sovereigns , war is nearly always the result of an inability to resolve a recurring dispute using lawful process .
Before lawful process can begin , the parties in dispute must be narrowed to include only parties of equal standing , as shown above .
Then they can proceed as follows : Negotiation .
In other words , a contract , or treaty .
" Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother . "
Negotiation is the most common form of settlement , which is an expression of our most basic right of free agency .
All contracts are examples of negotiation .
Most disputes which go beyond negotiation are a result of breach - of - contract .
In other words , one or more parties to a contract either do something which they had agreed not to do , or else fail to perform an act they have promised .
Even criminal acts come into courts as the result of a dispute .
As an example , let 's say that a man has stolen a loaf of bread from you .
First , you accuse him of the theft .
He either admits , or denies .
If he denies , you have a dispute .
If he admits , then you demand restitution ( replace the bread ) .
If he agrees , and then follows through , then there is no dispute .
If he does not agree , or if he agrees and then fails to follow through , then you have a dispute .
This same principle applies to all criminal acts .
Prosecutions for murder were originally civil disputes , prosecuted by the family of the victim .
County prosecutors came into existence as a means to protect the poor , who did not have the resources to prosecute criminals who had damaged them .
Mediation .
An attempt to reach an agreement with the help of a third party .
" But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established . "
We are to bring along one or two witnesses , preferably people known to all parties , to aid in the negotiation , and try to bring about a peaceful resolution .
Mediation , like all negotiation , must result in a contract , or treaty between the parties .
The mediator has no authority to compel the parties to agree , or to settle the dispute without agreement between the parties .
Arbitration .
This is the delegation of authority to a third party to settle the dispute .
" And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : " Arbitration , in its various forms , is what we commonly think of as a court .
It is the heart of this discussion on jurisdiction .
The church , a body of men learned in God 's law , was Jesus ' choice of arbitrator when all other attempts to settle a dispute had failed .
" Church , " in this sense , meant " ecclesia , " or the body of lawful elders .
In any arbitration , all parties in dispute choose to delegate the authority of their own court , the right to make their own judgment , to a third - party .
This is , in itself , the beginning of a negotiated settlement , since all parties must agree to the third - party arbitrator in order for him to have the power , i.e. jurisdiction , to settle the dispute .
The verse ends with these words : " but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican . "
In other words , if a man will not settle a dispute any other way , ignore him as long as you can , and then do what you must .
A man must always have a remedy .
Within the boundaries of God 's law , of course .
We 've learned that jurisdiction comes into play only in arbitration .
As near as I can tell , the sources of jurisdiction to settle a dispute can be narrowed to two : contract , and escheat .
Jurisdiction by Contract Contract includes voluntary participation , as well as any oath , agreement , or treaty which delegates the authority to settle disputes to another party .
Walking into a court and giving your name is an example of voluntary participation .
Acceptance of service of process , even from a court with whom you have no contract , can become voluntary participation if you fail to send timely notice to the court of its lack ( known as " want " ) of jurisdiction .
Jurisdictional agreements often occur far in advance of a dispute .
Contracts containing clauses such as " this contract is made pursuant to the laws of Delaware , " or which are acknowledged by a Notary Public , or other officer of a body with an organized court , delegate jurisdiction as a part of the contract .
The recording of a contract with a clerk or " register , " for a body with an organized court , gives that court " cognizance " of the contract .
It begins with a contract when a man recording a document pays a fee to the register .
Look back at Black 's definition of jurisdiction .
" [ Jurisdiction ] exists when court has cognizance of [ matter in dispute ] . "
Many law reform students believe that recording a deed for land with a county register gives the county either legal title or equitable interest in the land .
It appears from the evidence , that recording merely gives the county jurisdiction to settle disputes involving the land , and the parties to the deed .
Many contracts contain clauses which specifically delegate jurisdiction to an arbitration council .
If any dispute shall arise between the parties to this contract with regard to the covenants contained herein , then jurisdiction over the settlement of said dispute shall be limited to the XYZ Resolution Council , located at 321 Abicromby Place , Anywhere , U.S.A , and the judgments and awards of said Council shall be binding upon the parties hereto .
Jurisdiction by Escheat Escheat is a different matter , and is widely misunderstood .
Black 's Sixth Edition defines it as : A reversion of property to the state in consequence of a want of any individual competent to inherit .
Remember that " property " is not land , money , or other wealth ; it is an " aggregate of rights . "
Is the " right to settle disputes " a property right ?
Of course it is .
All rights are property .
When we neglect to delegate to a specific party the right to settle disputes arising from our contracts , there is no one who is competent to inherit that right if a dispute does arise .
This makes our " property " easy pickings for any " sovereign " with an organized court to step in and claim that right for his own .
The burden of proof is then shifted to the parties , to prove that someone else has that right .
If no competent party can come forward and claim that property right , then the parties are " escheated " out of it .
Escheat is also significant on a broader scale .
By allowing a Godless body of men to organize together and monopolize our courts , Christians have abandoned the right to settle their own disputes , and barred themselves from righteous judgment .
So long as no one is willing or able to fill that capacity , we will continue to be " escheated " over and over again .
Our only solution is to reaffirm our Christian Duties , rediscover our Rights , and exercise our God-given Authority .
Common law courts , ecclesiastical courts , and other types of peoples ' courts are currently springing up all over the country .
Although the mainstream media usually maligns these courts , their formation is a symptom of peoples ' deep - seated impulse to return to God 's law .
Unfortunately , too many of these groups are not educated in the due- process procedures required of a lawful court .
Careful study is needed in the operation of any court , for if due process is not afforded the parties in dispute , the rights of the court will be taken through escheat .
It is my prayer that this report will aid all people in achieving peace in their lives , which is the aim of any lawful court .
I pray that all courts , and all people with disputes , will better understand the limited authority with which a court operates .
May the One True God give us the Strength and Wisdom to follow a True Course .
Amen .

Qiana Zimmerle got an early start on her Christmas shopping last week , heading to a Kmart in Burbank where she loaded up a cart with toys , clothes and a High School Musical game .
But with money tight this year , instead of going to the checkout line , Zimmerle dropped the gifts off at the layaway counter , paid a small deposit and left the store -- for now .
Over the next few weeks , she ’ll make regular payments on the remaining $ 113.18 balance and pick up the items when she ’s paid it off .
“ I have 12 nieces and nephews , so that ’s why I have to do it this way , ” said Zimmerle , 28 , who lives in Eagle Rock .
“ It ’s easier on me , money - wise . ”
After pulling back on layaway programs for years , retailers are again touting the service as a financially savvy way to buy goods this holiday season .
Cash - poor and credit - strapped shoppers are responding by flocking to layaway counters at stores such as Kmart , Marshalls and Burlington Coat Factory , and using online options such as ELayaway.com .

“ The response has just been tremendous , ” said Tom Aiello , a spokesman at Kmart , which is running a national holiday ad campaign to hype its longtime layaway service .
“ We know for a fact that it ’s a big increase over the usage from last year . ”
Retailers are hoping the availability of layaway will boost customer traffic during the coming weeks .
“ The expectation on all retailers is that this is going to be an extremely tough holiday season , ” said Richard Giss , a retail analyst with accounting firm Deloitte & Touche .
“ So they ’re reaching into the old retail bag of tricks .
How do you get people to spend money when they ca n’t afford it ?
You help them budget , you help them plan -- that ’s really what a layaway plan is at its core . ”
Unlike credit cards , layaway plans usually carry no interest .
Most stores require a small deposit or flat fee upfront and place some restrictions on what can be put on layaway , such as perishables and clearance items .
A typical layaway term is 30 to 60 days , Giss said .

Layaway programs rose to popularity during the Great Depression and became a common form of payment for consumers who could n’t afford to pay cash upfront .
But once credit cards became widely available layaway all but disappeared , with the exception of a handful of retailers .
Now layaway is making a big comeback .
Thanks to the credit crunch , the buy - now - pay - later mentality of credit cards has been replaced by frugal consumer spending and an unwillingness to take on more debt .
“ People are looking to buy the things they want with non-credit - based terms , ” said Michael Bilello , senior vice president of business development at ELayaway.com .
“ The lend - and - spend boom is over . ”
Bilello said ELayaway.com , a 3 - year - old payment processing service affiliated with more than 1,000 merchants including Gap and Adidas , has seen a sharp rise in business from both consumers and retailers .
The company ’s membership has risen to 75,000 registered shoppers today from 10,000 in January , Bilello said .

“ Big - box retailers are now contacting us and saying , ‘ We want to offer layaway terms to our consumers , ’ ” he said .
Leticia Castaneda of Glendale said seeing Kmart ’s layaway commercial on television sold her on the service .
“ I heard . . . there was a layaway department , so I came , ” said Castaneda , 45 , as she placed about $ 500 worth of Christmas presents on layaway at the Kmart in Burbank last week .
“ Instead of paying three , four hundred bucks at once , I take my time , ” she said .
“ It makes it easier on the Christmas shopping . ”
Wal - Mart Stores Inc. made headlines two years ago when it announced it would drop its layaway program .
Despite the recent resurgence in the service , the country ’s biggest retailer said it would n’t reverse the decision .

“ Right now there are no plans to bring back layaway , ” Wal - Mart spokeswoman Anna Taylor said .
“ Traditional layaway programs are expensive , and ultimately that cost is factored into the cost of products , which affects the customers . ”
And the availability of layaway programs has n’t helped some businesses .
Nancy Maher , who owns a jewelry stand in downtown Los Angeles , said that despite offering a flexible layaway plan that does n’t include a set deposit amount or fixed payment dates , she has had fewer customers lately and has seen layaway use drop 50 % over last year .
“ When the economy is down , jewelry is a luxury , ” Maher said .
“ It you have some money , first you eat , then you buy clothes .
Jewelry is the last thing people buy . ”

But for the essentials and less pricey gifts , layaway could be the answer to many consumers ’ financial troubles this year .
Zimmerle , the Kmart shopper , said she faced higher prices for groceries and rent in recent months and was worried that the company where she worked as a payroll account coordinator might go out of business .
Without layaway , she said , “ I ’d have to do the Secret Santa thing , ” picking one of her relatives at random and buying a gift only for that person .
Even the 99 Cents Only Stores chain , which sells all of its products for less than a dollar , unveiled its own layaway program last week .
Advertisement
“ I think it ’s probably a real sign of the times , ” said Eric Schiffer , chief executive of City of Commerce - based 99 Cents Only .
“ We just feel it ’s a service we want to offer our customers . ”
“ If there ’s a big bottle of spaghetti sauce and they can put a quarter down , pay a nickel each week and pay it off by Christmas , it ’s theirs . ”

Along the way , Wolverine encounters many mutants , both familiar and new , including surprise appearances by several legends of the X - Men universe whose appearances in the film series have long been anticipated .
He added that the dollar had been kept elevated in recent years by what some called " dark matter " or " American alpha " – an assumption that the US could earn more on its overseas investments than foreign investors could make on their American assets .
However , this notion had been gradually dismantled in recent years , before being dealt a fatal blow by the current financial crisis , he said .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
Despite a bleak economic environment featuring wide - ranging layoffs and rising unemployment , the nation ’s premier law enforcement agency is touting “ one of the largest hiring blitzes in our 100 - year history . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The FBI posted openings for 850 special agents and more than 2,100 professional support personnel .
Officials say it ’s the largest FBI job posting since immediately after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The FBI ’s unexpectedly large number of job openings results more from attrition and a wave of retirements than from growing government appropriations , Bureau officials told CNN .
The FBI routinely advertises openings for individuals with critical skills in computer science and language fluency .
But John Raucci , assistant director of the FBI ’s Human Resources Division , says current needs are much more wide - ranging .
“ We ’re also looking for professionals in a wide variety of fields who have a deep desire to help protect our nation from terrorists , spies and others who wish us harm , ” Raucci said .

In a measure of how quickly its options are shrinking , the United States is about to embrace an economic theory that was widely thought for most of the last generation to have been discredited : the idea that great bursts of deficit - funded government expenditure can jolt an economy back to growth .
And the nation is poised to put this theory to the test on a scale untried in peacetime by any developed country on Earth .
President - elect Barack Obama will soon unveil a package of tax cuts and spending increases that , combined with already planned spending , would push Washington ’s 2009 deficit to between $ 1.5 trillion and $ 2 trillion -- more than 10 % of the economy ’s output .
And he will argue that this tidal wave of federal expenditure should continue into next year , and perhaps beyond .
Only during World War II did U.S. government expenditures account for a greater share of economic activity , according to federal statistics .
That ’s also true for virtually every other developed country .

“ There ’s been nothing of the magnitude of what the incoming administration is contemplating -- certainly not as intentional policy -- in the modern era , ” said Adam Posen , deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
The sheer size of Obama ’s plan and the considerable support it is generating among economists as well as the public are testament to the frightening dimensions of the global economic plunge -- and to the fact that , to date , efforts by government policymakers have done little more than slow the fall .
Obama ’s plan represents an unexpected comeback for the ideas of the late British economist John Maynard Keynes , who argued in the 1930s that governments could end the Depression by spending heavily to maintain demand for goods and services until frightened consumers and damaged businesses gained the courage to resume buying and selling on their own .
The secret , Keynes argued , was not so much the amount of money the government spent , but how convincingly it signaled that the economic game was reviving -- and thus enticed players in the private sector to overcome their fears and begin playing again .
Advertisement
In this regard , timing and the political atmosphere when the government acted were critical :
The size of the stimulus had to be large enough to seem likely to have an effect , and action had to be taken quickly and decisively -- without the kind of political haggling that could undermine confidence .
Experience also suggests the stimulus strategy must be accompanied by steps to fix the damaged financial system , especially credit , economists say .
“ If you do n’t fix the financial system , you ’re going to linger in the wind for a very long time , ” said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff .
For decades , conservative economists have dismissed Keynes as misguided .
What has suddenly revived interest in his ideas is the shattering speed with which the present economic crisis has developed .

At the American Economic Assn.'s annual meeting in San Francisco last week , experts conceded that they had been caught flat - footed by the virulence of the current crisis and were rushing to brush up on Keynesian “ fiscal stimulus . ”
“ Fundamentally , we ’re facing a whole new ballgame , ” said Boston College economist Peter Gottschalk .
“ We thought we knew how to treat the disease of recession .
We were able to give it the right medicine and basically had it under control .
“ Now we ’ve discovered there ’s a new strain of the disease that requires a different kind of treatment , and our understanding of that treatment is very limited . ”
International Monetary Fund policymakers are urging nations to raise government spending by about 2 % of their economic output -- a combined total of several trillion dollars -- to combat the global downturn .
China announced last month a $ 586 - billion package , which amounts to about 8 % of its output .
South Korea and Taiwan each have promised packages amounting to 4 % of national output , and the European Union is considering a plan worth roughly $ 250 billion .

Critics of fiscal stimulus complain that government spending is invariably wasteful because it must occur quickly to prop up the economy , and that the resulting deficits eventually drive up interest rates , crowding out more - efficient private - sector investment .
But with the U.S. facing perils unseen since the Depression , the incoming administration is looking to President Franklin D. Roosevelt , the New Deal and Keynesian economics for inspiration .
Indeed , in a major speech last week , Obama seemed to echo FDR ’s central questions : how a nation with so many needs and resources could find itself producing less , not more , and what was to be done about it .
The president - elect declared that his stimulus plan would recognize “ the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there are millions of Americans trying to find work , even as , all around the country , there is so much work to be done . ”
Obama aides surprised some observers last week by revealing that about 40 % of the stimulus package would take the form of tax cuts rather than direct spending .
Several studies of recent tax cuts have concluded that those receiving them pocketed much of the money instead of spending it , dampening the growth - spurring effect .

But Obama also has promised the biggest public works initiative since the construction of the interstate highway system in the 1950s , as well as programs to repair schools , expand Internet access , make public buildings more fuel - efficient , spur growth of a renewable - energy industry , and modernize the nation ’s electric power grid .
Those efforts would hark back to FDR undertakings , including the notable Works Progress Administration program , which put millions of Americans to work on giant projects such as the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state .
Although Keynes ’ name is indelibly intertwined with FDR’s , Roosevelt did little Keynesian deficit spending during the 1930s .
“ It was n’t until 1937 that he ’d intellectually accepted deficit spending as a means of combating the Depression , and then there was a lot of timidity on his part about using the idea , ” said Stanford historian David M. Kennedy , whose book “ Freedom From Fear ” is widely considered the definitive account of the era .
Advertisement
Roosevelt ’s 1937 budget included a mere $ 3 billion of deficit spending , which amounted to 3 % of national output , or less than a third of the proportion Obama is prepared to call for -- totaling about $ 800 billion .
It was World War II that settled the question of whether the economy could survive large government deficits and , as Keynes asserted , prosper .
By 1943 , deficit spending grew to more than 30 % of gross domestic product .
The U.S boomed during the war and , after a brief but frightening recession in 1945 , it expanded powerfully .
Keynesian fiscal stimulus became such an entrenched idea that governments around the world used it to spur growth .
But from the heyday of Keynesianism to the present , no country has attempted an experiment anywhere near as audacious as what Obama now proposes .
For example , spending under the post - World War II Marshall Plan , which sparked the rebuilding of war - wrecked Europe , never amounted to more than 5 % of recipient nations ’
GDP , according to Tyler Cowen , a George Mason University economist .
Advertisement
And with Ronald Reagan ’s election in 1980 , the goal became to shrink government , not expand it .
Management of the economy had been largely transferred to the Federal Reserve and monetary policy .
By the 1980s , recessions and serious economic turmoil seemed to be troubles of the past .
Until now .
The fundamental argument for the huge stimulus has little to do with analysis of past plans or economic theories .
What ’s driving it is the fact that the U.S. and most other countries are in a largely unforeseen and terrifying mess .
Other than waiting for the problem to burn itself out , the new administration sees few alternatives but to return to Keynes and stimulus .

Eighties pop star Rick Astley has branded his surprise victory in the best act ever category at the MTV Europe Music Awards as " ridiculous " .
The singer beat U2 , Green Day and Christina Aguilera to the gong , which was voted for by the public .
He said : " I just felt it was a bit of a daft award .
" How can you present the best act in the world ever especially when you 've got Paul McCartney on the show as well ?
It was just a bit ridiculous . "
Although he played down the victory , the singer said he was very pleased that the public had voted for him .
" They mentioned the phrase " rickrolling " ( a phrase coined after his hit Never Gonna Give You Up was hidden behind a variety of fake web links as an online prank ) last night and I think MTV were thoroughly rickrolled , " he said .
" I really appreciate all the guys that did vote for me but I also feel for all the artists who got rickrolled a bit last night because there were obviously some people there that perhaps deserved it more than me .
" You 've got people like U2 in that category and Christine Aguilera so it 's a bit of a funny one . "
Despite his famous win the singer said he had no plans to make a return .
He added : " I do n't have the desire to come back with a new single .
I still do gigs and sing my old tunes and pretend I 'm 21 again for an hour which is nice .
Rick Astley in his heyday back in the 80s " I do n't really crave having a record again in that way .
I think those days are gone .
They 're best left where they are . "
The ' 80s pop star also admitted that he was a big fan of talent shows such as The X Factor .
He said : " The one thing I like about X Factor and those shows is the people are getting to say what they want .
" They 're actually voting and it 's down to them at the end of the day .
" I genuinely think Daniel ( Evans ) has got a lot of fans because what he does , he does well .
" It shows you can't decide what people want at the end of the day .
You can try and ram it down their throats but you can 't . "
Rick Astley was talking to Comedy Dave from Chris Moyles ' Breakfast Show on Radio 1 .

You thought I was kidding when I said I would do an entire podcast about toilets , but you were wrong .
Here ’s what Japanese toilets taught me about the auto industry .
Play Episode ( recommended for maximum loud , funny , ranting ) :
Or read as a blog post :
Konnichiwa , boys and girls .
Today I ’ll do my final podcast about my trip to Japan .
Previously I ’ve covered a dozen marketing and cultural observations about Japan and why Japan is the king of customer service .
So if you have n’t seen those yet , check â€˜em out .
But another thing that really struck me was the Japanese bathrooms .
Â
Do n’t worry , I ’m going to keep the language , um , out of the gutter , but when I started thinking about how to broach this topic , somehow the US auto industry came to mind , which of course , is going down the toilet .
But along the way , think about how the topics I discuss apply to ANY business .
So let me rant about five things involving toilets , and cars …
1 ) Â Â Â Evolution
Think about the toilet in your apartment .
Think about the toilet at your office .
Think about the toilet at your parent ’s house .
Think about the toilet you had when you were 5 years old .
What do they have in common ?
EVERYTHING .
They ’re exactly the same .
For me , with the exception of my unrenovated 60s era apartment in Seattle in which the toilet was a bright canary yellow , every single one was basically the same , a white ceramic bowl with a white ceramic cover with a white lid .
Â
OK , maybe at my mom ’s house there ’d be a furry blue cover or a red and green one with Santa on it during the holidays , but they were all the same .
Which is why it ’s so striking when you go to Japan , because the toilets are unlike anything you ’ve ever seen .
They seem so evolved .
I ’ll talk about how in a second .
Now lets compare cars from the US and Japan .
I ’m not going to rip the US car industry and say that they ’ve never evolved , but look at something like a Jeep Cherokee from the 80s compared to now .
Are they really that different ?
Now pick a Japanese care and do the same thing .
You want a rant about car evolution ?
Listen , I do n’t know if it was a Japanese company or an American company that finally figured this one out , but how about accidentally leaving your lights on and draining your car battery .
How many of you are nodding your head right now , shuddering about the time you left the lights on in your car , went into a friend ’s house or the football game or whatnot , and when you came out , your lights were on , and your battery was dead .
Really ?
We could n’t figure this one out ?
Not a single engineer for years and years and years and years spoke up and said , you know , there ’s really no need to have your lights stay on , why do n’t we make it so that when you shut the car off , it shuts your lights off ?
What happened to that guy ?
Did he get fired on the spot ?
Â
Did they lock him in a basement in Flint , Michigan ?
Â Really ?
You mean to tell me that no one thought this was a good idea ?
Think about thatâ€¦ think about how many thousands of lost productivity hours there were from people that could n’t get to work .
Think about all the dangerous situations people were put in stranded at night in a parking lot .
Think about all the nice couples having brutal fights as the frustration mounted .
Think about all the annoying announcements in department stores ‘ Would the owner of a blue Plymouth Reliant , license plate 147 - PFH please return to your car , your lights are on . ’
My theory is that there was a powerful mafia organization built around Sears Diehard batteries and the jumper cable industry .
Would n’t it have been nice if all American cars evolved past that 20 years ago ?
And two quick ones : when I was in high school in the 80s , we had our standard American cars , but my friend ’s family bought a Subaru station wagon .
And I was struck by two things on the dashboard .
First , the heat controls were nice , round , clearly marked dials that you could twist easily , not difficult sliding levers .
And second , the hazard lights were simply a triangle on the dash that you pushed .
Press once , the hazards were on .
Press again , they were off .
On American cars , you sometimes had to do a 2 - step process to turn on the hazards , and sometimes it was located under the steering column .
Again , really ?
They ’re HAZARD LIGHTS .
Who thought , well , if someone needs the hazard lights , it ’s probably a stressful , emergency situation .
Let ’s hide the switch and make it difficult to engage !
2 ) Â Â Â Mechanical breakdowns
Ever have to unjam a stopped up toilet ?
Is there any greater fear – any greater fear ?
– then when you ’re at your rich friend ’s house and they have like 6 - ply , 300 - thread count Egyptian - weave toilet paper and you flush and it starts to get stuck and the water is rising and your heart stops because it looks like it might overflow ?
Ever use a snake ?
Or a plunger ?
Or deal with a plumber ?
Or have to take the cover off to inspect the ball and chain mechanism ?
Or have a toilet keep running forever ?
Not good times .
My point is ?
Should n’t we have figured this out by now ?
Â
According to wikipedia , toilets were invented in 2800 BC .Â
Should n’t plumbers be out of business ?
I ca n’t say for sure that the newer Japanese toilets work any better , but just check out the video on TheHopkinsonReport.com .
They ’re at least trying .
They ’ve got a freaking vortex going .
As far as mechanical breakdowns for cars , the story has been told many times .
Now do n’t write me angry emailsâ€ ¦
I do n’t have JD Power and Associates on retainer to fill my head with data .
But I think most would agree that although the US has made great strides and some companies and some models have caught up in quality , Japanese cars consistently had fewer mechanical problems than US cars over the years .
3 ) Â Â Â Customer service
Let me say three words and tell me what images it conjures up : Used .
Car. Dealer .Â
What about bringing the car to the shop ?
What about dealing with mechanics ?
What about your confidence level that you ’re getting a good deal when buying a car ?
Â
Few people rave about the history of customer service in the US auto industry .
And hey , I ca n’t speak to the car buying experience in Japan , but when every single customer interaction in the entire country for me was a good one ?
I ’ll take my chances that car shopping is n’t too bad either .
So what about the buying process for toilets ?
In the US , how does one even buy a toilet ?
Well , you ’re either dealing with the folks at Home Depot – if you can get someone to come to aisle 17 – or you ’re dealing with a general housing contractor .
Hmmmâ€¦ do they fall above used car dealer or below ?
But in Japan ?
I am horribly embarrassed to say that on my vacation , I took a tour of the Toto Toilet Headquarters .
HEY !
It was recommended in the freaking Lonely Planet guide next to museums and other attractions !
Demo video of high - tech , green , Japanese toilet from Jim Hopkinson on Vimeo .
And you know what ?
It did n’t disappoint !Â
It was like an IKEA , but 10 times better .
Â
They had kitchens and sinks and bathrooms with LCD TVs in the tub .
Â
Granted , there were no Swedish meatballs , butâ€ ¦
â€ ¢Â Â Â They had before and after makeovers showing how their products could increase efficiency in your house
â€ ¢Â Â Â A team of three attractive Japanese girls giggled , laughed , and bent over backwards giving me a rundown of products in their catalog
â€ ¢Â Â Â A man dressed like a scientist gave me a personal tour or their newest models
â€ ¢Â Â Â
At the end of the mini tour , they gave out free gifts !
4 ) Â Â Â Going green
You do n’t have to be Al Gore to know that American auto companies fought vigorously against hybrids and alternative fuel vehicles over the past few decades in favor of giant gas - guzzling SUVs that padded their bottom line .
Just think of the leadership position they ’d be in right now if they were forward thinking .
Instead , when I hear the word ‘ Hybrid , ’ I think Toyota Prius .
They ’re way ahead and we ’re playing catch - up .
As far as toilets go , I know there have been advances in basic US toilets which use fewer gallons of per flush and thus conserve water .
But , I ’ve also heard that they are n’t as strong , so sometimes you have to flush twice , thus not saving water at all .
I ’ve also heard stories of people paying off contractors to get the â€˜old kind . ’
But I do know this .Â
In the demo the guy gave me in Japan , the new model shoots the water around in a Bermuda - triangle - esque vortex , and they had some fancy meter hooked up that measured the force of the flush .
Put it this way , hold onto your iPhone because if you drop it by mistake , it ’s never coming back .
5 ) Â Â Â Technology
In the auto industry , I have to applaud both sides of the globe for the advances in the past 25 years .
Cars can be driven longer and longer , they break down less , and antilock brakes , crumple zones , and airbags are saving lives .
But in the bathroom , it ’s a different story .
In the United States , I feel we ’ve taken a giant leap backwards .
I do n’t know whose fault it was , but it has been decided that no American can be trusted to simply turn on a faucet , turn it off when we ’re done , and use enough paper towels to dry our hands .
TheHopkinsonReport.com looks at High Tech Control Panels on Japanese Toilets from Jim Hopkinson on Vimeo .
Oh no .
We must all be treated like idiots and punished .
We ’re forced to succumb to some crazy dance where we have to wave our hands in front of infrared sensors , push a knob and wash our hands in 3 seconds flat , dry our hands with half a sheet of gauze , or blow cold air on our wet hands before wiping them on our pants .
It ’s really quite sad .
— OK , stop the podcast .
This is unprecedented .
I recorded this podcast on a Tuesday night , and was editing on a Wednesday night , and I was still so fired up about this , I plugged in the mic and added even MORE ranting .
Does NO ONE see a problem with this ?
Does anyone care ?
I challenge ANYONE â€¦ ANYONE !
â€¦ to show me an automated system that does the following 4 things perfectly
1 ) as soon as I wave my hands a single time at the sensor , the water immediately turns on
2 ) the water is the right temperature and comes out hard enough to wash the soap off , but not so hard that it splashes
3 ) as soon as I wave my hands a single time at the dryer sensor , a paper towel immediately comes out
4 ) The paper towel I get is substantial enough to dry my hands in a single use – I do n’t have to get another sheet , and I do n’t have to wipe my hands on my pants
— OK , back to the podcast
But not in Japan .
â€ ¢Â Â Â Let ’s start with every toilet having a heated seat .
I do n’t know anyone that does n’t like heated seats in their car .
Why not have it in the john ?
â€ ¢Â Â Â How about an electronic control panel on the wall instead of that clangy metal knob
â€ ¢Â Â Â How about an electronic sensor that will automatically raise and lower the seat .
That argument between men and women has been around since the dawn of time .
Not anymore .
â€ ¢Â Â Â And the water jets ?
Do n’t knock it till you try it .
â€ ¢Â Â Â
So when you read about other options such as auto flushing , blow dryers , deodorizing fans , and artificial flushing sounds , it sounds like you ’re comparing a brand new , top of the line 2009 Infiniti or Lexus to a 2001 Pontiac Aztec .
So in the end , what did we learn here ?
I covered :
â€ ¢Â Â Â Continually evolving your product
â€ ¢Â Â Â Maintaining product quality
â€ ¢Â Â Â Superior Customer Service
â€ ¢Â Â Â Operating in an environmentally friendly way
â€ ¢Â Â Â Keeping up with new technology
What I ’m trying to get across , is that it does n’t matter if you ’re making Toto Toilets or Toyota Tundras , these qualities are necessary for ANY business to succeed .
So in the end , was I able to do an entire podcast about toilets ?
You bet your ass I was .
Nah , he's cute really , but i do n't know if the chicken rescued the mouse out of mercy or a quick meal for pinching its corn ?
The Record Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) is suing a seriously ill teenager for illegally sharing music , despite the fact that the family could n’t afford to represent themselves in court , let alone pay a fine .
19 year old Ciara Sauro from Pittsburgh suffers from pancreatitis , needs an islet cell transplant and is hospitalized weekly .
She lives with her single mother , who earns minimum wage .
The background narrative may not excuse them necessarily from the case , but here ’s where it gets interesting .
They could n’t afford to defend the case , so a Federal Judge ruled her guilty in absentia and imposed an $ 8000 fine , which she ca n’t afford to pay either , due to hospital bills .
The amount of songs allegedly shared : 10 .
Sauro denies the claim : “ Look and see where it ( the downloads ) came from , and look and see that it ’s not me .
It ’s not fair to do to me . ”
Better still , the Internet account in the lawsuit was opened by her estranged father , who does n’t live at the same address .
It ’s really a sad state of affairs when the seriously ill can be hounded like this without any affordable legal recourse .
The law is for the rich , so they say .
The good news according to a local report , Pittsburgh Attorney James Brink has offered to represent the Sauros for free and will ask a judge to reopen the case .
Stephen Colbert appeared on Good Morning America this morning to talk A Colbert Christmas : The Greatest Gift of All and to offer a first look at his Christmas special .
Diane Sawyer played clips of the special , including one clip with Jon Stewart singing , and surprisingly Stewart can actually hold a note .
The special airs this Sunday November 23 on Comedy Central and the DVD goes on sale November 25 .

From the NY Post :
9 -YEAR-OLD REVEALS DATING SECRETS
He ’s only 9 , but this pint - sized pickup artist already knows plenty about pleasing the ladies .
So much , in fact , that Alec Greven ’s dating primer , “ How to Talk to Girls ” – which began as a handwritten , $ 3 pamphlet sold at his school book fair – hit the shelves nationwide last week .
The fourth - grader from Castle Rock , Colo. , advises Lothario wannabes to stop showing off , go easy on the compliments to avoid looking desperate – and be wary of “ pretty girls . ”
“ It is easy to spot pretty girls because they have big earrings , fancy dresses and all the jewelry , ” he writes in Chapter Three .
“ Pretty girls are like cars that need a lot of oil . ”
He advises , “ The best choice for most boys is a regular girl .
Remember , some pretty girls are coldhearted when it comes to boys .
Do n’t let them get to you . ”
Over a few Shirley Temples yesterday at Langan ’s on West 47 Street , Alec said that he culled his wisdom by peeking at his peers at play .
“ I saw a lot of boys that had trouble talking to girls , ” Alec said .
As for his how - to , he concedes , “ I never expected people to buy it like a regular book in a bookstore . ”
But with classic plain - spoken advice – like “ comb your hair and do n’t wear sweats ” – it ’s no surprise his 46 - page book was a hit with boys and girls of all ages .
He believes the best way to approach a girl is to keep it to a simple “ hi . ”
“ If I say hi and you say hi back , we ’re probably off to a good start , ” he said .
As for his own love life , he said he is not dating anyone at the moment .
“ I ’m a little too young , ” he confessed .
In his book , published by HarperCollins , he suggests holding off on falling in love until at least middle school .
Dating – which he defines as going out to dinner without your parents – is for “ kind of old ” people , who are 15 or 16 .
Officials at the Soaring Hawk Elementary School said he wrote the book – which was the runaway bestseller at its book fair – for kids , but believe anyone can find inspiration in it .
Alec ’s mother , Erin Greven , credits her son ’s beyond - his - years insight to his avid reading .
“ He reads nonstop .
At dinner , I say , ‘ Put your book down , ’ ” she said .
Alec – who just finished a children ’s book on the Watergate scandal – said he wants to be a full - time writer when he grows up , with a weekend job in archaeology or paleontology .

CARLOS XUMA COMMENTS :
I say good for him …
This kid might be my competition someday .
It gives me great hope that some guys are learning the right information early on .
I am just happy that – even though the article is written in a cutesie sort of condescending tone – people seem to understand that it is something of a problem for young guys .
My only concern is that his contribution will be laughed at as just silly adolescent ideas .
My favorite line :
“ Pretty girls are like cars that need a lot of oil . ”
Yes , they can be , Alec .
Yes , indeed .

Those of us who decorate yule trees must decide first : real tree or fake ?
It 's no surprise that the National Christmas Tree Association makes a strong case against artificial trees .
Typically manufactured from PVC , they 're not biodegradable nor recyclable .
They 're also a source of carcinogenic and otherwise nasty dioxins .
And the industry group claims that 85 percent of artificial Christmas trees are imported from China .
Live trees can carry their own environmental baggage ; so can favorite decorative plants like poinsettia and cyclamen .
Real trees perform valuable ecosystem services like carbon sequestration while they 're alive and return nutrients to the soil as they decay .
Christmas trees are as much of a farmed crop as soybeans ; no one is harvesting them in significant numbers from the wildlands .
It 's a bit of a stretch to claim , as the association does , that " tree farms support complex eco-systems . "
Still , Christmas tree production does n't approach the American corn complex in its potential for ecological damage .
The big variable in Christmas tree farming is pesticide use .
Precise figures on its magnitude are hard to find .
Oregon , a leading producer and the source of many trees sold in California , released its first statewide report on pesticides this year .
But since Christmas tree farming was lumped with nursery operations , it 's impossible to tell which of the reported chemicals - including the soil fumigants methyl bromide and chloropicrin and the herbicide glyphosate - were used in tree farming .
The California Department of Pesticide Regulation offers a more detailed breakdown .
In 2006 , the latest year for which data are available , the state 's Christmas tree growers reported using 23 insecticides , miticides , herbicides , fungicides and rodenticides .
Although some are relatively benign , others are capable of killing nontarget species and compromising the health of tree - farm workers .
Some examples :
The heavily used glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup , is less problematic than polyethoxylated tallowamine ( POEA ) , the surfactant that allows the solution to coat plants .
University of Pittsburgh biologist Rick Relyea reports that POEA is highly toxic to frogs ; Monsanto , Roundup 's manufacturer , disputes his findings .
Pyrethroid insecticides like bifenthrin and esfenvalerate kill aquatic invertebrates and most insects .
Carbaryl and imidacloprid poison honeybees .
Dimethoate , an organophosphate used on insects and mites , also affects birds and fish and can cause headaches , nausea and breathing difficulty in humans .
Some tree growers have adopted organic practices , even though they may not be certified by the California Certified Organic Farmers organization .
" It 's way too expensive for us to be certified , " said a representative of Skyline Tree Farm in La Honda .
But the farm manages without pesticides : " We choose to plant the tree varieties that have less susceptibility to pests than others .
For weed control , we mow .
Certain kinds of brush we 'll dig up or cut out . "
Robert Criswell , who runs Black Road Christmas Tree Farm in Los Gatos , said he uses minimal concentrations of Roundup in spot applications but avoids insecticides .
Last year , he handled an outbreak of Douglas - fir twig weevils by cutting and burning 50 truckloads of trees .
Both farms practice stump culture , asking cut - it - yourself customers to leave a ring of branches on the stump .
Criswell said new growth can be harvested in 2 1 / 2 to five years , with the cycle repeated up to six times .
For some problems , there 's no chemical fix .
Phytophtora ramorum , the fungus - like organism that causes sudden oak death , has been detected in some Christmas tree farms .
Although the disease is not fatal to conifers like Douglas - fir and grand fir , infections can mar their foliage .
There 's concern that farmed trees may be carriers ; California restricts movement of susceptible evergreens from Curry County , Ore. , the northernmost outpost of sudden oak death .
Fortunately , said Criswell , the holiday sales season is out of sync with the release of phytophtora spores in spring and early summer .
Trees aside , consider the poinsettia .
The plant is not so poisonous as it's often accused of being , although its latex sap can be a mild irritant .
But growers battle two insect pests , the greenhouse whitefly and silverleaf whitefly , that feed on the leaves and leave a sticky residue behind .
Although imidacloprid has proved effective against whiteflies , the pests can evolve resistance .
Growers respond by using it in rotation with pyrethroids and other chemicals .
Biological controls - fungi and parasitic wasps - are available , but integrated pest management has n't yet supplanted chemical pesticides in poinsettia greenhouses .
Another environmental cost to consider : transportation .
Buying holiday flowers grown in Ecuador or Colombia is about as sustainable as using Chilean - grown avocados in your Christmas salad - a net loss of resources plus local jobs .
Growing concerns over climate change and energy security have kicked research on alternative energy sources into high gear .
The list of options continues to expand , yet few papers have comprehensively reviewed them .
And fewer still have weighed the pros and cons in as much depth as a new study published earlier this month in the journal , Energy & Environmental Science .
The results are a mixed bag of logical conclusions and startling wake - up calls .
The review pits twelve combinations of electric power generation and vehicular motivation against each other .
It is a battle royal of nine electric power sources , three vehicle technologies , and two liquid fuel sources .
It rates each combination based on eleven categories .
And it was all compiled by one man , Mark Jacobson , professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University .
" I felt a need to pull together all the information we had plus that from other sources to quantify and rank ... the best and worst proposals , ” Jacobson told Ars .
The results of his mathematical ranking are both rational and unexpected .
Wind power emerged as the overall victor .
When teamed with battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , it claimed the top two spots by winning seven of the eleven categories .
Photovoltaics are an unexpected also - ran , failing to make the top five .
Politically favored ethanol stands out as the big loser of the study , falling behind " clean coal , " a technology many consider a dead end .
Ouch .
Such an undertaking suits Jacobson .
He and his research group have broad experience in the alternative energy field .
They have covered a variety of topics , from wind power to aerosol pollution to health and vehicle emissions .
A few years ago , he dipped his toe into the policy arena .
This study is his latest contribution .
" My hope is that policy makers will use this information and begin to focus on the best solutions to climate change , air pollution , and energy security , " Jacobson said .
He 's off to a good start .
Two major alternative energy plans — RePower America and the Pickens Plan — already use information from Jacobson 's compendium to bolster their proposals .
He has also presented his results to New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman , Chair of the US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , and shared early findings with the US House of Representatives Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
An alternative energy encyclopedia
Jacobson 's success with policy makers should come as no surprise .
He has created an encyclopedia of current knowledge on alternative energy sources for the 21st Century .
In addition to evaluating many proposed sources of " green " electricity and fuel , he summarizes the technologies with respect to several categories .
His ranking covers everything from water usage to terrorism to a proposed solution 's effect on wildlife .
The breadth of these categories may have precipitated some of the unanticipated results .
Jacobson emphasized two categories over the others — global warming emissions and mortality .
The latter appears to be a novel addition to the ranking system , quantifying deaths caused both by pollution and war or terrorism .
Nuclear and ethanol fared poorly in both categories .
Nuclear power , while clean at the point of generation , suffered from high emissions in this study .
Nuclear pollutes throughout its lifespan .
It starts with pollution from ore mining and continues through to plant decommissioning and waste storage .
Nuclear also dropped in the rankings — although not by much — due to the risks posed by nuclear proliferation .
Jacobson made an intriguing assessment of nuclear power ’s mortality score .
First , he envisioned a nightmarish , but not inconceivable , scenario — a “ limited nuclear exchange , ” or the detonation of 50 fifteen kiloton bombs .
He estimated the deaths directly resulting from the bombings , and then calculated the number of deaths caused by soot and pollution from the burning cities .
To arrive at the final result , he tempered this worst case scenario with a probability score , a number that attempts to gauge the likelihood of such an event .
Bad news for Eddie Ethanol
Cradle - to - grave emissions also sunk corn and cellulosic ethanol .
While ethanol 's direct tailpipe emissions are offset by subsequent crops , much of the carbon released early in the process is never recaptured , the paper said .
With the expansion of farmed fuel , lands once considered marginal would fall under the till .
The carbon stored within these targeted ecosystems is enormous , and its release would be extremely difficult to offset .
And while ethanol attempts to address carbon emissions , it does nothing to reduce other gases responsible for climate change and respiratory diseases .
The pace of climate change may be unpredictable , but experts agree that significant warming will occur by the end of the century .
Many scientists are urging quick action , so any delays in addressing the problem will further compound the issue .
Wind , for example , is a proven and commercially available technology .
It would be responsible for zero emissions due to delays in bringing the technology to production capacity .
" Clean coal , " on the other hand , is anything but proven , and so it drops in rank .
As is common in reviews , Jacobson relies on findings from previous studies .
Some may consider this a deal breaker , but the paper is remarkably straightforward .
All numbers , assumptions , and formulae that form the ranking ’s backbone are listed in a detailed appendix ( PDF ) .
With the economy currently in shambles and gas prices well below $ 2 a gallon , alternative energy sources may be the last thing people want to think about .
But now may be the best time to act .
The US labor market shed another 58,000 jobs last week alone , so plenty of workers await employment .
And installing the capacity to power all road - going vehicles with electricity would be surprisingly easy .
By comparison , the United States put 300,000 planes into the air during World War II .
For that same effort , Jacobson says we could install between 73,000 and 144,000 five megawatt wind turbines .
Doing so would prevent 15,000 pollution - related deaths a year and trim U.S. carbon emissions by nearly a third .
This alone would not suffice to curtail US contributions to global warming , but it would be a start .

By now you 've probably heard the news about Mars : methane gas is being generated on the Red Planet , and the amount varies with season and location .
There are really only two ways to make methane that we know of : geologically ( volcanoes , chemical changes under the surface , and so on ) and biologically ( little critters basically farting belching ) .
Mars is an interesting place , and anytime we find something new and interesting about it , it 's not surprising to see the media covering it .
It 's also not surprising to see the scientists involved excited about it .
But when that news deals with biology , well , things tend to get a little out of control .
Or , as in this case , a lot out of control .
First , what do we know ?
1 ) A few years back ( in 2004 specifically ) , methane was detected on Mars .
However , those observations were not sensitive enough to do much more than measure the amount ( 10 parts per billion in the atmosphere , more or less ) .
2 ) New maps made of the Martian methane found it changes from place to place , and time to time .
Methane is not stable in Mars ' atmosphere : it goes away rapidly .
So there must be a source of it that is making methane now , actively .
3 ) The easiest way to get methane is from volcanoes , but they spew out other gases , and these were not detected .
4 ) Another , related way is for chemical processes under the surface to create methane .
However , we do n't understand what is happening chemically on Mars terribly well , or beneath the surface .
5 ) Methane is a natural byproduct of life on Earth .
Maybe that 's happening on Mars as well .
That 's it .
That 's what we know .
It might be geological , it might be chemical , it might be biological .
We do n't know which .
That did n't stop some of the media from totally exaggerating the article to the point of irresponsible journalism .
Take the UK newspaper The Sun .
The headline they ran ?
" Nasa reveals life on Mars " .
Incredible .
The lead line was " ALIEN bugs are responsible for strong plumes of methane gas detected on Mars , it was claimed tonight . "
That 's simply wrong .
Completely and utterly !
All the scientists said they did n't know for sure .
Some implied microbes were a good candidate , but none came out and said " It was alien bugs . "
Sure ,
The Sun is a rag , best used to line bird cages ( even the online version , if you can scrape enough electrons together ) , but it 's widely read .
And lest you think it was just them , then check out The Mirror , with its headline " Mars : Nasa experts to confirm there is life on Mars " , or The Money Times , which had " Methane plumes indicate ‘ life on Mars’ " .
Lots of blogs ran with this idea , too .
To be fair , NASA is not blameless in this .
Their press release for this was titled " DISCOVERY OF METHANE REVEALS MARS IS NOT A DEAD PLANET " .
Now , they are playing with the word " dead " , since you can interpret that to be about geological activity , as opposed to biological .
But still , that 's fanning the flames they must have known would erupt .
I would 've hoped they had learned their lesson from the last time they pulled a PR stunt like this .
OK , so NASA goaded tabloid media into false headlines , and some ran with it ( when they did n't need provocation ) .
What 's the real deal ?
I 'll be frank : we do n't know .
Methane is a very simple molecule ( CH 4 , just four hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbon atom ) , and is pretty easy to produce in a number of ways .
As noted above , volcanoes are probably ruled out due to the lack of any detection of other gases they usually produce .
Chemistry ?
Maybe .
Mars is different than Earth .
The laws of chemistry are the same there as here , but the chemistry going on is different .
The air is thin , and mostly CO 2 .
We know the surface chemistry of the planet is pretty different than here ; the water that once flowed on its surface was probably acidic and very salty , and when it dried up left weird things like jarosite .
Not only that , there appears to be perchlorate in the soil found by Phoenix , and that tends to dissolve terrestrial life .
However , it 's possible that CO 2 could combine with water under the surface ( if there 's a heat source like magma ) to make methane .
And what of biology ?
It can't be ruled out , but it can not be ruled in either .
The amount of methane detected was pretty substantial , implying a large amount of biological activity , but there has been no evidence of any life on Mars at all up to now .
It 's all circumstantial : ice under the surface was found by Phoenix , but near the north pole .
Water used to be abundant , but no conclusive proof of extant liquid water on the surface has been found ... not even temporarily ( like recent flooding events ) .
All the evidence for liquid water ( like gullies in craters ) could be from other sources , like clathrates .
The bottom line here is that if we want to figure out what 's causing this gassy Martian eructation , we need better instrumentation at the site .
I hope that NASA will equip their next landers with something that can taste the air and perhaps nail down the source of the methane .
Finally , a thought : where you get your news is just as if not more important than what that news is .
When it comes to science , there are very few newspapers you can trust .
When it comes to astronomy and space news , your best bet is to go to the people who know what they 're talking about , and go to multiple sources to cross - check them .
And who would that be ?
Who got this methane story right ?
Universe Today , unsurprisingly , nailed it with " Large Quantities of Methane Being Replenished on Mars " .
Also unsurprisingly , Emily at The Planetary Society blog has an excellent article as well .
My fellow Hive Overmind blogger Carl Zimmer live blogged the press conference and produced an excellent report .
Other bloggers noticed the media nonsense too , including my friends and colleagues Dave Mosher and Carolyn Collins Petersen .
I suppose that after all this , there 's one thing we know for absolute sure : methane , both chemically and journalistically , is a volatile substance .
The real source of the Martian methane .

The Dutch ‘ pedal much harder when the wind is against them ’ and are well - primed to cope with the economic downturn , prime minister wrote in an essay in Saturday ’s Financieele Dagblad .
‘ That is part of our character .
It is to do with our history and our seaward location , ’ the prime minister wrote .
Unions and employers have shown that they can work together and lessons have been learned from earlier crises , he said .
And while 2009 may be a ‘ bad year ’ , the Netherlands is doing alright compared to the US and other European countries , he said .
Consumers not worried
A survey by Booz & Company , also in the FD , shows that most of the Dutch think the economy will begin to recover in six months time .
Some 75 % expect the value of their homes to fall and 77 % think their investments and savings will be worth less .
But a large majority expect their own income to either stay the same or go up .
And 67 % do not think they will have to cut back on spending .
But a survey by brand advisors Highvalue shows that trust in the banks has gone down over the past month .
Rabobank is far and away the most trusted bank , followed by Postbank .
Bottom of the list is Fortis .
Are you worried by the crisis ?

You'd think that buying things online eliminates the human element of shopping in a retail store .
And you 'd almost be right .
Nolan heard about one of his company 's " problem customers " from a friend of his in the customer service department .
This customer was satisfied exactly as often as he was not right – never .
If there was a coupon code for $ 5 off five items , he'd be calling to ask why it did n't work for one item .
If they caved and gave him the discount , it 'd only result in more calls demanding more and more discounts .
If his order arrived on the last day of the estimated shipping date , he'd bitch and moan until the shipping cost was refunded .
There was n't much Nolan could do about their problem customer , but he did discover that one of his predecessors had added an undocumented feature , presumably in response to him :

So if you kept trying to apply a coupon code with an invalid item quantity , you 'd get an error message .
Keep trying , and you get called a dumb ninny .
Keep going still , and the web site throws up its hands in desperation .
Sam Mendes ’ adaptation of Richard Yate ’s 1961 novel Revolutionary Road is “ the best American film of 2008 , ” said Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle .
Starring the perfectly cast Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet ( watch the trailer here , via YouTube ) , the movie successfully “ captures the timeless torment of the unhappy marriage ” and the “ farewell to dreams . ”
DiCaprio and Winslet deliver great performances in Revolutionary Road , said Michael Phillips in the Chicago Tribune , and the movie ’s “ rewards are many . ”
But “ however sterling the craftsmanship , the film adaptation inflates the meaning and buffs the atmospheric surfaces of Yates ' story , rather than digging into its guts . ”
That ’s an understatement , said Sean Burns in the Philadelphia Weekly .
“ Mendes has absolutely nothing new to say ” about suburban malaise .
Not only is his new film “ phenomenally dull , ” Winslet and DiCaprio “ just stand around shouting the subtext at one another . ”
Perhaps this movie works best as “ a sick joke , aimed at couples who went to see Titanic on a first date and now find themselves married and as miserable ” as Revolutionary Road ’s lead pair .
Make room for a few more folks at the Inauguration .
Barack Obama has invited Captain Chesley B. “ Sully ” Sullenberger , the hero pilot who landed the US Airways Airbus in the Hudson River last week .
All 155 passengers and crew were safe .
Mr. Obama has also invited all five members of the crew of Flight 1549 , which had taken off from LaGuardia and moments later made a controlled landing in the Hudson , to join the inaugural ceremonies .
As an added treat , the soon - to - be president has sent the pilot and crew an even more exclusive invitation — to come on board Air Force
One whenever they have the chance .
Mr. Sullenberger , who has been helping with the federal investigation into the air disaster and has yet to make any public statements , has not seen his wife and daughters since he averted a possible disaster .
His family is on their way to Washington from their home in Danville , Calif .
It is not clear yet where the pilot and crew will be seated at the Inaugural ceremonies , but they are expected to have prominent seats and good views of the swearing - in .
DistroWatch Weekly - end of an era
I published the very first issue of DistroWatch Weekly ( DWW ) on 9 June 2003 .
The introductory instalment was followed a week later with a somewhat " beefier " one , covering JAMD Linux , a distribution that was gathering some momentum in those days .
Like many other one - man projects throughout the history of Linux distro development , JAMD disappeared a few months later without a word of explanation or any sort of apology .
But these were the kinds of topics that DWW was hoping to bring to the attention of the readers : presenting a new , interesting distribution , giving space to distro developers to explain their work , evaluating the growing number of products vying for our attention , and providing opinions on the current issues .
In other words , it meant to serve as a discussion forum on an otherwise facts - only news and reference portal .
For over 5 ½ years I 've never involuntarily missed a single issue - until last week , that is .
That was when I found myself confined to bed , for a second weekend in a row , with some nasty infection that made it impossible for me to even look at a computer screen , let alone write articles that tens of thousands of visitors would want to read .
As a result , I decided to cancel last week 's issue and get myself plenty of rest instead .
In the days that followed , I also decided to resign from the position of the editor of DistroWatch Weekly .
Yes , you 've read it correctly - I will no longer write DistroWatch Weekly .
The reason is quite simple : writing a publication that is read by such a large number of people is a stressful affair .
One needs to select an interesting topic , then present it in an authoritative , yet non-confrontational manner - a task that often requires a lot of balancing .
Then there is the news section , which is usually just a round - up of events of the past week , but it needs to be compiled and proof - read , and this too takes time and effort .
And then there is the deadline factor - as we start approaching Monday around 9 o'clock GMT , I watch with amazement how all of a sudden the site 's traffic goes through the roof .
It is as if all the visitors were screaming - hey , where is my DWW ?
All this , week after week after week ...
And yet , I think that DWW should continue .
Without it , DistroWatch is just another soulless database , not unlike Freshmeat - useful for sure , but hardly an exciting place to visit .
Besides , would n't you miss all those good , spicy forum fights we 've had the pleasure and misfortune to witness over the years ?
So here it comes - the official position vacant notice .
DistroWatch is looking for a new editor of DistroWatch Weekly .
A successful applicant would be someone with knowledge of ( and enthusiasm for ) Linux , BSD , OpenSolaris and open source software in general , with good writing skills .
The duties will be simple - to compile and publish a new issue of DistroWatch Weekly every Monday , complete with a lead story , a news summary , and all the regular columns .
For this work I am prepared to offer US $ 150 per issue ( I hope to bring this up to US $ 200 per issue once the current economic slump is over and online advertising picks up again , but it looks like it may still take a while ) .
Interested applicants should email their applications with links to their articles , blogs , etc. ( if available ) to distro at distrowatch dot com .
Finally , I wish to express my gratitude to everybody who has contributed to the success of DistroWatch Weekly over the years .
I do n't intend to disappear from public life completely , but for the foreseeable future I 'd like to go through my long and growing to - do list to improve the site and to implement some of the often - requested features .
Of course , you can still count on me bringing you the latest release news and to keep all distribution pages up - to - date .
With luck , we could have a new DistroWatch Weekly , written by a new editor , next Monday , but a lot depends on how fast we can find the right person (s ) for the job .
In the meantime , have a nice week and thank you all for your continued support !

Longtime
Ars readers know that I ’ve had my own problems in the " Constitution - free zone " that exists in US airports , but an aggressive new ACLU campaign highlights a fact of which I was previously unaware : the Constitution - free zone that exists a US borders and airports actually extends 100 air miles inland and encompasses two - thirds of the country ’s population .
The US Border Patrol can set up checkpoints anywhere in this region and question citizens .
The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution contains a border - related exception to unreasonable search and seizure laws , permitting searches at border checkpoints that would n’t be permitted elsewhere .
But federal statute 8 CFR 287.1 ( a ) ( 1 - 3 ) defines the border zone for enforcement purposes as encompassing an area within 100 miles of the actual border , with the possibility of extending it further under certain circumstances .
This means that the US Border Patrol could conceivably set up random checkpoints asking travelers for a passport in places like Columbus , Ohio ; Houston ; or anywhere in the state of Florida .
And , in fact , it appears that it has been doing exactly this .

Mountaintop mining exposes coal deposits by blasting rocks from the surface .

UK an ' unequal place to grow up '
A report says investment in education has failed to boost social mobility
The UK remains an unequal place to grow up , with success in life largely determined by parents ' backgrounds and earnings , a report says .
The Social Mobility Commission , set up by the Liberal Democrats , is urging the government to offer interest - free loans to struggling poorer families .
Schools in deprived areas should also receive more money , it adds .
The government , due to publish a report on social mobility on Tuesday , said it was committed to equal opportunities .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has asked former health secretary Alan Milburn to chair a group looking into the issue .
' Outrage '
The Social Mobility Commission 's report contains 27 main recommendations to end what is referred to as " a society of persistent inequality " .
Most concern a targeting of resources to deprived households and schools with the highest proportions of poorer pupils .
The report also suggests child tax credits should be available only to low - income families and that they should also have access to affordable credit such as interest - free loans .
We 've raised the glass ceiling , but we have n't broken through it
Alan Milburn
Former health secretary Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said : " This expert analysis shatters the idea that Britain in 2009 is a free and fair society .
" It is an outrage and a tragedy that two children born at the same time in the same hospital should have wildly different life chances based simply on the income of their parents . "
Martin Narey , chief executive of children 's charity Barnardo's , who chaired the commission , told the BBC that much more needed to be done .
He said education had " not become the great leveller that many people believed it would be " and investment had " disproportionately benefited the middle classes " .
" There 's been a much greater expansion in university education for children from comfortable backgrounds than from the most deprived backgrounds , " he said .
" We need to make sure that the most disadvantaged children get to the best schools and we need to look at over - riding local authority admission policies and school admission policies .
" If we did that more widely , we would fundamentally alter equality of opportunity for the disadvantaged . "
' Bottomed out '
Mr Narey said the issue of child poverty also had to be addressed .
" A basic and reasonable income is an absolute prerequisite for social mobility , " he added .
The government said it remained committed to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor .
Mr Milburn 's panel of industry leaders will look at helping people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get on in key professions .
He told the BBC it was vital to encourage children from all classes to develop careers in law , medicine , the senior civil service , media and finance .
" This is about identifying the obstacles that stand in their way and removing them , " he said .
" We 've raised the glass ceiling , but we have n't broken through it . "
Mr Milburn admitted that social mobility had been declining in Britain for several decades , but said it had recently " bottomed out " and " the opportunity now is to get it going again " .
The Social Mobility Commission - which is comprised of charity leaders , academics and economists - was set up last year at the instigation of Mr Clegg .

Hugh Jackman used to go to gay clubs - to hit on drunk women .
The ' X - Men ' actor says he and his best friend used to frequent the nightspots as teenagers so they could prey on unsuspecting girls .
He said : " I probably should n't be saying this , but I remember when I was about 19 , me and my friend used to go to these dance parties which were 80 per cent gay guys , 18 per cent girls who were sick of heterosexual guys hitting on them , and then vultures like me and my mate .
" We would go there until two in the morning , when the girls were really drunk and wishing they were n't with 80 percent gay guys .
" I 'm the worst kind of straight guy .
The leech !
The vulture ! "
The actor was recently crowned People magazine 's Sexiest Man Alive and already has his eye on next year 's crown .
He added to MTV : " I 'm not resting , mate .
I 'm not a one - term winner here .
I want two terms , three , four , something like that .
Brad Pitt 's had two but never back - to - back .
That 's my goal . "
Hey all , it ’s Little D !
I ’m finally getting my patch !
I ’ve been a prospect for about a year now , but before that , I was just a hang - around .
I ’ve been asked to write some tips on being a prospect .
It ’s not easy .
Before I became a prospect , I was just a hang - around .
I had to jump into situations and volunteered for rides , and even though I was down for the cause , that did n’t mean the club had to be down for me .
Over time they saw that I was serious , and Sunny D let me become a prospect .
If you thought it was hard being a hang - around with no benefits , trust me , it ’s even harder when you become a prospect .
That ’s because all eyes are on you now .
Meaning everything the club needs you have to deliver , and you better do it right .
There were times when I just wanted to give up , but I stuck it out because I realized that because I was now a little brother in the family , they stuck their neck out for me even harder .
No matter how much of a hard time they gave me , the club always gave a harder time to anyone who bothered me .
One of the best things about joining the Patch - Tag is that I learned a lot about myself and I ’m proud of the man I ’ve become .
I feel a certain level of responsibility , and I ’m proud that my brothers trust me .
I feel like I ’ve become a better man because of the level of respect I have to carry myself when I ’m wearing the patch .
What is required to become a patch holder ?
As a prospect all you have to do is keep your mouth shut and never talk to any outsider about club business .
Show up to church on time , typically earlier to help set up , and just remember to keep your ego at the door .
If you ca n’t respect older members , or if you ca n’t understand that you ’re at the bottom of the chain , you ’ll be smoked out immediately .
Make yourself available for all events , and do what your told .
It seems so simple , but I ca n’t tell you how many prospects I ’ve seen drop off because they could n’t show respect , show up on time , or drop their egos at the door .
Most importantly , do NOT embarrassed the club .
The Patch - Tag is huge on carrying yourself with respect , if you ’re out in public and wearing club colors , you better not cause any trouble that could bring a spotlight on us .
It was n’t easy , and it was n’t always fun , but I ’m proud to say I ’ve become a better man with the Patch - Tag of South Florida .
I love that my brothers keep me out of trouble and my girls love the way I carry myself now .
I ’ve seriously grow 10 years older within the club .

By record bosses ...
Sales of Guns N' Roses ' ' Chinese Democracy ' have failed to meet expectations because the record has been poorly promoted , reports claim .
Label bosses at Geffen Records are understood to have shouldered much of the blame on frontman Axl Rose , who has been out of contact for two months .
CLICK HERE to read Gigwise 's review of ' Chinese Democracy ' .
Guns N' Roses - Through the Years
The album , which was released last week after a fourteen year wait , failed to top the charts in the UK , falling 80,000 copies behind The Killers ' ' Day And Age ' .
“ Everyone knows
Axl is a bit of a maverick genius and wo n’t do anything he does n’t want to do , ” a source told the Sun newspaper .
“ The label is really glad to have him back .
But it is frustrating because the album would have had a much better chance of going to No1 if he had only been prepared to show his face .
“ People have been trying to contact him for two months and he ’s been completely AWOL .
“ You would have thought after spending 15 years on an album you might do a few weeks promotion . ” First week sales of ' Chinese Democracy ' in the US , where the album was available exclusively in Best Buy stores , are understood to be approaching 500,000 .
But the record is facing a battle against Kanye West and The Killers to claim the number one position on the US Billboard chart .

Security in Baghdad and across Iraq has improved enormously in the nearly two years since Mr. Crocker was confirmed as ambassador , but many Iraqis , including Iraqi political leaders , worry that the current situation is merely a lull given the still - fractious political system .
Image After months of delays and other problems , the enormous new United States Embassy compound in Baghdad was dedicated on Monday by Iraqi and American officials , who declared the start of a new era for relations .
The embassy is Americas largest in the world , and the final cost was said to be $ 736 million .

Mr. Crocker acknowledged the troubles since the invasion but said the implementation of the security agreement between Iraq and the United States , which went into effect on Jan. 1 , was a sign of Iraq ’s progress toward being a stable , sovereign state .
Of the 120 years since the United States first established a presence in Baghdad , Mr. Crocker said , “ no period has been more intense , more challenging or more promising than that since April 2003 .
And of that period , perhaps no single week has been more important than this past one . ”
On Dec. 31 , the embassy officially moved out of the Republican Palace , the jewel of Baghdad ’s government buildings and the headquarters of the American presence in Iraq since shortly after the invasion .
For months , officials and members of the support staff , adding up to 1,200 people in all , have been gradually moving into the new embassy , America ’s largest in the world .
The Congressional Research Service said the final cost was $ 736 million ; the original estimate was $ 592 million .
Though its construction also was troubled by long delays , structural problems and allegations of abusive labor practices , the embassy , a campus of adobe - colored buildings on 104 acres , has a far more functional appearance than the lavish palace .
Surrounded by concrete walls topped with razor wires , the compound is less than a mile from the Republican Palace in the Green Zone , which was handed over to Iraqi control on Jan. 1 as part of the security agreement .
Tiny fragments of genetic material can play a role in heart disease Scientists have halted the advance of heart disease in mice - and even reversed some of its effects .
The study provides hard evidence that tiny pieces of genetic material called microRNA can play a key role in the development of heart disease .
The therapy , featured in the journal Nature , targets and blocks microRNA in heart cells .
A US specialist said that , with trials under way in other animals , human tests may be only a few years away .
This is one of the hottest topics in biology at the moment
Professor Eric Olson
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
The importance of microRNAs to heart disease - and a host of other diseases - has already been suggested by other scientists .
Their job is to regulate the activity of our genes , but with many different types present in the cell , scientists are trying to establish which plays the biggest role .
The US and German scientists are focusing on one type labelled microRNA - 21 , and their role in a type of heart cell called the cardiac fibroblast , which helps provide the structure of the organ , and plays a critical role in the progressive scarring which stops it working properly in heart disease .
Until recently , that process was thought to be an irreversible one .
The researchers found that cells in a failing heart had higher levels of this microRNA , and linked it to a chemical signalling pathway which leads to the tissue damage found in the condition .
Animal studies
In mice , they used a chemical which blocked microRNA - 21 , and found that not only that this pathway was interrupted , but that cardiac function in the animals improved .
This , they wrote , proved its potential as a new target for drugs in heart diseased humans .
Professor Eric Olson , from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , whose own research focuses on microRNAs and heart disease , said that the results were " exciting " .
" This is one of the hottest topics in biology at the moment , " he said .
" Micro - RNAs are being very seriously considered as a therapeutic target - there is a lot of promise and potential in this area .
" This research suggests you can reverse or prevent aspects of heart disease . "
He said : " There are already studies in large animals using micro-RNA inhibitors in heart disease - I can envisage that in a few years we will see this in human trials . "

Updated Following its failure to foster a voluntary solution between ISPs and rights holders , the government will create a new agency and regulations to clamp down on copyright infringement via peer - to - peer networks , it 's reported today .
A proposal for a body called the Rights Agency will be at the centre of anti-internet piracy measures , according to the Financial Times , which cited sources who had read a draft of Lord Carter 's report on Digital Britain .
The Rights Agency will be introduced alongside a new code of practice for ISPs and rights holders , to be overseen by Ofcom , according to the leaked draft .
The final report is due out by the end of this month .
ISPs will be required to tell customers when they are suspected of illegally sharing music and films , it 's reported .
So far some major ISPs have trialled sending their customers ' copyright infringement notices in partnership with the record industry on a voluntary basis .
The new regulations will also reportedly force ISPs to collect data on " serious and repeated infringers " that they would have to make available to rights holders in possession of a court order .
It 's unclear whether that means providers would be made to keep records of the content shared by committed filesharers .
There would be nothing new in requiring ISPs to keep logs of which customers are assigned which IP addresses when .
That kind of data is already obtainable by court order , and has been used by rights holders to pursue alleged illegal filsharers .
The vague reference to data collection is therefore likely to prompt concern from consumer advocates over potential monitoring of actual internet traffic .
The Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) said yesterday that its consultation on peer - to - peer copyright infringement had attracted polarized responses .
The government has long been committed to a rearguard action against illegal filesharing , but has been trying to encourage ISPs and rights holders to agree a voluntary solution .
A BERR spokeswoman refused to comment on today 's report .
The creation of the Rights Agency will represent tacit admission of a failure of self - regulation .
Figures from both the internet industry and rights holder organisations contacted by The Register today interpreted the leak as indicating the UK government intends to imitate the French 's new Hadopi copyright enforcement body .
It remains very unlikely that sanctions against consumers accused of illegal filesharing will go as far as the full internet cut - off mandated by Hadopi's " three strikes " process , however .
The BPI , which represents record labels , said it had been working with ISPs to agree enforcement sanctions since the six largest providers signed a memorandum of understanding on illegal filesharing last summer .
" We envisage that this work will result in voluntary deals , enshrined in a set of codes of practice underpinned by regulation , " it said .
The Internet Service Providers ' Association ( ISPA ) said it was not aware of plans for the Rights Agency and could not immediately comment .
Separately today the IFPI , an international coalition of record industry bodies , said 95 per cent of music downloads are unlicensed . ®
Update
ISPA sent this statement :
ISPA is aware of rumours in the media today about Government plans for the creation of a new agency responsible for reducing illegal online file - sharing .
ISPA understands that the Government is considering its options after it became clear that its preferred option as outlined in the recent consultation document was not supported by stakeholders .
ISPA would expect a full consultation on any proposal for legislation from Government in this area and will comment when more details become available .
ISPA maintains that Government imposed regulation is unlikely to provide a satisfactory solution to this issue and believes that the emphasis should continue to be on educating the public about copyright and on developing alternative lawful distribution channels .
Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer has mocked Google 's entry to the mobile phone software market , questioning its strategy of giving away its software .
The first Google smartphone , the G1 , was recently launched by German telco T - Mobile .
Most smartphones and personal digital assistants use commercial operating systems such as Symbian or Microsoft 's Windows Mobile , but the G1 uses Google 's open - source Android .
Mr Ballmer , in Sydney for Telstra 's annual investor briefing , said Google would not have an " easy " time convincing phone makers to switch to Android .
I wrote this blog entry a few weeks ago before my recent job change .
It ’s a look at the cost of high - scale storage and how it has fallen over the last two years based upon the annual fully burdened cost of power in a data center and industry disk costs trends .
The observations made in this post are based upon understanding these driving costs and should model any efficient , high - scale bulk storage farm .
But , and I need to be clear on this , it was written prior to my joining AWS and there is no information below relating to any discussions I ’ve had with AWS or how the AWS team specifically designs , deploys , or manages their storage farm .
When Amazon released Amazon S3 , I argued that it was priced below cost at $ 1.80 / GB / year .
At that time , my estimate of their cost was $ 2.50 / GB / year .
The Amazon charge of $ 1.80 / GB / year for data to be stored twice in each of two data centers is impressive .
It was amazing when it was released and it remains an impressive value today .
Even though the storage price was originally below cost by my measure , Amazon could still make money if they were running a super - efficient operation ( likely the case ) .
How could they make money charging less than cost for storage ?
Customers are charged for ingress / egress on all data entering or leaving the AWS cloud .
The network ingress / egress charged by AWS are reasonable , but telecom pricing strongly rewards volume purchases , so what Amazon pays is likely much less than the AWS ingress / egress charges .
This potentially allows the storage business to be profitable even when operating at a storage cost loss .
One concern I ’ve often heard is the need to model the networking costs between the data centers since there are actually two redundant copies stored in two independent data centers .
Networking , like power , is usually billed at the 95 percentile over a given period .
The period is usually a month but more complex billing systems exist .
The constant across most of these high - scale billing systems is that the charge is based upon peaks .
What that means is adding ingress or egress at an off peak time is essentially free .
Assuming peaks are short - lived , the sync to the other data center can be delayed until the peak has passed .
If the SLA does n’t have a hard deadline on when the sync will complete ( it does n’t ) , then the inter - DC bandwidth is effectively without cost .
I call this technique Resource Consumption Shaping and it ’s one of my favorite high - scale service cost savers .
What is the cost of storage today in an efficient , commodity bulk - storage service ?
Building upon the models in the cost of power in large - scale data centers and the annual fully burdened cost of power , here ’s the model I use for cold storage with current data points :
Note that this is for cold storage and I ignore the cost of getting the data to or from the storage farm .
You need to pay for the networking you use .
Again , since it ’s cold storage the model assume you can use 80 % of the disk which would n’t be possible for data with high I/O rates per GB .
And we ’re using commodity SATA disks at 1TB that only consume 10 W of power .
This is a cold storage model .
If you are running higher I / O rates , figure out what percentage of the disk you can successfully use and update the model in the spreadsheet ( ColdStorageCost.xlsx ( 13.86 KB ) ) .
If you are using higher - power , enterprise disk , you can update the model to use roughly 15W for each .
Update : Bryan Apple found two problems with the spreadsheet that have been updated in the linked spreadsheet above .
Ironically the resulting fully brudened cost / GB / year is the unchanged .
Thanks Bryan .
For administration costs , I ’ve used a fixed , fairly conservative factor of a 10 % uplift on all other operations and administration costs .
Most large - scale services are better than this and some are more than twice as good but I included the conservative 10 % number
Cold storage with 4 x copies at high - scale can now be delivered at : 0.80 / GB / year .
It ’s amazing what falling server prices and rapidly increasing disks sizes have done .
But , it ’s actually pretty hard to do and I ’ve led storage related services that did n’t get close to this efficient — I still think that Amazon S3 is a bargain .
Looking at the same model but plugging in numbers from about two years ago shows how fast we ’re seeing storage costs plunge .
Using $ 2,000 servers rather than $ 1,200 , server power consumption at 250W rather than 160W , disk size at ½ TB and disk cost at $ 250 rather than 160 , yield an amazingly different $ 2.40 / GB / year .
Cold storage with redundancy at : $ 0.80 GB / year and still falling .
Amazing .

Yesterday , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department unveiled a new plan to “ help ” the economy .
Not only is the government going to take on more mortgage debt obligations from Fannie , Freddie and Ginnie , but there is a plan to encourage more consumer debt .
The idea is to , through TARP , encourage investors to buy consumer debt backed securities .
These are securities that package things like credit card debt , auto loans and student loans into tradeable securities .
Investors earn money as consumers pay back their debt .
With credit tightening , there are fewer people getting approved for credit lines .
Indeed , some people are even seeing their credit card limits reduced — along with freezes to their HELOCs .
This means that spending power is being reduced for consumers .
On top of that , some consumers are finally waking up and realizing that things are Not Good .
All sorts of renewed vows to cut up the credit cards are being spoken , and many are rethinking their spending habits .
All of this has the government worried .
Our economy has shifted to one that is debt - based .
It all runs on consumers spending money they do n’t really have on things they do n’t actually need .
Part of the economic downturn is due to limited spending power because of restricted credit .
The latest incarnation of TARP is designed to encourage lenders to start extending credit again so that consumers can continue on their debt - fueled spending sprees .
Do n’t fall for it .
Right now , our economy is set up so that what is good for the economy is bad for individual finances .
This is a wake - up call .
Practice sound personal finance habits :
Save , get out of debt , earn more than you spend .
Even if credit becomes easier to get again in the coming weeks and months , do n’t take the bait .
After all , easy credit is what got us in this mess to begin with .
President - Elect Obama has unfortunately chosen Pastor Rick Warren of the Saddleback Church to give the invocation at the inauguration in January .
Pastor Warren is a rare gem of a human being / Christian .
He has compared abortion to the Jewish Holocaust , equated gay marriage to incest and pedophilia , and previously cut a video in support of Proposition 8 .
See below :
I struggle desperately not to be a one issue voter , but like so many in the LGBT community , I am deeply disappointed by this choice , and at the expense of all the positives I have witnessed in the presidential transition thus far .
In what can only be called a calculated effort to reach across the aisle and placate the religious right , Obama has succeeded only in alienating some of his most fervent supporters , who have remained steadfast despite missing the “ Hope Train ” when Proposition 8 passed last month .
Frankly , my wallet is still aching from all the contributions we made to the Obama campaign as well .
Unfortunately this is n’t the first time Obama has stepped in it .
I gave Obama the benefit of the doubt the first time around , but do n’t know if I can now .
Not since Prop 8 .
I ’m sure many will argue that Barack Obama personally does n’t support gay marriage in the first place , but nor does he think it ’s appropriate to write discrimination into law .
Constitutions enable rights , not redact them .
If it ’s any consolation , there are some on the right who are n’t too happy with Pastor Warren either .
Let them give him as much grief as we give Obama .
I ’m reminded of a line from the Song “ Down to Earth ” by Peter Gabriel as I write this .
Do you feel you were tricked , by the future you picked ?
The answer ’s not yes .
At least not yet .

Plaxico Burress , the New York Giants wide receiver responsible for catching the game - winning touchdown in this year ’s Super Bowl , accidentally shot himself in the leg with a gun he had in his pants last week in a New York City nightclub .
Since Burress ’ pistol was unregistered in New York , he has been charged with two counts of second - degree criminal possession of a weapon in what prosecutors call " a strong case . "
If he ’s convicted , Burress — who apparently has never been in any significant legal trouble before — will face a mandatory minimum of 3 years in state prison for each count , with a potential maximum of 15 years for each count .
And , while New York does n’t recognize registrations from other states anyway , Burress ’ gun was also unregistered in New Jersey , where he lives , so it ’s possible that he could face further charges there over the incident .
Burress appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday , showing no limp or other signs of the injury .
He did n’t enter a plea , was released on $ 100,000 bond , and was ordered to return to court on March 31 .
The " crime "
According to The New York Times , " Burress arrived at the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan at 1:20 a.m.
Saturday morning , with four others , including two teammates .
" The criminal complaint , released by prosecutors Monday , said that an onlooker then saw Burress near the V.I.P. area of the club holding a drink in his left hand and fidgeting his right hand in the area of the waistline of his pants .
The witness then heard a single ‘ pop ’ sound before hearing Burress say , ‘ Take me to the hospital . ’
" Burress was on the ground , with his legs shaking , when a bloody gun — a .40 - caliber Glock pistol — fell out of his pant leg and onto the floor , the onlooker said .
The bullet , which broke through the skin of Burress ’s right thigh and pierced muscle tissue , traveled through the leg before lodging itself somewhere in the club .
" Burress left the club by 1:50 a.m. , the police said , and arrived at the hospital at 2:04 a.m. , according to surveillance cameras at the hospital . "
The parasites must have smelled Burress ’ blood
Burress was driven to the hospital by teammate Antonio Pierce .
According to The San Francisco Chronicle , " The cover - up , police sources said , began almost immediately .
The .40 - caliber Glock was placed in the glove compartment of Pierce ’s Escalade and the teammates drove off , with a number of phone calls made before Burress arrived at New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center at 2:04 a.m. , the sources said .
Burress gave an alias , sources said , and the hospital did not call police , though it was required by law to do so .
" Burress left the hospital at 1 p.m. Saturday , and when police called a short time later — alerted to the shooting by a television news report — an administrator claimed confidentiality laws prohibited her from discussing patients .
" Later , a high - ranking police official called the administrator and told her she was wrong , at which point the administrator acknowledged Burress had been admitted , sources said .
" The hospital said it is cooperating with police and is doing its own investigation . "
Now , the Chronicle story reported , Pierce and some of the hospital staff who treated Burress may also face charges .
" ’We are investigating both the hospital ’s failure to report the shooting and Antonio Pierce ’s role that evening , ’ Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne , the NYPD ’s top spokesman , said after Burress surrendered and was charged with gun possession for accidentally shooting himself at Manhattan ’s Latin Quarter nightclub .
" Pierce , meanwhile , seemed confident he did nothing wrong .
‘ I do n’t see myself getting arrested , ’ he said Monday in an interview on WFAN Radio .
" Police said neither the NFL nor the Giants are fully cooperating .
" The NFL , Browne said , reneged on its promise to make Pierce available Monday and a similar promise to produce two Giants trainers went unfulfilled .
" The trainers , police sources said , might have been among those contacted by Burress and others to discuss treating him without police knowing .
" By late Monday , one member of the Giants ’ medical staff did talk to detectives , as did a players ’ union official .
" ’ You have a series of events , and there is a universe of silence after this shooting , ’ Browne said .
" Previous reports described Burress as alerting club security to his gun and accidentally firing it as he tried to hand it to a security member .
Police , however , said that was not the case . "
New York News Day reported that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg " blasted Giants receiver Plaxico Burress yesterday , calling for him to be prosecuted ‘ to the fullest extent of the law ’ for accidentally shooting himself in the right thigh with an illegal handgun — particularly because as a sports hero , he is both a public figure and a role model .
“ ‘ If we do n’t prosecute [ him ] to the fullest extent of the law , I do n’t know who on Earth we would , ’ Bloomberg said .
‘ It makes a sham , a mockery of the law .
And it ’s pretty hard to argue the guy did n’t have a gun and that it was n’t loaded .
You ’ve got bullet holes in and out to show that it was there . ’
" Burress ’ attorney , Benjamin Brafman , asked people not to prejudge the case .
" ’I think the mayor can at times influence pending legal proceedings , ’ he said .
‘ I am just asking the mayor and everyone else to take a deep breath … [ and not prejudge ] . ’
" Bloomberg has made his war on illegal guns a signature issue .
He also had harsh words for the hospital where Burress was treated , New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
He said hospital management should be charged for failing to report the incident , and that the hospital workers involved should be fired .
" ’ It is just an outrage that the hospital did n’t do what they are legally required to do , ’ he said .
‘ It ’s a lame excuse that they did n’t know — this is a world - class hospital in a city where we all know what goes on in the streets of our city , and we all should be working together to get guns off the streets . ’
The statement " we all should be working together to get guns off the streets " is shockingly immoral and fascist — and laughably impossible , even if it were a lofty goal .
The News Day story continued , " Police did n’t learn what had happened until they saw it on the television news Saturday afternoon , several hours after the shooting occurred at a Manhattan nightclub , Bloomberg and police officials said .
The mayor also blamed Giants management for failing to notify authorities .
" ’ The Giants should have picked up the phone right away , as good corporate citizens , ’ he said .
Quick , somebody add " good corporate citizens " to the list of creepy fascist terms before we forget it .
In rebuttal to Bloomberg ’s charges , News Day concluded , " Pat Hanlon , a spokesman for the Giants , disputed this .
‘ In the early hours of Saturday morning , as we started to get a sense of what we were dealing with , we did , in fact , notify NFL security , which then contacted the police , ’ Hanlon said in an e-mailed statement . "
It ’s understandable that any one person or organization does n’t want to further provoke the State .
But would n’t it be great , just once , for a large organization in a situation like this — like the NFL — rather than bowing and scraping before their masters and timidly pledging their " full cooperation " ( with the State ’s attempts to gather evidence to shake them down for money or even to lock them in cages for non-crimes ) , to tell the State — as the average 18th - or 19th - Century American likely would have — to f**k off ?
Who ’s the victim ?
To summarize , Burress is being prosecuted not for damaging another person ’s body or property , for which that person has filed a complaint , seeking restitution and / or damages ; he ’s being prosecuted for not having a permission slip from the State to carry his own property .
And the people who helped him get medical treatment are being threatened for not turning Burress in to the State for not having a permission slip and because the piece of his property , for which he did n’t have a permission slip , involved in the victimless incident happened to be a gun ; and for not cooperating with the State , once the non-crime came to its attention , in helping it gather evidence to prosecute Burress for the non-crime , and possibly to prosecute them for their involvement in the non-crime too .
The despicable treatment by the State of Burress , and the equally despicable threatening of those who went out of their way to help him with his accidental injury , is another example of the State ’s hegemonic relationship with the people it " serves , " as Butler Shaffer has quipped , " the way a cannibal ‘ serves ’ his neighbor . "
In a free society , Burress would be responsible for paying his hospital bill and for any damage to the nightclub , after which he could put the whole unpleasant accident behind him and get on with his life .
Instead , the State is going to ruin Burress ’ career and life , and cause unspeakable anguish for his loved ones , by locking him in a cage inside a socialist hellhole for a " crime " that hurt no one except for himself — and even that , just barely .
The only victim in this " crime " is Burress .
State " justice "
The State is not what keeps the amorphous , ill - defined entity it calls " society " from descending into " chaos . "
And its criminal " justice " system does not exist to make victims whole again ; rather , it ’s a giant make - work scam for parasitical " law enforcement " officials , politicians , and court employees .
As the sickening Burress case shows , much of the State ’s " law enforcement " consists of work that would n’t exist in a free society , prosecuting victimless crimes and trying to outlaw peaceful , voluntary behavior .
And much of the real crime that occurs ( like murders and robberies ) would n’t happen if the State were n’t creating black markets in commodities like narcotics ; forcibly preventing people from defending themselves and their property through things like gun control laws ; and socializing property like streets so that there ’s no owner who has to be concerned about the safety of his paying customers .
And when one of those real crimes occurs , thanks to the wonders of socialism , the victim not only has to pay with his taxes for the police force that failed to protect him or his property ( and may also fail to catch a suspect ) , but if someone is charged , the victim will suffer the further indignity of paying for the trial , and further still of paying for the perpetrator ’s incarceration if he ’s convicted .
There ’s nothing the State can do that the market can’t do better , faster , cheaper , and fairer .
If the persecution of Plaxico Burress is an example of the State ’s " justice , " how could free market courts be any worse ?

A simple trigonometric identity
A few nights ago I was writing up notes for my category theory reading group , and I wanted to include a commutative diagram on three objects .
I was using Paul Taylor 's stupendously good diagrams.sty package , which lets you put the vertices of the diagram in the cells of a LaTeX table , and then draw arrows between them .
I had drawn the following diagram :
Here I put A at ( 0,0 ) , B at ( 4,0 ) , and 1 at ( 2,2 ) .
This is clear enough , but I wished that it were more nearly equilateral .
So that night as I was waiting to fall asleep , I thought about the problem of finding lattice points that are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle .
This is a sort of two - dimensional variation on the problem of finding rational approximations to surds , which is a topic that has turned up here many times over the years .
Or rather , I wanted to find lattice points that are almost at the vertices of an equilateral triangle , because I was pretty sure that there were no equilateral lattice triangles .
But at the time I could not remember a proof .
I started doing some calculations based on the law of cosines , which was a mistake , because nobody but John Von Neumann can do calculations like that in their head as they wait to fall asleep , and I am not John Von Neumann , in case you had n't noticed .
A simple proof that there are no equilateral lattice triangles has just now occurred to me , though , and I am really pleased with it , so we are about to have a digression .
The area A of an equilateral triangle is s√3/2 , where s is the length of the side .
And s has the form √t because of the Pythagorean theorem , so A = √ ( 3t ) / 2 , where t is a sum of two squares , because the endpoints of the side are lattice points .
By Pick 's theorem , the area of any lattice triangle is a half - integer .
So 3t is a perfect square , and thus there are an odd number of threes in t's prime factorization .
But t is a sum of two squares , and by the sum of two squares theorem , its prime factorization must have an even number of threes .
We now have a contradiction , so there was no such triangle .
Was n't that excellent ?
That is just the sort of thing that I could have thought up while waiting to fall asleep , so it proves even more conclusively that starting with the law of cosines was a mistake .
Okay , end of digression .
Back to the law of cosines .
We have a triangle with sides a , b , and c , and opposite angles A , B , and C , and you no doubt recall from high school that c2 = a 2 + b2 - 2 ab cos C.
We 'll call this " law C " .
Before I fell alseep , it occurred to me that you could take the analogous law B , which is b2 = a 2 + c2 - 2 ac cos B , and substitute the right - hand side for the b2 term in law C .
Then a bunch of stuff will cancel out and you should either get something interesting or something tautological .
Von Neumann would have known right away which it was , but I needed paper .
So today I got out the paper and did the thing , and came up with the very simple relation that : c = a cos B + b cos A
Which holds in any triangle .
But somehow I had never seen this before , or , if I had , I had completely forgotten it .
The thing is so simple that I thought that it must be wrong , or I would have known it already .
But no , it checked out for the easy cases ( right triangles , equilateral triangles , trivial triangles ) and the geometric proof is easy : Just drop a perpendicular from C .
The foot of the perpendicular divides the base c into two segments , which , by the simplest possible trigonometry , have lengths a cos B and b cos A , respectively .
QED .
Perhaps that was anticlimactic .
Have I mentioned that I have a sign on the door of my office that says " Penn Institute of Lower Mathematics " ?
This is the kind of thing I 'm talking about .
I will let you all know if I come up with anything about the almost - equilateral lattice triangles .
Clearly , you can approximate the equilateral triangle as closely as you like by making the lattice coordinates sufficiently large , just as you can approximate √ 3 as closely as you like with rationals by making the numerator and denominator sufficiently large .
Proof :
Your computer draws equilateral - seeming triangles on the screen all the time .
I note also that it is important that the lattice is two - dimensional .
In three or more dimensions the triangle ( 1,0,0,0 ... ) , ( 0,1,0,0 ... ) , ( 0,0,1,0 ... ) is a perfectly equilateral lattice triangle with side √ 2 .
[ Addendum 20090130 : Vilhelm Sjöberg points out that the area of an equilateral triangle is s2√3/4 , not s√3/ 2 .
Whoops .
This spoils my lovely proof , because the theorem now follows immediately from Pick's : s2 is an integer by Pythagoras , so the area is irrational rather than a half - integer as Pick 's theorem requires . ] [ Addendum 20140403 :
As a practical matter , one can draw a good lattice approximation to an equilateral triangle by choosing a good rational approximation to !!\sqrt3 !! , say !!\ frac ab !! , and then drawing the points !!( 0,0 ) , ( b , a ) , !! and !!( 2b , 0 ) !!.
The rational approximations to !!\sqrt3 !!
quickly produce triangles that are indistinguishable from equilateral .
For example , the rational approximation !!\ frac74 !! gives the isosceles triangle with vertices !!( 0,0 ) , ( 4,7 ) , ( 8,0 ) !!
which has one side of length 8 and two sides of length !!\sqrt{65}\approx 8.06 !! , an error of less than one percent .
The next such approximation , !!\ frac {26}{15} !! , gives a triangle that is correct to about 1 part in 1800 .
( For more about rational approximations to !!\sqrt3 !! , see my article on Archimedes and the square root of 3 . ) ] [ Addendum 20181126 : Even better ways to make 60 - degree triangles on lattice points . ]

MONTREAL –
The former partner of a prominent Montreal businessman is challenging sections of the Quebec civil code that deny alimony to common - law wives who split with their spouses .
The woman , who can't be identified to protect her children , wants $ 56,000 per month in alimony in addition to a flat sum of $ 50 million .
The woman was with the businessman for nearly 10 years and had three children , all of whom get support payments .
Her lawyer argues the law does n't reflect reality .
She said it is common in Quebec for couples to remain unmarried and points out 60 per cent of children in Montreal are born out of wedlock .
The lawyer is attacking the constitutionality of the law .
Continuing with my plan outlined in Plans for Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo I fixed the Parrot Plugin of Padre and even released a pre-packaged version of Parrot and Rakudo with Strawberry Perl and Padre .

As hacking on that would need lot of XS and knowledge and deep understanding of how Parrot works I do n't think I am qualified to do that properly .

Nov. 18 , 2008 -- Smokers and former smokers who eat lots of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables may be less likely than other smokers to develop lung cancer .
Researchers at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo , N.Y. reported that news today in Washington , D.C. at an American Association of Cancer Research meeting on cancer prevention .
" The first thing to do is to quit smoking , " because that is " still the best thing to do to reduce the risk " of developing lung cancer , researcher Li Tang , PhD , tells WebMD .
Besides quitting smoking , Tang recommends smokers and former smokers eat more cruciferous vegetables , such as broccoli , cauliflower , cabbage , kale , turnip greens , mustard greens , and collard greens -- especially in their raw form .
Tang cautions that " nothing is the magic bullet " guaranteed to prevent lung cancer .
But there 's no downside to eating more vegetables .
Tang 's team asked 948 lung cancer patients and 1,743 people without lung cancer about their smoking history and consumption of fruits , cruciferous vegetables , and other vegetables .
Among smokers -- and especially among former smokers -- higher intake of cruciferous vegetables was linked to lower risk of lung cancer .
That does n't mean that those vegetables prevented lung cancer .
Tang 's study was observational ; it did n't directly test cruciferous vegetables for lung cancer prevention .
But other research has shown that compounds called isothiocyanates from cruciferous vegetables may have cancer - fighting properties , Tang notes .
The most commonly eaten cruciferous vegetables in Tang 's study were broccoli , cabbage , and cauliflower .
Eating those vegetables raw may be best , because heating damages an enzyme needed to activate isothiocyanates , Tang says .
In February , other researchers reported that isothiocyanates in broccoli sprout extract may have helped prevent bladder cancer in lab tests on rats .
And in July , another study showed that men who eat broccoli several times a week may be less likely to develop prostate cancer than men who do n't eat broccoli .

Advertisement The Macintosh - the first Apple computer to bear the name - turns 25 on 24 January .
The machine debuted in 1984 and kicked off a product line that were Apple 's flagship computers for many years .
The Macintosh helped popularise the combination of graphical interface and mouse that is ubiquitous today .
The machine was unveiled using a hugely expensive TV advert , directed by film maker Ridley Scott and shown during the US Superbowl on 22 January 1984 Desktop pioneer
The project to create the Macintosh was started by legendary computer maker Jef Raskin and the original machine had a 9in screen in an upright beige case , 128 k of RAM , internal floppy drive , and came with keyboard and single - button mouse .
Apple had previously produced computers using a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , such as the Apple Lisa .
But those machines cost far more than the original Macintosh .
Although Microsoft had launched its operating system - MS DOS - in 1981 it was not until 1985 , a year after the Macintosh made its debut , that it introduced its own GUI , Microsoft Windows .
However , this did not enjoy significant popularity until the advent of Windows 3.x in 1990 .
It 's amazing the Mac has lasted so long and had such a positive impact on the world
Macintosh designer Andy Hertzfeld
Macintosh designers look back at their creation
My memories of the Macintosh The Macintosh 's relatively low price tag of £ 1,840 ( $ 2,495 ) made it very affordable , said Mark Hattersley , editor in chief of Macworld UK .
" It was a hugely popular machine , " said Mr Hattersley .
" It took desktop computing away from IBM and back to Apple for a good number of years , " he said .
" It brought the notion of the desktop graphical interface to the mass market . "
The " Macintosh " moniker was reportedly taken from the name of Mr Raskin 's favourite Apple - the McIntosh .
However , this form of the name had to be altered to avoid legal wrangles with another company already trading under that name .
Once successors to the first Macintosh were introduced by Apple , the original machine was re-badged as the 128k version .
The initial production run of the first Macintosh have the signatures of the design team burned in to the inside of the case .
In the UK , science - fiction author author Douglas Adams was the first to buy one of the original Macintosh machines .
Second in line was Stephen Fry .
Sadly , he said , he no longer possesses the early machine .
He told the BBC : " Oh I wish I still had it .
I remember giving it away in 1986 to a primary school in a village in Norfolk . "
Apple has retained the Macintosh name for many of its products - in particular the shortened form re-emerged in 1998 with the launch of the iMac .
The Macintosh name re-appeared with the iMac in 1998 Jason Fitzpatrick , from the Centre for Computing History in Haverhill , said that it was now hard to find a working 25 - year old Macintosh .
Many , he said , have suffered what is known as " bit rot " in which the memory chips inside the machine decay , leading to a gradual loss of functionality .
Kevin Murrell , director of the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park , said it had many working Apple machines even older than the 25 - year - old Mac .
Swap shop
Even new , he said , the Macintoshes had their quirks .
The external hard drive available for later versions of the Macintosh had to be placed on the left side of the machine to avoid interference with its power supply .
The lack of hard drive meant that anyone working with the machine had save everything on a floppy disk , leading to an awful lot of disk swapping .
But despite this , he said , many people had very fond memories of the time they spent with an original Macintosh .

Nine billion gallons of corn ethanol were produced in the United States in 2008 , twice as much as in 2006 .
By the end of the year , though , dreams of a sustainable , domestically produced fuel that could help end our addiction to oil had deflated .
The puncturing reasons came from all directions .
Corn ethanol , aided by a generous subsidy from the federal government , has had the lead in alternative fuels , but recent studies reveal that it is much more costly , both economically and environmentally , than people had thought .
Sharply rising grain prices underscored ethanol ’s impact on household budgets and the global food supply .
And then oil prices tumbled , making ethanol significantly less competitive in the energy marketplace .
Transportation fuel accounts for 28 percent of the country ’s energy use .
With oil reserves headed inexorably for depletion , shortages and more wild price swings ( like last summer ’s $ 147 - a - barrel spike ) very likely loom ahead .
The vexing question — surely one of the greatest scientific and technological challenges of our time — is what will take petroleum ’s place .
There are other biofuels , but they have drawbacks too .
The first U.S. facility for converting algae into fuel is expected to open soon in Rio Hondo , Texas , but it will take decades to achieve significant production .
Cellulosic ethanol can be derived from inedible crops like switchgrass , but the technology is still largely confined to the laboratory .
And many types of biofuel require vast amounts of land , leaving less acreage available for food crops .
If biofuels are n’t the answer , what is ?
Surprisingly , the thing that replaces oil might not be a liquid fuel .
It might not , strictly speaking , be a fuel at all .
Nor is it some exotic source you have never heard of .
It is electricity .
And it is already making its way into an auto dealership near you .
Troubles With Ethanol The U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 [ pdf ] set a target to produce 9 billion gallons of biofuel in 2008 .
Forecasters predict the past year ’s American corn harvest will come in at 12 billion bushels .
Meeting the biofuel mandate required 4 billion of those bushels :
One - third of the harvest was dedicated to creating corn ethanol , which makes up just 4.5 percent of our gasoline supply .
Land - based biofuels also pose serious environmental threats .
“ The reason we think biofuels can reduce global warming is because we assume the feed crop will take carbon out of the air , ” says Tim Searchinger of Princeton , the lead author of a report on biofuels ’ environmental impact in a February issue of Science [ subscription required ] .
“ That ’s true .
But we ’re forgetting something :
The land was already removing carbon . ”
He found that over 30 years , corn - based ethanol would actually increase emissions by nearly 100 percent , because farmers exploit previously unfarmed land to grow corn for ethanol .
In November researchers at the University of Texas at Austin found that producing corn ethanol consumes 28 gallons of water per mile traveled , whereas conventional petroleum uses 0.15 gallon .
“ In order to grow enough corn , we ’ve been pushing to the fringes , into land that needs extensive irrigating , ” says Otto Doering , professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University .
“ The question is , how much longer can we support that push ? ”
The collapse in corn prices in the latter half of 2008 should cool plans to drastically increase production .
With corn trading at $ 3.50 a bushel , just half its June high , farmers will have less incentive to invest in expensive irrigation equipment and crop expansion .
Unpromising Options
Where does that leave us ?
The push for biofuels will continue because we have already made a commitment to ethanol .
The 2007 Energy Act mandates that biofuel production increase over the next 14 years , culminating in 36 billion gallons in 2022 .
“ If this were a pure science issue , I think we ’d be done with ethanol by now , ” says Robert Rapier , a former chemical engineer at ConocoPhillips and the current director of engineering at AccSys Technology .
“ We ’ve created an infrastructure and a cycle that ’s very hard to beat . ”
Yet there is another way to displace oil , one that is attracting interest from academics and industry alike .
In July a report from MIT , On the Road in 2035 , found that if a market for lightweight hybrid and plug - in hybrid electric vehicles were developed , the United States could cut its gas consumption by 68 billion gallons — about half our current fuel use — within 27 years .
Return of the Electric Car
The new electric cars reflect huge advances in concept and technology .
A plug - in hybrid electric vehicle ( PHEV ) utilizes both electric and combustion motors , circumventing the limited storage capacity of even the latest , much improved batteries .
The forthcoming Chevrolet Volt is expected to run 40 miles purely on electricity .
Beyond that range , its combustion engine will kick in , powering a generator for its onboard battery .
If used for short trips and recharged regularly at a household outlet , it would use no gasoline at all .
Hybrid vehicles , which do not plug in but also use both gas and electric engines , are bringing the technology mainstream .
Last year Toyota sold more than 180,000 of its hybrid Prius , and the company is reportedly working on a PHEV version of the car .
Meanwhile , just about every automaker is working on a new generation of electric vehicles , including both hybrids and cars that operate entirely on electricity stored in batteries .
Much depends on how quickly electric vehicles infiltrate the market and whether consumers will recharge them during off - peak hours .
According to a 2008 study from Oak Ridge National Laboratory , the existing grid could support 50 million new PHEV vehicles , assuming that drivers plug in during off - peak hours and allow their batteries to charge at a modest 120 - volt / 15 - amp rate .
( In this projection , 50 million light - duty PHEVs would constitute a 25 percent market share by 2030 . )
However , if the same number of vehicles were all charging at 5 p.m. on a beefier , 240 - volt / 30 - amp circuit , the grid would need 160 additional gigawatts of capacity , requiring the construction of 160 new power plants .
“ The biggest challenge wo n’t be building the infrastructure ; it will be changing consumer habits and expectations , ” says Stan Hadley , coauthor of the report .
End of the Road for Liquid Fuels ?
Something still has to generate all those gigawatts , of course .
In the United States that something is often coal : 49 percent of the nation ’s electricity is derived from it .
Renewables , including wind , solar , and hydro , currently account for barely 8.5 percent .
Nonetheless , “ electricity opens up so many other sources , ” Hadley says .
“ Nukes , renewables , natural gas ; anything that makes power is fair game . ”
In fact , Searchinger says that the biomass currently tapped for biofuels would be put to better use making electricity .
“ The process of converting biomass into liquid fuel uses half of the energy in the feedstock .
It ’s far more efficient to burn the biomass for electricity and then use the electricity in cars . ”
That is in part because you waste less making the electricity and also because electric engines convert as much as 75 percent of available energy into forward motion , compared with the 20 percent energy conversion rate of gasoline engines .
Better still would be electricity from a new generation of emissions - free solar photovoltaic panels .
In March the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory demonstrated a thin - film solar photovoltaic cell that is 19.9 percent efficient , two - thirds better than the industry average of 12 percent .
Wind power , too , is a promising clean resource .
A 2008 U.S. Department of Energy report projects that 20 percent of the nation ’s electrical demand can be supplied by wind power by 2030 .
For now , the benefits of a plug - in and all - electric vehicle fleet reside largely in the realm of theory .
But with the Chevrolet Volt scheduled for a 2010 introduction , the PHEV Prius reportedly slated to debut at about the same time , and Nissan ’s announcement in May that it will bring a vehicle powered entirely by electricity to the U.S. commercial market in 2010 , theory may soon give way to a new motoring reality .
“ Electrifying the transport sector is a game changer , ” says Dave Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research .
“ We ’re not talking about 10 or 15 percent gains in efficiency ; we ’re talking about exponential gains , ” equivalent to — in the Volt ’s case — about 100 miles per gallon .
If the past year has taught us anything , it is to be wary of outsize claims .
But we have also learned that we have the technology to reshape the transportation landscape — and that is a lesson that could resonate for decades to come .
Love machine : Computer geek too busy for romance builds himself the perfect girlfriend
If blind dates , speed dating or websites have n't led you to the love of your life , you could always take a leaf out of inventor Le Trung 's book - and build your perfect partner .
The 33 - year - old has created Aiko - a ' twenty - something ' robot who not only looks feminine and sexy but also does household chores and his accounts .
But despite her shiny hair and 32-23-33 figure , Aiko - whose name means love child - is no trophy partner .
Robot romance : Le Trung with his perfected partner Aiko
She is accomplished too with a talent for maths and a 13,000 - sentence vocabulary - in English and Japanese .
She can also recognise faces , read aloud from a newspaper and give directions .
Aiko , a fembot made from silicone and A.I. technology , is a genuine labour of love for Mr Trung .
He has taken out credit cards and loans , sold his car and spent his life savings on perfecting the machine - at a cost so far of £ 14,000 .
The former software programmer , from Ontario , Canada , said he never had time to find a real wife but has not built Aiko as a sexual partner - although she is touch - sensitive and reacts if she is shown affection or is hurt .
Living doll :
The petite , feminine robot speaks two languages and does all the household accounts and chores
Mr Trung said : ' I want to make her look , feel and act as human as possible so she can be the perfect companion .
' Like a real female she will react to being touched in certain ways .
If you grab or squeeze too hard she will try to slap you .
She has all senses except for smell .
' She does n’t need holidays , food or rest and she will work almost 24 - hours a day .
She is the perfect woman . '
Mr Trung , who dresses
Aiko in different outfits and takes her for drives in the countryside , was a child genius and made his first robot when he was eight years old .
' People have mixed reactions when they meet Aiko , ' he said .
' They either love or hate her .
Some people get angry and accuse me of playing God .
Once someone threw a rock at Aiko .
That really upset me .
But many people are fascinated by her .
' Women are generally impressed and try to talk to her .
But the men always want to touch her , and if they do it in the wrong way they get a slap . '
Mr Trung will spend the next few years perfecting Aiko 's software and increasing her range of skills - but not just for his own amusement .
' I suffered a heart attack and I thought that one day I might need 24 - hour care in the future , ' he said .
' I may need to have Aiko look after me one day . '
Watch Aiko in action ...
Because it was released on Christmas Eve , when most people including me were focused on other things , the November personal income - and spending report for the U.S. did n't attract much attention .
Yet it contained some interesting news .
Despite the fact that the savings rate rose significantly , real consumer spending rose as much as 0.6 % in November , following 5 straight months of declines .
This means that the economy probably did n't contract as much as most people have believed , though it will still definitely contract .
But how could real consumer spending increase even as the savings rate rise ?
Simply because real household income rose sharply , by 1.1 % , which is a lot for a single month ( at an annual rate it 's roughly 14 % ) .
And why did it rise so much ?
Because of deflation , as the price index fell by 1.2 % .
The deflation during that month thus provided a significant boost to the purchasing power of U.S. consumers and so to the entire economy .
This is not meant to suggest that deflation can't in other circumstances have a contractionary effect .
But it clearly illustrates that this is not always the case and that deflation thus can have a positive effect , something which is usually neglected by non-Austrians .
Where does religious freedom end ?
This is an important question , a vital one .
At times , a matter literally of life and death .
In Wisconsin , the parents of Madeline Kara Neumann are going to stand trial soon for killing their child .
She had juvenile diabetes .
Her parents did not take her to get medically treated , but instead prayed over her .
Last March , she died of diabetic ketoacidosis : she dehydrated , and her body basically shut down .
She was 11 years old .
Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in people with diabetes who do n't get insulin .
It is almost completely preventable with regular insulin shots , a simple medical procedure .
In other words , had Kara been diagnosed with diabetes -- and that 's a relatively easy disease to diagnose in children during routine medical checkups -- she would almost certainly be alive today .
Medical science provides children with diabetes the ability to live a relatively normal life .
This is so , so sad ; the death of a child , especially one that was almost certainly completely preventable , is an awful thing to contemplate .
But we have to think about it , because it appears that Kara 's death was her parents ' fault .
From the New York Times article linked above :
The Neumanns ... are known locally as followers of an online faith outreach group called Unleavened Bread Ministries , run by a preacher , David Eells .
The site shares stories of faith healing and talks about the end of the world .
It 's clear from the news reports ( for example here , here , and here ) that the religious beliefs of the parents were to blame for this little girl 's death .
I wo n't beleaguer you with the details of knowing that faith healing does n't work beyond the placebo effect , and in the case of diabetes does n't work at all .
What 's important to think about here is , if religion is behind Kara 's death -- and we know that fringe religious beliefs of parents have caused countless cases of children becoming sick or even dying -- then what recourse does the justice system have ?
I have no doubts that many religious people would claim that they have the right to do as they see fit to take care of their children .
A case can be made for that ; I personally do n't want the government telling me what I can and cannot do to raise my child .
But then , we already acknowledge that laws exist that govern this very thing .
I can not sell my child , or abuse her , or do any number of other things that violate her rights as a human .
Certainly , causing the death of a person takes away their human rights .
In this country , we have a right to believe what we want .
I agree with that idea .
However , we do not have the right to necessarily act on those beliefs .
What if my religion says I must pray by screaming at the top of my lungs at funerals ?
Or if it says I have to commit genocide to bring about the Rapture ?
Or if I can only get into Paradise by flying planes into buildings ?
Obviously , these are not rhetorical or even hypothetical questions .
Clearly , religious rights have limits .
According to the NYT article , the laws on the books about belief - related deaths vary from state to state , and the outcome of this trial may set precedents across the country .
If it is indeed shown that the parents of this young girl caused her death due to their religious beliefs , then I sincerely hope they are locked away for a long , long time .
You have the right to believe what you want .
But you do n't have the right to allow that belief to cause harm to come to children under your care .
And diabetes does n't care what you believe .

First off – you really can build this thing very cheaply , but to do so you have to recycle , freecycle , and scrounge .
If you just go out and buy new everything it will probably cost over $ 200 – still not bad all in all .

Construction Steps
Hind Sight –
What I would do differently
The planning is over and construction on my hoop house greenhouse has begun .
I ’ve rounded up all of the materials and it looks like I ’m going to end up with about $ 50 in a 165 square ft. green house .
Granted I already had most of the materials because I ’m an incorrigible pack rat , but even if I had bought everything new just for this polytunnel
It would still only come to about $ 120 $ 150 – less than a dollar per square ft .
Due to the fact that we are in the midst of a global economic meltdown , and the future is a bit uncertain keeping the cost of this project as low as possible is an important consideration .
After some research I ’ve decided to build the structure of the hoop house out of 20 ft. joints of three quarter inch PVC plumbing pipe .
Some similar greenhouse designs that I ’ve run across use 10 ft joints of pipe and then fasten everything together with pipe fittings , but I ’m saving quite a bit of cash with the long joints of pipe and by not using any fittings – also overall simplicity is improved .
There is one thing though , you can carry 10 ft joints of pipe in the mini van , but hauling 20 ′ pipe requires a truck and preferably a ladder rack .
However , you could just cut them in half right at the home improvement store and then put them back together when you get home with the coupling that is built into one end of the 20 ′ long pipe joints – 10 ′ pipe joints do n’t have the built in couplers – just go to the home improvement store prepared with a saw or pipe cutter .
My hoop house green house is going to be 11 feet wide and 15 feet long , and will be about seven and a half feet tall in the center .
You could make one of these as long or as short as you want , but using this design the width needs to be between 10 - 12 feet .
11 feet wide just happpened to work out with the layout of my garden which has 3 foot wide beds with 5 ft paths between ( the wide paths are so that I can keep it tidy with my riding lawn mower ) so eleven feet covers two beds and the path between them .
This width also makes the sides go fairly straight up from the ground for the first few feet – I ’ve noticed that in some hoop house / polytunnel designs the outer edges are almost unusable because of the slope of the greenhouse sides .
If your Greenhouse is too Flat it will collapse !
You might be tempted to make your greenhouse wider and lower at this point to get more floor space out of it – but be careful .
If you have snow in your area it will slide off of a high peak a lot better than it will if your greenhouse has more of a flattened shape – and the same goes for heavy rains .
If your hoop house shape is too flattened it will cave in the first time it snows or rains really hard !
How to Build the $ 50 Hoop House
I decided to begin the construction by building the end walls first – even though it would be more fun to throw up the main structure in just an hour or so and make a big showing of progress , I think that in the long run it will be quicker and easier to build the end frames first on my garage floor .
I used pressure treated lumber for much of the polytunnel end frames even though I usually try to avoid treated wood in the garden .
In this case I think it ’s called for or else the greenhouse probably would n’t last more than 2 - 3 years without rebuilding the frame .
In any event I ’ll try to keep it off of the soil as much as possible .
Leave the piece that runs across the bottom of the door in place for now .
Once everything is set in place it will be easy to cut out with a hand saw .
The end wall frames ended up being reasonably light and very rigid .
BTW , you might notice that the second one is different ( simpler ) from the first because this is a learn - as - I go process .
Both of them work fine though .
This is the front side because it is all on one plane so that the plastic skin will lay flat on it .
The back side has reinforcement gussets that stick out .
And Now for the Plastic
The plastic sheeting that I ’m using is plain old non-UV stabilized 6 mil “ clear ” plastic sheeting from the lumber yard .
There is exactly one reason that I am using this particular variety instead of special polytunnel / greenhouse plastic – it ’s what I have .
I cut a 22 ′ piece off of a 100′ x 20 ′ roll that I already had ( I ’m a contractor ) which was about $ 90 for the roll – so in essence I used about $ 22 worth of plastic sheeting after you apply the 10 % TN sales tax .
Had I ordered real green house plastic from littlegreenhouse.com a similar sized piece of 6 mil plastic would have been about $ 71 with shipping .
The real deal would no doubt last much longer than the “ visqueen ” that I ’m using , and also probably has better thermal and light transmittance .
If all goes well maybe I ’ll get some of that next year .
Also ,
It ’s hard to buy large pieces of heavy duty plastic like this without buying a whole roll , so unless you know a contractor or Mom and Pop hardware store that will cut you a piece you might really be better off ordering some of the good stuff .
On the other hand a big roll of plastic sheet is one of those things that comes in awfully handy some times .
If you have much wind I would recommend using steel fence posts or rebar that is at least 5/8 ″ diameter in these spots .
My fence posts do n’t match because they ’re left overs from previous projects – remember , I ’m on a tight budget !
The humongous wire ties made this really quick easy and strong , but If I did n’t already have them I would just use “ baling ” wire , and it would work as well .
As you can see it ’s getting dark , and I ’ll have to finish this later .
Total time invested so far is about 2 1/2 hours .
I believe that taking the greenhouse down next summer , and re-assembling it in the fall will probably only take an hour or so , but I guess I ’ll see about that .
Since the site location where I ’m building my greenhouse is n’t all that level I had to raise up one side of the end frames with some 2x6s that I ripped to fit – later I cut the tail off where it sticks out toward the fence .
Also notice that this means that the PVC pipes that are the intermediate ribs are too low where they hit the ground …
So I extended them with some scraps of PVC conduit that I had – I never throw anything away .
BTW , the gray PVC conduit is sunlight resistant unlike the white – although somewhat more expensive and is less expensive !
If you want to do a really good job you could use it instead .
You should probably use the gray conduit instead of the white pipe that I used .
You could even opt for schedule 80 conduit which is much thicker if you wanted to go whole hog , or if you needed to make a structure that is sturdier , more permanent or wider .
If you live where it snows or even rains very hard – You need to add a 2 ″ pvc pipe to the very top of the frame like this :
When I originally built the greenhouse I did n’t use the ridge pole and it collapse under a snow load .
Since adding this feature
It has been through several snows with no problem at all .
However when I know snow is coming I have two 2×4 props that I put under the ridge as insurance .
I strung it all together with 1x2s that I ripped out of some slightly used 2×4 studs .
Using full 1x4s ( which I later did ) or even 2x4s for the top set of these would make the structure stronger .
I used a few wire ties to get everything located , and then drove a 1 1/ 4 ″ drywall screw at each joint to secure it .
As you can see by the lay out marks , I first measured and marked all of the locations so that it would go together reasonably straight .
If you look really close in this picture you will see the wires that serve as X bracing on the sides .
I used a doubled wire that I attached at the top and bottom of the ends using a washer and a screw .
I then used some scraps of wood to twist the double wires together and tighten them up like a rubber band airplane .
You just want them to be snug so do n’t go nuts tightening them up .
These wires really go a long way to make the whole structure more rigid and sturdy .
Now for the plastic covering – measure and cut your piece of plastic – you want a little extra in all directions – the piece that I used is 20 ′ x 22 ′ .
My greenhouse is 15 ′ feet long so I cut a 2×2 x 15 ′ – Here I ’m positioning it in the center of one of the 20′ edges of the plastic – leaving 2 1/2 of plastic past the ends of the 2×2 .
Staple it together just to hold it in position .
Now roll the 2×2 under one complete turn so that the edge you stapled is facing up under the top layer of plastic sheet .
Now screw a 1×2 on to secure the plastic .
By wrapping the plastic around the 2×2 , and then sandwiching 2 layers between the 2 pieces of wood you make a very secure connection , and also add some weight to the bottom edges to help keep them from billowing up in the wind .
Do the same thing to the opposite edge , and then roll it all up and get someone to help you carry it to the hoop house and unroll it across the top …
Thusly .
Now you almost have a greenhouse .
Roll under the edges on the ends and staple them securely ( Note : now that I have taken this down for the summer , I think that when I put it back up next fall instead of “ stapling it securely ” I ’m going to just staple it a little bit to get it positioned , and then screw battens made of 1 × 2 or strips of plywood to hold it in place – it should be stronger and quicker ) , and other than the doors the structure of your polytunnel greenhouse is finished .
Total time at this point – about 6 hours .
Everything is a bigger job than it seems like it ’s going to be .
Rake soil or mulch up to the gaps at the bottom to keep out drafts and ( larger ) critters .
Cats in particular are likely to be attracted to such a nice sheltered spot with a bed full of soft loose dirt to dig in so pay attention to the details .
Rocks , bricks or concrete stepping stones or blocks placed on top of the soil / mulch around the outside edges are probably a good idea .
Here is a forum discussion on alternative ways to fasten plastic to your greenhouse .
I have n’t tried the poly pipe clips that are discussed , so I ca n’t vouch for them , but it looks like a good idea that I would consider .
Here is a picture of a small greenhouse which uses that method :
Before I even started on the hoop house I tilled copious amounts of compost into the beds where the greenhouse was going to end up .
So , even though I probably wo n’t get a chance to put up the doors until next weekend ( which is Halloween ) , I ’m all ready to plant some lettuce and spinach for ( hopefully ) some fresh mid winter greens .
One of my goals in building this polytunnel is to have something fresh coming out of the garden or greenhouse all year long .
That might be a little optimistic , but I ’m going to give it a shot .

OK , that ’s a bit more than I estimated because I did n’t count all of the minor bits that I just take for granted because I buy them in bulk and keep them on hand .
These prices are what you would pay if you just bought the quantities that you need for this project .
Drywall screws for example are only about a third as much when you buy a 25 lb box like I do being a contractor .
However , you can shave most of the 20 dollar overage by using 5/8 rebar instead of fence posts , and gray UV resistant PVC conduit which is actually less expensive than the non resistant white plumbing pipe that I used – you can also do without wire ties , and use scraps of wire instead , etc .
I already had everything on hand except for the PVC pipe and a couple of pieces of 1×6 lumber .
However , surely almost anyone can get some of this stuff for cheap or free if they put some time and effort into it – so shop around and use your imagination to find what will work best for you .
Admittedly it might be hard for most people to build this for just $ 50 out of pocket , but then again a serious scrounger can probably do it for even less .
Hind Sight – What I would do Differently
When I originally built this hoophouse it collapsed under a moderate snow load but after adding the 2 ″ ridge on top of the ribs I have had no more trouble – despite several even larger snows .
I do put a pair of 2×4 props under the ridge when I know that snow is coming though – for insurance .
Use UV resistant gray PVC Conduit instead of white plumbing pipe – it should last longer and is actually less expensive Use UV resistant greenhouse plastic instead of “ visqueen ” construction plastic –
It ’s a good bit more expensive , but I ’m so pleased with how the polytunnel turned out so far that I ’m pretty sure the investment in durability would be worth while .
However , if the extra expense meant putting off the project I would go ahead and use the cheap plastic because 1 ) The plastic will have to be replaced sooner or later anyway and the difference in cost seems proportional to the difference in life span 2 ) It would n’t be worth putting off having a perfectly usable greenhouse .
I should have painted the PVC pipes with latex paint before applying the plastic sheeting – apparently this makes the poly sheet last longer , and maybe makes the frame pipes more resistant to UV .
Site Selection –
As you can see in the pictures my garden is in a clearing in the woods and the truth is it does n’t get as much sun as I would like for it to – however I can still grow a nice garden – it just does n’t yield as much as it might .
I ca n’t really do very much about this , but you should keep in mind that you want as much sun as possible as well as a sheltered well drained spot that is as close to the kitchen as possible so that it is n’t too much trouble to trot out and get a bowl of fresh lettuce for supper .
All that being said – do the best you can with the spot you have , and you might be surprised with the results you can get with a little effort .
Next time I think I will use screws and battens made of plywood strips to secure the main skin to the end walls ( I ’m not talking about the end wall skin here ) so that instead of using 200 staples I will use a couple of dozen screws to accomplish the same thing , but it will make it quicker to put up and take down .
When I do it I ’ll add pictures for clarification .

To demonstrate a new method for fabricating three - dimensional living biological structures , researchers at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Industrial Science ( IIS ) have created a 5 - millimeter tall doll composed of living cells .
According to an announcement made on January 22 , the researchers created the tiny figurine by cultivating 100,000 cell capsules -- 0.1 - millimeter balls of collagen , each coated with dozens of skin cells -- together inside a doll - shaped mold for one day .
After the cell capsules had coalesced to form the doll - shaped mass of tissue , it was placed in a culture solution , where it reportedly survived for more than a day .
The researchers , led by IIS professor Shoji Takeuchi , also successfully tested the biofabrication method with human liver cells .
According to Takeuchi , the technique can be used to create bodily organs and tissues with complex cellular structures , which may prove useful in the fields of regenerative medicine and drug development .
" The overall shape can be controlled by changing the mold , " said Takeuchi , who expressed a desire to combine multiple types of cells to create a complex system that functions as a living organism .

At least 52 killed in Egypt bus crash Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday December 14 , 2008
Print This Email This DAHRUT , Egypt ( AFP ) 
At least 52 Egyptians were killed when their bus plunged into a canal south of Cairo on Sunday in the deadliest road accident in Egypt in two decades , officials said .
More than 60 people were in the public bus when it swerved into the canal to avoid an oncoming truck as it travelled on the main highway between the Nile city of Minya to Cairo , a security official said .
" Fifty - two bodies have been recovered , " the official told AFP , adding that 10 passengers were taken to hospital with injuries .
Many university students were among the dead , and rescue workers were searching the waters of the Ibrahimiya canal for survivors and victims , the official said .
At least 20 ambulances rushed to the crash site along with local residents offering their help after the accident near the village of Dahrut , about 200 kilometres ( 125 miles ) south of Cairo , an AFP correspondent reported .
All the dead had drowned before they could be reached by rescue workers , a hospital official told AFP .
It was the deadliest road accident in Egypt since 1987 , when 63 Egyptians were killed when a bus and a train collided .
Police have detained both the truck driver and the bus driver for questioning , a police official told AFP .
Poor road conditions and lax traffic regulations in Egypt cause thousands of accidents every year and a new highway code came into force in August with the aim of improving road safety .
Road accidents kill about 6,000 people and cause 30,000 injuries each year , also because of poor upkeep of vehicles , according to the transport ministry .
Last week , 15 Coptic students were killed when their bus overturned while travelling from Minya to the Mediterranean city of Alexandria .
Eight people , including six schoolgirls , were killed in September when a truck plunged into a river in the Nile Delta province of Sharqiya .
Thousands convicted of a misdemeanor for threatening or assaulting a spouse or girlfriend could once again own guns because of a flaw in the federal law .
That prospect grew more likely Monday after the Supreme Court gave a skeptical hearing to a government lawyer who argued that a crime of domestic violence should result in a loss of gun rights .
Neither families nor police officers should face “ the powder keg situation of a domestic offender with a gun , ” said Nicole Saharsky , a Justice Department lawyer .
But she ran into sharp questioning from justices who said the law was badly written .
Advertisement
Congress in 1996 sought to strengthen the laws against domestic violence .
Before , only persons convicted of violent felonies in such situations lost their rights to own a gun .
Going a step further , lawmakers adopted an amendment to take away gun rights for those who had a “ misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ” on their records .
Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) , the amendment ’s sponsor , said he was closing a loophole .
In domestic violence cases , local prosecutors often agree to have defendants plead guilty to a misdemeanor assault or battery , which usually calls for less than a year in jail , he said .
“ There is no reason for someone who beats their wives or abuses their children to own a gun .
When you combine wife beaters and guns , the end result is more death , ” Lautenberg said in the Senate before the amendment was enacted .
But last year , the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia cast doubt on the law ’s reach .
Its judges decided the federal gun ban did not cover misdemeanor convictions involving assault or battery at home .
Instead , it said the federal ban applied only to those convicted under a state ’s domestic violence law .
Advertisement
That would make the federal gun law “ a dead letter in two - thirds of the states , ” according to the government ’s lawyer .
Saharsky said most states do not have misdemeanor laws specifically targeting domestic violence .
Justice Antonin Scalia was unswayed by that argument .
“ People are governed by the law that is passed , not by the law that Congress intended to pass , ” he said .
He and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the law as written appeared to apply only to domestic violence measures , not the more common laws against assault and battery .
Scalia wrote the 5 - 4 opinion in June which held for the first time that the 2nd Amendment protects an individual ’s right to have a gun .
He said then that the decision did not shield criminals who committed serious crimes with a gun .
But during Monday ’s argument , Scalia said possessing a gun was “ lawful conduct , ” and a wife - beating charge lodged against a West Virginia man was “ not that serious an offense . ”
Advertisement
The government lawyer shot back that the defendant “ hit his wife all around the face until it swelled out , kicked her all around her body , kicked her in the ribs .
. . . “
“ Then he should have been charged with a felony , ” Scalia interjected , “ but he was n’t . ”
The defendant , Randy Hayes , pleaded guilty in 1994 to misdemeanor battery of his then - wife .
Ten years later , police responded to a domestic violence call from his home and learned he had owned or sold several guns .
He was convicted of illegal gun possession under the 1996 amendment .
The case of U.S. vs. Hayes does not turn on the 2nd Amendment , but instead on how the justices read the words of the 1996 law .
Advertisement
“ This statute is a mess , ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy commented at one point .
Roberts noted that California , Illinois , Michigan and Ohio have misdemeanor domestic violence laws .
People convicted under those measures would not benefit from a ruling that limited the reach of the federal law , he said .
The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence said a ruling for Hayes “ could re-arm thousands of convicted domestic violence abusers . ”
About 14 % “ of all police officer deaths occur during a response to domestic violence calls , ” the group said .
On the other side , the Second Amendment Foundation said the “ fundamental right ” to own a gun should not be taken away over a misdemeanor .

This is part of a series of posts this week on happenings in the sprawling but always succinct world of Twitter .
Twitter can be used to network , make friends or keep up with Britney Spears .
And soon it will become a way to transfer money over the Web .
Twitpay is a start - up that aims to allow people to send small payments through Twitter .
To do this they include the recipients ’ username in their message .
For example , posting the update “ @johnsmith twitpay $ 10 for lunch ” would deliver the cash to that Twitterer ’s Twitpay account .
The company monitors the public stream of messages for the keyword “ twitpay ” and facilitates the exchange .
You replenish your Twitpay account using a site like PayPal .
Once recipients have accumulated more than $ 10 in their accounts , the balance can be cashed out in the form of an Amazon gift card .
For all transfers exceeding $ 1 , Twitpay will take a flat cut of 5 cents .
In its simplest form , the service is a quick way to settle a lunch tab or pick up a round of drinks on a friend ’s birthday .
But Michael D. Ivey , its chief executive and co-founder , says it could also make it easier to donate money during a disaster like Hurricane Katrina or an earthquake .
“ Ideally we want to enable social giving on Twitter , ” he said .
“ But beyond that , we could enable charitable giving , such as to the Red Cross .
We ’re very excited to be able to help people do good over Twitter . ”
Along with many of the third - party applications that make use of Twitter ’s platform , Twitpay has no official ties to Twitter , which allows people to post messages up to 140 characters in length .
But along with the Shorty Awards , Mr. Tweet and the multitude of other sites and third - party applications springing up around the platform , Twitpay is another example of the way Twitter is forming an ecosystem of its own .
The service is still in a trial phase , but Mr. Ivey said the company was actively working to obtain financing and is in discussions with several groups .

Dec. 14 , 2008
Last Tuesday , just hours after the FBI arrested the now - infamous Governor of Illinois , Rod Blagojevich , on suspicion of fraud , Joe Gelman , the owner of the Neocon Express blog posted the following headline :
Hope and Change : Close Obama Ally Arrested .
Immediately beneath the headline , and above the fold , he placed a picture of Gov. Blagojevich , Barack Obama and Mayor Daley standing together while sharing a laugh .
Above the picture was the caption " The Chicago Way . "
Below the picture was the following text :
" In what is described by US Attorney 's as a " corruption crime spree " , Illinois Governor and close Obama ally was arrested this morning in Chicago .
Three areas of extreme corruption are alleged :
He tried to sell Obama 's open Senate seat for money ; used " pay to play " strong - arm tactics on contracts for government funded projects ; and tried to get newspaper columnists at the Chicago Tribune who were critical of him fired in exchange for government funding .
Some Republicans are now demanding that Obama release all communications between his transition team and Governor Blagojevich . "
If you 're a sharp reader you can probably pick out the three underlined words above that caused my blood to boil .
Yep , " close Obama ally " .
At best , Mr. Gelman 's use of that phrase to describe Obama 's relationship with Governor Blagojevich was made out of pure ignorance of the situation .
Given that Mr. Gelman is a former columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News ( and , as far as I can tell , not living in Illinois ) I 'll give him the benefit of the doubt that this comment was simply made out of ignorance .
But , if that 's the case , and you do n't know whether or not Obama and Blagojevich are allies then do n't report it as fact , Mr. Gelman .
With that said , what leaves some doubt in my mind about Mr. Gelman 's intentions is the way he added a link to the phrase " Governor and close Obama ally " .
The implication of a link in any blog post is that the story being linked to is supportive of the claim being made in the text .
In this case , the implication is that whatever is on the other end of that link will add credibility to Mr. Gelman 's claim that the Governor [ of Illinois ] and Obama are political allies .
However , if you click the link and read the FOX News story ( shocking that a neocon would use FOX as his source ) , you 'll see that nowhere in the entire article are Obama and Blagojevich tied together as allies .
The link is misleading , which leaves open the possibility that Mr. Gelman 's error was more than just ignorance of Illinois politics , but worse , a deliberate attempt to mislead his readers .
Anyone who has followed Illinois politics knows that Obama and Blagojevich are by no means " close allies , " or allies at all , for that matter .
The extent of any alliance between the two begins and ends with the fact that they both happen to be members of the same political party from the same state .
They 're two Illinois Democrats .
In 2002 , when Blagojevich was locked in a tight gubernatorial Democratic primary , Obama did not endorse B - Rod .
Then , in 2004 , Governor Blagojevich returned the favor by not endorsing Obama in his tight primary race for the U.S. Senate .
Since when do political allies skip the opportunity to endorse each other ?
But , if the lack of endorsements area little too subtle to convince all those Gelman - types out there that these two are not allies , the Governor himself has provided us with some much more direct and straightforward evidence , namely that the FBI tapes from the Blagojevich investigation catch the governor calling President - Elect Obama a " motherfucker . "
Blagojevich , an apparent fan of the F - bomb , used the four - letter word in reference to Obama several times during the course of the FBI tapes .
It is clear that Blago does not consider Barack his friend , in any way , shape or form .
Blagojevich and Obama are not allies and have never been , and there is no evidence to suggest that they are .
So , Mr. Gelman , I call on you to remove any reference on your blog to Obama and Blagojevich being allies until you have the evidence to prove it .
Additionally , I call on you to run a correction and explain to your readers that simply because you found a picture of Obama and Blagojevich standing together , and that they happen to be members of the same political party from the same large and diverse state , that does not mean they are allies .
Maybe a call to tell the truth is asking a bit too much of a neocon though .
After all , a little lie about a political alliance in order to further the neocon agenda is nothing compared to the neocon lies of the past decade .
At least this lie wo n't launch an ill - advised , preemptive war .
Not content with lese - majeste laws to protect the revered monarchy that are among the world 's most draconian , Thailand is to build a wall around the kingdom to keep out detractors .
But the barrier will be virtual , a national internet firewall to block websites deemed insulting to the throne of King Bhumibol Adulyadej , who at 80 is the world 's longest serving monarch .
For the princely sum of almost £ 9 m the Thai information ministry will shield the king and his adoring subjects from the sleights – real or perceived – of those who mock online .
Thailand 's government , locked in a bitter struggle with staunchly royalist demonstrators who have been on the streets for months , has been accused of harbouring republican tendencies and being hostile to the monarchy .
It refutes the charge , but the move to construct the firewall appears to be the result of pressure from the powerful military and its demand that criticism of the monarchy be stamped out .
The firewall will also give Thailand 's bureaucrats the power to block other websites it labels inappropriate , like those run by perceived terrorist groups or showing pornography .
But the first target will up to 1,000 websites suspected of carrying material regarded as offensive to the king .
Last year the government , which was appointed by the military after a coup in 2006 , blocked the YouTube website for weeks after its parent company , Google , refused to take down a posting .
The 44 - second clip showed a picture of the Thai king with a pair of women 's feet suspended above his head .
In Thai culture feet are regarded as dirty and the lowest part of the body .
Thailand 's lese - majeste laws are harsh by any standard , promising 15 years imprisonment for anyone who " insults , defames or threatens " the royal family .
But the law allows anyone to make an accusation against anyone else , with the result that it is often abused to ensnare rivals .
The Thai prime minister , Somchai Wongsawat , has ordered police to be especially vigilant and special branch are monitoring community radio stations suspected of airing lese majeste content .
Though they may lavish Wall Street Journal reporters with leaks and other scoops , American corporate executives tend to keep their names out of the newspaper 's editorial pages .
Overt support for the opinion section 's relentlessly right - wing politics carries too much risk of customer blowback .
But FedEx founder and CEO Fred Smith will tolerate no such sissiness .
A former George W. Bush fraternity brother , Smith was named as a possible Bush defense secretary and has become involved with John McCain 's presidential run .
Fair enough .
But Smith has to figure many customers might take it personally when tells the Journal opinion section " a majority of the population " is unproductive and greedy :
He sees a big problem in that so few Americans now pay any income tax .
" We 're now at a point where a very large part of the population pays no federal income tax at all .
When you have a majority of the population that realizes that you can transfer money from the productive to themselves , that 's one of the great questions for the future of civilization , as far as I 'm concerned . "
( Emphasis added . )
The " most people do n't pay income taxes " saw is a key Republican talking point in the 2008 election , and a misleading one at that , since a > it 's closer to 40 percent and b> virtually all workers pay , directly and indirectly , payroll taxes amounting to 15 percent of wages .
But more to the point , saying the majority of Americans are unproductive is just the sort of thing that 's going to prompt customers ( like , say , me ) to choose alternate carriers when redistributing their own meager ( and for the most part declining ) wealth this holiday season via Amazon.com and the like .
Smith has secured a brighter future for himself in a hypothetical McCain Administration , at least .
Hope it was worth it .
The wheels and undercarriage are missing , the interior has had little maintenance and the windows and doors need replacing .
The external walls , made of plywood , need attention and the original roof , which would have been wooden with attractive scalloped detailing but is now covered in asphalt , also need restoration .
Callie Shell - Obama [ Return to Feature ] © Callie Shell / Aurora for Time © Callie Shell / Aurora for Time I made this picture in October of 2006 during the Illinois State races .
Just three of us in a car : Senator Obama , a friend of his who was driving and me .
I do n't think you could make this picture now .
He had stopped at a rest area along the back roads of Illinois .

The bug was discovered accidentally by a G1 owner A text conversation has revealed a big problem with the G1 mobile phone - powered by Google 's Android software .
The newly discovered bug causes the phone to restart when owners type in the word " reboot " soon after starting up the device .
Google hurried to repair the problem , which causes the phone to interpret any text entered just after the phone was turned on as a command .
Google has rushed out a fix for the bug which will soon be available in the UK .
The bug was discovered when an owner of the phone typed the word " reboot " into a text message after restarting the phone .
" I was in the middle of a text conversation with my girl when she asked why I had n't responded , " said a user called jdhorvat in the description of his discovery that was posted to Google 's problem reporting website .
" I had just rebooted my phone and the first thing I typed was a response to her text which simply stated " Reboot " - which , to my surprise , rebooted my phone . "
The phone , which uses the Google - developed Android operating system , is sold by T - Mobile in the UK under the name " G1 " .
Google has fixed the problem in an update to the phone software that will be automatically installed on users ' phones .
" We 've been notified of this issue and have developed a fix , " said a Google spokesperson in a statement .
" We 're currently working with our partners to push the fix out . "
Users in the US already report receiving the update , and Google told the BBC that users in the UK should receive it by 12 November .

Is Piracy A Cover For Nuclear Waste Dumping Off Africa ?
Posted by Pile ( 14046 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Industry ]
[ Environment ]
Who imagined that in 2009 , the world 's governments would be declaring a new War on Pirates ?
As you read this , the British Royal Navy - backed by the ships of more than two dozen nations , from the US to China - is sailing into Somalian waters to take on men we still picture as parrot - on - the - shoulder pantomime villains .
They will soon be fighting Somalian ships and even chasing the pirates onto land , into one of the most broken countries on earth .
But behind the arrr- me - hearties oddness of this tale , there is an untold scandal .
The people our governments are labeling as " one of the great menace of our times " have an extraordinary story to tell -- and some justice on their side .
Pirates have never been quite who we think they are .
In the " golden age of piracy " - from 1650 to 1730 - the idea of the pirate as the senseless , savage thief that lingers today was created by the British government in a great propaganda - heave .
Many ordinary people believed it was false : pirates were often rescued from the gallows by supportive crowds .
Why ?
What did they see that we can't ?
In his book Villains of All nations , the historian Marcus Rediker pores through the evidence to find out .
If you became a merchant or navy sailor then - plucked from the docks of London 's East End , young and hungry - you ended up in a floating wooden Hell .
You worked all hours on a cramped , half - starved ship , and if you slacked off for a second , the all - powerful captain would whip you with the Cat O' Nine Tails .
If you slacked consistently , you could be thrown overboard .
And at the end of months or years of this , you were often cheated of your wages .
Pirates were the first people to rebel against this world .
They mutinied against their tyrannical captains - and created a different way of working on the seas .
Once they had a ship , the pirates elected their captains , and made all their decisions collectively .
They shared their bounty out in what Rediker calls " one of the most egalitarian plans for the disposition of resources to be found anywhere in the eighteenth century . "
They even took in escaped African slaves and lived with them as equals .
The pirates showed " quite clearly - and subversively - that ships did not have to be run in the brutal and oppressive ways of the merchant service and the Royal navy . "
This is why they were popular , despite being unproductive thieves .
The words of one pirate from that lost age - a young British man called William Scott - should echo into this new age of piracy .
Just before he was hanged in Charleston , South Carolina , he said : " What I did was to keep me from perishing .
I was forced to go a -pirating to live . "
In 1991 , the government of Somalia - in the Horn of Africa - collapsed .
Its nine million people have been teetering on starvation ever since - and many of the ugliest forces in the Western world have seen this as a great opportunity to steal the country 's food supply and dump our nuclear waste in their seas .
Yes : nuclear waste .
As soon as the government was gone , mysterious European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia , dumping vast barrels into the ocean .
The coastal population began to sicken .
At first they suffered strange rashes , nausea and malformed babies .
Then , after the 2005 tsunami , hundreds of the dumped and leaking barrels washed up on shore .
People began to suffer from radiation sickness , and more than 300 died .
Ahmedou Ould - Abdallah , the UN envoy to Somalia , tells me : " Somebody is dumping nuclear material here .
There is also lead , and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury - you name it . "
Much of it can be traced back to European hospitals and factories , who seem to be passing it on to the Italian mafia to " dispose " of cheaply .
When I asked Ould - Abdallah what European governments were doing about it , he said with a sigh : " Nothing .
There has been no clean - up , no compensation , and no prevention . "
At the same time , other European ships have been looting Somalia 's seas of their greatest resource : seafood .
We have destroyed our own fish - stocks by over - exploitation - and now we have moved on to theirs .
More than $ 300 m worth of tuna , shrimp , lobster and other sea- life is being stolen every year by vast trawlers illegally sailing into Somalia 's unprotected seas .
The local fishermen have suddenly lost their livelihoods , and they are starving .
Mohammed Hussein , a fisherman in the town of Marka 100 km south of Mogadishu , told Reuters : " If nothing is done , there soon wo n't be much fish left in our coastal waters . "
This is the context in which the men we are calling " pirates " have emerged .
Everyone agrees they were ordinary Somalian fishermen who at first took speedboats to try to dissuade the dumpers and trawlers , or at least wage a ' tax ' on them .
They call themselves the Volunteer Coastguard of Somalia - and it's not hard to see why .
In a surreal telephone interview , one of the pirate leaders , Sugule Ali , said their motive was " to stop illegal fishing and dumping in our waters ...
We do n't consider ourselves sea bandits .
We consider sea bandits [ to be ] those who illegally fish and dump in our seas and dump waste in our seas and carry weapons in our seas . "
William Scott would understand those words .

There is really no evidence for this .
The original source is an article in a British Newspaper : The Independent .
The above text here and at the Huffington Post are both cut and paste jobs of that original article .
Right now there is no evidence of nuclear waste dumping .
If we assume that the European countries ( which means France and Germany btw , as most of the nuclear reactors in Western Europe are in those two countries ) are dumping nuclear waste in the ocean ... why they heck would they go to Somalia to dump it ?
The waters off of Somalia are some of the most trafficked shipping lanes in the world -- go up the Red Sea to the Suez Canal , and the major Saudi Oil ports , as well as lots of ships hailing out of or toward the Suez on their way to and from India , China , and the rest of the Far East .
The Europeans would be better hauling the nuclear waste out to the mostly avoided areas of deep ocean in the Atlantic , which would be easier for them to get to as well .
Right now , this is all BS .
No way ca n't see ....

Here is a 2005 report from the UN Environmental Program :
http://www.unep.org/tsunami/reports/TSUNAMI_SOMALIA_LAYOUT.pdf
It states :
Further , Somalia is one of the many Least Developed Countries that reportedly received countless shipments of illegal nuclear and toxic waste dumped along the coastline .
Starting from the early 1980s and continuing into the civil war , the hazardous waste dumped along Somalia ’s coast comprised uranium radioactive waste , lead , cadmium , mercury , industrial , hospital , chemical , leather treatment and other toxic waste .
Most of the waste was simply dumped on the beaches in containers and disposable leaking barrels which ranged from small to big tanks without regard to the health of the local population and any environmentally devastating impacts .

The beer is the product of nearly a year of aging its Sheol Barleywine in bourbon barrels .
According to one of the brewers ( presumably Matt Van Wyk ? ) at Beemapping , “ To follow up on what Andrew said , batch # 1 is in fermentor and batch # 2 will be shortly behind it .
Hopefully we can bottle one whole batch this time .
We will also have 30 cases of Wooden Hell to release this winter as well .
The government is currently approving the label .
We may try to do a pre-sale / advance order on the Wooden Hell and give a window to pick it up with the idea of targeting the Killer Kowalski release to be the main pick up date . ”

The first - ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball took place January 20 , 2009 at the Washington Convention Center There ’s never been anything like it .
Past inaugural balls generally have been closed to everyday Americans , populated instead by an exclusive circle of dignitaries and donors .
President Obama , however , wanted to share this special night with a wide cross-section of Americans , reveling in the possibilities of what we can accomplish together .
In a statement made by Obama when the announcement was made in regard to his plans to host the event he said : “ This is an inauguration for all Americans .
I want to make sure that we have an event that would be open to our new neighborhood here in Washington , D.C. , and also the neighborhoods across the country .
Michelle and I look forward to joining our fellow Americans across the country during this very special event . ”

The sea lamprey 's mouth has garnered it the nickname " vampire fish " A synthetic " chemical sex smell " could help rid North America 's Great Lakes of a devastating pest , scientists say .
US researchers deployed a laboratory version of a male sea lamprey pheromone to trick ovulating females into swimming upstream into traps .
The sea lamprey , sometimes dubbed the " vampire fish " , has parasitised native species of the Great Lakes since its accidental introduction in the 1800s .
The work is reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The Great Lakes on the US - Canada border support recreational fishing worth billions of dollars a year , which the lampreys would wreck but for a control programme costing about $ 20 m annually .
This is thought to be the first time that pheromones have been shown to be the basis of a possible way of controlling animal pests other than insects .
" There 's been extensive study of pheromones in animals and even in humans , " said lead researcher Weiming Li from Michigan State University in East Lansing , US .
It was one of the worst things to hit the Great Lakes in the history of European settlement
Marc Gaden
" But most researchers have presumed that as animals get more complex , their behaviour is regulated in a more complex way , not by just one pheromone , " he told BBC News .
Professor Li's team released the synthetic version of a lamprey hormone from a trap placed in a stream where lampreys come to breed .
Females scenting it would swim vigorously upstream until they found the source , some becoming trapped in the process .
Death wish
The sea lamprey 's natural life cycle takes it from birth in a stream to adulthood in the ocean , where it gains its vampirical appellation .
Circular jaws lock on to another , larger fish , and a sharp tongue carves through its scales .
From then on the lamprey feeds on the blood and body fluids of its temporary host , often killing it in the process .
Eventually , the satiated lampreys - both males and females - find a suitable stream to swim up , breed and die .
The female lampreys were lured into traps on the stream Unlike salmon , which seek out the stream they were born in , lampreys appear willing to take any stream indicating a suitable breeding place ; and perhaps pheromones play a role in identifying streams worth selecting .
In their native Atlantic Ocean , their numbers are controlled by predation ; but in the Great Lakes they have no predators .
They first appeared in the 1800s after completion of the Erie Canal linking the lakes to New York .
Colonisation was completed a century later when other canals provided unfettered access to the upper lakes .
What followed was decimation of native fish .
" It was one of the worst things to hit the Great Lakes in the history of European settlement , " said Marc Gaden from the Great Lakes Fishery Commission ( GLFC ) , the body responsible for controlling the lamprey problem .
" Before it , we had a thriving fishery largely dependent on native fish such as the lake trout ... but by 1940 they had colonised thousands of streams and fishermen were beginning to see the devastation . "
Getting fresh
Many fish can survive only in fresh water or only in the oceans - or , like salmon , have a set migration between the two - but the lamprey appears to have thrived on its move from the saline Atlantic to the fresh environs of the five lakes .
Each individual devours a total weight of up to 20kg of trout or other host fish during its parasitic lifetime .
The GLFC has established a complex set of control measures , including dusting the streams with pesticides specific to the lamprey , building barriers to block their upstream migration , and releasing sterile males to reduce breeding .
" Why we 're so enthusiastic about the pheromone work is that we see it as another tool in the arsenal , " said Dr Gaden .
" We see it as away of tricking these spawning lampreys , and then you can do things to manipulate their behaviour in ways that would work against them - for example you could lure them into streams without suitable spawning habitat , or just into traps . "
Professor Li's team is now planning a larger experiment , using the pheromone to trap female lampreys in 20 streams feeding into the lakes , which will take three years to complete .

The North - Atlantic nation recently announced that it would again expand its self - assigned yearly quota of fin whales to approximately 150 over the next five years , even tough authorities in the country are perfectly aware of the fact that the culling of whales is expressly prohibited in international treaties .
The move was triggered by the fact that Iceland and Japan recently signed a whale meat import - export deal , with the Atlantic nation supplying the meat , and the Asian country purchasing it .
Japan came to these desperate measures following years in which its whale culling in Antarctic waters was boycotted or sabotaged by activists from Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd , as well as by Australian military patrol vessels .
Following growing international pressure on them , the Japanese are now considering the idea of moving their operations to the northern part of the Pacific , as exposed by a leaked document from the latest International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting .
If that plan fails , then the Asian nation will have nowhere else to turn to for its prized whale meat except to other countries that blatantly disregard the 1982 UN Charter prohibiting worldwide whaling .
Last year , Iceland killed nine highly - endangered fin whales in its waters , but announced that it would seek to kill 150 more each year from now .
Needless to say , this sparked extreme reactions from environmental groups , with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society threatening to move its operations from the Antarctic to the Atlantic , and vowing to ram and sink any whaling ships it comes across .
Over the past years , in the Antarctic , the Japanese have mostly been hunting for Minke whales , which have a lower threat level than their finned counterparts .
So it would stand to reason that they would move their operations to where they are needed most .
If they manage to get their whole fleet back on track , then Sea Shepherd could maybe patrol both areas with a vessel , while keeping one in reserve .
“ We ’re going to say to people around the world to not buy Icelandic vodka , sweaters , and fish , to not go as tourists to Iceland and to not use Iceland as a refueling station for private jets , ” says Paul Watson , the leader of Sea Shepherd , and the captain of its flagship , the Steve Irwin .
A full boycott of Icelandic products is in order , because the state 's economy , in its current state , is unable to take such a devastating blow .
Family trees dating back to 1600 were studied .
A man 's genetic make - up may play a role in whether he has sons or daughters , a study of hundreds of years of family trees suggests .
Newcastle University researchers found men were more likely to have sons if they had more brothers and vice versa if they had more sisters .
They looked at 927 family trees , with details on 556,387 people from North America and Europe , going back to 1600 .
The same link between sibling sex and offspring sex was not found for women .
The precise way that genes can influence baby sex remains unproven .
But the Evolutionary Biology study could clear up a long - standing mystery - a flood of boy babies after World War I .
While a woman will always pass a female " X " chromosome via her egg to her child , the father effectively " decides " the sex of the child by passing on either another " X " in his sperm , making a girl , or a " Y " chromosome , making a boy .
The family tree study showed that whether you 're likely to have a boy or a girl is inherited
Dr Corry Gellatly
Newcastle University
While the birthrate is almost 50 /50 , suggesting that overall men will deliver equal amounts of " X " sperm and " Y " sperm , scientists have suspected that in some individual couples the balance is shifted in favour of either boys or girls .
Various explanations have been put forward for this , ranging from differences in the time in the woman 's monthly cycle that sex happens , to the amount of time that sperm spend waiting in the testicles .
The Newcastle study , by Dr Corry Gellatly , is strong evidence that there is a genetic component .
He found that within families , boys with lots of brothers were more likely to have a higher number of sons themselves and those with lots of sisters were more likely to have lots of daughters .
War babies Dr Gellatly said it was likely that a genetic difference affected the relative numbers of " X " and " Y " sperm within those produced by the man .
This gene , while only active in the man , could be carried by men and women .
" The family tree study showed that whether you 're likely to have a boy or a girl is inherited . "
He said that the effect was to actually balance out the proportion of men and women in the population .
" If there there are too many males in the population , for example , females will more easily find a mate , so men who have more daughters will pass on more of their genes , causing more females to be born in later generations . "
In the years after World War I , there was an upsurge in boy births , and Dr Gellatly said that a genetic shift could explain this .
The odds , he said , would favour fathers with more sons - each carrying the " boy " gene - having a son return from war alive , compared with fathers who had more daughters , who might see their only son killed in action .
However , this would mean that more boys would be fathered in the following generation , he said .

Is George Bush preparing to give himself a presidential pardon ?
On first hearing , the idea sounds utterly incredible and outrageous .
How can the head of a state in which respect for the law remains an active part of the national DNA even contemplate such an arbitrary and shameless act of apparent lawlessness ?
Amnesties and pardons of this kind are the stock - in - trade of tinpot dictators , not constitutional leaders .
And yet ...
A Bush pardon would be a sensational final act to the most divisive presidency in modern America .
But he certainly has the power to grant it .
Article 2 section 2 of the US constitution gives the president the power to grant reprieves and pardons .
The US courts have traditionally interpreted this power widely , to include amnesties , conditional pardons and blanket pardons .
And all presidents have used the power – Harry Truman 's 1,913 pardons is the postwar record .
And these final weeks of a presidency have become , by convention , the pardoning season .
Compared with Truman , Bill Clinton was a light pardoner .
He awarded just 396 of them in his eight years as president .
But as many as 218 of Clinton 's pardons were issued during his final month in office in 2001 – beneficiaries included his brother Roger Clinton and his longtime Arkansas politicial ally Susan MacDougall .
This settling of accounts could be the pattern which Bush is about to follow .
As of now , Bush has issued just 157 presidential pardons in nearly eight years in the White House .
They have covered crimes from the manufacture of untaxed whiskey to the sale of migratory bird parts .
Most of the Bush pardons involve drugs , gambling and frauds .
But Bush has not issued a pardon since March 24 – when the beneficiary was a South Dakota native American called Lonnie Two Eagle who was pardoned for an assault on a reservation .
But in just under seven weeks Bush 's power to pardon will expire .
Not even Richard Nixon pardoned himself .
It fell to his hapless successor Gerald Ford to announce , a month after Nixon 's resignation in August 1974 , that it was time to draw the line .
Nixon had been at the centre of " an American tragedy in which we all have played a part " , Ford announced in a broadcast .
" It could go on and on and on , or someone must write the end to it .
I have concluded that only I can do that , and if I can , I must . "
But can Bush rely on Barack Obama to be so magnanimous ?
And can Obama be relied on to grant the wide - ranging executive pardons to the whole range of Bush administration officials that the outgoing White House may wish to protect ?
Maybe – but no , in the end , I do n't think so either .
Magnanimity is all very well when it comes to your defeated Democratic opponents .
But it is a whole other ballgame when the petitioner is the outgoing president himself .
Be clear that this issue is without question in Bush 's rapidly diminishing intray .
Be clear too that Bush is fully prepared to protect his political allies and hitmen .
He has , after all , made his own stance clear by using his powers to commute Dick Cheney 's chief of staff Lewis Libby 's prison sentence for obstruction of justice in the Valerie Plame affair in 2007 .
So , if the matter is on Bush 's agenda then it is also , in some way , on Obama 's too .
The possibility of a Bush pardon is not a conspiracy theorist 's fantasy .
It is a real and present political possibility – and Americans are beginning to wake up to it .
This week , Human Rights Watch and eight other organisations including the American Civil Liberties Union , Amnesty International , and the Open Society Policy Centre , wrote a public letter urging Bush not to issue a preemptive pardon of past or present officials implicated in torture or other abuses related to the " war on terror " .
The groups pointed out that formal legal investigations into US torture , rendition and other abuses have so far been only patchy – a reflection of the Bush administration 's determination over several years to handle detainees outside the legal process .
There is a very serious possibility that dozens of cases will make their way through the US courts in the coming months and years – and it is therefore possible that hundreds of administration officials will ultimately be forced to answer for their conduct .
I do not know for certain that Bush is considering a comprehensive pre-emptive pardon for officials right through to his own Oval Office .
Nor do I know for certain that the matter has been discussed with the Obama team .
But common sense says these things must be taking place in some form or other .
It says , moreover , that Bush and Obama may have a common interest in such an outcome .
Bush wants it because it protects him and his lieutenants .
Obama may want it too , because he wants a clean slate and does not want to have his presidency blighted by the legal cleaning - up operation that might ensue .
If that analysis is correct , then prepare for an unprecedented act of self - pardon by Bush that extends to dozens – perhaps hundreds – of civilian and military officials .
It would be a stunning challenge to America 's self - image as the upholder of law and freedom in the world .
It would be a lawless outcome to a lawless war .
For Bush , it would be a climactic act of the untramelled presidential authority that he and Cheney have so determinedly forged .
It would send waves of outrage through America and the world .
And yet , for Obama , it might nevertheless be the cleaner outcome .
Troubled times call for ingenious solutions and , from green coal to hydrogen - fuelled ships and the birth of " transumption " , here are some of the brightest .
Lucy Siegle explains the latest ecovations
Prefacing the launch of the fourth Observer Ethical Awards , we 've chosen to highlight 20 of the biggest ethical ideas around at the moment , affording some respite to the prevailing jam - side - down version of life on offer almost everywhere else .
Because while there might be a paucity of cash and unadulterated resources , one thing we have in abundance is ingenuity .
As Nicholas Stern , author of the eponymous Stern Review , puts it : " There are more incentives to invest in energy efficiency during a recession and when oil prices are high . "
From constraints come great innovations …
It would be disingenuous to suggest that there is n't a sense of urgency about all this , as Emma Howard Boyd , head of socially responsible investing at Jupiter Asset Management – sponsors of the Big Idea award , makes clear : " The urgency of what is required to combat issues such as climate change has not diminished as a result of the current financial crisis .
We need big ideas – and it is at times like these , when there is widespread disruption , that we see innovation and new thinking . "
Big ideas need not necessarily be a whistle - and - bells hi-tech response .
At least one of our Big 20 can be described as an " ancient technique " on loan from the Aztecs .
The modern genius lies in its rediscovery and deployment because , while it would be foolish to believe blindly in a silver bullet for all environmental problems , now is absolutely the time for faith in contemporary ingenuity .

1. Biochar
In a nutshell : A way of trapping carbon with " green coal " .
The clever bit :
Any biomass waste – from wood to peanut shells – releases carbon as it decomposes .
But it can be burned in a kiln by pyrolysis ( an airless burning technique ) to create biochar , also known by the soubriquet green coal .
The biochar is then dug back into the ground in order to lock carbon into the soil following a system set out by ancient South American civilisations – which exposes the idea as nothing new .
What is groundbreaking , however , is using it to mitigate our current predicament – ie , runaway greenhouse gas emissions .
According to experts , billions of tonnes of carbon could potentially be sequestered in the world 's soils , specifically from agriculture and forestry residual biomass .
Biochar appears to lock carbon in for much longer than other forms or sequestration : a plant or tree will only sequester for 15 to 20 years , for example , whereas it seems reasonable to suggest that the biochar system will sequester for at least 100 years .
Also , biochar just happens to anchor soil nutrients extremely well at a time when the planet 's soils have lost half of their carbon thanks to industrialised agriculture .

2. Fertilising the ocean
In a nutshell : Dumping iron dust in the ocean to remove carbon .
The clever bit :
It is acknowledged that the oceans are the planet 's biggest global sink , soaking up 2bn tonnes of carbon every year .
Spreading iron dust on ocean waters can in fact trigger huge plankton blooms the size of a small city .
The algae would then absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , and when the algae dies , the whole lot sinks to the bottom of the ocean and is sequestered on the seabed .
Proponents – notably Victor Smetacek , an oceanographer from the University of Bremen – suggest that it would take just five to 10 ocean - going ore carriers to deposit iron sulphate , a waste product from iron and titanium smelters , into the world 's oceans , and that the phytoplankton created would then remove 1 trillion kilograms of CO2 every year .

3. Benign biofuels
In a nutshell : The biofuels it 's OK to like .
The clever bit :
The idea was simple : burn plant - derived biofuels such as maize , sugar and corn in engines , then the CO2 released would be offset by the amount of gas absorbed by the plants when they grew .
It appeared you could drive oil - free on green gold .
Sadly this was a cruel mirage , and when we got close it became clear that the displacement impact of a biofuel boom would lead to the ploughing - up of virgin habitats , giant monocultures , land - rights disputes , and the truly terrible conundrum of whether to feed the world or power the rich world 's private – and expanding – car fleet .
In a dramatic fall from grace , biofuels crashed and burned .
However , proponents of second - generation biofuels say it's not the idea that is at fault , just the choice of biomass .
This time around they advocate using the whole plant and converting waste materials such as cornstalks and leftover sugar - cane fibres into cellulosic ethanol that will then power our lives .
This is reliant on a fledgling process : cracking or splitting cellulose into simple hydrocarbons – in effect breaking down complex chains and liberating sugars .

4. Hydrogen cargo ships
In a nutshell : Emissions - free shipping .
The clever bit :
To produce hydrogen - hybrid boats that could turn global shipping and freight from an emissions juggernaut into a zero-emissions glide across the oceans .
The unlikely vehicle of revolution – which admittedly is some way off a transatlantic sortie right now – is a former British Waterways maintenance vessel , converted by Birmingham University , named the Ross Barlow .
Believed to be the world 's first hydrogen - hybrid canal boat , the Ross Barlow 's system works by storing hydrogen in lithium hydride powder , which can be topped up when it has been exhausted .
It 's clever stuff because researchers have already overcome the two main hydrogen stumbling blocks that have dogged the automotive industry in particular .
First , making hydrogen is one thing ; storing it safely is another issue entirely .
Unlike hydrogen cars , the system on the Ross Barlow barge means that there is no need to carry high - pressure gas or liquid on board – while there has always been a fear that hydrogen cars might , literally , go off like a bomb , the threat of potential explosions has been removed .
And there 's another advantage : in cars , hydrogen has always proved to be too heavy , but the genius of the boat idea is that heavy hydrogen , in the form of lithium hydride powder , does n't matter – ships need ballast .

5. Species relocation
In a nutshell : Giving under - threat species a second home .
The clever bit :
You can see why the plight of the mustang , the romantic symbol of the American west , which is under threat from what has been termed " federal euthanasia " , caught the imagination of conservationists .
The authorities decreed that the 33,000 mustang population roaming free on public lands across the west must be shot down to size ( by losing 6,000 ) .
Critics contend that this is because they are in competition for food resources with cattle ranching .
But the response – to move the mustangs to another part of the country entirely , to a privately funded refuge – has raised a few eyebrows .
In many ways this goes against the grain of conservation practices ( which are usually geared towards making the best of a bad job , as in the installation of conservation corridors for elephants that work around depleted areas or trouble spots ) .
Pragmatists say it 's about cutting your losses and preventing extinction .

6. Radical eco activism
In a nutshell : Green direct action .
The clever bit :
The days of eco radicalism – last seen somewhere around Newbury , some time in 1996 – are back , as signified by climate action group Plane Stupid 's breaching of the perimeter fence at Stansted airport in December , the scaling of the chimney at Kingsnorth power station by six Greenpeace protestors the previous October , and two largescale Camp for Climate Action gatherings .
Grief , fury and rage caused by political indifference and inaction over the rapid decline of the earth 's ecosystems and a seeming permanent get - out - of - jail - free card for the main greenhouse gas emitters has spilled over into direct action .
Meanwhile the September acquittal of the Kingsnorth Six marked a turning point : their defence argument – they were trying to protest against climate change - induced damage on a far greater scale than the £ 30,000 - worth of chimney damage they allegedly caused – set a precedent .

7. Reinstate the drinking fountain
In a nutshell : The rebirth of bottle - free water .
The clever bit : Saying " no " to bottled water – and the 13bn plastic bottles sold in the UK every year ( just 3 bn of which are recycled ) – is catching on but is still hard work .
This begs the question of what happened to all the beautiful fountains , many donated by philanthropists in the 1800s , that were once dotted around civic centres and parks , and when are they coming back ?
Some community groups , such as Warley Woods Community Trust near Birmingham , are already planning a £ 75,000 restoration of the park 's drinking fountain .

8 . The world community grid
In a nutshell : Your computer does ethical stuff in the background .
The clever bit :
The considerable spare capacity of our home computers is used to make lighter work of some of humanity 's most important calculations .
The idea is simple : while you use a fraction of your machine 's capacity to go about mundane stuff , IBM 's World Community Grid runs calculations in the background pertaining to molecular mechanics in order to find the next generation of solar cells for Harvard University .
Alone , it is estimated , it would take Harvard 's department of chemistry and molecular biology computers some 22 years to do the necessary calculations for the Clean Energy Project , but using our spare computer capacity , researchers hope this can be reduced to a matter of two years .
Already nearly half a million users have installed the simple software and signed up ( worldcommunitygrid.org ) to perform calculations that their owners could never understand .

9. Cradle to cradle
In a nutshell : The future of sustainability .
The clever bit : Each year humanity digs up pristine ecosystems to mine and drill for resources .
Less than 1 % of these materials end up embodied in the things we use , whereas half a trillion tonnes of waste is chucked away to rot , pollute or belch out methane .
You would hope there was a less braindead way of proceeding .
There is , it 's called cradle to cradle ( sometimes abbreviated to C2C ) , a holistic design system that models human industry on nature 's processes where there is no waste .
How ?
Well whether you are constructing a running shoe or a brand new Chinese city , C2C dictates that all materials used conform to two types of nutrient classification : technical or biological .
Technical nutrients are benign , non toxic synthetics that can be used in continuous cycles without losing their integrity while biological nutrients are organic materials that decompose into the soil , providing enriching nutrients .
This is design for " all children , all species , for all time , " as US architect , William McDonagh who , along with German chemist Michael Braungart is one of the main C2C proponents , puts it .
Their book , Cradle to Cradle was recently published in the UK and demonstrates contempt for the make - things - less - bad approach of the typical green movement .
Admittedly the revolution is still focused on product design ; to date Chinese construction projects , trainers for Nike , a car , aircraft seats and even nappies – but things are scaling up : the Netherlands government will make all its procurement orders , from cups to cars , C2C by 2012 .

10 . Carrotmobbing
In a nutshell : Do n't boycott – procott instead .
The clever bit : " The problem is that businesses will do anything for money , " says 27 - year - old US environmentalist Brent Schulkin .
" But what if that 's also the solution ? "
In order to find out , Schulkin approached 23 liquor and grocery stores in his San Francisco neighbourhood and asked what percentage of a day 's takings each was prepared to invest in energy - efficiency improvements in return for him organising a " mob " of shoppers to visit the store .
The rather unprepossessing K&D Market won the bidding with 22 % .
Using the internet , Schulkin publicised the scheme , then nervously waited to see if any shoppers would turn up .
They did .
A huge K&D carrotmob spent about $ 9,000 in two hours , breathing life into the old corporate - social - responsibility adage that corporations with values can translate this into cold , hard cash .
Schulkin appears to have hit on a form of activism that could have mass appeal .
Ultimately he wants to create carrotmobs so big that they can negotiate with some of the globe 's biggest corporations .

11 . Ecotarianism
In a nutshell : Counting carbon emissions rather than calories .
The clever bit :
The goal is to change your diet to be low carbon and low impact by choosing foods with the lowest environmental overburden or footprint you can find , with the lowest global - warming potential ( GWP ) and the least chance of messing up the planet via their acidification and pollution potential .
Essentially you 're looking for the foodstuffs with the lowest energy inputs and the greatest efficiencies in production .
For example , forgo meat from ruminants , particularly cows , in favour of pig and poultry that has a lower environmental impact .
As sugar refining uses huge amounts of energy , cut your intake of sweets by 50 % and eat dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate ( which has a big environmental impact ) .
Light bulb rating : 2/5
12 . Zero -waste fashion
In a nutshell : Clothing without the cutoffs .
The clever bit :
That fashion is a profligate business is hardly a revelation , but zero - waste fashion sees no need to conform to a system of excess , instead borrowing from Japanese automotive manufacture , phasing out to minimise ecological impact and maximise profits .
Based in London , eco-aware Central Saint Martins graduate Mark Liu created the Zero Waste range .
Given that fabric widths are standardised , he has calculated that nearly 15 % of fabric is wasted during the pattern - cutting process .
To avoid this he engineers cuts , prints and pattern repeats so that no fabric is wasted .
Light bulb rating : 2/5
13 . Transumption
In a nutshell : Do n't buy stuff – lease it .
The clever bit :
It 's consumerism , but not as we know it , because when transuming you pay for the service rather than the actual product .
Therefore you get the benefits of the product , but you will never own it .
A good example is the Interface Evergreen carpet available to lease by the month ( interface - resource -europe.com ) .
" We sell only the services of the carpet , " says the company website .
" That 's the colour , design , texture , warmth , acoustics , comfort under foot and cleanliness . "
Immediately this takes the environmental heat out of consuming , as the onus is put on the manufacturer to reuse , recycle and to make products that can easily be disassembled and changed – ie , more sustainable products .
Research shows that when the product remains with the manufacturer , there is an incentive to produce more durable goods , as transuming puts the brakes on the shop - to - landfill consumerist cycle .
The first buds of this trend are strongly in evidence with the Rent Not Buy movement .
Begun in Anchorage , Alaska by particle and nuclear physisicists Mr and Mrs Caius Howcroft , there is now a flourishing UK chapter ( rentnotbuy.co.uk ) .
Light bulb rating : 4/5
14 . Rehome a mutt
In a nutshell : Crossbred dogs win best in show .
The clever bit : Last August the BBC documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed suggested that Crufts , the annual jamboree celebrating canines from an ever - decreasing gene pool , in effect promoted health problems in dogs .
While it was suggested that the Kennel Club get its house in order , Pedigree pet foods dropped its sponsorship of Crufts and the BBC chopped it from the schedule .
This is in step with global trends .
When Barack Obama promised his daughters a new puppy when they moved into the White House , Ingrid Newkirk , president of Peta , did n't miss a beat .
" Senator , no one needs to tell you that this country is proud to be a melting pot and that there is something deeply wrong about wanting only a purebred dog .
Millions of Great American Mutts – the dog that should be our national dog – are set to die in our nation 's overcrowded pounds and shelters for lack of good homes .
When you are ready , please adopt a homeless pound puppy . "

15 . Backyard sufficiency
In a nutshell : Treating your garden as a source of protein .
The clever bit : Also known as Micro Eco Farming , backyard sufficiency is about exploiting small ( and often unpromising ) plots of urban land until they yield a bumper harvest .
It uses techniques such as vertical horticulture and hydroponics to grow upwards and more intensively .
Using pesticides is not an option , so it is by definition organic .
Some techniques are low tech and based on the selection of hardy and adaptable crops , such as planting mushroom beds ; others are still works in progress , such as growing your own fish .
At Aquavision in Devon ( aquavisiononline.com ) , the UK 's first organic carp farm , sustainable aquaculture specialist Jimmie Hepburn is busy developing small carp ponds to demonstrate that backyard carp growing for the table is possible .
Light bulb rating : 3/5
16 . Hypermilling
In a nutshell : Ultra economical driving .
The clever bit : Hypermilers do n't just aim for good mileage , as eco drivers do – they push fuel efficiency to the limit .
Some hypermiling tips are just common sense : the correct tyre pressure on your car can chop 10 % from your petrol ; decreasing your speed from 75 mph to 65 mph increases fuel economy , and idling the engine is out – it increases emissions by 13 % ( go to eta.co.uk for more ideas ) .
Other hypermiling absolutes might seem a little more out there , such as driving in soft soles , dispensing with footwear in order to increase pedal sensitivity ( to prevent fuel loss ) or ridge riding , aka driving with your tyres aligned with the line at the edge of the road to avoid driving through water .
Light bulb rating : 2/5
17 . Strategic organics
In a nutshell : Organic pick 'n'mix .
The clever bit : Organic production has lots of eco merits , but the thing that made organics the darling of the shopping trolley was the fact that their production ruled out pesticides .
But however skewed the economics ( critics contend that conventionally produced food does not reflect its true environmental cost ) , organic produce still attracts a premium .
Strategic organic is therefore about prioritising which items need to be organic , and which non-organic ( and therefore cheaper ) products you can get away with .
The bible of Strategic Organic , the US Environmental Working Group report published in October 2008 , ranks fruits and vegetables by the amount of pesticides found on each and is based on testing 43,000 products .
The 12 types of non-organic produce to be avoided ( the " dirty dozen " ) : peaches are the " dirtiest " , followed by apples , sweet bell peppers , celery , nectarines , strawberries , cherries , lettuce , imported grapes , pears , spinach and potatoes .
Meanwhile vegetables such as broccoli , asparagus and onions have relatively low levels – so you can get away with non-organic versions .
They are the " cleanest " foods , along with avocados , pineapples , mangos , frozen sweetcorn , frozen peas , asparagus , kiwis , bananas and cabbage .
Light bulb rating : 2/5
18 . The slow wardrobe
In a nutshell : Dump the concept of " McFashion " , rather than the actual garments .
The clever bit :
How big is your fashion footprint ?
From 2003 to 2007 , garment prices fell by an average of 10 % , and over the past five years the rate of frenzied buying has accelerated .
We make room for the new by discarding some 2 m tonnes of the old every year , which goes into landfill .
The slow wardrobe extends the useful lifespan of the threads already hanging in the national wardrobe while redistributing stockpiled fashion to those who will wear it , with the aim of decreasing today 's average annual consumption of 35kg of clothing per person to a more sustainable 7kg .
Consumers prioritise longevity by buying trans - seasonal garments ( such as a classic jacket ) rather than pure fashion and by purchasing as far up the material food chain as they can afford .
We also learn to wash and dry clean more sparingly ( both decrease lifespans of clothes ) and to use specialist services to refashion and / or mend older garments ( just 2 % of the annual fashion budget goes on mending or servicing clothes , so this needs to be increased ) .
Meanwhile a 2008 YouGov poll found that there are an amazing 2.4bn pieces of clothing unworn for an entire 12 months ( many possibly brand new ) cluttering up the national wardrobe , which adds up to £ 10 bn - worth of stockpiled fashion .
This needs to be redistributed via a system of clothes swap parties and targeted donations before it is chucked in landfill .
Light bulb rating : 3.5/5
19 . Precycling
In a nutshell :
The bottom has fallen out of the recycling market , so make it your last resort .
The clever bit : Precycling represents the stage before recycling and , unlike recycling , it expends little energy .
Precycling happens at the point of purchase , and entails you choosing the product that comes in the least packaging ( therefore diverting waste from landfill ) or bringing along your own container or bag .
Instead of buying packaged sandwiches , for example , take a lunchbox to work , along with cloth napkins and a reusable water bottle .
Light bulb rating : 4/5
20 . Ethical texting
In a nutshell : The end of eco-supermarket dilemmas .
The clever bit :
Fish stocks are in famously poor health – only 10 % of the top predator species , such as tuna , that swam the world 's oceans when industrial fishing began 70 years ago are believed to be left .
All of which makes shopping for the right fish problematic .
American consumers now have the answer to sustainable fish shopping at their fingertips , as the Fish Phone text service spares them from carting around a copy of Bottomfeeder : How to Eat Ethically in a World of Vanishing Seafood by Taras Grescoe – instead they text the designated number .
The Blue Ocean Institute monitors 90 seafood species for up - to - the - minute sustainability ratings and will text back either a safe code " green " or a danger code " red " , such as for farmed salmon , along with the health advisory warning that indicates the possible presence of PCBs , dioxins and pesticides .

The Death of Tom Hurndall
Tom Hurndall was in a coma for nine months after being shot in the head by an Israeli sniper .
He died January 13 , 2004 .
It is with great sadness that If Americans Knew shares with you the news of the passing away of Tom Hurndall .
Tom , 22 , died Tuesday night in a London hospital due to complications with pneumonia .
He had spent the past nine months in a vegetative state after being shot in the head by an Israeli sniper on April 11 , 2003 , while trying to escort children to safety in Rafah , Gaza Strip , Occupied Palestine .
Tom was a member of the International Solidarity Movement , a Palestinian - led effort to bring internationals to the Occupied Palestinian Territories to aid the civilian population in non-violent resistance to the occupation .
At a hearing on Monday , a soldier arrested last week in connection with the shooting of Tom Hurndall , has finally been indicted on six charges : Aggravated Assault ; two counts of Obstruction of Justice ; Incitement to False Testimony ; False Testimony ; and Improper Conduct .
A second soldier has been detained and is expected to be indicted on charges of Obstructing Justice and False Testimony .
As we grieve the death of Tom , let us not forget the ongoing catastrophic situation in Palestine that he was working to end .
In fact , since he was shot , 6,761 Palestinians have been murdered and 47,463 have been injured ( as of January 2015 ) .
As Tom ’s mother , Jocelyn , wrote recently in the UK Guardian , “ It seems that life is cheap in the occupied territories .
Different value attached to life depends on whether the victim happens to be Israeli , international or Palestinian . ”
We ask that you write letters to the editor of your local newspaper regarding this incident .
If your paper covered it , please thank them and ask them to report more on the plight of the Palestinian people .
If your paper did not cover it , admonish them for it and demand to know why they consider Tom ’s life , like so many in Palestine , unworthy of mention in their pages .
Remember , as always , polite , concise , and to - the - point letters are more likely to be published .
For more information regarding Tom , please visit http://www.tomhurndall.co.uk/.
We also encourage you to share this powerful documentary filmed in Gaza that covers the shooting of Tom Hurndall , the killing of filmmaker James Miller , and the events that took place after Rachel Corrie was crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer .

Well I know my reaction is definitely to be scared to death , as Cowboy Bebop is one of my top favorite anime series .
A lot of people have had the same reaction , and it looks like people in Japan are n't any different .
AnimeVice has put together some of the responses from their 2ch message board and here is what some people have said on the matter :
" Is Keanu Reeves going to grow shaggy hair ? "
" I 've come to the conclusion that [ making a Bebop film ] is unnecessary and impossible . "
" I wonder if the famously short - legged Keanu can play the role of Spike ? "
" My only worry is Ed . " " But Keanu doing it will be fun ... "
" The question is , who will play Ed ? " " I wonder if Ein will appear ? "
" I think the anime movie is better . "
" Please do n't turn Spike into a modern high school student LOL " " The Japanese staff is involved ?
And instead of C - grade actors they got Keanu ?
This could really boost the image of Japanese animation ! "
As you can see there 's a lot of worry , but at least a bit of the response is positive , though there are still a lot of questions to be answered .
My main questions are if Keanu 's playing Spike , who the heck is playing Jet , Faye and Ed ?
At least they can't screw up Ein unless they somehow forget he 's a Corgi .

If you 've avoided reading my personal twitter for the past year because you really are n't interested in baby pictures , quirky personal philosophies , old - school piro - whining or links to the unusual and sometimes interesting things that tend to snag my moth - like attention span , then you probably have missed what I 've been up to over at the MegaGear store .
Some of it is actually kind of interesting because it reflects an interesting shift in our " business model " that we 're hoping helps us serve our customers ( you ) better .
Since most of you are n't likely to engage in promotional forensics to learn what those changes are and what we are now offering , I really should write something about it ... especially since i need all of you to go buy some of it :)
[ In case you are balking at the amount of text below , here 's a quick summary :
All of our new shirts are full color , 100 % cotton Direct to Garment shirts that we print ourselves .
We are offering a number of new designs as well as some old favorites we have n't offered for a while .
We are also offering 11 " x 14 " fine art prints of pretty much any Megatokyo comic you want as well as the Broken Miho drawing .
We are also running a big sale where most products ( including new ones ) are on sale .
On top of this sale price , you can take an extra 10 % off the sale price on shirts and hoodies if you use coupon code " G34R " when you order ( Good through December 12th ) .
Also , Megatokyo posters are $ 12.50 each or two for $ 22 , and Megatokyo button sets are two for $ 10 . ]
Now for the long version .
One of the core philosophies behind MegaGear is that we like to make and sell stuff we might want ourselves .
That 's been a little difficult to do with t- shirts because the color limitations of screen printing have prevented us from offering the detailed , full color shirts we 've wanted .
That situation changed earlier this year when we acquired the other new ' baby ' in our family , a Direct to Garment printer .
A DTG Printer is basically just a big inkjet printer that has been heavily modified to print directly on t- shirts .
The technology has been around for a while but has evolved over the past few years to the point that it has become a viable production choice .
The main advantages to DTG printing is that you can print full color images on normal , 100 % cotton t- shirts , including dark / black shirts .
The detail and quality of the output is actually pretty impressive .
There was a bit of a learning curve ( let 's not talk about head alignment , shall we ? ) , but a few months ago we felt we were ready to start offering the shirts in our store .
Testing included multiple washes to test the durability the shirts which by their very nature they are not quite as durable as screen printing inks over the long term .
They will stand up just fine if you take reasonably good care of them .
I 've been wearing and watching a number of shirts for several months now and they are holding up well .
[ Care note : just like screenprinted shirts , you should turn them inside out when washing them and use the gentle cycle if you want any shirt to last a long time .
Note that * I * am not doing this , because i am testing them to worst case washing conditions :P ]
The other advantage to DTG printing is that all shirts are printed on demand , which means i can experiment with shirt designs without having to worry about having a big inventory of shirts no one wants if the design is a real dud ( This is liberating , trust me ) .
Another advantage is i can print designs on tshirts , ladies t's , hoodies , etc .
This means that we can offer many of our designs in both ladies t's and hoodies which is something we could not really do before .
In the store you 'll find some new shirts that take advantage of this full color printing , like the recent Ph33r t3h Cute Ones design and the new Piroko Spellcasting design .
It 's also enabled me to bring back some Megatokyo designs we have n't offered for a while , like 3V1l Minion and Kimiko Idol .
The printer has no problem with solid color graphics , like the long awaited OB3Y design ( it took me forever to come up with a graphic i liked , but i'm really happy with the final output ) .
There are also a number of light colored shirts like Broken Miho and Bunnies and Kitties which i can print much larger on the bigger sized shirts .
There 's a pretty decent variety of new designs in the store , including a new , alternate Megatokyo logo and even a print of the classic 4 panel MT comic " B4K4 Quake " .
Check out what we have to offer , and if you like one , i'll print it for you . :)
Another product I put a lot of research into also involves a high end inkjet printer : Fine Art prints .
It 's actually rather amazing to see the quality output these printers are capable of producing these days .
Since there is a lot of detail i draw that most of you never get to see ( because of the limitations of web resolution or the print size of the books )
I 've always wanted to offer fine art prints so people might see it .
Since my work is generally pencil and greyscale , it was important to find a printer that could accurately print subtle pencil work .
After much research I finally chose the HP B9180 which is a pigment - based ink printer and Moab Entrada Rag Bright 190 Fine Art Paper .
Note that both paper and inks are archival , with the HP Vivera inks being tested to be fade resistant for up to 200 years .
Our first Fine Art Print offerings in the MegaGear store are prints of any Megatokyo comic you wish ( with a few limitations ) , printed , signed , dated and slipped into an archival plastic sleeve with an acid free backer board .
I 'm also offering a print of the updated version of the original Broken Miho drawing i did back in 2002 , also signed and dated .
More to come as i work on making availible some of my COPIC colored works .
Normally , that 'd be more than enough promotion , but ... hey , it 's the holidays , and we want to give you lots of incentive to buy stuff from us . :)
Most products in the store ( including new ones ) are on sale !
For example , most $ 22 t- shirts are on sale for $ 20 , $ 20 t- shirts for $ 18 , etc .
Also , be sure to check out our Clearance section where we are closing out some of the older designs
On top of the sale price , you can take an extra 10 % off the sale price on shirts and hoodies if you use coupon code " G34R " when you order ( Good through December 12th ) .
Also , All Megatokyo posters are $ 12.50 each or two for $ 22 , and Megatokyo button sets are on sale two for $ 10 .
So , in short , the shift in our " business model " is that we are now printing most of our own t- shirts , Dye - sub mugs , license plates and coasters , and now our own fine art prints .
When you buy stuff from the MegaGear store , you are not only supporting the comic , but you are getting stuff we produce ourselves .
Stuff we pack and ship ourselves .
It 's the way we like it .
Hopefully you will find something you like .
Thank's for shopping with MegaGear and supporting Megatokyo .
Jack appreciates your support :)
Ok , that 's enough of that .
Right now , it 's snowing outside my window , i have a little something i'm trying to finish for Applegeeks , and then it's back to work on the Megatokyo comic .
Thank you , as always , for your support .

Teens ' abstinence pledges found not to work
Teenagers who pledge to remain virgins until marriage are just as likely to have premarital sex as those who do not promise abstinence and are significantly less likely to use condoms and other forms of birth control when they do , according to a study being released today .
The new analysis of data from a large federal survey found that more than half of youths became sexually active before marriage regardless of whether they had taken a " virginity pledge , " but that the percentage who took precautions against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases was 10 points lower for pledgers than for nonpledgers .
" Taking a pledge does n't seem to make any difference at all in any sexual behavior , " said Janet Rosenbaum of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , whose report appears in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics .
" But it does seem to make a difference in condom use and other forms of birth control that is quite striking . "
The study is the latest to raise questions about programs that focus on encouraging abstinence until marriage .
The findings also reignite the debate about the effectiveness of abstinence - focused sexual education just as lawmakers are about to reconsider the more than $ 176 million in annual funding for such programs .
Rosenbaum analyzed data collected by the federal government 's National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , which gathered detailed information from a representative sample of about 11,000 students in grades seven through 12 in 1995 , 1996 and 2001 .
Rosenbaum focused on about 3,400 students who had not had sex or taken a virginity pledge in 1995 .
She compared 289 students who were 17 years old on average in 1996 , when they took a virginity pledge , with 645 who did not take a pledge but were otherwise similar .
She based that judgment on about 100 variables , including their attitudes and their parents ' attitudes about sex and their perception of their friends ' attitudes about sex and birth control .
By 2001 , Rosenbaum found , 82 percent of those who had taken a pledge had retracted their promises , and there was no significant difference in the proportion of students in both groups who had engaged in any type of sexual activity , including giving or receiving oral sex , vaginal intercourse , the age at which they first had sex , or their number of sexual partners .
The Minnesota Constitution protects our right to have an abortion and the decision to have one .
But most Minnesotans are not aware of how their rights are currently restricted and what access to abortion care looks like in our state .
Since 1995 , lawmakers in Minnesota have proposed nearly 400 new laws restricting abortion access , intimidating providers , misleading patients , and increasing costs .
Deciding whether or when to become a parent is about freedom and control over our lives at our most basic level : our bodies , our families , our life ’s path .
OUR JUSTICE is proud to be A PLAINTIFF IN THE DOE V. MINNESOTA TO REMOVE MINNESOTA’S ABORTION RESTRICTIONS .

Peter ConnerFriday 9 Jan 2009 09.17 amDavid ThorneR 1200 GSHello David , Thankyou for your recent enquiry regarding pricing of the R 1200 GS Motorcycle .
We do not accept household furniture as trade ins on vehicles and would reccomend you sell them privately .
The R 1200 GS has a list price of $ 25,470 .
Please note that this excludes Dealer delivery and ORC and is GST inclusive .
I welcome you to contact me personally to arrange a test ride at a time that would suit you .
Sincerely , Peter ConnerDavid ThorneFriday 9 Jan 2009 10.03 amPeter ConnerRe : R 1200 GSDear Peter , Thank you for responding to the online request I filled out several months ago and your kind offer to allow me to test ride the product before paying what is essentially five times the value of my car .
If you could confirm for me that the model is available in desert yellow , I would be very interested .
Regards , David .
Peter ConnerFriday 9 Jan 2009 10.22 amDavid ThorneR 1200 GS colours availableHello David , Yes the R 1200 GS is available in desert yellow .
We have a desert yellow demo model on the showroom floor at the moment if you would like to come in to view and arrange a test ride at that time .
Sincerely , Peter ConnerDavid ThorneFriday 9 Jan 2009 10.48 amPeter ConnerRe : R 1200 GS colours availableDear Peter , I have just been informed that bees are attracted to yellow vehicles .
Apparently a few years back , a guy I know purchased a bright yellow convertible and was unable to drive it with the top down due to constantly being surrounded by bees .
Do you know if this is a science fact ?
I am allergic to bees and the last thing I want is to be stung in the eye while I am doing 240 kph on the freeway during the test ride .
Also , do you know if there are airtight motorcycle helmets available ?
Regards , David .
Peter ConnerFriday 9 Jan 2009 11.09 amDavid ThorneRe : Re : R 1200 GS colours availableHello David , You would be required to follow state speed restrictions of 100 kph on the Eastern Freeway during a test ride and would reccomend lower speeds than that until you have familiarised yourself with the bike .
We would generally not expect people to take the demo bike on the freeway but we can discuss when you come in .
I have never heard that about bees liking yellow vehicles and would think it is not true .
The R 1200 GS is available in granite , black and red in addition to the yellow .
Would you like to come in today and discus ?
Sincerely , Peter ConnerDavid ThorneFriday 9 Jan 2009 02.50 pmPeter ConnerRe : Re : Re : R 1200 GS colours availableDear Peter , I have been researching bees on the internet for the last four hours at work .
When I type " Do bees like yellow " into google , it states that there are 2,960,000 results .
It will take me a while to look at that many pages so I doubt I will make it in there today .
One of the pages states that Qantas once had a yellow kangaroo as their logo but when it was painted on the tail fin it attracted nests of bees so the logo was changed to red in the mid fifties .
This would seem to support the argument that bees are indeed attracted to yellow and contradicts what you have told me .
Admittedly though , another page states that bees are technically unable to fly due to their wings being too small for their body weight but I have seen them doing it so this can't be true - somebody should check the internet and make sure everything on there is correct .
Regardless , I do not think having to dodge bees in addition to the already present dangers of learning to ride a motorbike for the first time would be very safe .
Once when I was a passenger in a yellow taxi , a bee flew in and I screamed causing the driver to swerve and hit a wheelie bin .
I will continue my research and confirm that this would not be a factor before I arrange the test ride .
Regards , David .
Peter ConnerFriday 9 Jan 2009 03.18 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Re : R 1200 GS colours availableWhen you say you are learning to ride a motorcycle , do you hold a current full motorcycle license ?
Sincerely , Peter ConnerDavid ThorneFriday 9 Jan 2009 03.40 pmPeter ConnerRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : R 1200 GS colours availableDear Peter , No , but how hard can it be ?
They are just pushbikes with engines .
Part of my daily job role is to ride to collect co-workers lunch orders from McDonalds .
I balance the bags on my handlebars because they will not buy me a basket .
I think that qualifies me for something .
Often , I have to make the trip twice when McDonalds ® employees leave something out of the order .
Actually , on average , every third time I go through the drive through they forget to include part of my order .
Also the girls who work there are too attractive .
This means that if I want something from my local McDonalds ® late at night , I have to shower , shave and wear something nice before I can get a simple snack .
As it takes me at least two hours to do my hair , I am practically starving by this time and therefore order twice as much food as usual .
Ordering more food increases the chance of them leaving something out .
Last night it was an apple pie and that is really the only thing I like from there .
It is quite obvious to me that they do this on purpose
Once , I ordered two big macs , minus the beef , large fries and an apple pie .
When I got home and opened the bag , there were two happy meals in there .
The toy in each was a Kim Possible figurine which worked out well as I gave one to my son and kept one myself .
For a cartoon character , you have to admit that Kim Possible is quite attractive .
I also have a thing for Lois from the television series Family Guy so I must have a penchant for cartoon redheads which is vaguely puzzling to me as I cannot stand redheads in real life .
Nobody can .
I read somewhere that redheads are more prone to allergies and if this is a science fact , and includes allergies to bee stings , all redheads should be encouraged to wear bright yellow T - Shirts .

T HE H ISTORICAL D EVELOPMENT
OF THE V ACUUM C OFFEE P OT
Copyright © 2001 - 200 7 Brian Harris - All Rights Reserved
European Origins
C offee first became widely available in Europe around the middle of the seventeenth century , as a result of the expansion of the international shipping trade .
The earliest coffee brewing methods involved boiling the coffee together with water , with the optional step of filtering out the grounds .
This resulted in a overly bitter and unpalatable beverage , which generally fell out of favor until the advent of the Infusion brewing process in France about 1710 .
This process involved submersing the ground coffee , usually enclosed in a linen bag , in hot water and letting it steep or " infuse " until the desired strength brew was achieved .
In this era , the " coffee pot " was a metal vessel used primarily as a means of dispensing the brewed coffee , either via a spout or by one or more spigots jutting from the body of the vessel .
T hroughout the eighteenth century , coffee culture and technology continued to evolve .
More complex methods of separating the grounds from the brew were developed - some involving ingenious screw mechanisms and collapsible bags .
This era also saw the evolution of ever more elaborate urns for dispensing the coffee , including some that dispensed coffee from an inner chamber and hot water from an outer jacket , which also served to keep the coffee warm .
Indeed many innovations of the era were designed to keep the coffee hot either by employing an insulating jacket of water or air surrounding the pot , or a spirit lamp located in the base ( or both ) .
I t was about this time in Europe that the notion that coffee should never be boiled was gaining acceptance .
One of the primary advocates of this idea was Jean Baptiste de Belloy , Archbishop of Paris , who favored the French Drip Pot .
In this method of brewing coffee , two chambers are stacked one upon the other , with a cloth filter placed in between .
Finely ground coffee is packed into the upper chamber and boiling water is poured over it .
As the coffee brews , it slowly drips into the lower chamber , from which it is served .
Again , the slowness of the brewing process often leads to a tepid cup , but the innovative minds of the era were soon at work on the problem .
The American scientist and adventurer Benjamin Thompson ( Count Rumford ) , invented a drip pot with an insulating water jacket , and added his voice to those promoting coffee without boiling in his essay , " Excellent Qualities of Coffee and the Art of Making it in the Highest Perfection . "
Palmer 's 1786 patented
coffee urn with spirit lamp ,
hot water jacket , and
dual spigots .

French Drip Pot .
B y the beginning of the nineteenth century , all the elements were in place for the development of the glass vacuum pot .
Amateur scientists were busy experimenting with vacuums , vapor pressure , and fluid dynamics ; efficient coal - fired furnaces vastly increased the availability of affordable glassware ; and coffee making had become a very fashionable and profitable enterprise .
While spirit lamps had been used previously to keep coffee warm in an urn , now the heat was harnessed to drive the brewing process itself .
This concept was first employed in the early filtering percolators of the 1820s , where heat and vapor pressure forced water into the upper chamber of a metal drip pot .
But now that concept was expanded and made visible by the transparency of glass .
Augmented by the action of the vacuum , which initiated the second stage of the brewing process , the result was an elegantly simple system which produced an excellent cup of coffee .
T he earliest glass vacuum pots appear to have been in use in Germany by the 1830s , as witnessed by a patent filed in France by Mme. Jeanne Richard in 1838 .
This patent shows a design which which referenced an existing vacuum pot by Loeff of Berlin .
The popularity of the vacuum coffee pot spread quickly from Germany to other parts of Europe , as evidenced by patents filed by Louis François Boulanger in France ( 1835 ) and Mority Platow and James Vardy in England ( 1839 ) .
It was about this time that there was an explosion of patent filings for a variety of " improvements " to the glass vacuum pot , chief among them being those of Madame Vassieux of Lyons .
Her 1841 design consisted of a double - globe assembly , with a spigot in the lower globe to dispense the coffee , and a decorative , pierced - metal crown at the top .
This French Balloon design is virtually indistinguishable from the early Silex and Cona models of a half century later .
The decorative touches reflect the fact that coffee brewing had moved out of the kitchen and into the dining room , where the new glass coffee brewers bestowed prestige upon the hostess , and provided entertainment to her guests .
Madame Vassieux 's " Glass
Balloon " design patented
in France in 1841 .
H owever , these new glass coffee brewers were not without their drawbacks .
The glass of the era was nothing like the heatproof glass of the twentieth century , and was prone to failure .
Besides their obvious fragility , if the pressure was too great , they tended to explode .
And if the hostess was inattentive and the spirit lamp was left burning after the water had left the lower globe , the glass would overheat and crack .
It was to address this latter problem that many patented improvements were filed .
Various mechanisms ( including one that is rather reminiscent of the flush mechanism of a modern lavatory ) were designed to extinguish the lamp at the appropriate moment .
Boulanger 's 1835 patent .
The first French glass
coffee maker .
Fortant 's patent design
with a self - extinguishing
flame mechanism .
Malpeyre 's 1841 patent
with a detachable handle
built into the stand .
B y 1850 the double - globe glass coffee maker had generally fallen out of favor in France , and the fashionable Parisian s embraced the next incarnation of the vacuum brewer - the Balancing Siphon .
In this arrangement , the two vessels are arranged side - by - side , with a siphon tube connecting the two .
Coffee is placed in one side ( usually glass ) , and water in the other ( usually ceramic ) .
A spirit lamp heats the water , forcing it through the tube and into the other vessel , where it mixes with the coffee .
As the water is transferred from one vessel to the other , a balancing system based on a counterweight or spring mechanism is activated by the change in weight .
This in turn triggers the extinguishing of the lamp .
A partial vacuum is formed , which siphons the brewed coffee through a filter and back into the first vessel , from which is dispensed by means of a spigot .
Sometimes called a Viennese Siphon Machine or a Gabet , after Louis Gabet , whose 1844 patent included his very successful counterweight mechanism , the Balancing Siphon was both safer than the French Balloon , and was completely automatic .
Turmel 's 1853 patent for
a Balancing Siphon
coffee brewer .
A coffee brewing system very similar to the Balancing Siphon , but which appears to have developed independently was the brainchild of Scottish naval engineer and inventor , James Napier .
Developed in the 1840s , Napiers prototype coffee maker was composed of standard laboratory equipment , giving it a rather clinical look .
The layout is nearly identical to that of the Balancing Siphon , except that there is no balancing mechanism to extinguish the lamp , and the brewing process was subtly different .
Ground coffee and boiling water were combined in the jar , and only a small amount of water was placed in the globe .
The water in the globe was heated by a spirit heater creating a small amount of steam which was forced through the siphon tube to agitate the coffee and water mixture in the jar .
When the flame was extinguished , a vacuum formed which siphoned the brewed coffee though a filter and back into the globe , from which it was served .
The Napierian brewer was much preferred in England , and stunningly beautiful silver - plated versions continued to be made into the early part of the twentieth century .
Roberton 's 1890 patent
for an improved Napierian
brewer with a spigot added
to the glass globe .
American Vacuum Brewers
I n 1894 , the House Furnishing Review reported the arrival in America of a new patented English coffee machine , composed of a " glass globe or boiler which hangs by means of trunnions from an ornamental stand , the base of which is a spirit lamp .
A funnel - shaped vessel , terminating in a long glass tube , the junction being surrounded with a cork fitting the mouth of the boiler , forms the remaining portion of the appliance . "
This " new " machine was obviously a revival of Mme Vassieuxs 1841 French Balloon .
W hen the glass vacuum pot was re-introduced in the early part of the twentieth century , it was accepted as a new and unique American invention , despite its long history in Europe .
Interestingly , most modern writers who do acknowledge the vacuum coffee brewers European antecedents usually associated it with James Napiers side - by - side siphon brewer rather than with its true forebears , the French designs of Vassieux , Fortant , and the like .
But the vacuum brewer was already known in America as early as 1859 .
A number of early patents describe metal pots which employed the vacuum principle to brew coffee , including that of William Edson of Boston , Massachusetts , who , in 1866 , patented his inexpensive and easily - constructed " Improved Coffee - Pot " :
The spirit of my invention consists in making a coffee - pot with a single diaphragm being provided with pipe P , the whole being arranged , in combination with the closed pouring - spout B , that when the water in the lower chamber boils it shall be forced , by its own steam , into the upper chamber S , and that when the whole begins to cool a vacuum shall be formed in the lower chamber , and forcibly draw back through the pipe P the liquid coffee from the upper chamber , S , leaving the grounds upon the strainer F .
I am aware that this same object has been completely accomplished by a French invention , ( see Veyrons Brevet dInvention , ) called the " vacuum coffee - pot ; " but the arrangement is complicated and expensive I do not think there has heretofore been invented a coffee - pot in which the complete operation is secured by means so simple as mine .
Early Silex Vacuum Brewer ,
nearly identical to the
French Balloons of the 1840's .
Edson's 1866
" Improved Coffee - Pot " I n 1868 , Julius Petsch of Hanover , Prussia , and Stephen Buynitzky of St. Petersburg , Russia , jointly filed a U.S. patent for an ingenious vacuum brewer consisting of an integrated pot with internal upper and lower chambers , suspended by trunnions from a stand over a spirit heater .
Due to the asymmetrical shapes of the two chambers , when the water rises to the upper chamber , the pot becomes unbalanced and tips to the side .
This process extinguishes the heater , and when the vacuum pulls the brewed coffee back into the lower chamber , the pot swings back to vertical , simultaneously tripping a small hammer which then strikes a bell to indicate that the coffee is ready .
I n 1866 and again in 1887 , patents were filed for side - by - side Balancing Siphon pots which were virtually identical to Gabets 1844 design , including his patented counterweight mechanism .

Machine for Infusing Coffee T he first stacked vacuum coffee pot design patented in America of which a significant component was composed of glass , was James Van Marters 1898 design consisting of a lower metal chamber surmounted by a cylindrical glass upper chamber .
An airtight seal was formed between the two chambers by wrapping the roughened surfaces with linen tape .
By brewing the coffee in the closed upper chamber , Van Marter assures us that his apparatus will achieve " the thorough extraction of all the desirable elements [ of the coffee - berry ] without any loss of the volatile aromatic portions thereof . "
Again , this design was not totally new , and indeed appears to be a copy of the Repalier - style vacuum pots popular in Europe in the 1850's .
Van Marter 's 1898
Metal & Glass Coffee Apparatus
A recognizable double - glass vacuum pot does not appear in the patent records until 1914 - a " Coffee Percolator " designed by Albert Cohn of London .
This design is clearly the direct descendent of Mme Vassieuxs French Balloon .
That year also saw the design of an early Silex vacuum brewer designed by Gerhard Behrend of New York .
A flurry of similar design patents were filed in the subsequent few years , all consisting of upper and lower glass vessels fitted together with a flexible stopper , some type of filter assembly , and a base to support the brewer over a spirit lamp .
Because the glass vessels of this era were hand - blown , they each varied somewhat in size and shape .
As a result , many early patents pertain to the design of handles , stands , and rubber seals that could adapt to these variations .
A number of double - glass balloon vacuum pots appeared in the patents with imaginatively designed support stands .

I n 1915 , a vacuum coffee maker was made from Pyrex , the Corning Glass Works newly introduced ovenproof glass , and was marketed under the name " Silex . "
The name reportedly derives from the phrase , " S anitary and I nteresting method of making L uscious coffee .
It is E asy to operate on account of its being X - ray transparent . "
The rights to the design had been acquired in 1909 by two sisters , Mrs. Ann Bridges and Mrs. Sutton , of Salem , Massachusetts who had it manufactured by the Frank E. Wolcott Manufacturing Company .
With the availability of heatproof Pyrex glass , the Silex brewers did not suffer the same drawbacks as their French predecessors , and a new era of vacuum brewing was launched .
By a fortuitous turn of events , a large number of these Silex brewers were sold to hotels and sandwich shops , providing large - scale exposure for the product .
As a result , today the name Silex is almost synonymous with any glass vacuum pot .
A key patent in the development of the popular Silex line would appear to that of George Loggie of Lexington , Massachusetts .
His 1917 design is identical to the earliest Silex models , and was assigned to one Hazel M. Bridges , who later filed the first patent on behalf of the Silex Company of Hartford , Connecticut .
Mrs. Bridges patent was filed in 1926 and described a " novel and improved drainer for use in connection with the well known  Silex type of coffee percolators , " which employed a spring tensioning clip to secure the filter in place .
Her patent drawings show a freestanding vacuum pot sitting atop an electric stove .
Throughout the 1930s , Frank Wolcott and others registered a series of patents for improved vacuum brewers which illustrates the progression of vacuum pot designs marketed by the Silex Company .
At the 1939 New York Worlds Fair , the Silex Companys exhibit was dominated by a seven - foot replica of a Silex glass coffee maker in operation .

T he main competitor to the Silex coffee makers was Harvey Cory 's Glass Coffee Brewer Corporation of Chicago , Illinois .
The first patent filed by Harvey Cory for a vacuum coffee brewer was in 1933 , and was quickly followed by a series of new designs , many of which focused on peripheral design elements of the brewers - handles , covers , filters , and so forth .
His 1934 patent illustrates both the " Fast - Flo " filter which shipped with many early Cory brewers , as well as an alternate design which showed up later on vacuum pots sold by General Electric .
It is interesting to note that what is arguably the most significant innovation ascribed to Cory , namely the glass filter rod , was not invented by Harvey Cory himself , but by Raymond Kell of the MacBeth Evans Glass Company in 1932 .
The familiar Cory design was patented in 1939 , while the similar Silex " Lox - In " glass filter was not submitted for patent until 1946 .

T he major innovations of the 1930s were in the electrification and automation of the vacuum brewing process .
A number of electric stove designs were patented by the Silex Company , including both commercial and domestic models , one of which included a special stabilizing mechanism designed to keep the pots steady on the stove aboard moving vehicles such as ships and trains .
Those wishing to automate the vacuum brewing process again struggled with the traditional problem of how to determine when to reduce the heat to initiate the vacuum phase of the process .
A number of solutions were proposed , including designs which employed thermal detectors ( Chester Hall , 1936 ; Hermann Lemp , 1937 ) and others designed to sense the vibration of the pot caused by the agitating action of the rising steam .
Many of these were " add - on " devices , but in 1936 , Simon W. Farber of Brooklyn , New York , submitted a patent design for what would become his fully automatic , electric " Coffee Robot . "

T he 1940s saw a number of innovations in the design of vacuum brewers .
In 1942 , Harvey Cory submitted a patent for his " rubberless " vacuum pot .
This design dispenses with the customary rubber gasket used to form an airtight seal between the upper and lower vessels , and substitutes a seal formed by two mechanically ground glass surfaces .
The seal is rendered fluid tight by the combined weight of the upper bowl , filter and ground coffee .
The key to this design is to ensure that the pressure required to raise the water up the funnel tube does not dislodge the upper vessel before the weight of the water above compensates for the increasing pressure below .
Another innovative design introduced around this time was the sleek and futuristic - looking General Electric vacuum brewer .
The GE " Automatic " model incorporated a unique , magnetically - activated device to control the brewing process .

T he decade of the 1940s also saw the emergence of Sunbeams highly successful " Coffeemaster " line - a series of polished chrome electric vacuum brewers which incorporated an automatic system to control all aspects of the brewing process :
A further object is to provide what may be termed an automatic coffee maker , which will function automatically to perform the coffee making operations and to keep the coffee at a desired temperature for serving .
In this connection my invention aims to control the timing of the coffee making functions , regardless of the number of cups of coffee being made , to the end that uniformly delicious coffee will be produced with out need of the housewife or operator keeping watch over the device to perform some manual operation in the nature of timing , or adjusting , or preventing recurrence of the coffee making process .

B y the middle of the 1950s , the vacuum pot had begun to fall out of favor and the number of patents filed fell dramatically after about 1951 , with the final patent for a vacuum coffee maker in this era being filed ten years later by Chester Wickenburg , et. al. of the Sunbeam Corporation .
The vacuum pot was gradually supplanted first by the pumping percolator , and later by a descendant of the old French Drip pot : Mr. Coffee and his kin .
A s the twenty - first century dawns , the popularity of the vacuum pot is experiencing something of a renaissance , fueled by those individuals who appreciate fine coffee and by those who are attracted to the nostalgia of its Art Deco appeal .
A handful of companies still manufacture and sell vacuum brewers , most notably Asian firms such as Hario , Yama , and Tayli .
In 1989 , Toshiba patented a microchip - controlled vacuum brewer in which the brewing of the coffee ( including the grinding of the coffee beans ) is performed automatically based on electronic input of the number of cups and strength desired .

Methane discovery could mean life on the Red Planet
NASA scientists have found new evidence of methane gas and water vapor on Mars ’ atmosphere — the strongest indication so far that life might exist , or once existed on the planet .
Martian methane was detected in 2003 using ground - based telescopes , but some scientists said it could have been dumped on the planet by comets .
The latest discovery is an indication that it is actually produced on the Red Planet .
Methane is typically a byproduct of microbial organisms on Earth .
The presence of this gas on Mars implies active geological , or possibly even biological , processes on the planet .
Prof. Michael Mumma said Thursday the discovery of the gas meant there was a ‘ substantial probability that life was there or still survives ’ on Earth ’s neighbor .
“ It might be possible for similar organisms to survive for billions of years below the permafrost layer on Mars , where water is liquid , radiation supplies energy , and carbon dioxide provides carbon , ” NASA ’s lead scientist Mr. Mumma said .
NASA is due to send a large , nuclear - powered rover to Mars in 2012 to assess whether the planet has ever been — or still is — able to sustain life .
Combatants of the rebel Lord ’s Resistance Army ( LRA ) brutally massacred at least 620 civilians and abducted more than 160 children between December 24 and January 13 in northern Democratic Republic of Congo , said Human Rights Watch and Justice Plus , a Congolese human rights organization .
Many of the victims were killed or abducted in three simultaneous attacks on December 24 and 25 , 2008 .
In a two - week mission to the region , Human Rights Watch and Justice Plus researchers collected detailed information , including lists of persons killed or abducted in and around Doruma , Faradje and Duru , in Haute Uele territory .
At several sites where the killings took place , researchers found fresh graves , pools of dried blood , cords used to tie up prisoners and blood - stained bats and axes used to kill the victims .
“ The LRA went in intending to kill and they left few survivors , ” said Anneke Van Woudenberg , left , senior researcher at Human Rights Watch .
“ The similar tactics and the near - simultaneous attacks indicate this was a planned operation meant to slaughter and terrorize as many civilians as possible . ”
The LRA attacks followed the beginning of a joint military operation on December 14 , led by the Ugandan army with support from the Congolese , Southern Sudanese , and Central African Republic armies .
The Ugandan army attacked the LRA headquarters in Congo ’s Garamba National Park , near the border with Sudan .
Following the attack , the LRA dispersed into several groups , each of which targeted civilians along its path .
The rebels waited until December 24 for the most devastating of their attacks , waiting until people had come together for Christmas festivities , then surrounding and killing them by crushing their skulls with axes , machetes , and large wooden bats .
Most of the few who survived also had head wounds , but two 3 - year - old girls had serious neck injuries , suffered when LRA combatants tried to twist off their heads .
Mass murder for Christmas
The Congolese bishops Fulgence Muteba Mugalu and Fridolin Ambon Besungu say that many Congolese think the US backs Rwanda , which they believe is behind the deadly conflict in the Congo .
US diplomacy is needed , they add .
In the village of Batande , three miles from Doruma , near the Sudanese border , the LRA killed at least 80 people on December 25 when village residents had gathered for Christmas lunch after the morning church service .
LRA members surrounded the people , tied them up with rope or rubber strips from bicycle tires , and then separated the men and boys from the women and girls .
They took the men and boys about 40 meters from the church and killed them immediately with blows to the head .
They took the women and girls into the forest in small groups and raped many of them before crushing their skulls .
One of the few survivors in the village , a 72 - year - old man who arrived late for Christmas lunch , hid in the bushes and watched in horror as his wife , his children and grandchildren were killed .
He later buried many of the bodies and told Human Rights Watch researchers that only six people had been left alive in the village .
When the killing ended in Batande , the LRA combatants ate the Christmas feast the villagers had prepared , and then slept among the dead bodies before continuing on their trail of destruction and death .
LRA combatants attacked another 12 villages on December 26 , 27 , and 28 .
In Faradje , a town to the east of Garamba National Park and about 150 miles from Doruma , another group of LRA combatants also attacked on Christmas Day , killing at least 143 people and abducting 160 children .
The tactics were similar , with the LRA combatants crushing their victim ’s skulls with axes and bats .
The dead included the local doctor , two school inspectors , teachers , two pastors , and state officials .
As their operations continued into the night , the LRA set fire to about 940 houses , three primary schools and nine churches .
They left early in the morning with the abducted children and 20 adults , all of whom were tied up together and forced to carry goods looted by the assailants .
LRA attacks are continuing
According to eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch , LRA combatants killed at least 86 people between January 8 and 11 in Sambia , Akua , and Tomate towns , to the south of Faradje .
Given that information from these attacks is still incomplete , it is likely that the death toll is much higher .
“ Hundreds of people have been slaughtered and this just goes on , ” said Joel Bisubu , of Justice Plus .
“ We need food and medical supplies for the injured , but even more we need protection . ”
Soldiers of the joint military operation have provided limited protection to people of the region .
The Ugandan army says its objectives are to track the LRA and its leader , Joseph Kony , wanted on an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , and to rescue civilians abducted by the LRA .
To date , Ugandan troops have rescued 25 people .
Congolese army soldiers arrived in Doruma and Faradje only after the massacres had taken place .
The United Nations Mission in Congo , MONUC , has a mandate to protect civilians and provides logistical support to the Congolese army , but is not part of this operation .
Most of the UN peacekeepers are posted farther south in eastern Congo , where other rebel forces and the Congolese army have been fighting a war that has also taken a devastating toll on civilians .
LRA leaders , including Kony , are wanted by the ICC for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in northern Uganda .
Any ICC suspects who are captured or surrendered should be turned over for trial at the ICC immediately , Human Rights Watch said .
Uganda and DRC are both ICC state parties obligated to cooperate with the court , including by assisting in executing ICC warrants .
“ In the past , Ugandan army attacks on the LRA have often spurred immediate reprisals on civilians living nearby , ” said Van Woudenberg .
“ LRA atrocities like these show the Ugandan army needs to take steps to protect civilians when undertaking offensive military operations . ”
Bill Ayers was a founder of the radical 1960s Weatherman group .
Whew !
What was all that mess ?
I 'm still in a daze , sorting it all out , decompressing .
For the past few years , I have gone about my business , hanging out with my kids and , now , my grandchildren , taking care of our elders ( they moved in as the kids moved out ) , going to work , teaching and writing .
And every day , I participate in the never - ending effort to build a powerful and irresistible movement for peace and social justice .
In years past , I would now and then – and often unpredictably – appear in the newspapers or on TV , sometimes with a reference to Fugitive Days , my 2001 memoir of the exhilarating and difficult years of resistance against the American war in Vietnam .
Then came this political season .
During the primaries , the blogosphere was full of chatter about my relationship with Barack Obama .
We had served together on the board of the Woods Foundation and knew one another as neighbours in Chicago 's Hyde Park .
In 1996 , at a coffee gathering that my wife , Bernardine Dohrn ( also a founder of the Weatherman ) and I held for him , I made a $ 200 donation to his campaign for the Illinois state senate .
Obama 's rivals and enemies thought they saw an opportunity to deepen a dishonest perception that he is somehow un-American , alien , linked to radical ideas , a closet terrorist who sympathizes with extremism – and they pounced .
On March 13 , Senator John McCain , apparently in an attempt to reassure the " base , " sat down for an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News .
McCain was not yet aware of the narrative Hannity had been spinning for months , and so Hannity filled him in : Ayers is an unrepentant " terrorist , " he explained .
" On 9/11 , of all days , he had an article where he bragged about bombing our Pentagon , bombing the Capitol and bombing New York City police headquarters .
...
He said , ` I regret not doing more . ' "
McCain could n't believe it .
Neither could I .
On the campaign trail , McCain immediately got on message .
I became a prop , a cartoon character created to be pummelled .
When Alaska Governor Sarah Palin got hold of it , the attack went viral .
At a now - famous Oct. 4 rally , she said Obama was " pallin ' around with terrorists . "
( I pictured us sharing a milkshake with two straws . )
The crowd began chanting , " Kill him !
Kill him ! "
It was downhill from there .
My voicemail filled up with hate messages .
They were mostly from men , all venting and breathing heavily .
A few threats : " Watch out ! " and " You deserve to be shot . "
And I got some emails like this one from satan@hell.com : " I 'm coming to get you and when I do , I 'll waterboard you . "
The police lieutenant who came to copy down those threatsdeadpanned that he hoped the guy who was going to shoot me got there before the guy who was going to waterboard me , since it would be most foul to be tortured and then shot .
The good news was that every time McCain or Palin mentioned my name , they lost a point or two in the polls .
The cartoon invented to hurt Obama poked holes in the rapidly sinking McCain - Palin ship .
The McCain - Palin attacks not only involved guilt by association , they also assumed that one must apply a political litmus test to begin a conversation .
In a robust and sophisticated democracy , political leaders – and all of us – ought to seek ways to talk with many people who hold dissenting , or even radical , ideas .
Lacking that simple and yet essential capacity to question authority , we might still be burning witches and enslaving our fellow human beings today .
Maybe we could welcome our current situation – torn by another illegal war , as it was in the '60s – as an opportunity to search for the new .
Perhaps we might think of ourselves not as passive consumers of politics , but as fully mobilized political actors .
Perhaps we might think of our various efforts now , as we did then , as more than a single campaign , but rather as our movement - in - the - making .
We might find hope in the growth of opposition to war and occupation worldwide .
Or we might be inspired by the growing movements for reparations and prison abolition , or the rising immigrant rights movement and the stirrings of working people everywhere , or by gay and lesbian and transgender people courageously pressing for full recognition .
Yet hope – my hope , our hope – resides in a simple self - evident truth : the future is unknown , and it is also entirely unknowable .
History is always in the making .
It 's up to us .
It is up to me and to you .
Nothing is predetermined .
That makes our moment on this Earth both hopeful and all the more urgent – we must find ways to become real actors , to become authentic subjects in our own history .
In this time of new beginnings and rising expectations , it is even more urgent that we figure out how to become the people we have been waiting to be .

PRAGUE 
The European Union has stepped into a dispute between Russia and Ukraine that has drastically reduced energy supplies to the Continent , saying on Wednesday that it had won agreement from Russia and Ukraine for independent monitoring of natural - gas flows through Ukraine .
The pledge , European officials said , should help restore gas supplies to the West , which were entirely halted earlier in the day .
After phone conversations with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his Ukrainian counterpart , Yulia V. Tymoshenko , on Wednesday , the European Commission president , José Manuel Barroso , said both leaders had agreed in principle to allow monitors to verify gas movements .
But he also warned both countries  and particularly Ukraine  that failure to help restore supplies could have consequences for their relationships with the European Union .
“ We have received assurances both from Prime Minister Putin and Prime Minister Tymoshenko that they both accept international monitors , ” Mr. Barroso said .
The surge of games , videos and creative websites that pay tribute to an Iraqi journalist 's presidential shoe - toss continues to grow .
The simple site Thank You for Throwing Your Shoe offers thanks to Muntadhar al - Zeidi , the now - famous journo who shoe - bombed President George W. Bush during a Baghdad press conference last Sunday .
The site solicits photos of people with their own footwear as a tribute to al - Zeidi's unsuccessful two - shoe attack .
" Hold up your shoe for Muntadar al - Zeidi , the Iraqi journalist who was arrested for throwing his shoes at President Bush , " the site says .
" We do n't condone shoe throwing , but we prefer it to war . "
Since Wired.com first wrote about the rapid appearance of animated GIFs and games immortalizing the incident , many more impromptu memorials have surfaced , mostly in the form of games .
The Shoe Bush Worldwide game ( screenshot above ) lets players fling a wide variety of footwear – from high heels to cowboy boots – at an increasingly disheveled president , with success measured by a Whack - O - Meter .
Duck Duck Bush lets gamers chuck almost anything ( including a pit bull with lipstick ) at the commander in chief .
Kroma 's Bush game asks , " Can you throw a shoe at Bush ? "
The tally indicates more than 50
million virtual shoes have been tossed ( with more than 6 million hits ) .
Other games include :
Kast Sko Mot Bush , a cool , catapult - powered game
Ninja Bush , which puts the president in a black ninja outfit and lets him return fire with baseballs
Bye Bye Bush , which shows the president on an infinite field ( and gives players a seemingly endless supply of shoes )
Bush Shoe Incident , which tests players ' reaction time
The creative animated GIFs are still surfacing , too :
Meanwhile , raw footage of al - Zeidi's angry shoe attack remains atop the list of viral videos , as ranked by Viral Video Chart , with more than 12 million views so far .
The Facebook fan page for Muntadar al - Zaidi ( The Shoe Thrower ) now has more than 17,000 fans .
He might need the friends :
An Iraqi judge " announced a probe Friday into the beating and bruising of an
Iraqi journalist 's face moments after he hurled his shoes at President
George W. Bush , " according to the Associated Press .

Did I just say that ?
Yes I did .
And increasingly I ’m hearing it from wine professionals that I know — spoken , of course , in hushed tones and off the record .
Most professional sommeliers and wine writers would n’t be caught dead uttering such terms in public , let alone publishing them .
So I guess it ’s up to us bloggers to spread the word : wine drinkers around the world , you ’ve been hoodwinked .
Tricked .
Bamboozled .
Conned .
Before you throw that glass at your monitor , let me explain .
Wine has always gone with food .
In fact , one of the first reasons that wine became popular as a beverage was not for its flavor , but because the alcohol helped kill the nasties that often infected pre-refrigerator - technology cuisine .
The surest recipe for an unpleasant evening was to forget to drink a bit of wine , usually diluted heavily with water after gnawing on that side of beef that had been hanging in your medieval “ kitchen ” for weeks .
It did n’t take long for the cultural practice of drinking wine with meals to be cemented as part of civilization , and it ’s stuck for , oh , the last four thousand years or so .
Of course , it did n’t hurt that wine also gets us drunk .
Do n’t underestimate the power of fun as a driver of cultural traditions .
Along the way to its peak of popularity , wine started tasting a lot better , especially as winemakers learned more about chemistry , viticulture , and aging wine .
At some point , most people started drinking wine more for the pleasure of its flavors than for its digestive benefits , not to mention the fact that , yes , it gets us drunk .
I guess at some point , people starting forming opinions that not only was a proper meal incomplete without a bottle of wine , certain wines actually tasted better with certain foods and vice versa .
And that was where everything started to go downhill .
Because , on a certain level , these folks were absolutely right .
Most people will agree a nice crisp white wine goes better with butter sautéed snapper than a massively tannic red .
Such common sensibilities are ultimately what is responsible for the incredible traditions of winemaking and cultivation around the world .
Curious wine lovers might wonder just why it is that Tuscan red wines are so brawny , but perceptive wine lovers that have ever had an authentic Florentine steak and grilled vegetables quickly find out that the answer is the same reason that the coastal region of Southern France around Marseille produces such lovely , crisp pink and white wines .
These wines just taste better with what people eat in these places most of the time .
Over their centuries of evolution , the regional cuisines of the wine producing areas of the world and the people responsible for their creation have “ settled ” on the wines that work best for them .
So that ’s all good , of course .
But just like cancers that can grow from seemingly benign cells , these basic sensibilities planted the seeds of a poisonous idea , one that has grown to the point that every evening around the world , wine lovers stand paralyzed in the aisles of grocery stores and in the halls of wine stores , trying desperately to choose the “ right ” wine for whatever they are making for dinner that night .
Many also tremble at the thought of taking responsibility for ordering a wine for an entire table of guests , for fear of choosing a wine that they imagine the sommelier will arch their eyebrows at and ask with a sneer , “ are you sure you want to drink THAT with your chicken , Sir ? ”
The perception that there are “ proper ” wine pairings is so pervasive now that in addition to the countless books that exist to help the helpless figure out exactly what to cook to match their Albariño , there are now even several wine brands whose sole existence consists of “ eliminating the guesswork . ”
On the other end of the price spectrum from the crappy wines that are brazen enough to call themselves “ Goes With Beef ” lay the fine dining restaurants of the world , with sommeliers that work hard to put together 8 course flights of wine pairings for $ 125 to accompany your tasting menu .
These pairings , which at the best restaurants are both artfully done ( i.e. tasty ) and opportunities to try interesting wines , serve to further reinforce a universal belief in three fundamental falsehoods when it comes to pairing food and wine :
Lie # 1 : For any given food / dish there is a “ perfect , ” “ ideal ” or “ correct ” wine pairing .
Lie # 2 : There are a ton of mistakes and pitfalls out there — lots of wines just “ do n’t go ” with certain foods and vice versa .
Lie # 3 : Because of # 1 and # 2 , food and wine pairing is an art that is hard to learn , requires deep knowledge , and generally is best left to experts .
And these lies , dear reader , are tacitly supported by the wine establishment around the world , quite possibly because there ’s a lot more money to be made if everyone acts as if they are true .
I ’ve had a lot of fancy wine pairings , done by people with fancy initials after their names , and six figure salaries in fine restaurants that prove these folks know their shit when it comes to wine ( and they most certainly do ) .
But I tell you honestly , for every one of those wine and food combinations that have been great , there have been just as many that were simply ordinary .
That ’s right .
The hit rate is really around fifty percent .
And why is this the case ?
Because the single most important variable in the success of wine and food pairing lies completely out of the control of every sommelier and chef in the world .
And that variable is me , you , and every single person that sits down to a mouthful of food and a swig of wine .
We each bring our own unique sensory apparatus to the process of tasting .
If everyone in the world could possibly take a bite of one big apple , each of us quite literally tastes something different .
What we “ taste , ” — that is , the story we tell ourselves as our individual , complex , and completely unique brains interpret the signals that they are getting from each of our individual , complex and unique sensory nervous systems — is ours and ours alone .
The biochemical and bioelectrical processes that combine to create the thought , “ Hey , this wine goes great with pepperoni pizza ” are so staggeringly complex , not to mention situational , that the idea that someone can actually know what they are doing when they prescribe a specific wine with a specific dish is laughable .
Have you ever listened to several serious wine experts share their tasting notes about a wine that you yourself are tasting at the same time ?
I ’ve had this experience several times , tasting wines with Robert Parker , Karen MacNeil , Andrea Robinson , Anthony Dias Blue , Frank Prial , and more .
And every time not only are my tasting notes different from theirs , all of theirs are different from each other .
Some taste chestnuts , some taste tobacco , some cedar , and some espresso .
So if the world ’s foremost wine experts can’t even agree on what an individual wine tastes like in a controlled setting , how on earth could someone suggest they will know what it will taste like with rosemary and garlic rubbed lamb shank with new potatoes and sautéed Swiss chard ?
I hear what you ’re saying .
You ’re saying , “ sure , they might not know exactly what it will taste like for me , but they know that it will generally go well together , do n’t they ? ”
And I ’m here telling you , yeah , they can probably say that , about to the point of being able to suggest that a nice crisp white will go better with butter sautéed snapper than a massively tannic red .
The rest , my friends , is just luck .
So here ’s what I want you to remember when it comes to wine and food pairing :
Principle # 1 : There are no right answers .
Even the crisp white with fish is bullshit if you do n’t like crisp white wines .
When in doubt , always drink what you like to drink and you ’ll probably enjoy your food and your wine better than you would if you worried about matching them .
Principle # 2 : Take advice only when you feel like it , and do n’t expect it to be right even when the person is some sort of expert .
You might like someone ’s pairings , and you might not .
But just because someone else thinks that Gruner Veltliner is the perfect pairing for steamed asparagus with butter and salt , does n’t mean you will .
Principle # 3 : Since this is all about you ( yeah baby ) , experiment !
try different things and figure out what works for you .
And I guarantee what you ’ll discover , in the course of these explorations , is that for any dish , there are a million and one wines that will taste great with it , and for any wine , there are just as many foods that would be perfect accompaniments .
All of which will make you happy , and also prove my point .
Go forth and break free from your chains .
The only answer to what to drink with what you eat is , in the end , is everything and anything .
Opponents of open source often use the specter of potential patent infringement charges to protect their proprietary turf .
Questions over patent validity in software are never easy to answer , but it's one that a new effort called Linux Defenders from the Open Invention Network ( OIN ) is trying help solve .
Linux Defender includes facilities for peer - to - peer patent review , post patent review as well as defensive publications for patents .
With Microsoft alleging , or just hinting strongly in some cases , that open source technologies infringe on over 200 Microsoft patents , the new effort might potentially help open source and Linux vendors to defend themselves should the need arise .
But the overall goal of Linux Defenders is to ensure that patents are of high quality and that prior art is properly recognized in the patent process .
" It 's not really focused on Microsoft , " Keith Bergelt , chief executive officer of Open Invention Network told InternetNews.com .
" Under post - issue Peer to Patent there will probably be some Microsoft patents up there , there will probably be some from small companies and trolls ,  he said , using a pejorative term for patent - holders who often manipulate the patent system for excessive profits .
 It really will be a mixture , but I do n't think you should expect to see 30 Microsoft patents up there .
We do n't have Microsoft patents up there now . "
A Microsoft spokesperson was not immediately available for comment on the new service .
Since claiming in 2007 that open source technologies infringed on its patents , Microsoft has softened its tone .
At a 2008 open source event , Sam Ramji , Microsoft 's director of open source technology strategy , told attendees that Microsoft has never litigated against open source users .
But the issues that arise between patented software and open source creations remain in place .
As part of the Linux Defender program , the OIN will look at issued patents in an effort called the post issue Peer to Patent effort .
If warranted , the OIN would help challenge an already issued patent if it believes it is invalid based on information it has or is made aware of by the open source community .
The Linux Defender effort will also do peer review of pending patent publications in an effort to help validate that a patent application is non-obvious and has not already been invented .
Linux Defender will also engage in a practice known as Defensive Publications .
A Defensive Publication is a set of documents that describes a production or method , which could then become a source for defining prior art in the patent awarding process .
Applicants for U.S. Patents are expected to show that their invention is obvious and original .
The Linux Defender Defensive Publications effort is an attempt to identify everything that has already been invented by open source and Linux technologies .
Bergelt described the Linux Defender Defensive Publication initiative as a tool for helping with future patent claims .
For example , if an invention has a Defensive Publication filed with it , then a future patent application from a third party could be potentially be invalidated .
After all , Bergelt noted , Prior art is dependent on chronology in most instances , such that whoever published first .
Bergelt admitted that a Defensive Publication could also be used to help out with a patent that potentially has already been granted .
In such case the original inventor might not have formally published a defensive publication prior to a patent have been granted .
" There are situations where the defensive publication itself would not serve as prior art , " Bergelt explained .
" But for that patent at issue as long as we can prove the earliest publication , not as a defensive publication but in an informal structure whether in a presentation or in a website we can show where it came from and when it was first made available in the public domain .
Then we could take it back as part of the post patent effort for re-examination . "
Bergelt noted that while the open source community has been good at developing innovation , it has n't always been as good at codifying that innovation from a legal perspective .
Though larger companies like IBM , Red Hat and Novell have been able to patent some of their open source innovations , Bergelt argued that smaller companies and projects have been boxed out of the process .
Could Linux Defender balance the playing firled ?
It 's one of the goals .
The OIN itself was formed in 2005 as a multi-vendor effort to provide royalty - free usage of patents to open source project .
As such Bergelt sees the Linux Defender effort as a natural extension of what OIN has already been doing .
" We want to provide a single source for people in the open source community and especially Linux as a path to affecting change , " Bergelt said .
Abortion opponents are pressing state and local governments to stop sending taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood , arguing that the nonprofit group has plenty of cash and should n't be granted scarce public funds at a time of economic crisis .
Planned Parenthood receives about $ 335 million a year -- a third of its budget -- from government grants and contracts to subsidize contraception , sex education and non-abortion - related health care for poor women and teenagers .

After two days of deliberations , the United Nations officials at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Poznan , Poland , agreed to give media accreditation to the DeSmogBlog , the first time in history that the UN has accredited a blog , according to UNFCCC Public Information and Media Assistant Carrie Assheuer .
“ It was quite the ordeal , ” said DeSmogBlog Editor Richard Littlemore .
“ The UN system is set up to accommodate mainstream media and it ’s not an institution that ’s designed to be flexible or innovative . ”
But after Littlemore showered the UNFCCC press office with examples of DSB citations in everything from the Globe and Mail to the New York Times , Assheuer , a Canadian who was already familiar with the DeSmogBlog , finally acknowledged the blog ’s function as an online media outlet within the UN ’s now - more - flexible definition .
“ I thought that the decision was particularly important because there are no other English - speaking reporters from Canada covering this conference , ” Littlemore said .
“ So , the UN is saying , ‘ We only deal with old media , ’ and the old media barons are saying , ‘ We do n’t care enough about climate change to send a reporter . ’
It was the perfect prescription for keeping Canadians in the dark about what ’s happening in Poznan . ”
DeSmogBlog co-founder James Hoggan said he was delighted to hear of Littlemore ’s success .
“ It ’s another happy side effect of setting up the DeSmogBlog , ” Hoggan said .
In going to Poznan - and thanks to Richard ’s stubbornness - we have made the world a little more welcoming to new media .
This is n’t just about climate change .
It ’s about access to information and free speech , and on that count , we ’re happy to be making good things happen . ”
Claims for unemployment benefits reach 26 - year high
More Americans are collecting jobless benefits than at any time in the last 26 years as companies rush to cut costs in a sinking economy .
The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls rose to 4.09 million in the week ended Nov. 22 , the most since December 1982 , the Labor Department said today in Washington .
A separate report showed orders at U.S. factories tumbled in October by the most in eight years as demand collapsed at home and abroad .
AT&T Inc. , DuPont Co. and Viacom Inc. today announced plans to eliminate more than 15,000 jobs as consumer spending falters and the recession deepens .
The Labor Department tomorrow will report that the U.S. unemployment rate jumped to a 15 - year high of 6.8 percent in November , according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists .
" Businesses are battening down the hatches , " Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh , said in a Bloomberg Television interview .
" Job losses are going to continue to accelerate . "
Figures from the Commerce Department showed factory orders dropped 5.1 percent , more than forecast and the biggest decline since July 2000 .
Excluding transportation gear , bookings decreased for a third consecutive month .
Bonds rose while stocks fell .
The benchmark 10 - year note yielded 2.62 percent at 12:49 p.m. in New York , down from 2.66 percent yesterday .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index was down 0.8 percent at 864.16 .
Two regional Federal Reserve bank presidents warned the economic slump is likely to persist .
Dennis Lockhart , president of the Fed Bank of Atlanta , told a conference in New Orleans the economy was " in the midst of a long and very painful adjustment process . "
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans , speaking in Dearborn , Michigan , said the U.S. faced a " very substantial downturn . "
Continuing claims were projected to rise to 4.03 million , according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
Labor revised total benefit rolls for the prior week up to 3.998 million from 3.962 million .
Initial jobless claims declined by 21,000 to 509,000 in the week that ended Nov. 29 , which included the Thanksgiving Day holiday .
Initial claims last week were lower than the 540,000 median estimate of economists surveyed .
The government often has difficulty adjusting the figures for seasonal influences during holidays .
The four - week moving average of initial claims , a less volatile measure , climbed to 524,500 , the highest since 1982 , from 518,250 , today ’s report showed .
The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits , which tends to track the jobless rate , increased to 3.1 percent , the highest since 1992 , from 3 percent .
These data are reported with a one - week lag .
Forty - nine states and territories reported an increase in new claims , while 4 reported a decrease .
The biggest increases were reported by California , Ohio and Michigan .
Claims reflect weekly firings and tend to rise as job growth — measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls report — slows .
So far this year , weekly claims have averaged 408,500 , compared with an average of 321,000 for all of 2007 , when employers added a total of 1.1 million jobs .
The economy has lost 1.2 million jobs so far this year as payrolls dropped for 10 consecutive months .
Tomorrow ’s jobs report may show payrolls fell by 330,000 in November , the biggest one - month drop since 1982 , according to the Bloomberg survey .
The unemployment rate probably rose to 6.8 percent , the highest since 1993 .
Rising unemployment and the persistent credit crisis raise the likelihood the recession that began in December 2007 will turn into the longest slump in the post - World War II era .
What started as a housing slump has spread to manufacturing and services .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index dropped last month to the lowest level since 1982 , and its services gauge , which accounts for almost 90 percent of the economy , fell to the lowest level since records began in 1997 .
Financial firms are among those making the biggest job cuts .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the largest U.S. bank by assets , said this week it will cut 9,200 jobs nationwide at Washington Mutual Inc. as it acquires the Seattle - based lender .
" We have seen a fairly significant dropoff in demand , starting in October , " Delta Airlines Inc. President Ed Bastian said on a Webcast of a Credit Suisse Group AG airline conference in New York this week .
" The revenue environment is as cloudy as it ’s ever been .
We ’ve never seen the level of demand destruction that some are forecasting for our business . "
Delta , the world ’s largest carrier , said it will cut seating capacity by as much as 8 percent in 2009 and eliminate an unspecified number of jobs .

Sean Connery was n't supposed to be James Bond .
Keanu was n't supposed to be " the One . "
So , who were the original choices ?
Here are 5 actors and the legendary roles they turned down .
THE ROLE : James Bond in Dr. No
WHO LET IT GET AWAY : Cary Grant .
Despite being Bond producer Albert Broccoli's best man , Grant said " I do n't "  to the offer , and Sean Connery got the role instead .
Of course , many studio executives objected to the decision , and even Bond creator Ian Fleming said Connery " was n't exactly what I had in mind . " 
REGRETTABILITY METER : Low .
By the 1960s , Cary Grant already had a spectacular film career .
If he 'd accepted the role ( as Broccoli later revealed ) , it would 've been just a one - movie deal .
THE ROLE : Neo in The Matrix
WHO LET IT GET AWAY : Will Smith turned it down to star in the forgettable action flick Wild Wild West , and the part went to Keanu Reeves .
REGRETTABILITY METER : Low .
In an interview with Wired , Smith said , " I would have absolutely messed up The Matrix .
At that point I was n't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be — whereas Keanu was . " 
THE ROLE : Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction
WHO LET IT GET AWAY : Michael Madsen , who was stuck in lengthy rehearsals for Wyatt Earp .
John Travolta got the role instead and , almost overnight , transformed from a Hollywood has - been into one of the most bankable stars in the business .
REGRETTABILITY METER : High .
Madsen called Wyatt Earp " a big waste of time . " 
THE ROLE : Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy
WHO LET IT GET AWAY : Sean Connery , who 'd never read the J.R.R .
Tolkien series and claimed he " did n't understand the script . " 
( Can you say karma ? )
REGRETTABILITY METER : High .
In return for playing the role , New Line Cinema offered the Scottish actor up to 15 percent of worldwide box office receipts , which would have earned Connery more than any actor had ever been paid for a single role — as much as $ 400 million .
THE ROLES : Sundance in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , Jimmy " Popeye "  Doyle in The French Connection , and Captain Benjamin Willard in Apocalypse Now .
WHO LET THEM GET AWAY : Steve McQueen .
REGRETTABILITY METER : Tragically high .
McQueen turned down the role of Sundance simply because costar Paul Newman refused to give him top billing .
Later , McQueen declined the lead in The French Connection because he felt the part was too similar to the tough cop he 'd played in 1968 's Bullitt .
Gene Hackman took the part and won an Oscar for it .
And finally , in 1978 , McQueen told Apocalypse Now director Francis Ford Coppola to shove off when he was offered the lead .
McQueen 's non-negotiable asking price was $ 3 million ; plus , he did n't feel like spending four months shooting in the Philippine jungle .
Instead , Martin
Sheen landed the role , and despite suffering a heart attack during the stressful production , he gave one of cinema 's greatest performances .

THURSDAY , Dec. 4 , 2008 ( Health.com ) —
If your friends are happy , you 're often happy too .
That 's a no-brainer .
But what about your next - door neighbor — can his happiness rub off on you ?
A new study says yes .
Using data from the comprehensive Framingham Heart Study , James Fowler of the University of California at San Diego and Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School analyzed the happiness and social networks of 4,739 people from 1983 to 2003 .
After figuring out how everyone was related , the researchers looked at participants ' answers to four questions on a commonly used depression index .
They found patterns of happiness among groups of friends , spouses , family members , and neighbors .
Not surprisingly , an individual 's happiness was influenced by that of the people around her .
But the study , published Thursday in the British Medical Journal , also revealed that the subjects were affected by the happiness of people who were as many as three degrees removed from them .
The findings show that if you have a happy friend , you 're 15 % more likely to be happy .
But if a friend of a friend of a friend is happy , your chances of being happy are still about 6 % greater than they would be otherwise .
In other words , your friend 's buddy — even if he 's a stranger to you — may have a significant effect on your outlook on life .
" We 've known for some time that social relationships are the best predictor of human happiness , and this paper shows that the effect is much more powerful than anyone realized , " says Daniel Gilbert , PhD , a professor of psychology at Harvard University .
Distance plays a role
Physical proximity was a strong predictor of how happiness spread in social networks .
Nearby friends — those who lived within a mile of the subjects — who were happy increased a subject 's chance of being happy by 25 % .
Distant friends — those living more than a mile away — had no significant effect on someone 's happiness .
So the faraway folks we keep in touch with on our iPhones and Facebook pages may not have as great an influence on our emotional life as the neighbor we wave to when we take out the trash .
" This means that life is much more local than people think it is , " says John F. Helliwell , a fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research .
" Modern technologies allow you to maintain these very long - distance networks , but it 's the local ones that really count . "
Sitting next to a jolly cubicle mate does not mean you 'll catch the bliss bug .
The study found no relation between the happiness of coworkers .
This suggests , the authors write , “ that the social context might moderate the flow of happiness from one person to another " — meaning that the office environment may not be fertile ground for gleefulness to grow .
The researchers did n't investigate why your downstairs neighbor may influence your mental state more than your sister three hours away .
And because it was conducted in one New England town , the results may not translate to other communities , wrote Peter Sainsbury , the director of the Division of Population Health in the Central Sydney Area Health Service , in an editorial accompanying the study .
" Perhaps Framingham [ Massachusetts ] was unique in some way , " he surmised .
" Do n't drop your unhappy friends yet . "
Why the study matters
The discovery adds to a growing body of research that proves social networks are powerful predictors of behavior .
Two recent studies found that you 're more likely to be obese or a smoker if those close to you are .
The authors of the BMJ study note that those findings could have significant implications on how we approach public health .
Better care for people who are ill , for example , may end up making lots of people — some of them strangers — healthier or happier .
The results are also fuel for scientists studying the importance of positive states .
By understanding the conditions in which happiness spreads , they argue , we may be able to foster well - being , rather than trying to restore it once it has been lost .
" Traditionally , we 've waited until something goes wrong and then we 've tried to fix it , " says Helliwell .
" We ought to be thinking of how to improve people 's well - being , because the things that make people happy transmit positively to their neighbors . "
Do you know your partner 's sexual history ?
Have you had an orgasm ?
Do you have your friends ' blessing ?
Some things to take care of before you have any kind of sex .
As a sexuality educator , I spend most of my time helping parents understand how to talk with their children and teenagers about sex , sexuality , gender , and all of the myriad issues that go along with those things .
One question that parents often ask me is how to make sure their teenagers are ready to have sex .
Putting aside issues of whether parents should have substantial input and control over their teenager ’s sexual activities , I found that parents were relying on goals that were far too vague .
Parents want to make sure that their teenagers are mature enough , have good communication with their partners , understand the health and reproductive consequences , etc .
One parent lamented that she and her daughter had ( what the mother thought were ) great conversations about the need for all of these things , but that her daughter went ahead and had sex even though she never had good communication with her partner and ended up having unprotected sex .
Was her daughter not listening to her ?
Pretending to go along and then choosing a different route ?
While those are possibilities , the more likely problem is that the daughter was not sure how to measure and assess her relationship to make sure that she had reached the goals she enthusiastically agreed with her mother were important .
And so , my list of ten concrete things that teenagers need to do before they have sex was born .
Just to be clear , these are things to do before you have oral sex , sexual intercourse , or anything else that could get you pregnant or an STD .
1 . Have an orgasm .
Yes , before you start having sex , you should give yourself an orgasm .
It ’s important to know what feels good to you before you can show another person what feels good to you .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

2 . Know the other person ’s sexual history .
And I do n’t mean just vaginal intercourse for this one !
3 . Know the other person ’s STD status , as well as your own .
The only way to know this for sure is to be tested !
And if you ’re both virgins , well , you ’re not going to be for long .
You might as well get that scary first STD testing out of the way so you ’ll know what to expect next time around .
4 . Talk about exactly what STD protection and birth control you will be using .
These two issues go hand - in - hand ( for heterosexual couples ) , and it is the domain of both parties to be intimately involved .
5 . If you are part of a heterosexual couple , talk about what happens if the woman gets pregnant .
Here are a few options to talk about , in alphabetical order : abortion , adoption , raising the kid alone , raising the kid together .
With the understanding that reality is different than the theoretical , make sure you ’re both on the same theoretical page .
6 . Have your best friend ’s blessing .
We can rarely see someone we ’re in love with clearly .
It is often our best friends who can see our lovers and our potential lovers for who they really are .
Listen to what your best friend has to say , and take it to heart .
If it ’s not what you wanted to hear , give it some time .
Wait a month .
A good relationship will be able to withstand another month before having sex .
Then ask a different friend , and see what they have to say .
7 . Meet your partner ’s parents .
At the very least , make sure you know why you have n’t met your them .
The best sex comes out of knowing someone well , and knowing someone ’s family is an important part of knowing them .
( Even if they ’re really , really different from their family . )
8 . Be comfortable being naked in front of each other .
You do n’t actually have to strip down in broad daylight to make sure you ’ve reached this milestone , but it sure helps !
9 . Have condoms on hand .
Make sure they fit right , that they ’re within the expiration date , and that they have n’t been exposed to extreme conditions ( like the inside of a really hot car ) .
Condoms should be part of any respectful sexual relationship .
There need be no assumption of hook ups outside of the relationship , just an assumption of good sexual habits being made and
kept .
10 .
Make sure that your partner has done all of these things too .
Part of a happy , healthy sexual encounter is taking care of everyone ’s emotional needs and physical health .
Both people need to pay attention to themselves and to their partner .
That way each person has two people looking out for them .
It ’s just the best way to do things .
BEST EMBRACE OF DEMOCRACY , FLAWED AS IT IS : EVE ONLINE
This year CCP of Iceland ( another potential finance joke sidestepped ) invited the more than 200,000 players of Eve Online to vote for nine representatives from around the world to convey their concerns and suggestions about the game to the company .
That alone was innovative .
Then the company flew them to Iceland to sit down for a few days with the game ’s developers .
The company has committed to repeating the process about every six months , which makes this an idea that ought to spread beyond the game world .
Maybe Microsoft should allow Windows users to vote for an officially recognized gripe committee .
Maybe the airlines could have their chief executives sit down with an elected panel of frequent flyers twice a year .
Hey , who says games ca n’t make the world a better place ?
BEST DISAPPOINTMENT : SPORE If Electronic
Arts has learned anything from its experience with Spore , it ought to be that a software company should just let its games do the talking , rather than relentlessly hyping a game for years before its release only to deliver a one - note electronic toy in the end .
Spore would not have fizzled so quickly if expectations had not been so ludicrously inflated to begin with .
Perhaps more important , it showed that maybe even a game god like Will Wright , the game ’s creator , can stand to be reminded of the basics once in a while .
Spore was great at letting the player create something from nothing .
But in the end it just was n’t that interesting to play with .
Making cool stuff is a great part of video games , but the play , more than in any other media , really is the thing .
( For Mac and PC . )
BEST VINDICATION : FABLE II Like Mr. Wright , the game designer Peter Molyneux also likes to talk .
And he is also quite good at it .
His games , however , have never quite been as golden as his tongue .
Until now .
With Fable II , his enchanting Enlightenment - era fantasy role - playing adventure , Mr. Molyneux finally achieved his goal of allowing players to feel as if they were inhabiting a living world .
( For Xbox 360 . )
GAME OF THE YEAR : GRAND THEFT AUTO IV G.T.A. IV came out in April , and for the rest of the year I kept waiting for some other new game to captivate and refuse to release me the way this masterpiece from Rockstar did .
I ’m still waiting .
Beyond its formidable craft , apart from its well - balanced combat and driving mechanics , what impresses most about G.T.A. IV is its writing .
It is one of the few games that even try to take on the real world in any adult way .
( Of course , the game ’s Liberty City setting is a parody of modern New York . )
Penetrating through all the game ’s gangster trappings is a hunger to engage with the idiocies , the contradictions and even some of the good things in modern America .
After all , someone has to .

I have been writing for sometime that liberals are being jerked around by their fear of bacteria and disease in the service of the FDA and USDA getting totalitarian regulations in place which are MEANT TO destroy our small farmers .
But it is not easy reaching urban liberals who have such a blind faith in " science " they miss the politics altogether as well as the suffering of other human beings who are being wiped out by the liberal desire for 100 % certainty they wo n't get sick when they eat a sandwich .
Just as the Right has sold American civil liberties down the river for an attempt at " safety from terrorists " - not minding the CENTRALIZATION of spying agencies set up with huge data banks to spy on lefties / commies / pinkos / Muslim / terrorists who threaten this country with their lack of obedience to authority / patriotism , the Left has sold American civil liberties down the river for an attempt at " food safety " - not minding that a CENTRALIZED " food safety "
Department is being planned which will have huge data banks for spying on the right / rednecks / racists / farmers who threaten this country with their lack of scientific / hygienic practices .
We know what the Patriot Act did to this country .
We needed to challenge the whole " terrorism is causing everything " myth to begin to see what was really going on - the fake WMD scare , the oil contracts , the Halliburton and Blackwater contracts , the undoing of civil liberties to destroy political dissent .
Some on the right , such as Ron Paul , see as well having stood up to their fear of terrorism and decoupled it from a blind faith in the authority of the president and military .
The point is to see the rest of the plans to take control .
Those plans are happening in the countryside .
And to begin deconstructing them , it is time for the Left to give up its fear of diseases and its blind faith in the " authority of science . "
Both authorities are manipulated and controlled by corporations .
Both fears are as well .
But right now , the Left , which has done such a powerful job of exposing the lies about the war and the dangers of the Patriot Act , is caught way behind in seeing what is happening through the lie of " food safety " - which sounds so mundane and harmless but is the Nazi - trick of using hygiene , once again , to take control .
The most advanced science is seeing bacteria as amazing and exposure to it , even bad bacteria , as critical for strong immune systems .
click here
Not so oddly , farmers know this already .
Farmers know a lot of science that does n't come from books but in being grounded in life itself ends up being way ahead of the fragmented " modern science " that is used as the basis , for instance , of pasteurization , badly outmoded as a scientifically valuable tool .
click here
It was , of course , " modern science " which devalued breast feeding , promoted bottle feeding and corporate baby formulas .
The objections from mothers were treated an " anti- science " and disregarded .
It took a great deal of time of and more advanced science to prove what mothers have known for thousands of years , that breast feeding is miraculous on many levels .
And that milk is not pasteurized .
Farmers know things about the relation between farming and our immune systems that I had never heard and which certainly does n't jive with the USDA 's pushing the idea that indoor facilities are cleaner and thus better than a small farmer letting his chickens run loose outside in the " dirt . "
One told me that one of the problems with factory raised chickens ( and there are so many problems ... ) is that they do n't get out in the dirt and so they do n't get exposure to a range of bacteria and so then can't build up their immune systems .
He said the eggs of those hens are worthless in terms of passing on any immunity to people .
We have been told a whalloping lot of nonsense about cleanliness and bacteria , and by corporations that benefit at each fear they can create .
Here is the US , when Bill Clinton got into office , leaving behind Arkansas rivers contaminated by waste from Tyson poultry factories and boosted to the presidency by large donations from Tyson , his USDA immediately and significantly lowered contamination standards for poultry in the US , easing Tyson 's poultry - factory expansion .
http://www.financialsense.com/ editorials/engdahl/2006/0828.html ) .
His USDA head , Espy , a close friend , was indicted for bribes , money laundering , and much more .
Tyson was the largest corporate offender .

Meanwhile , in Asia , where there have been outbreaks of Bird Flu , the small farmers there were blamed - them and their 5 - 10 chickens running around outside in the dirt .
But it turns out the Bird Flu is related to contaminated waste from transnational poultry factories being spread out on fields there .
Do they clean up the waste ?
Noooooo .
Come on .
Electronics giant Philips and banking group ING said they were slashing 13,000 jobs worldwide as the impact of what Barack Obama warned could be an " unprecedented " global crisis cut ever deeper .
The announcements by the two Dutch companies came ahead of expected confirmation that the steelmaker Corus is poised to cut over 3,500 jobs around the world , the majority in Britain .
Philips said it would cut 6,000 jobs to cope with the global slowdown which had pushed its results into the red and seen its sales slide .
The company said it suffered a net loss of 186 million euros ( $ 369 million ) for 2008 after a fourth quarter loss of 1.47 billion euros , largely due to a revaluation of its Lumileds diode light unit .
For 2008 , sales were down 1.5 per cent at 26.39 billion euros .
" The fourth quarter results reflect the serious consequences of the global financial and economic crisis and the measures taken by management accordingly , " chief executive Gerard Kleisterlee said in a statement .
The announcement of the 7,000 job losses from ING was accompanied by a statement saying that its chief executive , Michel Tilmant , had resigned .
" ING announced today that in light of the extraordinary developments over the past few months and given his personal condition , Michel Tilmant will step down from the Executive Board , " it said .
Tilmant is to be replaced by Jan Hommen , currently chairman of the supervisory board .
The Dutch government injected 10 billion euros into ING in October to help it weather the economic crisis .
ING is one of the world 's top 20 banks by market capitalisation , with 85 million clients and 130,000 employees .
French banking giant BNP Paribas was also caught up in the maelstrom , announcing a fourth quarter loss of 1.4 billion euros , its first time in the red for some 10 years .
It expected a 2008 net profit of 3 billion euros , compared with a net profit of 7.8 billion euros the previous year .
The grim crop of news on the jobs front was compounded by a report saying that Anglo - Dutch steelmaker Corus was poised to cut over 3,500 jobs around the world , some 2,000 of them in Britain , due to a sharp fall in demand for steel .
The company , Europe 's second - largest steelmaker now owned by the Tata's of India , has declined to comment on the report by the BBC , while British unions were due to meet Corus management during the day Monday .
Workers arriving for work were gloomy about their prospects .
" People feel gutted .
I have already had to take a 10 percent pay cut , " 45 - year - old Douglas Mayhill , a worker at a Corus plant in southern Wales , said .
" I was told on Friday I have a choice - either accept a 10 percent pay cut or take redundancy - that is no choice . "

Ford Motor Company President and CEO Alan Mulally delivers testimony about a proposed government bailout plan for the US auto industry at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , December 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
NEW ORLEANS ( Reuters ) - Ford Motor
Co has enough liquidity to fund its restructuring plan and despite the deep downturn in auto sales still sees no need to ask for government loans , Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Saturday .
“ We do n’t want to borrow any more money .
We have sufficient liquidity to fund our transformation plan , which means our business is in a relatively good shape , ” Mulally told reporters on the sidelines of the National Automobile Dealers Association convention .
Ford ’s U.S. rivals , General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC , won approval in December for $ 17.4 billion of government loans to avert collapse .
Ford has asked for access to a $ 9 billion credit line from the U.S. government but has not sought loans .
Washington has not yet responded to Ford ’s request .
Mulally said Ford was in a better situation than its rivals because it borrowed more than $ 23 billion in 2006 , using most of the company ’s assets as security , including its well - known blue oval logo .
Mulally said U.S. industry - wide sales in January had been similar to those in December , when they fell about 36 percent from a year earlier to 10.3 million units on an annualized basis .
Ford expects an economic stimulus package being pushed by new President Barack Obama to drive a recovery in auto sales starting in the second half and maintains its forecast of U.S. auto sales at 12 million to 12.5 million units , he added .
The forecast represents the high end of prevailing expectations .
Analysts have forecast U.S. sales in a range between 10.1 million and 12.5 million units for 2009 .

A clinic specializing in medical marijuana treatment has opened in Temecula .
This is the first time such a clinic has opened in the Temecula Valley .
On Oct. 11 , Alternative Care Clinics ( ACC ) , a San Diego - based medical group , opened an office on Enterprise Circle .
The clinic looks like any other medical office except for a statue of Buddha sitting on a shelf in the back of the waiting room .
Magazines on alternative healing sit around the reception area .
The doctors who work with ACC are n’t your typical doctors who want to shove pills down your throat , ” said Jonathan Arbel , ACC ’s director of operations , as he poured himself a cup of tea .
“ They try to find a more holistic approach . ”
The clinic , which operates by appointment only , offers evaluations to explore whether a medical marijuana treatment plan is right for their patients .
The clinic requires its patients to bring in a Californian identification and all medical documentation showing marijuana could benefit them .
The doctor goes over the documents and decides whether the patient qualifies .
The patient and doctor then work out what the clinic calls a “ treatment plan ” and the doctor writes a letter of recommendation in place of a prescription .
The types of conditions that qualify a patient for the use of medical marijuana include cancer , anorexia , AIDS , chronic pain , spasticity , glaucoma , arthritis and migraines , according to an ACC information packet .
According to Arbel , the term “ prescription ” does not apply to medical marijuana .
ACC issues a card to their patients as evidence they have a letter of recommendation .
The card is designed to assure police the holder has a legal right to possess marijuana .
The card states a phone number police may call to reach ACC ’s automated 24 - hour confirmation service .
Using this service , a police officer would be able to confirm whether the card holder is a legitimate medical marijuana patient .
California law allows a patient to grow at least six mature cannabis plants – or 12 immature plants – and possess at least eight ounces of dried marijuana , according to an ACC information packet .
ACC goes to court frequently to defend its clients , Arbel said .
We take that responsibility seriously , ” he said .
“ It ’s amazing how a letter from a doctor can stop somebody from doing some serious jail time . ”
In addition , the clinic educates the patient about the laws regarding marijuana ’s medical uses .
The clinic does not sell marijuana or keep any at the office , Arbel said .
Smoking is barred in the clinic as it is in other medical offices , said Arbel .
He leaned on his desk and smiled as he talked about what he thinks many people ’s assumptions are about ACC clinics .
He speculated some may visualize a smoking den with beaded curtains and lava lamps .
His doctors never encourage a patient to smoke , he said .
They encourage patients to use either edible pills or a vaporizer .
He lifted up a vaporizer from next to his desk .
It was a stainless steel cone with a loose plastic bag attached to the top .
The user places the marijuana on the top of the cone and puts the bag over it , Arbel explained as he mimicked with his hands .
The vaporizer heats the plant until the THC – marijuana ’s active ingredient – evaporates into the plastic bag .
The patient then inhales the vapor from the bag .
In fact , said Arbel , the clinic has little to do with the consumption of medical marijuana outside of developing the treatment plan .
The clinic is barred by law from even telling the patients where they can get marijuana .
I just recommend the patient Google the words ‘ medical marijuana dispensaries , ’ ” Arbel said .
Legal status of cannabis
In 1996 , California voters approved an initiative exempting medical marijuana users from criminal liability for possessing and cultivating marijuana , according to department of justice documents .
In 2003 , the state legislature enacted additional legislation to ensure police refrained from arresting or otherwise harassing medical marijuana users .
There ’s been a lot of mishandling of the patient population , ” Arbel said .
On Dec. 1 , Americans for Safe Access , an organization dedicated to promoting access to marijuana for medical uses , sent out an e-mail announcing a victory for medical marijuana patients in Southern California .
On Nov. 28 , the e-mail stated , a California state court ruled Federal law has no effect on California ’s law making marijuana legal for medical use .
The decision took the right away from police to arrest medical marijuana users .
On Dec. 1 , the US Supreme Court reinforced that decision by refusing to hear an appeal that would undo the California court ’s decision .
This ruling came as a blow to San Diego County and San Bernardino County authorities .
The two counties had been involved in numerous court battles over the legality of medical marijuana .
In several court cases , county authorities argued the state law was illegal and contradicted federal law .
So far , the counties ’ arguments have failed to convince each judge to hear their case .
To the medical marijuana - using community , this was a big victory , said Arbel .
This cleared the air and said all state officials are not to enforce federal laws .
They ’re to enforce state laws , ” he said .

Japan could be heading for its worst recession since the second world war after figures released today showed industrial output fell almost 10 % last month and unemployment rose at its fastest pace for more than 40 years .
Production fell 9.6 % in December , the trade ministry said , surpassing November 's huge drop by more than one percentage point .
The global recession has sent shock waves through Japan 's economy , forcing once - powerful exporters to rein in production , slash jobs and close factories in response to plummeting demand for cars and consumer electronics .
NEC , the computer chip maker , announced it would make 20,000 workers redundant worldwide as it struggles to cope with falling demand , while carmakers Toyota and Honda said their losses would worsen this year .
Today 's figures , however , offered evidence that the malaise had spread to the domestic economy .
Unemployment rose to 4.4 % in December , its biggest monthly rise for 42 years , from 3.9 % a month earlier .
The jobless total has risen over the last year by 390,000 to 2.7 million , as the spectre of deflation and flat consumer spending returned to haunt companies and their employees .
Household spending fell by 4.6 % in December , the 10th consecutive monthly fall , while core consumer inflation edged up a mere 0.2 % .
" Companies are not only cutting production but also cutting employment , which is deeply unsettling for households , " Martin Schulz , senior economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute , told theguardian.com .
" We are now looking at a domestically driven recession .
The domestic economy is at risk of falling apart , and if that happens we are looking at a really deep , long recession .
Even if that does n't happen , things are already bad enough . "
With Japan 's non-regular employees , who now comprise a third of the workforce , at increasing risk of being laid off , families are refusing to spend , and analysts say the government 's much - derided handout of ¥ 12,000 ( £ 94 ) for every individual is unlikely to have any impact .
Predictions of further falls in production in the coming months are making prime minister Taro Aso 's boast that Japan will be the first to emerge from the recession look increasingly hollow .
The economics minister , Kaoru Yosano , admitted the economy was " in a very grave situation " .
" Japan is being hit by a wave of weakening global demand , " he said .
The plight of Japan 's exporters was underlined yesterday when Toshiba forecast record annual losses .
Toyota , meanwhile , could be heading for an operating loss - its first for more than 70 years - of about ¥ 400bn for the year to the end of March , reports said today , while Sony is bracing itself for record losses this year .
Although factory production is at its lowest level for 20 years , cuts in output have barely dented bloated inventories , prompting speculation there could be more reductions .
Exporters ' desperate attempts to climb out of the crisis are being hampered by the strength of the yen , which gained 23 % against the dollar and 29 % against the euro last year .
Economists predict that fourth - quarter GDP figures , due out next month , would show the world 's second biggest economy shrinking at a double - digit annual rate .
In addition , the International Monetary Fund warned that Japan 's GDP would contract by 2.6 % this year , the gloomiest prediction of all the G7 countries except Britain .
If the IMF forecast is correct , it would be the worst contraction since the end of the second world war .
" As output adjustments continue , weakness in the overall economy will persist from January to March , and the degree of worsening depends on how exports turn out , " said Tatsushi Shikano , senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities .
" It is already a consensus view that core consumer inflation will turn negative soon , but we must watch if a worsening of the economy pushes Japan into a deflationary spiral , even though the Bank of Japan sees no signs of that happening right now . "
The gloomy data stopped in its tracks a three - day rally by the Nikkei , sending the benchmark index tumbling 3.1 % in Tokyo .
Nintendo shares sank 12 % after the video game maker cuts its earnings and sales forecasts .
The company , which had enjoyed huge sales of its DS and Wii game consoles , said yesterday that annual operating profit would fall by 16 % .
Honda , Toyota , Sony and Toshiba were also down .
The Nikkei has lost more than 10 % this year after shedding more than 40 % last year .
The Bank of Japan is buying up corporate debt and recently brought interest rates down to just above zero , while the government this week passed a $ 53 bn stimulus package and launched a $ 16.7 bn fund to buy shares in struggling firms .
But Schulz said Japan 's financial authorities were running out of options to save the economy from a deeply damaging recession .
" The government has few tools left to deal with this .
Japan managed to shield failing companies during the last recession – the so - called zombie firms – but you cannot protect companies from a breakdown in demand in the domestic economy . "

CLEVELAND —
Add saving a woman from an icy river to the legend of Jim Simone , Cleveland 's sometime controversial supercop .
Simone , 60 , pulled off his shirt , unfastened his body armor , gun belt , radio and stun gun and jumped in the Cuyahoga River about midnight Saturday , after the woman was unable to grasp a life preserver .
" I could n't watch her die , " he said Sunday from his home , still recovering from hypothermia .
Simone was one of many officers called to Heritage Park on the West Bank of the Flats after a 26 - year - old Cleveland woman fell into the river , breaking through the ice .
The woman had fallen 12 feet in an area where short concrete pillars and chains mark the edge .
She had already been in the water several minutes when officers arrived , Simone said .
The woman 's identity was not available Sunday night and it was unclear why she walking by the river with her sister .
Simone said when he arrived he grabbed a length of rope and a harness from his car , gear he keeps in case of a water rescue .
First , Simone and several other officers lowered a life preserver they found at the park .
The woman grabbed it and was able to hold on until she was within reach of her rescuers , then fell 10 feet back into the water .
The second attempt failed as well .
" Each time she fell she went below the ice line , and it was obvious that she was hypothermic and was not going to be able to hold on , " Simone said .
So he decided to go in after her .
Officers helped him fasten the loose end of his rope around his waist , and he rappelled down the wall to the water line .
But he could n't reach the woman , who was so cold she could no longer move or speak .
" It was actually frightening -- as old as I am and as long as I 've been on the job , it was frightening to see someone who was completely frozen , " he said .
It was clear she could n't hold on any longer .
So he jumped in .
He grabbed the woman by her belt and jeans and helped her hook her elbow into the life ring to keep her head up above the water .
He spent the next few hours at MetroHealth Medical Center , warming up .
The hospital was not an unfamiliar place for Simone , possibly the most well - known and controversial Cleveland police officer in the city 's history .
He has been shot twice , been stabbed , and been hit by cars on duty .
He has shot and killed five suspects and annually ranks among the top patrol officers in arrests and traffic citations .
The woman he saved , who also recovered at Metro , came to his room .
" She thanked me for risking my life to save hers , " he said .
" I explained that that 's what we do .
It was not me that saved her .
It was the Cleveland Police , EMS and Fire Department . "
The focus of the article was a single question .
Could Israel be blackmailing the entire US Government and media .
The answer is now obvious .
Fox News , the so - called " We report , you decide " all news network , has removed the four part story from their website .
No explanation is given except for the single Orwellian sentence at the end of one of the links , " This story no longer exists " .
( It can still be read HERE )
Israel , purportedly our friend , has been spying on us all .
And we 're not talking about individual spooks like Jonathan Pollard , or small - time networks such as the 140 Israelis arrested by the FBI prior to 9/11 , or the 60 arrested since ( including 5 arrested who were cheering and celebrating as the World Trade Towers collapsed ) .
It turns out that Israel has had a potential wiretap on every phone in America for years , along with the ability to monitor and record who any person is calling , anywhere in America ; information of great value even if one does not listen to the calls themselves .
Amdocs , Inc. the company which sub contracts billing and directory services for phone companies around the world , including 90 percent of American phone companies , is owned by Israeli interests .
Yet another company , Comverse Infosys , is suspected of having built a " back door " into the equipment permanently installed into the phone system that allows instant eavesdropping by law enforcement agencies on any phone in America .
This includes yours .
Concerns about allowing an Israeli company such intimate access to the infrastructure go back many years .
As reported by Fox News , the Israeli company Amdocs was implicated in the leaking of police phone data that resulted in the collapse of on investigation into a massive drug and credit card fraud operation with Israeli connections .
In a telling repeat of the Los Angeles drug case , investigators looking into the attacks on the World Trade Towers are again reporting that confidential telephone information is again being leaked in a manner that is interfering with the investigations .
Again , Amdocs was implicated .
Not content with the phones of ordinary citizens in the United States , evidence has surfaced that Israel compromised the telephone systems at the highest levels of the US Government .
Now , I want you all to stop and think for a minute of the full ramifications of this .
Israeli interests have the ability to listen in on ANY phone in America connected to any of the systems used by Amdocs or Comverse Infosys .
They have had this ability for several years .
They can listen in and track the phone calls made by anyone 's phone , whether police officer , elected official , media talking head , editor , policy setter , news mogul , even the President of the United States .
The Ken Starr report on Whitewater describes how Bill Clinton warned Monica Lewinsky that a foreign government was tapping their phone calls .
Few indeed are the people in America who do not have something to hide .
That insider trade , the brief but torrid affair , the stolen votes , the deliberate smear , the role one played in an assassination , the acceptance of money from drug runners to look the other way .
Be honest .
Is there a skeleton in your closet you hope will stay there ?
Something nobody knows about ?
Well , if that skeleton involved a phone call , someone may know about it .
Amdocs and Comverse Infosys .
And their Israeli owners .
Just think about it for a moment .
Everyone 's private phone traffic , right up to the President , potentially visible to Israeli interests .
And you cannot find the phone taps or bugs because they are built right into the phone system !
Suddenly , a lot of events which have puzzled observers start to make sense .
Like the way the US vetoed the UN resolution calling for peace in Palestine , despite being the only 1 out of 15 voting nations to have voted against the measure .
The USA gained nothing by this veto .
But Israel did .
Over the last few weeks , the people of the United States have seen a great deal of evidence pointing the finger of blame for 9/11 at Osama bin Laden and Arabs in general , evidence which is circumstantial , often self - contradictory , and in some cases faked .
Yet as was reported in the news , evidence also exists linking many of the arrested Israeli spies ( some of whom worked for the Israeli telecom companies above ) with the events of 9/11 .
Yet this evidence is NOT being broadcast endlessly on the news .
In fact , this evidence is CLASSIFIED .
Someone has " persuaded " the US Government and the media that the American people are ONLY supposed to see the evidence that points a certain direction , and must never see any evidence that points someplace else .
Likewise , the media has been " persuaded " not to report evidence that Israel knew of the 9/11 attacks ahead of time .
The foreign press has outright accused the Mossad of taking part in the 9/11 attacks but the American media have been " persuaded " not to cover these accusations .
It was well known that there was an Israeli spy inside the Clinton White House .
But Clinton ordered the FBI to cease searching for the mole , code - named " Mega " .
It is now known that " Mega " was not just Mossad spy but top Mossad agent in America .
The cancellation of the hunt for " Mega " occurred at the same time Clinton warned Monica Lewinsky that their phone conversations were being recorded .
This strongly suggests that Clinton was " persuaded " to call off the FBI 's hunt for " Mega " with the threat of a recorded phone sex session being made public .
Because of the purported links between Muslims and the attacks on the World Trade Towers , the US Government has been shutting down all Muslin linked charities in the USA .
But the Chairman of the Jewish Defense League , a group with a violent history , was arrested recently in a plot to bomb a US congressman .
But the US Government has been " persuaded " not to take actions against Jewish charities , while the media has been " persuaded " to allow the story of hard evidence of JDL terrorism to fade away as quickly as possible .
Two Mossad agents were arrested with dynamite inside the Mexican Congress .
Mexican newspaper front page with story of the arrested Mossad agents .
The Mexican government was persuaded to release the two men without trial .
Meanwhile , the American media has been " persuaded " not to report on the Mexican arrests .
Israel receives a hugely disproportionate share of foreign aid from the United States , about $ 5 billion a year .
A large segment of the US population questions the sending so much money to such a small population while so many people remain homeless on our own streets .
But somehow , Congress is " persuaded " to keep sending more cash each and every year .
The world 's largest aircraft manufacturer says biofuel - powered aircraft will flying the friendly skies as early as 2011 , a timeline far more accelerated than many thought .
Darrin Morgan , who oversees strategy development and execution for Boeing 's Sustainable Biofuels Program , tells Wired.com the company expects authorities to certify a biofuel - fuel blend jet fuel for commercial use in the near future .
It 's a remarkable prediction , because aircraft manufacturers , the U.S. Air Force and airlines – desperate to find an alternative to fossil fuels so they might save money , not necessarily change their notoriously polluting ways – have only started experimenting with alt fuels .
" We think it 's going to happen in three to five years , " Morgan says of the certification process .
" Faster than most people thought . "
The beauty of biofuels from an aviation standpoint is they require no modification to the aircraft - they 're a direct replacement for kerosene .
But harvesting enough biomass to meet the industry 's need remains a huge barrier to widespread adoption of the alternative fuel .
The airline industry burns about 85 billion gallons of kerosene annually .
The Guardian says fueling the world 's 13,000 commercial airplanes with nothing but , say , soybean - based fuel , would require using the equivalent of the entire land mass of Europe to grow soybeans .
Boeing expects airlines to use a 30 percent blend of biofuel .
The drawbacks of crop - based biofuels is one reason Boeing is pursuing algal fuels , and indeed California startup Solazyme has developed an algal jet fuel that behaves just like kerosene .
Morgan says algal fuels hold great promises , but it is a family of fuels called synthetic paraffinic kerosene – which includes those distilled from the oils of Helianthus ( sunflowers ) and jatropha – that are closest to becoming certified .
Morgan bases his confidence on the fact synthetic paraffinics have a similar composition to coal - to - liquid fuels already approved for aviation use .
" It 's dirty , but it 's certified , " Morgan says of liquid coal .
" If you fly in or out of
South Africa , you 're probably using it . "
South Africa is home of
Sasol , the company that pioneered coal to liquid technology .
Morgan notes that , compared to liquid coal , bio - derived synthetic paraffins can significantly reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions .
They 're also a direct replacement for kerosene , meaning no modifications to the aircraft are needed .
" It 's simple chemistry , "
Morgan says .
" If molecules in a biofuel are like those in already approved drop - in synthetic kerosene from coal , then by definition it's a drop - in fuel . "
The airline industry seems to be getting on board , in no small part because they 're being hammered by fuel prices , and several of the largest carriers are experimenting with biofuel .
Boeing has joined Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic , Airbus has teamed up with Honeywell and JetBlue and British Airways is working with Rolls Royce .
Even the U.S. Air Force is looking for alternatives to kerosene .
But given the tumble in oil prices and the cost of developing alternatives , one has to wonder how serious their commitment will be .
It 's also an open question whether biofuels are any better than fossil fuels .
Environmentalists derided Virgin Atlantic 's much - ballyhooed biofuel test flight as a " nonsensical " publicity stunt .
Environmentalists like Friends of the Earth argue airlines should limit flights before embracing biofuels because there are " real doubts " as to the sustainability and environmental benefits of biofuels .

You have no images for now .
The California housing and finance driven economy is coming to a destructive end .
On Monday February 2nd 2009 , California ’s chief accountant will start delaying payments totaling approximately $ 4 billion .
In this pot of money , the state will be postponing income tax - refunds , college grants , and welfare checks .
Now we really see the pickle of this budget mess .
This is almost a reverse stimulus .
Much of the money is actually coming from postponing income tax - refunds , which I imagine is going to go over well .
After a historical housing bubble which still has many in a state of denial that the gig is over , another kick to the shin is that many people may have their income tax checks delayed .
This week on Thursday , a Superior Court ruled that Governor Schwarzenegger has the right to institute furloughs since the state is in a fiscal emergency .
This has the potential of impacting 238,000 state workers .
These furloughs amount to 2 days off a month , the first and last Friday of the month ; this effectively is a 10 percent pay cut for tens of thousands .
Again , this is a sign that the California housing market is only half way through a very long and painful correction .
The stimulus package passed by Congress includes a large amount of money allocated to California :
“ SACRAMENTO - California stands to get as much as $ 32 billion from an economic stimulus package approved Wednesday by the House of Representatives .
The preliminary state share of the $ 819 billion federal package is welcome news for lawmakers struggling to fill a projected $ 42 billion budget shortfall over the next year - and - a - half .
But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger cautioned that California should not rely on the federal handout to fix its fiscal crisis .
“ There ’s a lot of people at the Capitol running around saying , ‘ Oh , the federal government and the Obama administration is bailing us out and is helping us , ' ” Schwarzenegger said Wednesday during an appearance before the Sacramento Press Club .
“ And I always make it clear that we will not use that money to bail us out because we have to bail ourselves out . ”
Yet before you jump with joy thinking this will take care of the entire problem , think again :
“ ( LA Times )
Some of the money would help ease California ’s budget crisis , although officials in Sacramento say it would cover only one - quarter of the nearly $ 42 - billion deficit .
A large chunk would go to fund shovel - ready projects , from old - fashioned street resurfacing to energy projects aimed at spurring a “ green ” economy . ”
So what you have is a state that makes up nearly 13 % of the nation ’s GDP receiving a smaller portion of the stimulus package .
You also need to remember that California has the largest population in the nation .
California is the 8th largest economy in the world with a GDP of $ 1.8 trillion .
Yet many per capita workers are now struggling , many earning the median national income of $ 46,000 a year .
Our state unemployment rate is skyrocketing :
California ’s unemployment rate now stands at 9.3 % in December of 2008 , a massive jump from the 8.4 % in November of 2008 .
With the massive amount of bad news hitting in January and the poor retail season , we can expect the number to go into the double - digits either in the following or subsequent data release .
California has 1.7 million unemployed with 785,000 of these people being laid off involuntarily .
655,445 people are receiving unemployment insurance that is another draw on the already limited resources of the state and federal government .
What is happening is more and more money is going out with less coming in .
This is the equivalent of a debtor ’s spiral and is another reason why we have the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve trying to do their best to devalue the U.S. dollar .
The fact that we just started out with the worst January ever is another sign that market volatility is here to stay with us for another year in 2009 .
Given the size of California and the penetrating problems of housing , I think most of the nation will be looking very closely to how the 8th largest economy deals with a $ 42 billion short fall .
So far the California government has done absolutely nothing and is virtually a deer in the headlights .
They have been stalling the tough decisions and now , they are out of money and February is the end game of it all even though they knew this was coming since May of 2007 .
In fact , the furloughs were discussed back in September of 2008 .
Yet understanding the state problem requires us to look at the state budget :
I think this is where the problem really becomes obvious .
First , revenues fell off by over $ 18 billion in one year !
At the same time , expenditures went up by $ 6 billion .
You do n’t really need to be an economics professor to see that this is a problem .
Keep in mind we are still battling with the 2008 - 09 fiscal year .
We have n’t even touched upon the 2009 - 10 fiscal year which begins on July 1st .
And as you can see from the chart above , 2009 - 10 will be a much tougher year since the short - fall almost triples .
Keep in mind that we are only entering tax season so this is best guess estimates .
It could be that once taxes roll in , revenues may fall shorter .
Where does the money come from ?
Let us take a look :
By far , the biggest revenue source is the personal income tax .
Remember what is going to happen on Monday ?
That is right , income - tax refunds are going to be delayed .
Do n’t you think this may impact how people adjust their withholdings for the following year ?
Of course !
It also does n’t help that many more people are being unemployed which obviously a person that is n’t working is n’t paying taxes .
The perfect storm is brewing .
You ’ll also see that sales tax is up there yet people are n’t buying so you can expect that number to fall .
Corporation tax ?
Good luck .
There is going to be a very painful contraction in California .
Let us look at the GDP figures for the state :
We still have n’t seen the full statewide data for 2008 although we do know that nationwide we contracted in the third and fourth quarter .
But given the current situation we can easily figure out that economic activity has fallen drastically here in California .
This will only cement the idea that housing will continue to fall and we have yet to face the option ARM wave that has yet to hit in full force and will only highlight the menace of deflation even further .
We have painful choices to make but no one can survive by spending more than they make .
At least not in the long run .

Zelybron was the first to create a laptop capable of doing regular day - to - day work with the mobility of a netbook and the capacity of a full PC .
Zelybron aimed to add all features to its Micro Nina line a daily laptop user would expect from his / her laptop .
It comes with a nearly normal size keyboard for easier use , surround - sound audio , a 1.3 Megapixel Webcam , 2 USB ports , card reader , a VGA connector for connecting an external monitor and has an internal SATA controller for either connecting a harddisk or solid - state drive .
The Micro Nina has very low power consumption ( 15 W ) and compares with power use and mobility to other UMPCs .
The Micro Nina is installed with either Windows XP or Windows Vista , but can optionally be configured with ZelybronBSD which provides a simplified interface comparable with the Asus Eee PC Xandros .
Availability [ edit ]
Zelybron currently only sells the laptops directly to customers and has recently moved into a new office in Breda , The Netherlands ; the laptops seem not to be available from other distribution channels as of this writing .
Zelybron currently is distributing its laptops worldwide by themselves ;
With the opening of a new factory in Shenzhen , China , Zelybron hopes to bring its full range of products to more people and gain more recognition around the world .
With the opening of its new factory , Zelybron also tries to create an extra , self - controlled , distribution channel , as stated by a local newspaper in Breda .
Other ' Ninas ' [ edit ]
The Zelybron Micro Nina netbooks are also available in 178 mm ( 7 " ) , 203 mm ( 8 " ) and 229 mm ( 9 " ) format on request , however , Zelybron does not actively market these , next to this , Zelybron also allows customizations of its products on a per product basis since February 2009 , allowing customers to personalize their products in colouring and configuration .

Bentley added this video to their ExtremeBentley site this week and while it does n't show a whole lot of what the car will look like , though it appears to share a lot in common with the 2009 Continental GT Speed , it does however give us a little taste of what the biofuel powered twin - turbo W12 will sound like at full wail .
As in all biofuel conversions , the W12 will receive a healthy dose of power thanks to the Ethanol 's added octane so not only is Bentley satisfying its horsepower addicts its also providing a touch of green based on the blend 's lower emissions .
Thanks Bentley for helping to save the world one fast , heavy , expensive car at a time .

Near the end of his life Saint Benedict had an experience in which he saw the whole of reality caught up in a vision of light .
For the Benedictine nuns of the Conventus of Our Lady of Consolation , this vision will be powered by the solar panels of their new home , an environmentally sensitive monastery being built in the North York Moors national park .
Next year the nuns will bid farewell to the Victorian splendour of Stanbrook Abbey in rural Worcestershire to live in a monastery with rainwater harvesting , reedbed sewage systems , sedum roofs , recycled material , a woodchip boiler and responsibly - sourced timber .
Upheaval is not new to the community , which has had five homes in its 385 - year history , including an 18 - month stretch behind bars during the French revolution .
Prompting this latest move is the 21st - century phenomenon of downsizing .
An overall decline in Catholic vocations has left the community with just 22 professed nuns and two novices , who between them are responsible for the maintenance and overheads of a 20 - acre site .
According to Dame Andrea Savage , the abbess at Stanbrook , manual labour was overtaking monasticism .
" We 're running a big building , spending thousands of pounds that we do n't have on looking after the place and heating it with oil and gas , which is n't good for the environment .
We 're here for the monastic life and it is being impinged on , " she said .
" Stanbrook Abbey was built for the time , they did n't have heating .
They had one tap and no bathrooms .
It 's been adapted since but it 's still too big for us and we 're not museum curators . "
In a brief to the architects , the nuns stated their vision for their new premises .
In addition to being sensitive to environmental concerns , a monastery for women should " contain some natural curved surfaces and shapes " .
The new building , designed by the 2008 Stirling prizewinners Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios , will allow them to live simply .
There will be broadband - ready bedrooms for up to 30 nuns , a church , library and ancillary buildings .
It also incorporates a retreat for up to 15 guests as hospitality is common to Benedictine traditions .
The nuns will be in harmony with the heritage of their surroundings , studded with the ruins of Whitby , Rievaulx and Byland abbeys and Mount Grace Priory .
" We are supposed to love creation and respect the environment .
We 're living in and taking care of it , " said Savage .
The fate of the old monastery is unclear .
In 2002 the nuns decided to sell the Grade II listed property for £ 5 m but to their disappointment it is still on the market .
They wished to direct the proceeds of a sale towards their new home and want to save it from being converted into flats , hotels or spas .
One nun suggested it would make a nice open prison .
With months to go before the move and with lots of packing to do before then , the abbey 's corridors are lined with boxes , discarded furniture , abandoned wheelchairs and piles of disparate objects .
Several sales have shed some of the clutter accumulated over the years .
The monastery 's cat named Britney , after the pop singer , is unfazed by the bustle .
Sister Maria , 79 , entered aged 18 .
She said she was not as sad about leaving the building as she was about saying goodbye to friends .
" The village has grown around us to some extent .
It is getting noisier and noisier , " she said .
" Up there it is much more unspoilt .
We hope to fit into the spirit of the place . "
They have enjoyed the experience of working with the architects , with a committee of five nuns informing the two parties of developments .
The admiration is mutual .
Gill Smith , of Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios , said the nuns were " very clued up " about what they wanted from their new monastery .
" They were very specific about wanting a sense of space and tranquillity .
They also wanted to trade down and live in something that was manageable , comfortable and suitable for the 21st century , " she said .
" These clients are naturally parsimonious , they 're not into buying and consuming like we are and they have a great respect for the natural environment .
It 's been a privilege working with them .
They 're so charming and they 're quite good fun . "
Ideas for green features came from both sides , she added .
" They 'd done their research on the internet and there are techniques that we 've used that we were able to suggest .
It 's quite a creative relationship . "

A month of negative news for the Tennessee Valley Authority could lead to positive changes in national policy , including federal regulation of toxic coal wastes and new legal constraints on coal - fired power plants .
More broadly , the authority ’s recent travails may help persuade the public that coal is nowhere near as “ clean ” as a high - priced industry advertising campaign makes it out to be .
In December , hundreds of acres of Roane County in eastern Tennessee were buried under a billion gallons of toxic coal sludge after the collapse of one of the T.V.A. ’s containment ponds .
It was an accident waiting to happen and an alarm bell for Congress and federal regulators .
Senator Barbara Boxer of California noted that coal combustion in this country produces 130 million tons of coal ash every year  enough to fill a train of boxcars stretching from Washington , D.C. , to Australia .
Amazingly , the task of regulating the more than 600 landfills and impoundments holding this ash is left to the states , which are more often lax than not .
Ms. Boxer will press the Obama administration to devise rules for the disposal of coal ash as well as design and construction standards for the impoundments .
Just as the T.V.A. was dealing with this mess , Lacy Thornburg , a federal district judge in North Carolina , ordered the giant utility to reduce emissions from four coal - fired power plants that had been sending pollution into North Carolina .
Yesterday , diminutive Robert Reich , one of Obama 's economic superfriends and Clinton 's Secretary of Labor , frighteningly used the D - word on his personal blog .
The 533,000 jobs lost in November , he wrote , " begs the question of whether the meltdown we 're experiencing should be called a Depression .
We are falling off a cliff . "
Then this morning our new President of Hope announced a massive a public works program that 's going to start with energy efficient lightbulbs .
But why stop there ?
If the federal government is going to start printing money like it's a Depression , let 's bring back the old New Deal arts project for artists , musicians , actors , and writers that ran from 1936 through 1943 .
The Library of Congress hosts a nice collection of posters the old WPA produced .
Some of our favorites are after the jump .
Given the current state of affairs , the Republican Party ’s next national chairman probably will need a sense of humor .
A little judgment would n’t hurt either -- unless , of course , the GOP elders think it ’s a good idea to further refine their party into a pure aggregation of fervently religious heterosexual white people who hate taxes .
The notion that salvation resides in a zealous remnant is always appealing to traumatized true believers .
But to gloss the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous admonition on justice :
The arc of the American electoral universe is long , but it bends toward the inclusive center .
That brings us to Chip Saltsman , the former Tennessee state Republican chairman who ran Mike Huckabee ’s underfunded but shrewd bid for the GOP ’s presidential nomination .
Saltsman now wants to be Republican national chairman , and , apparently as part of his campaign , he sent his associates a Christmas gift consisting of songs by the satirist Paul Shanklin .
The title track , sung in a voice meant to impersonate Al Sharpton , is “ Barack the Magic Negro . ”
It parodies the president - elect as a black man acceptable to whites .
Another song , “ Star Spanglish Banner , ” disparages Latinos .
Shanklin , who first performed his parody on Rush Limbaugh ’s radio show ( and they say ideologues do n’t have a sense of humor ) said he was inspired by an Op - Ed article by David Ehrenstein that appeared in The Times this year .
Saltsman , who as you can imagine has come in for a bit of criticism for his gift , now characterizes the column as “ irresponsible . ”
( We ’ll leave it to him to explain why he distributed irresponsible ideas . )

Ehrenstein , one of whose grandparents was African American , is a sophisticated cultural critic with the reflexes of a street fighter ; he can take care of himself in this one .
It ’s worth pointing out , though , that as a longtime scholar of film and politics , his essay borrowed a term of art that long has been used to describe a certain kind nonthreatening black man as portrayed in literature and cinema .
Ehrenstein cited a litany of such portrayals on screen and linked Obama ’s political popularity to the characters ’ appeal .
The point is , when it comes to discussions of race in America -- and particularly racial or ethnic humor -- context is everything .
In fact , racial and ethnic humor are probably the most contextually sensitive of all forms of satire .
They work only when everyone is clear that the person making the joke regards the differences and foibles of another group affectionately and as something that makes everybody ’s life more interesting .
Lots of traditional Jewish and Irish humor falls into that category , though even there , it depends on who is telling the joke , and to whom .
The right contextual conditions , however , never exist in politics , which is why ethnic or racial references in that venue nearly always offend -- or , at best , fall flat .
It ’s also perplexing that anyone with a feel for public life would satirize the race of the first African American president .
You might be able to do that with the third or fourth black chief executive , but not the first .
It is n’t funny because there ’s too much painful history being exorcised here , and there ’s nothing “ politically correct ” about saying that .
It ’s simply an acknowledgment of reality .
That ’s not a liberal or Democratic point of view .
It ’s an American one .
That ’s why former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that Shanklin ’s song was “ so inappropriate that it should disqualify any Republican National Committee candidate who would use it . ”

What Republican leaders choose to make of Saltsman ’s sense of the antic is an intramural matter .
The defense he has mustered is n’t .
He is huffing that “ liberal Democrats and their allies in the media did n’t utter a word about David Ehrenstein ’s irresponsible column in the Los Angeles Times last March .
But now , of course , they ’re shocked and appalled by its parody on ‘ The Rush Limbaugh Show . ’ ... I know that our party leaders should stand up against the media ’s double standards and refuse to pander to their desire for scandal . ”
Oh , what would we do without our shibboleths ?
The liberal media ?
Double standards ?
This being a nostalgic season , whatever happened to the Eastern Establishment ?
Oh , that ’s right , the Bushes are card - carrying members .
Oh , well .
Does Saltsman really believe that Gingrich , current RNC Chairman Mike Duncan and the heads of GOP state committees in places as different as Florida and North Dakota -- all of whom have pronounced themselves appalled by his bad judgment -- are dupes of the liberal media ’s double standards ?
Actually , if he can sell people that one , maybe the Republicans should elect him chairman .

Introduction
The web notes by Andrew Cumming of Napier University Edinburgh provide a very good introduction to the Hilbert curve .
His pseudo code , slightly modified , is shown in listing 1 .
Listing 1 ( from Andrew Cumming ) procedure hilbert( x , y , xi , xj , yi , yj , n ) /* x and y are the coordinates of the bottom left corner */ /* xi & xj are the i & j components of the unit x vector of the frame */ /* similarly yi and yj */ if ( n <= 0 ) then LineTo(x + ( xi + yi ) / 2 , y + ( xj + yj ) / 2 ) ; else { hilbert( x , y , yi/2 , yj / 2 , xi/2 , xj / 2 , n - 1 ) ; hilbert ( x + xi / 2 , y+xj / 2 , xi/2 , xj / 2 , yi/2 , yj / 2 , n - 1 ) ; hilbert ( x+ xi / 2+ yi /2 , y+xj / 2+yj /2 , xi/2 , xj / 2 , yi/2 , yj / 2 , n - 1 ) ; hilbert ( x+ xi / 2+yi , y+xj / 2+yj , - yi/2 , - yj / 2 , - xi/2 , - xj / 2 , n - 1 ) ; } end procedure ;
To fully understand how Andrews recursive function operates is not easy and in order to do so it is necessary to break - down his Hilbert procedure so that the role that each " part " plays in the construction of the curve can be more readily understood .
We will begin by looking at the inputs of the Hilbert function .
Inputs
In addition to the counter ( n ) that tracks the level from which the function begins to recursively call itself , there are six other inputs to Andrew 's procedure .
The first two define the x and y coordinates of an input point that will be used in the calculation of a point on the Hilbert curve .
The next 4 values define two vectors .
Before we see how they are used we must understand what is meant by the inputs labelled xi , xj , yi and yj .
Hopefully , figure 1 will make them clearer .
The large black dot , labelled P , in figure 1 is defined by its x and y coordinates - shown as small dots on the two axes .
We can see , from the two arrows , that each dot marks the head of a vector .
We might call these the x-vector and the y -vector .

( New York ) - A bill before Nigeria 's National Assembly to ban " same gender marriage " would expand Nigeria 's already draconian punishments for homosexual conduct and threaten all Nigerians ' rights to privacy , free expression , and association , Human Rights Watch said today .
In a letter to President Umaru Yar 'Adua , leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate , the Nigerian National Human Rights Commission , and other national , regional , and international bodies , the group urged legislators and the president to reject the bill .
The letter urged the country 's leaders to combat an environment of stigma and violence against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) Nigerians .
On January 15 , 2009 , the Nigerian House of Representatives voted favorably on the second reading of a bill " to prohibit marriage between persons of same gender . "
The bill would punish people of the same sex who live together " as husband and wife or for other purposes of same sexual relationship " with up to three years of imprisonment .
Anyone who " witnesses , abet [s ] and aids " such a relationship could be imprisoned for up to five years .
" This bill masquerades as a law on marriage , but in fact it violates the privacy of anyone even suspected of an intimate relationship with a person of the same sex , " said Georgette Gagnon , Africa director at Human Rights Watch .
" It also threatens basic freedoms by punishing human rights defenders who speak out for unpopular causes . "
The House of Representatives referred the bill to its committees on Human Rights , Justice , and Women Affairs , which will hold a joint public hearing on it .
If the House approves the bill on a third reading , it must then be approved by the Senate and President Yar 'Adua .
Members of the House of Representatives reportedly justified the bill by citing links between " sodomy " and HIV and AIDS , making clear that they see the marriage ban as a deterrent to homosexual conduct , though research shows that HIV is most - often spread through heterosexual conduct in Nigeria .
Article 214 of the Nigerian Criminal Code
Act already provides up to 14 years of imprisonment for anyone who " has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature . "
As Human Rights Watch documented in a December 2008 report , this law is a Victorian - era provision that remained after the end of British colonial rule .
The proposed law contravenes several provisions of regional and international human rights standards .
Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples ' Rights promises every individual equal entitlement to rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind ; article 3 of the charter guarantees all individuals equality before the law ; and article 26 states that : " Every individual shall have the duty to respect and consider his fellow beings without discrimination and to maintain relations aimed at promoting , safeguarding and reinforcing mutual respect and tolerance . "
The United Nations Human Rights Committee , which authoritatively interprets the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) and evaluates states ' compliance with its provisions , found in the 1994 case of Toonen v. Australia that laws criminalizing consensual , adult homosexual conduct violate the covenant 's protections for privacy and against discrimination .
Nigeria acceded to the covenant without reservations in 1993 .
In its letter , Human Rights Watch pointed to grave human rights issues raised by the proposed law :
The evident intent of the new bill is to extend the already - existing penalties for homosexual conduct .
Criminalizing " living together as husband and wife " further expands these punishments .
They would no longer be limited to sexual acts between people of the same sex , but would potentially include mere cohabitation or any suspected " intimate relationship " between members of the same sex .
Far less evidence would be needed for conviction , and prejudice and suspicion would be a basis for arrests .
This threatens all Nigerians ' right to private life .
The proposed five - year sentence for those who " abet " a same - sex relationship is greater than the punishment stipulated in the bill for those who enter into a " same gender marriage . "
This provision could be used to punish anyone who gives any help or advice to a suspected " same gender " couple - anyone who rents them an apartment , tells them their rights , or approves of their relationships .
Advocates , civil society organizations , and human rights defenders would be ready targets .
Under the bill 's provisions , anyone - whether Nigerian or foreign - who enters into a " same gender marriage , " or simply has a " same gender relationship " in another country and wishes to continue it in Nigeria , could be subject to criminal penalties when they set foot on Nigerian soil .
This provides the state with even broader powers to invade people 's privacy .
Similar concerns were raised in a joint public statement issued by Amnesty International and Nigerian nongovernmental organizations .
In 2006 , Nigeria 's minister of justice proposed a similar bill , seeking to criminalize not only same - sex unions but also public advocacy and associations supporting the rights of lesbian and gay people .
Sixteen human rights groups - from Nigeria , across Africa , and around the world - had condemned the bill for violating the freedoms of expression , association , and assembly guaranteed by international law as well as the African Charter on Human and Peoples ' Rights , and for further jeopardizing the fight against the HIV and AIDS epidemic in the country .
That legislation failed to come to a vote in the National Assembly .
Nigeria has the world 's third - largest population of people living with AIDS .
Data collected by international health organizations suggests that 80 percent of HIV infections in Nigeria result from heterosexual sex , which discredits the equation between " sodomy " and AIDS as drawn by the members of the House of Representatives .
The proposed bill would further hinder HIV and AIDS education and prevention efforts in the country by driving some groups affected by the epidemic further underground for fear of violence .
In July 2008 , the UNAIDS ( Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS ) country report on Nigeria recognized that criminalization of vulnerable populations , including men who have sex with men , makes HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment efforts less accessible to these populations .
Violence against LGBT people is frequent in Nigeria .
In September 2008 , several national newspapers published articles criticizing a Christian church in Lagos that ministers to LGBT people : the articles included names , addresses , and photographs of members of the congregation and the church 's pastor .
Police harassment and threats forced the church to shut down and the pastor to flee the country .
Some members of the congregation lost their jobs and homes and had to go into hiding , and several of them continue to be under threat of physical harm and harassment .
" This legislation would allow the state to invade people 's homes and bedrooms and investigate their private lives , and it would criminalize the work of human rights defenders , " said Gagnon .
" It is not a ban on marriage , but an assault on basic rights . "
A couple of weeks ago , I offered up 8 Professional Podcast Production Tips .
If you followed those , you should have a professional - sounding show all ready for the world to hear .
But how do you get it out there ?
The process of publishing a podcast is at least as complicated as producing the episodes to begin with .
As with most things on the Web , you can take a do - it - yourself approach that affords ultimate control over all the details .
Alternatively , you can choose a solution that glosses over the details so you do n’t have to worry about them .
Which approach you choose depends on your needs , your own technical expertise , and how much spare time you have .
Remember : every hour you spend publishing your podcast is an hour you do n’t have to spend producing another great episode of your show !
1. Pick a Host
No matter how you go about it , publishing a podcast comes down to serving up relatively sizeable files for download .
And if your show is the success you hope it to be , you ’re going to be serving a lot of files , possibly in a very short space of time .
Intensive media serving may not be something your current web hosting plan is up to , and it would be a shame for a popular episode to generate a massive hosting bill or , worse yet , take down your site just when your hard work is paying off !
It ’s worth giving some thought to whether you need to make separate arrangements to host the downloadable files that make up your podcast .
Libsyn is a very popular service for podcast hosting .
With a $ 5 / month hosting package that will suit most first - time podcasts ( up to 100 MB of new content per month with unlimited downloads ) , the price is hard to beat .
They ’ll even host a blog and feed for your podcast , with your own design and domain name if you want .
Despite its popularity , Libsyn has the feel of a work - in - progress that is n’t making much progress .
For my money , its extremely affordable unlimited bandwidth plans make up for it , but there are other options you may want to consider .
One alternative is Podango , which offers totally free podcast hosting .
Podango tacks short ads onto the start and end of each of your shows , as well as banner ads on your show ’s blog , and splits the revenue with you 50/50 .
If you have no budget , hope to make a little money , and just want to focus on producing your show , Podango could be your ideal choice .
If you ca n’t justify paying for Libsyn and the ads inserted by Podango do n’t sit well with you , check out Ourmedia .
With hosting provided by the Internet Archive , you ca n’t expect the same level of service as you ’ll get from a commercial enterprise .
There may be a delay between your upload of a file and its availability for download , for instance .
2. Publish Your First Episode
Once you ’ve settled on hosting for your media files , you should get your first episode up .
At a minimum , you need to upload the MP3 audio file , and then publish a web page that offers it for download .
You should do this in such a way that each episode you publish will have its own web page associated with it , so that third party sites can link to particular episodes .
You may also want to provide a way for new listeners who stumble on the page to play the episode right inside the browser , without having to download it .
The easiest way to do all this is with a blogging system that includes special support for podcasts .
Libsyn provides an easy - to - use blogging system that comes pre-configured for your account , though it is notoriously difficult to customize its look and feel .
My preference is to set up my own blog separately from my media hosting .
WordPress is a popular choice that is relatively easy to set up , and is supported by most web hosts .
To add podcasting features , install and configure the PodPress plugin , which provides slick publishing tools , statistics , and in - browser players for audio and video .
Update :
As several readers have pointed out , the PodPress plugin has not been updated in awhile , and is incompatible with the latest version of WordPress .
The new Podcasting plugin has stepped in to fill the gap , thanks to developer Ronald Heft , Jr. , who developed it from scratch for the Google Summer of Code 2007 .
Check it out !
Update 2 : Another promising replacement for PodPress is Blubrry Powerpress .
3. Set Up a Feed
What makes a podcast a podcast , and not just a set of media files available for download , is the feed .
Software like iTunes can subscribe to your feed and automatically download new episodes of your show .
If you ’re using a blogging system to publish your podcast , chances are it already provides an iTunes - friendly feed .
The feed URL for Libsyn ’s blogging system appears at the bottom of your account screen , whereas the PodPress plugin for WordPress generates its own iTunes - friendly feed ( separate from WordPress ’s built - in feed ) .
If you are n’t using a blogging system , but are simply coding up a static page for each episode that you publish , then you ’ll need a good tool to write the feed .
Feeder is an excellent choice for the Mac , providing plenty of podcast - specific convenience features .
Yes , you could code the feed by hand by referencing the relevant documentation from iTunes , but keeping a hand - coded feed perfectly valid can be a chore , and unlike web browsers , feed - reading programs like iTunes do not tolerate coding mistakes .
4. Promote your Show
With your first episode up and a feed in place , you ’re ready to start getting the word out .
Your first step should be to submit your feed to iTunes .
iTunes is by far the most popular directory of podcasts , and it is the first place most regular podcast listeners will look for your show if they hear about it .
Make sure you have configured your feed with the iTunes description , artwork , and category information before submitting .
Whether you use Libsyn , PodPress , or Feeder , any tool that generates a podcast feed will let you set these iTunes - specific details .
Other places to submit your show include Yahoo !
Podcasts , Podcast Alley , Podcast Ready , Blubrry , and Podcast Pickle .
Of course , submitting your podcast to directories will only go so far .
Like any other content published online , you ’ll have to do some work to promote it .
5. Watch your Stats
With each episode you publish , keep an eye on your stats to see how you ’re doing .
Are most of your users downloading the show manually , listening in their browser , or auto - downloading them with software like iTunes ?
Libsyn and PodPress both provide reasonable stats .
If you ’re rolling your own feed with something like Feeder , you may want to send your feed through a service like FeedBurner so you can track how your show is performing .
6. Keep it Rollin ’
Perhaps the most important factor in building a regular following is to maintain a regular production schedule .
It does n’t have to be every week or even every month , but set yourself a schedule and stick to it .
If you become unpredictable , so will your listeners ’ dedication to your show .
Of course , the beauty of podcasting is that you can do your own thing on the Web .
If your intent is to publish occasionally and at irregular intervals , that ’s okay too — just be clear with your listeners that that ’s what you ’re doing , so they do n’t consider unsubscribing just because they have n’t heard from you for a month .
And that ’s it !
Your road to podcast production success .

People who read and post on this site would do well to remember that the founder of this web site co-wrote a book that repeatedly tells the reader it is OK to lie and deliberately conceal information as well as offering suggestions regarding ways and means to attempt conceal criminal activity .
This justifiably calls his veracity into question on just about any issue .
People who read and post on this site would also do well to remember that the very existence of this web - site is a result of the founder 's sour grapes over his inability to pass a polygraph examination for a position sensitive to national security .
This disappointment ignited an ill conceived crusade conducted from outside the United States that attempts to conceal the aid he is trying to provide to criminals and enemies of the USA behind a spurious quest for justice .
Sancho Panza
If George had a false positive on his polygraph , and that fueled his " crusade " as you put it , in my opinion is a great thing .
That is how in OUR country we have historically righted wrongs .
You may want to augment your extensive education and fancy talk with a simple history book read .
I and countless others that have been a victim of your silly box owe a debt of gratitude to people like George that take the time to fight for a just cause .
I have never seen where George has encouraged anyone to lie .
In fact I have read posts from him telling people that ask how to lie and beat a poly that this site is not here to encourage lying .
Talk about taking statement out of context , your the king Sancho .
I have seen where he has shown how easily your " test " can be fooled .
Unfortunately , I did n't have this info because I felt I did n't need to have it I WAS BEING TRUTHFUL IN ALL MY ANSWERS .
I was also unaware at the time that polygraph was bias against the truthful in false positives .
And as for the fear mongering that you engage in , namely that George is somehow an enemy of our country because he dares to shed light on your scam shows the lows your ilk will go , to save your job .
Most truly intelligent and now informed people will see through your non-sense .

The other day I was having lunch at one of the Asian - fusion restaurants in Zürich with a ( non-Asian ) friend .
At one point , he speared a piece of chicken with one chopstick , brought it to his mouth and pried it off with his teeth .
I must have a strange expression on my face , because he looked at me and asked me what was wrong .
Of course he did not know that in Japan , what he just did would be considered to be terribly rude , in the same way that someone who did n't grow up in Europe might not know about not putting your elbows on the table .
I explained this to him , and he sort of snorted and said " well why do n't you write a guide to chopstick manners on your site then ! "
So , here it is : a guide to chopstick etiquette , Japanese style .
Chopstick etiquette level 1 : The things you absolutely must not do
Breaking these rules is considered to be really bad .
Do not stick your chopsticks upright in your rice .
This is an absolute no - no because it 's the way a bowl of rice is offered to the spirit of a dead person , at their deathbed or in front of their photograph on the household Buddhist altar .
Do not leave your chopsticks crossed on your plate or bowl , or the table .
This is for a similar reason to the above .
I sometimes see chopsticks presented like this in food photos styled by non-Asians , and while I understand that it does n't matter if your primary audience is not Asian , it still makes me cringe .
If you must have chopsticks in your photo , keep them neatly together to stop your Asian viewers from wincing .
It 's also not considered to be very good form to cross the working ends of your chopsticks while eating , but that can't be avoided sometimes depending on your level of chopstick dexterity .
( See below under Level 3 for how to put your chopsticks down . )
Do not use one chopstick at a time , especially not to spear food .
Chopsticks are always used together , as if they are attached to each other invisibly .
Think of them as tweezers or tongs , not a pair of skewers .
Do not pass food from chopstick to chopstick .
This is verboten because , when a person dies and is cremated , their bones are passed from chopstick to chopstick as a part of the Buddhist funeral ritual .
( I remember doing this when my grandfather died . )
You should also not pick one one piece of food with two pairs of chopsticks ( held by two people ) .
( See no. 26 on this page of photos taken 2 weeks after the March 11 , 2011 earthquake . )
Do not use unmatched chopsticks .
This not only looks funny , it also is reminiscent of some funeral rites .
( If you have n't gotten the message yet , basically anything connected to funerals or death is considered you know , unlucky . )
Do not leave your chopsticks in your mouth while you do something else with your hands , like pick up plates or bowls .
This is also rather dangerous , should you slip and land face - down .
Do not wash your chopsticks off in your soup or in your beverage .
Rinsing bits of food off your chopsticks in your soup , or worse yet your water or tea (! ) is very icky and just not done .
Do not use your chopsticks as toys , or pretend they are drumsticks and pound the table with them , or stick them in your mouth and pretend you are a funny vampire , or stick them up your nose .
Well , just in case .
Do not use chopsticks as hair accessories
( As suggested by Yong ) I know some chopsticks are very pretty .
I know that you see photos of kimono - clad maiko - san in Kyoto with pretty chopstick - like sticks in their hair .
The are not chopsticks .
They are hair ornaments called kanzashi .
Chopsticks are for food .
You would look silly with a beautiful fork stuck in your hair , yes ?
Chopstick etiquette level 2 : The things that you should n't do
These rules may not get a gasp out of your fellow Japanese diners , but they may frown a bit .
Do not rub your waribashi together .
Waribashi ( 割り箸） are those wooden chopsticks that you need to break apart .
Some people rub them together as a matter of course , but this is only even needed if the chopsticks are so cheap that they are splintery .
Doing this with good quality waribashi indicates that you think they are cheap , and therefore is an insult .
( You may already know this rule - it 's the one that 's cited the most .
I see a lot of people still doing this though . )
Do not suck on your chopsticks .
Your chopsticks are supposed to delicately convey your food to your mouth .
Sucking or nibbling on them is not very polite .
Do not spear your food , even with both chopsticks .
Spearing with one chopstick is really bad , but even with two together it 's not considered very polite .
Spearing food is bad , period .
Do not shovel food directly from your rice bowl into your mouth .
You are supposed to pick your rice bowl or your miso soup bowl up in one hand and eat with your chopsticks in the other hand .
You can bring your soup bowl right up to your mouth and sip .
However , you are not supposed to do the same with your rice bowl ; you should pick up your rice in morsels ( Japanese rice is sticky enough to allow this ) and bring it up to your mouth , using the bowl judiciously to catch any drips .
As for other plates or bowls , those are never picked up .
Pick the food up from them with your chopsticks , then if necessary put it in your rice bowl - but ideally you should put it on a supplied plate of your own ( a 取り皿 , torizara , meaning ' plate to take things onto ) or directly in your mouth .
( Of course there are exceptions to this rule , such as raw - egg rice . )
Do not take food from a communal plate with your own chopsticks .
If you are served family - style , do n't use your own chopsticks if at all possible to pick up food directly from it .
This is considered to be unsanitary .
You should use the supplied serving utensils .
If there are no serving utensils though , you should turn your chopsticks the other way and use the fat or unused ends to pick up the food .
( Though I do n't know about the sanitary - ness of touching the used business end of the chopsticks in your grubby hands ... )
And since so many people asked , " What about shabushabu , sukiyaki , etc ? :
These are all informal meals which are meant to be shared with the family or group all dipping into the same pot .
So of course , the rules are going to be more relaxed .
Now if you are in a more formal meal situation , and there is for example a communal plate of sashimi or something , you should first watch what others are doing , but if in doubt , flip your chopsticks around .
( Let us put this into Western meal terms .
Rules are different for a meal at TGIFriday 's vs. a formal dinner .
The rules in this and the last level are for more formal occasions .
I hope that makes it clearer ! )
If you are serving other people ( not yourself ) from a communal dish , the basic rule is to flip your chopsticks around unless you know that person very well .
Do not let your chopsticks wander around .
Hovering your chopsticks from food to food or dish to dish , while you ponder what you are going to pick up , is considered to be rather off - putting .
Do n't point at people or things with your chopsticks .
This is considered to be somewhat ruder than pointing with ones fingers .
Chopstick etiquette level 3 : True chopstick refinement
In reality , I see Japanese people doing these things all the time .
But if you can manage to master these rules , you are a truly refined chopstick user .
If you are supplied with has hi - oki ( chopstick rests ) , use them .
Hashi - oki （箸置き）or chopstick rests are little ceramic objects that you are supposed to rest the ends of your chopsticks on when you put them down .
If your place setting is supplied with them , use them instead of a plate or bowl when you put down your chopsticks .
If you have waribashi , you can make a little impromptu chopstick rest out of the bag .
But if there are no chopstick rests , it 's ok to put your chopsticks down on your bowl .
Just be sure to keep them together , not crossed ( see above ) .
Do n't let liquids drip from your chopsticks .
Unsightly , and you could soil the table ( or your clothes , etc . )
Do n't stir your food around with your chopsticks .
This is considered to be rather insulting to the cook , not to mention ... unsightly !
If you are ever invited to a formal multicourse Japanese feast , you might want to remember this .
On the other hand , if you are eating natto gohan or something though it 's different .
So there you have it .
As I wrote at the top , in mind that these are Japanese etiquette rules ; the rules may differ in other Asian countries .
If you grew up using chopsticks , how do they compared to the rules you were taught ?

As a former New Yorker , I am occasionally obliged to ask impertinent questions .
Such as :
How can Democrats , who ridiculed Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as an inexperienced political wannabe , now embrace the idea of elevating Caroline Kennedy — who has n’t served a day in public office — to Hillary Clinton ’s New York Senate seat ?
How , indeed , can the same “ progressives ” who opposed Clinton ’s election as president because they were repelled by the notion of extending the “ Clinton dynasty ” now be keen on perpetuating the Kennedy dynasty through an appointment ?
As a longtime admirer of Sen .
Ted Kennedy , I am embarrassed .
The iconic Massachusetts senator and others in the family are actively promoting John F. Kennedy ’s daughter — who famously shunned the gritty political world for the sanctuary of public service through her private endeavors — to take the Senate seat once occupied by her late uncle , Robert F. Kennedy , and now held by Clinton .
A decision on filling the vacancy should Clinton be confirmed as secretary of state is up to New York Gov. David Paterson , who could be forgiven , in moments like this , if he fleetingly wishes that he’d not ascended to the office after predecessor Eliot Spitzer ’s indiscretions .
What , exactly , is the case to be made for Caroline Kennedy ?
Certainly she would bring her family ’s Rolodex , which is one route to credibility in a state where campaigns are extraordinarily costly — a total of $ 69 million was spent on the 2000 Senate race .
An argument is also made that Kennedy would keep aflame the liberal dreams her father ignited decades ago , and which her Uncle Ted has ably nurtured throughout his career .
No doubt she is bright and committed to public service .
But if these are the sole qualifications , plenty of New York Democrats meet them .
They are , as a group , a famously liberal bunch .
None can plausibly argue that Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and members of the New York congressional delegation who are said to be interested in the seat are n’t sufficiently committed to public service ; they ’ve spent their lives in it .
As for naming a woman to the job , as Paterson is being pressured to do , New York has a trove of experienced political women who ’ve proved themselves in the trenches .
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg is n’t one of them .
She ’s never taken the risk of running for office or sullied herself with the day - to - day messiness of public life .
Comparisons to Clinton ’s 2000 Senate bid are invalid .
Clinton ran for the office , doggedly visiting all 62 counties and campaigning through long days and nights that took her from African - American churches in Brooklyn to Hudson Valley apple farms to agricultural fairs upstate .
Her Republican opponent outspent her .
The media coverage was relentless .
Clinton won by a double - digit margin .
For all its cosmopolitan aura , New York ’s politics are defined by ancient grievances and clannish alliances .
Ethnic and racial rivalries boil .
There ’s an enduring rift between upstaters who resent New York City ’s dominance of state affairs , and downstate city and suburban residents who send most of the tax money to state coffers .
Cuomo , one of Kennedy ’s chief rivals for the Senate appointment , is the former husband of one of her cousins .
Arcane squabbles routinely throw New York politics into utter turmoil .
Example : Since Election Day , when Democrats wrested control of the state Senate from Republicans to gain full power for the first time since the New Deal , Albany has been consumed by a threat of three Democratic lawmakers to throw their support to Republicans , thus denying their own party the right to preside over the Senate chamber .
Paterson was forced to broker a power - sharing solution to placate the dissidents — a deal came just days ago .
A U.S. senator does n’t have to get into this swamp , but it ’s good to know how to navigate around it .
Kennedy does n’t .
Not that she could n’t learn .
In fact , if she wants to be senator , there is a path to the job — the special election necessary to fill the Clinton seat in 2010 , no matter who gets the interim appointment .
A campaign would allow Kennedy to prove her mettle .
Voters could take the measure of her as a potential leader , not as a celebrity .
I ’m sure those in the far corners of the state would welcome her , just as they welcomed Clinton .
A Kennedy is a big draw .
And there is n’t a county chairman alive who would pass up the chance to make the annual rubber - chicken dinner a certain sellout .

ローカルのストレージはキャッシュとして機能
“ すべてクラウ ド ” も間近!?
「 ZumoDrive 」を使ってみ た
オンラインストレージサービスは古くからあるが、汎用クラウドサービスの登場で、その使い勝手が急速に進化している。2009年1月に入ってプライベートベータテストを始めた「ZumoDrive」は、エンドユーザー向けのサービスとしては、現時点で最も先進的な利便性とリーズナブルな価格を実現したサービスの1つだ。ZumoDriveはAmazon S3をバックエンドに使い、ローカルPCのOSに透過的にマウントできる仮想ドライブを提供する。ファイルはクリックして初めてストリーム配信されるため、ローカルストレージは、もはや主従関係でいえば従の“
キャッシュ” として機能する。
ZumoDriveを使ってみたい読者は、同サービスのWebサイトで招待コード“ itmedia”を入力してみてほしい。現在ZumoDriveはプライベートベータテスト中だが、＠IT読者に対して先着で500アカウントまで発行してくれることになっている。ただし、iPhone用クライアントは現在まだ一部ユーザーしか利用できない。
Amazon S3上に登場したストレージサービス群
写真共有サイト のSmugMugは数百TBの写真データ をAmazon S3に保存しているという
ストレージサービスの進化が速まったのは、「 Amazon S3」が広く利用されるようになってからだ。Amazon S3 （Simple Storage Service）は、米アマゾン子会社 のAmazon Web Servicesが提供するクラウド型ストレージサービスで、すでにインターネットベンチャーを中心に利用が始まっている。例えばマイクロブログサービスのTwitterが、ユーザーのアイコン画像の保存・読み出しストレージにAmazon S3を使っているのは良く知られた話だし、写真共有サイトのようなところでも利用例がある（参考記事：クラウド型ストレージ「 Amazon S3 」は安いか？）
Amazon S3 はAPI 経由での利用が基本となるので、素のままでユーザーが使えるサービスではない。Webアプリケーションで画像やテキストファイルの読み書きをするストレージとしてであれば、Amazon S3の利用は難しくないだろうが、何らかのツール・開発は必要だ。Amazon S3を個人ユーザーが利用契約しても、そのままでは使い道がない。
ところが 、Amazon S3上にローカルアプリケーションやツール、Webサービスのレイヤをかぶせ、使いやすいストレージサービスに仕立てるベンチャー企業が続々と登場している。
Dropboxを超え るZumoDriveの手軽さ
Amazon S3をバックエンドのストレージとして利用し、個人ユーザーに対して優れた利便性を提供していたのは、これまでのところ「Dropbox」だったと思う（参考記事：HDD以上に便利なオンラインストレージ“ Dropbox ”）。 Dropbox はWindows 、Mac OS X、Linuxの専用クライアントをインストールすることで、ローカルのファイルシステムに完全に統合された形でオンラインストレージが利用できるサービスだ。
Windowsであれ ば 「 マイドキュメント」の中に「 My Dropbox」というフォルダができ、そこに入れたファイルはDropboxが提供するインターフェイスを介してAmazon S3に保存される仕組みになっている。DropboxクライアントをインストールしたPCからは、すべて同じフォルダやファイルが見え、どこかで更新したファイルは、若干のタイムラグを置いて、ほかのPC上でもすぐに反映される。
Dropboxでは差分データの蓄積を管理しているため、単にバックアップとして機能するばかりでなく、1日前とか1カ月前といった古いバージョンのファイルを取り出すことができるなど、すでにハードディスク以上の使い勝手を実現している。Amazon S3は2つ以上のデータセンターにまたがって冗長度のあるデータ保存を行っているため、いつ壊れてもおかしくない自分のハードディスクより、はるかに安心感がある。
非常に便利 なDropboxだが、1年以上使っていて私はいくつか問題を感じている。後発のZumoDriveは、そのうちいくつかを解決してくれている（ちなみに、DropboxもZumoDriveも、ともにベンチャーキャピタルのYコンビネータが出資しているスタートアップ企業だ）。
容量の小さ なSSDに仮想的にドライブを “ 増 設 ”
Dropboxは、専用クライアントをインストールしたPCのすべてで、全データが同期される。例えばクラウド上に20GBのデータを置くと、それと同期するPC上のすべてで20GBのフォルダが現れる。従って、新たなPCを購入してDropboxクライアントを入れたときには、20GBのデータのダウンロードが始まることになる。これは時間がかかるというだけでなく、「利用するPCの台数×20GB」というストレージの無駄遣いだとも言える。
搭載ストレージが4GBのSSDだけ、というようなネットブックであれば、そもそも同期のしようがないという問題も出てくるだろう。
これに対し てZumoDriveでは、クラウド上にストレージを作ってバージョン管理などを行うのは同じだが、さらに発想を変えて、もはやローカルディスクをキャッシュとしてしか扱わない。
ZumoDriveクライアントをインストールすると、タスクトレイにクライアントが常駐する
ZumoDriveクライアントをインストールすると、タスクトレイにクライアントが常駐する。Webサイトで作成したIDとパスワードを入力すると、申し込んだサービスの容量のドライブがローカルのドライブとしてマウントされる（私のWindows XP環境では東芝製のハードディスクとして認識され、すでにあるネットワークドライブのZドライブを避けて、Yドライブとしてマウントされた）。ただ、マウントしただけでは同期は始まらない。もちろんファイルのアップロード方向に関してはネットワーク接続が有効である限り、基本的に即座に反映が始まるのだが、ほかのPCからアップロードしたファイルに関しては、アイコンが見えているだけで、すぐにダウンロードが始まるわけではない。
インストーラのウィザードはアカウントとパスワードを入力するだけ
ドライブとしてマウントされ たZumoDrive
東芝製の80GBのハードディスクの型番で認識されている。実際には今回は20GB分を試用した
音楽ライブラリをクラウドに置いてiPhoneで聴く
ZumoDrive上に、どんなファイルがあるかはすべて見えるが、それらの一部は（もしくは全部が）ローカルのストレージにはダウンロードされていない。ファイルの中身は、編集や閲覧のためにファイルを開いたときに初めてZumoDriveのサーバからストリーム配信されてくる。
これは言い換えれば、4GBのSSDしかないネットブックでも20GBとか50GBのドライブを仮想的に増設できる、ということだ。ZumoDriveはiPhone用の専用アプリケーションも用意しているため、もう8GBとか16GBといった枠にとらわれずに、20GBとか30GBあるような音楽ライブラリでも文字通り持ち出すことができるわけだ。ZumoDriveはiTunesをサポートしており、クラウド上のオーディオデータをローカルのiTunesにインポートする機能がある。
今後はiPhoneだけでなく、Android、それに続い てWindows Mobileのサポートも検討しているという。
さて、ファイルにアクセスしたタイミングでダウンロードするといっても、ZumoDrive上のファイルは毎回ダウンロードされるわけではなく、ローカルのHDDやSSDにもキャッシュされる。ファイルを指定して、右クリックメニューから明示的にダウンロード（キャッシュ）することも可能だ。
iTunesがインストールされたPCであれば 「 Import to iTunes」で、ZumoDrive上の楽曲ファイルなどを取り込める
右クリックで明示的にファイルをダウンロードしたり、共有設定を行うなどができる
キャッシュに割り当てるローカルストレージの容量は、ユーザーが任意に設定できる。もし、そのローカルストレージの容量をZumoDriveより大きく割り当てれば、すべてのデータのキャッシュが（最終的に）ローカルにも保存されることになり、ほぼすべてのデータについて高速なアクセスが可能だ。逆にローカルストレージの割り当て容量がZumoDriveの容量より少ない場合には、ユーザーが指定したファイル、あるいは頻繁にアクセスするファイルについてのみキャッシュが行われる。メディア関連ファイルであれば、ストリーミングによりタイムラグなく視聴を始められるし、頻繁にアクセスするファイルのデータ総量は、それほど多いとも考えられない。今回はそこまで使い込めなかったが、もしかすると、ローカルストレージは数GB割り当てる程度でも十分に実用的な速度と使い勝手となるかもしれない。
詳しいアルゴリズムは非公開だが、ZumoDriveクライアントは、優先して同期（アップロード）すべきファイルを機械判定もしているという。
上り・下りで転送速度も設定できる
アップロード・ダウンロードの様子は監視・制御できる
差分データと全体データのアップロード
余談だが、アップロードするデータの扱いに関して、実装上、興味深いテーマが潜んでいる。たいていのバージョン管理ソフトと同様に、DropboxやZumoDriveは基本的に各ファイルについて、異なるバージョン間の差分データを蓄積、保存する。このためDropboxでは1GBの動画ファイルを編集しても、その変更がバイナリデータ上の一部の変更に過ぎなければ、アップロードするバイナリチャンクは小さなもので済む。ファイル全体を転送する必要がないわけだ。
しかし一方、こうしたアプローチでは差分データを作ったり、それをオリジナルデータに適用したりというオーバーヘッドが発生する。このため、ZumoDriveでは容量の小さなファイルについては差分データを即座にサーバに送るが、容量が一定以上のものについてはファイル全体を送るようにしているという。手元で試したところ、250KBほどの画像ファイルに数十ピクセル程度の変更を加えると、毎回全ファイルが転送された。これはDropboxに比べて無駄なトラフィックのように思えるが、差分を適用するサーバの負荷を考慮して、こういう設計にしたという。また、この閾値はサーバ側の設定で変えられるという。
この辺り、アップロードのタイミングや、差分か全体かなど、さじ加減によって使い勝手は変わってくるだろう。ユーザーの接続環境によってもパラメータを変えるなど工夫が必要かもしれない。何がベストかは誰も分からないが、後発のZumoDriveは、Dropboxと異なるアプローチを取っていて興味深い。
ストリーミングで即座に視聴
ZumoDriveの実際の使用感は、今のところ上々だ。大きめのファイルだとやや開くのが遅いという程度で、それ以外は通常のローカルストレージと同じ使い勝手で、特にドキュメントや写真程度ではストレスを感じない。もちろん直接アプリケーションでZumoDrive上のファイルを編集することもできる（ベータ版の2009年1月23日現在、まだバグが残っていてファイルのタイムスタンプの問題からテキストエディタなどで警告ダイアログが頻出するが、これはバグ追跡リストに追加されている）。
ストリーミングもうまく機能している。例えば100MBあるWMV形式の動画を、イー・モバイル接続のノートPCから開くと、即座に再生が始まる。MP3などのオーディオデータも、必ずしもファイル全体をローカルストレージに落とさなくてもストリーミングで聞くことができる。ZumoDrive専用のiPhoneクライアントでも同様だ。ただし、現状ではiPhoneクライアントでは音楽データのみで、動画のストリーミング再生については現在検討中だという。いずれにしても、このストリーミング機能に関しては、ファイルシステムレベルで独自レイヤを実装したから可能なことだとZumoDriveは説明している。
今回はテストしていないが 、ZumoDrive はMac OS Xクライアントも提供しているほか、今後 はLinux向けクライアントもリリース予定という。移植性を高めるためにクライアントの大部分はJavaで書いているという。ただ、Javaの標準GUIの見た目が気に入らなかったので、GUIツールキットは自分たちでかなりの時間をかけて作成したと話す。
ZumoDriveのユーザーインターフェイスは、Windowsのエクスプローラからの右クリックメニューのほか、各種設定や状況確認ができるダイアログがある。また、WebサイトにアクセスすればFlashで作り込まれたファイルビューが利用できる。このWebページでは、ファイルの過去の変更履歴をさかのぼって何段階か前のバージョンを閲覧・ダウンロードができるほか、共有関連の設定ができる。今どきのWebサービスらしく、信頼するユーザーのアクティビティがライフストリームとして見えるという機能もある。
MP3ファイルをストリーミングで再生している画面。左上の「Anger.mp3」には青いアイコンが付いていて、ローカルにキャッシュされていない（ZumoDriveにしかない）ことを示している。右側の「
Sexual Healing.mp3」はローカルにキャッシュがある。この状態で再生しているのはAnger.mp3（下のメディアプレーヤー）だ
ソーシャル系サービスのようにユーザーの活動（ファイルの編集・追加、ダウンロードなど）を時系列に一覧できる
Webサイトから もZumoDrive上のファイルの操作や閲覧ができる
Webサイト上では古いバージョンのファイルを閲覧したり、ダウンロードしたりといったことができる
秀逸なファイル共有、閲覧系の機能
ZumoDriveのファイル共有に関連した機能は秀逸だ。
ファイル共有には2種類ある。1つは、ZumoDrive利用者以外と手軽にフォルダやファイルを共有するための機能で、ファイルに対してユニークなURLを生成してアクセス可能にするやり方だ。これは単純にエクスプローラやWebページで「
Get Link」とするだけでいい。このリンクには事実上のパスワードが含まれていて、これをメールやメッセンジャーで友人・知人・家族などに送ることで手軽にファイルにアクセスしてもらえる。ほかの人に発見される心配はほとんどないものの、比較的緩いセキュリティのため、旅行写真の一時的な共有といった用途に向くだろう。あるいは、相手がダウンロードしたことを確認して即座に「 Disable Link」としてURLによるアクセスを禁じれば、たいていのファイルの共有で問題がないかもしれない。再び「
Get Link」を押すと、また異なるランダムな文字列を含むURLが生成される。
手軽にリンクを作成して 、ZumoDriveを使っていないユーザーとファイルやフォルダを共有できる
よくできているのは、写真の共有機能だ。Flashで作られたアルバム閲覧アプリケーションで、フォルダ単位で写真をパラパラ眺めることができる。つまり、カメラからZumoDrive上（というのはローカルに見えるドライブ、念のため）の適当なフォルダに写真をまとめてドロップして、そのフォルダのURLを誰かに送ることで、そのURLを受け取った人はWebブラウザのみでオンラインアルバムを閲覧できるということだ。写真の表示はプログレッシブで、ストレスが少ない。
i Phone上でも写真閲覧は快適だ。iPhoneアプリケーションに対しては適当にリサイズして送ってきているようで、3G接続でもストレスなくクラウド上の写真アルバムを閲覧できる。
URLによる簡易のファイル共有以外にも、ZumoDriveユーザーとの間であれば、もう少しよい共有方法がある。ユーザー名またはメールアドレスを指定して共有すれば、閲覧権、編集権、ダウンロード権などを細かく設定できる。セキュリティ上もURLを使ったものより安心だ。
ちなみに 、ZumoDriveのセキュリティは2段階。クライアントとZumoDriveのサーバとの間は一般的なSSLによる暗号通信。ZumoDriveとAmazon
S3の間は鍵長192ビットのAESを使っており、その鍵はZumoDriveのデータベースに保存してあるという。この鍵はユーザーごとに固定というわけではなく、同じユーザーのファイルでも異なる鍵が使われることもあるという。
Webブラウザで写真アルバムにアクセスした例。Flashで作られたフレームでパラパラと写真集をめくれる。簡易共有機能と併用すれば、もうメールで写真を送る必要はない
i Phoneでも専用アプリでZumoDrive上のアルバムが見れる。3G接続でも十分快適だ
ZumoDrive上のファイルは、ビューアが対応したものなら閲覧できる。画面は日本語のPDFファイル
ZumoDrive上の音楽ファイルはiPhoneらしいインターフェイスでストリーミング再生できる
i Phoneクライアントでは、キャッシュする量を設定できる
PDF やExcelドキュメントの閲覧やブログへの埋め込みも
Webサイト版 のZumoDriveでは、画像ファイルや音楽ファイルの視聴はもちろん、PDFやExcelファイル、テキストファイルの閲覧も可能だ。日本語ファイル名も受け付ける。iPhoneアプリケーションでも、日本語を含むPDFファイル、Excelファイルは閲覧できる（シフトJISのテキストファイルなど、一部文字化けするケースもある）。こうしたドキュメント類のプレビュー機能はZumoDriveのものではなく、外部のWebサービス「Scribd」を呼び出しすことによって実現している（参考記事：テキスト版YouTube!?
「 Scribd」が公開ベータへ）。
ZumoDriveに置いたファイルを、ブログなどに埋め込むのも簡単だ。プレビュー機能が対応しているファイル形式であれば、ファイルを選択して「
Get Embed Code」とするだけで、埋め込みようのHTMLスニペットが生成される。これをブログエントリなどでコピー＆ペーストすれば、写真やオフィス文書、PDFファイルを埋め込むことができる。

DropboxとZumoDriveの違いに見るクラウドの可能性
Dropboxをはじめとするオンラインストレージやクラウド系サービスと、新手のZumoDriveとで動作が大きく異なるのは、クラウド上で更新されたファイルの差分データを、クライアント側にすぐにプッシュしないことだ。あくまでも各クライアントのデバイス上でファイルが必要になった段階でファイルを転送する。これにより、すべてのデバイス上で同一の複製を作るという容量のムダや、すべてのデバイスで更新データを毎回すべて反映してしまうというトラフィックのムダを省ける。例えば、週に1度しか使わないノートPCで、オンラインになるなり延々とデータの更新が始まるのではウンザリだろう。
このアプローチ をZumoDriveでは内部的に 「ストリーム・オン・デマンド」と呼んでいるそうだ。私は遅延評価というプログラミング用語にならって、遅延ダウンロードと呼ぶのがふさわしいと思う。本当に必要になったときにだけ処理をすることで、無駄な処理を大幅に削減できるわけだ。ZumoDriveは今後数カ月のバージョンアップで「
Watch Folder」機能を実装し、指定したフォルダだけ完全にクラウド側と同期するよう指定できるようにするとしているので、ZumoDriveはハイブリッド型に進化しそうだ。
リアルタイムダウンロードか遅延ダウンロードかというのは、もちろんアプローチの違いで、どちらがより優れてるとは一概に言えない。ただ、Dropboxは限られた数の必要なファイルを同期させるためのオンラインレポジトリのようなものを想定しているのに対して、ZumoDriveは、あらゆるデータをクラウドに載せてしまってください、という前提で設計しているのではないだろうか。一部のファイルだけであればDropboxのように完全に同期しているほうがいい。逆に大量にファイルがある場合は、ZumoDriveのように必要なときに必要なデータだけローカルに持ってくるというアプローチのほうが有効だ。
この違いは両サービスの登場時期の違いと関係しているように、私には思われる。Dropboxが登場したときには、おそらくオンラインストレージは「補助的なファイル置き場」というニュアンスで捉えられることが多かったのではないか。しかし、ネットブック市場拡大でSSD市場の立ち上がりが見えてきた今、そろそろ“クラウドにすべて置く”という潜在ニーズが一般ユーザーに広がりつつあるのではないか。少なくとも、DropboxとZumoDriveのアプローチの違いには、そうした中長期的なトレンドの影響があるように思う。
ZumoDriveは安いか？
ZumoDriveは1GBの利用は無料。月額料金は10GBが2.99ドル、20GBが5.99ドル、50GBが14.99ドル、100GBが29.99ドル、200GBが59.99ドルなどとなっている（10GB当たり3ドル）。ハードディスクに比べれば割高だが、単純な単価比較には意味がない。複数PCを持つ人であればデータを多重に持つムダが省ける上に同期の面倒がない。バックアップやバージョン管理を兼ねている安心感もある。PC買い替え時にデータ移行の手間もない。こうしたメリットを総合的に考えると、“すべてクラウド”は十分に魅力的だ。例えば家族とのフォルダ共有を行えば、これまでムダに重複して持っていた写真などのデータ量も減るだろう。もっと言えば、そもそもほとんどの楽曲データはユーザーによらず同一バイナリなのだから、その重複分をなくせる可能性すらある。もちろんビジネスモデル、著作権などの問題はあるだろうが、長い目で見れば音楽を“購入”するというのは、ストリーミング権、キャッシュ権を買うような話になっていくのかもしれない。
Amazon S3自体もそうだが 、ZumoDriveの価格もこれで最終版というものではなく、今後ストレージ単価の下落とともに下がっていく可能性が高い。ZumoDriveの価格についてはベータ版もので、正式版リリース時に変更する可能性もあるという。
ちなみに 、ZumoDrive はAmazon S3を素で使った場合に比べてちょうど2倍の価格設定になっている。例えばAmazon
S3をドライブとして使うためのシェアウェア「JungleDisk」や、Unixユーザーなら「s3rsync」といったソフトウェアを使えば、同容量が半額で使える。純粋に定期バックアップを取りたいといった用途であれば、ZumoDriveよりも、こうしたソフトウェアを利用するほうが安く済むだろう。
ネットワーク上の水平分業とイノベーション
ZumoDriveはサービス自体としても興味深いが、Amazon S3上で、他社製サービスのScribdまで流用してサービスを仕立て上げているという分業がおもしろい。マッシュアップといえば、データ系のWebサービスを組み合わせるものだったが、今やAmazon S3のようなインフラ系APIも組み合わせ、そこに付加価値を生み出すイノベーションが起こっていると見るべきだ。
こうした水平分業がイノベーションを加速するのは間違いない。Amazon S3を含 むAmazon Web Servicesのクラウド系サービスは猛スピードで進化し、インフラ系サービスを拡充させている。その上で、独自プロトコル、独自サービスの設計や、各OS・デバイス向けの実装を行うベンチャーがいる。ZumoDriveを開発するチームはわずか4人のメンバーからなる。インフラ系の分業なしに、このような規模でZumoDriveのようなサービスを開発するのは不可能だ。
今後も 、Amazon EC2/S3を組み合わせたサービスは、次々と出てくるに違いない。いずれにしてもZumoDriveは、こうしたAmazonクラウドのエコシステムにおいて大きな成功を収めるポテンシャルを持ったサービスの1つと言えそうだ。

I said it before :
Their idea of “ fixing ” the economy is not the same as yours .
In a recent article in the Financial Times , Samuel Brittan opines about the peculiar nature of the current economic doom and gloom .
Interestingly enough , is at least partially correct in diagnosing the problem :
[ I ]t is … a logical absurdity that there should exist unsatisfied wants side by side with idle workers willing to supply them .
The natural condition of mankind is one of scarcity , and conflicts are often about the allocation of scarce resources .
You cannot usually have endless amounts of both guns and butter .
Perplexing , indeed !
Brittan is correct : we did n’t suddenly and collectively become less productive .
We did n’t suddenly enter an age of abundance ( in which case nobody would need to work , and it would n’t matter one bit ! ) .
How in the world did we lose 80,000 jobs ?
It ’s not a novel question , and it ’s one that ’s plagued economists and policy - makers alike .
Whenever resources are idle and needs are unsatisfied , there is something fundamentally wrong .
What happened — what is happening , is a necessary consequence of government and central bank manipulation of the money supply and the macro-economy .
The proximate cause of our current suffering is not simply “ overinvestment ” or “ underconsumption ” , ( Paul Krugman ’s favorite straw men ) or overutilization of the scarce economic resources , for which we all compete , in order to satisfy our limitless desires .
The cause of our current suffering is Malinvestment , brought about by expansionary monetary policy .
And these malinvestments must be liquidated or reallocated .
The economy eventually needs to restructure from the shock , in order to satisfy actual consumer demand , not the contrived demand of inflation .
Brittan notes that he has no qualms with the Schumpeterian theory of “ creative destruction ” , but since Schumpeter ’s theory is more about economic progress and evolution than it is about business cycles , the comparison demonstrates that he does n’t fully comprehend the problem :
A different kind of objection is that recessions are said to have a purpose .
They accelerate the destruction of misplaced activities and overspeculative investment . …
But this does not justify the secondary and tertiary destruction of perfectly viable activities because purchasing power has fallen throughout the economy .
Well of course it does !
Those activities , those economic endeavors that to Mr. Brittan seem so “ perfectly viable ” were only “ perfectly viable ” under the fog of inflationary credit expansion .
As long as the more money is printed , debts are repaid and new debts incurred .
For someone apparently familiar with the works of F.A. Hayek , the failure to acknowledge the nature of business cycles is alarming .
Hayek and Mises before him , essentially argued that this phantom “ viability ” could only persist , as long as the rate of monetary expansion continually increased .
They also noted ( and this is the salient point ) that this continual increase in the rate of inflation would inevitably lead to a severe bust , as the monetary unit would eventually fall into disrepute , and lose its status as a medium of exchange .
So it is , that the booms and busts of State - capitalism are coordinated .
They may not be coordinated in the sense that a bureaucrat or central banker actively seeks to destroy a particular business or industry , but they are coordinated in the sense that , failure to coordinate them results in the complete dissolution of State capitalism ’s power structure .
Business Cycles then , are not so much engineered by policy makers , as they are tolerated as a necessary evil .
I ’ll say it again : Their idea of “ fixing ” the economy is not the same as yours .
( CNN ) -- Outgoing Senate Rules Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said Tuesday she disagrees with her Democratic leadership 's move to block Roland Burris from being seated in the U.S. Senate .
Former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris makes his way to the Capitol on Tuesday .
" The question is really one , in my view , of law , " Feinstein told reporters in a Capitol hallway .
" Does the governor have the power , under law , to make the appointment ?
And the answer is yes .
Is the governor discredited ?
The answer is yes .
Does that affect his appointment power ?
The answer is no , until certain things happen " she said .
Failure to seat Burris " has ramifications for gubernatorial appointments all over America , " she said , describing him as " a senior , experienced politician . "
Feinstein 's remarks came shortly after the former Illinois attorney general was denied entry to the Senate chambers as he tried to claim the seat once held by President - elect Barack Obama .
After being denied entry , Burris indicated he 's not giving up his fight .
Followed by a swarm of reporters earlier Tuesday , Burris made his way through the Capitol and into the office of the secretary of the Senate on the first day of the 111th Congress .
The secretary of the Senate told Burris that his credentials were " not in order " and therefore he would not be allowed access to the floor .
Nancy Erickson , the Senate secretary , initially rejected Burris ' appointment Monday because his certificate of appointment was missing the signature of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White .
One of the Standing Rules of the Senate says that the secretary of state must sign the certificate of election along with the governor .
White has declined to sign the certificate , siding with some Senate Democrats who say Burris should not be seated because of the cloud over Blagojevich .
Blagojevich , a Democrat , has been accused of trying to sell Obama 's open Senate seat .
Burris has maintained that Blagojevich 's problems have nothing to do with him and the appointment is legal .
Burris has asked the Illinois Supreme Court to require
White to sign the certificate , saying he is required by law to do so .
The court has not yet ruled on the issue .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that if Burris gets valid credentials , the Senate would " proceed in a manner that is respectful to Mr. Burris , while ensuring that there is not a cloud of doubt over the appointment . "
Watch Reid say Burris is " not credentialed " »
Reid and Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois are expected to meet with Burris on Wednesday .
In a news conference Tuesday before a flock of observers and reporters , Burris said he was not seeking a confrontation over the seat and would consult with his attorneys to determine his next steps .
Watch Burris describe what happened »
One possible compromise could be to allow Burris to be seated in the Senate so long as he agrees not to run in 2010 , according to a source .
A senior Democratic source familiar with Senate leadership deliberations said Democrats fear Burris ' association with Blagojevich would make him so tainted that he would lose the Democratic seat if he ran in the next election .
The source declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the discussions .
Democratic sources cautioned that it's one idea under discussion and that the Democratic leadership has n't formally settled on making the offer to Burris .
Timothy W. Wright III , an attorney for Burris , did not give specifics about the next move but said he was prepared to take the issue to " the highest court in the land . "
He said the rejection of Burris ' credentials was " improperly done " and " is against the law of this land . "
" The outcome that we will be looking for is that Sen .
Roland Burris will be standing on the floor of the Senate conducting his responsibilities as the junior senator from the state of Illinois , " Wright said .
Senate Democrats who do not want to seat Burris insist that the problem is with the appointer , not the appointee .
Burris , 71 , is one of Illinois ' most accomplished politicians , having served as state comptroller and attorney general .
Senate leaders questioning the appointment cite Article 1 , Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution , which states , " Each house shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members . "
As Burris took his credentials to the Capitol on Tuesday , a media circus surrounded him and documented his every step .
The spectacle largely overshadowed the swearing - in ceremony for members of Congress .
One key question is whether Tuesday 's scene will help Burris ' case by putting political pressure on Democratic leaders to find a solution or hurt him by annoying them .
Jim Manley , a Reid spokesman , insisted Tuesday 's events will do " absolutely nothing . "
" We are more than able to walk and chew gum at the same time .
What happened this morning happened .
Now , Sen. Reid and Sen. Durbin will sit down and talk to Burris tomorrow and hear what he has to say . "
Republican strategist Ed Rollins urged Reid to seat Burris .
Read why Rollins says Burris should be seated
" This is one battle you do n't need .
The last thing you and your caucus wants now -- or the new president needs -- is a battle over seating his replacement for the last two years of his term , " he wrote in a commentary on CNN.com .
Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. , who was considered a contender for the open Senate seat , also spoke out on behalf of Burris .
" There is a strong constitutional and legal case for his seating , " he said .
" The longer this process takes , the more racialized this seat becomes and the more difficult it becomes for Democrats to hold it in 2010 . "

Hi Everyone , I 've uploaded a new version of the permutation library to hackage .
Here is the package description :
This library includes data types for storing permutations .
It implements pure and impure types , the latter which can be modified in - place .
The main utility of the library is converting between the linear representation of a permutation to a sequence of swaps .
This allows , for instance , applying a permutation or its inverse to an array with O ( 1 ) memory use . .
Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation functions in the GNU Scientific Library ( GSL ) .

From ADP : November Employment Report
Nonfarm private employment decreased 250,000 from October to November 2008 on a seasonally adjusted basis , according to the ADP National Employment Report® .
The estimated change in employment from September to October was revised down from a decrease of 157,000 to a decrease of 179,000 .
Led by massive cuts at Citigroup and other banks , major U.S. corporations announced 181,671 layoffs in November , the highest total in nearly seven years , according to a survey conducted by outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas and released on Wednesday .
...
The report comes two days before the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on employment in November .
Analysts surveyed by MarketWatch expect payrolls to fall by 350,000 , which would be the biggest decline since May 1980 .
So far in 2008 , announced layoffs have totaled 1.06 million , up 46 % from the same period a year ago .
Note : ADP only covers private employment and has been consistently more positive than the BLS report in recent months .
See the report for some graphs of employment and a comparison to the BLS report .
And from Rex Nutting at MarketWatch : Corporate layoffs surge to nearly 7 - year high
Also first time unemployment claims are running over 500 thousand per week - so all of the data suggests that the BLS employment report on Friday will show large job losses in November .
Officials in Montgomery County in Ohio discovered this week that tabulation software used with touch - screen voting machines in the presidential election failed to count five votes in the city of Trotwood .
The voting system in question is made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold Election Systems ) .
Montgomery County officials discovered that although the five votes were recorded to a memory card inside the voting machine , the votes were n't counted by the tabulation software when the memory card was uploaded to the tabulation server .
Premier 's Global Election Management System ( or GEMS ) is the tabulation software that counts votes from memory cards .
The company 's GEMS software is currently at the center of an investigation into dropped votes in a California county and was also the source of a previous problem found in Ohio in Montgomery and Butler counties during the May primary .
Officials discovered then that the GEMS system dropped votes if officials tried to load too many memory cards at once .
The problem turned out to be a sharing violation on the Premier election servers set up in eleven counties .
No votes were lost during the primary as a result of this problem , since officials were aware the machine was rejecting votes when it occurred , but the state sued Premier in August over this and other issues .
Unlike the primary , officials had no indication in the November general election that the machine was dropping the five votes that were discovered missing this week .
The votes were not included in the official count that county officials certified to the state .
Montgomery officials discovered the missing votes only through a special hand audit they were conducting on order from Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner .
In an effort to restore public confidence in the voting machines the state uses , Brunner ordered all of Ohio's 88 counties to conduct a graduated audit by randomly selecting precincts and conducting a hand recount of the presidential race on 5 percent of the ballots cast in order to compare the votes against digital tallies and ensure that electronic voting machines are counting votes accurately .
If the results of the 5 percent audit differ by more than two votes of the machine count , county officials are required to audit an additional 3
percent of ballots .
If this sampling also differs by more than two votes , then officials are required to hand count all of the ballots cast in the county .
Montgomery County is the first county to have uncovered a specific problem with the voting machines as a result of the audit .
According to the Dayton Daily News , officials discovered the missing votes when they put the memory cards back into the voting machines to conduct the manual audit .
The director of the county board of elections told the Daily News
that there is no circumstance , under normal election conditions , that would cause officials to put the memory card back into a voting machine once it 's been taken out .
They put the memory card back into the machine this time only to conduct the mandatory partial audit required by Brunner .
It 's unclear why they needed to put the memory card back into the machine to conduct the audit , however , since they already had paper trails of the votes ( the Premier touchscreen machines print out a voter - verifiable paper audit trail as voters cast their ballots ) and they already had the digital tallies from the machines as well .
Neither county nor state election officials were available to answer questions about the issue at press time .
The Premier touchscreen machines are used in 44 Ohio counties .
UPDATE :
There was something bothering me about this story when I first heard about it .
I was wondering why this problem was n't caught in the normal post-election canvassing process and why it took a mandated audit to catch it .
Montgomery County , after all , uses touch - screen machines that produce a paper trail .
Generally , in the normal canvassing process election officials should compare the vote total summaries that appear at the end of the paper trail against the digital summaries that are taken from the voting machine memory cards and uploaded to the county server containing the tabulation software .
If there 's a discrepancy , then there 's a clear indication of a problem .
But it turns out , according to Betty Smith , deputy director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections , that this comparison is n't required in Ohio .
Officials only compare the summary on the paper trail with the summary in the tabulation software if they are doing a recount on a close race .
And even then , they 're required to compare only 5 percent of the votes in this way .
They never compare the totals on all of the paper trails with the digital totals as a matter of course .
This is not uncommon .
Although many election districts use machines that produce paper trails , their states have no laws requiring election officials look at them unless there 's a close race .
Smith said they 've been comfortable with not comparing all of the paper and digital tallies because they 've had at least seven recounts of close races in the last three years and the 5 percent comparison they 've done in each one of those cases has always yielded matching results .
" This one proved us wrong , " Smith said .

Centering supper around a fish dish at least twice a week might help people with diabetes lower their risk of kidney disease , a study suggests .
In the November issue of the American Journal of Kidney Diseases , British researchers analyzed the records of more than 22,300 middle - aged and older English men and women who were part of a large European cancer study .
They wanted to examine the effect of eating fish on kidney disease .
The study subjects had answered questionnaires about their diet habits , including how much fish they ate a week , and had provided urine samples , which were analyzed for the presence of a protein called albumin , an indicator of kidney damage .
The researchers reported that of the 517 study subjects who had diabetes ( most of whom had type 2 ) , those who on average ate less than one serving of fish each week were four times more likely to have albumin in their urine than people with diabetes who ate fish twice a week .
" Protein in the urine is one of the earliest signs of kidney disease , a serious complication of diabetes , " says study co-author Amanda Adler , an epidemiologist with the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge .
Adler speculates that the nutrient content of fish may affect kidney function and improve blood glucose control .
But what kind of fish makes the biggest health splash was n't determined .
" We did n't ask about the type of fish people ate , but in this bit of England people eat cod , plaice , haddock , canned tuna .
Even fish and chips would have been included , " she says .
Susan Spratt , assistant professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology at Duke University Medical Center , says it 's too early to recommend diet changes based on the findings , noting that cause and effect are hard to determine in this type of epidemiological study .
" People who eat fish might have other healthier habits , " she says .
To prove fish could be a kidney disease - fighting factor in diabetes , clinical trials would be required in which people with diabetes ate fish and others did not , she says .
" But it would n't hurt patients to eat more fish , " says Spratt , who recommends fish oil to lower triglycerides in her diabetes patients who do not respond to or tolerate other therapies .
For dinner , stick with low - fat broiled and baked recipes , she says .

An image of the Wilkins Ice Shelf disintegration taken from the British Antarctic Survey 's Twin Otter aircraft reconnaissance flight .
The frozen desert interior of Antarctica was thought to be the lone holdout resisting the man-made warming affecting the rest of the globe , with some areas even showing signs of cooling .
Some global warming contrarians liked to point to inner Antarctica as a counter - example .
But climate researchers have now turned this notion on its head , with the first study to show that the entire continent is warming , and has been for the past 50 years .
" Antarctica is warming , and it 's warming at the same rate as the rest of the planet , " said study co-author Michael Mann of Penn State University .
This finding , detailed in the Jan. 21 issue of the journal Nature , has implications for estimating ice melt and sea level rise from the continent , which is almost entirely covered by ice that averages about a mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) thick .
The revelation also undermines the common use of Antarctica as an argument against global warming by contrarians , Mann said .
Ozone and cooling
Not all of Antarctica was thought to be immune to rising global temperatures , of course .
Scientists have been watching as the Antarctic Peninsula , the only part of the continent that juts outside the Antarctic Circle , has warmed faster than the global average , and entire ice shelves have collapsed into the south polar ocean .
In stark contrast , a large part of the continent — the East Antarctic Ice Sheet — was found to be getting colder .
The cooling was linked to another anthropogenic ( human - caused ) effect : ozone depletion .
Ozone in the Earth 's stratosphere absorbs the sun 's incoming ultraviolet rays , protecting living things on the surface ( including humans ) from detrimental effects .
Certain types of manmade chemicals have depleted much of this protective layer over the last few decades .
As ozone was depleted , less radiation was absorbed at this layer of the atmosphere , which altered the layering of temperatures over Antarctica , over which the largest ozone " hole " is found ( it 's not really a hole , but rather a region of extreme thinning ) .
This in turn altered wind patterns and strengthened the circumpolar vortex , creating a wall of winds that isolated the cold air over Antarctica from the warm air over the South Pacific Ocean , Mann explained .
Essentially , the effect of ozone depletion was " overwhelming the influence of greenhouse warming , " Mann told LiveScience .
He and his colleagues were able to show this in their study by compiling a more comprehensive temperature profile of Antarctica than scientists have ever had .
Weather stations and satellites
Weather stations have been in place in Antarctica since 1957 , but almost all of them are near the coast , providing no information about conditions in the continent 's interior .
Satellites are available now that calculate the surface temperature of the interior based on how much infrared light is radiated by the snowpack , but these records only go back 25 years .
The key to the study was comparing the two records and finding that they matched up closely for overlapping time periods .
The researchers then developed a statistical technique that used the data from both sources to make a new estimate of Antarctic temperature trends .
" People were calculating with their heads instead of actually doing the math , " said lead author of the study Eric Steig , of the University of Washington in Seattle .
" What we did is interpolate carefully instead of just using the back of an envelope . "
Their work showed that not only was the Antarctic Peninsula warming , but the interior of West Antarctica — the ice sheet most susceptible to potential future collapse — was as well .
And not only that , but that " the continent on the whole is warming , " Mann said .
" This is the first study to demonstrate that . "
The study , funded by the National Science Foundation , found that warming in West Antarctica exceeded about 0.18 degree Fahrenheit ( 0.1 degree Celsius ) per decade for the last 50 years — more than enough to offset the cooling in East Antarctica .
And with ozone depletion having leveled off , that cooling is unlikely to continue in the future .
" Efforts to repair the ozone layer eventually will begin taking effect and the hole could be eliminated by the middle of this century .
If that happens , all of Antarctica could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world , " Steig said .
" The greenhouse signal is now out - competing the ozone depletion signal , " Mann said .
The study is " good work , " said Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo. , but he says there are unique aspects of Antarctica 's climate that have n't been taken into account .
Trenberth was not involved in the Nature study .
One problem is that temperature inversions can bring warmer air down influencing surface temperatures .
" This aspect has not been addressed to date , " Trenberth told LiveScience .
The authors dispute this comment : " There is no evidence to support Trenberth 's speculation , and there is much evidence that he is wrong , " Steig told LiveScience .
Steig explained that they saw the same results whether they used satellite temperatures or those from the weather stations that sit a few meters above the surface , which wouldnt ' be the case if inversions were an important factor .
Andrew Monaghan , also of NCAR , said that he agreed with the broad findings of the study , which line up with similar studies he has done of Antarctic temperature trends .
He told LiveScience that the biggest finding of the study was the warming of West Antarctica , which is part of the broad ice sheet contributing to ice melt — " it 's a Greenland - sized chunk of Antarctica , " he said .
Monaghan , who was also not part of the Nature study , said that it is harder to generalize to the continent as a whole and that Antarctica has a highly variable natural climate and that " we still do n't understand the natural component well at all . "
Implications and contrarians
The implications of the findings for the stability of the Antarctic 's ice sheets are n't entirely clear yet and will have to be evaluated by ice sheet modelers , Mann said .
The worry is n't so much from East Antarctica , which sits at a higher elevation than the rest of the continent and is so cold ( many degrees below freezing ) that the few tenths of a degree of warming is n't yet an issue .
But the study likely means that " a larger part of West Antarctica is melting " than previously thought , Mann said .
West Antarctica is more subject to warm , moist storms and because its ice is all landlocked , it could contribute to sea level rise if it melts .
( Ice that 's floating on the sea does not raise the sea level if it melts . )
Modelers wo n't be the only ones interested in the study 's findings , as other scientists will likely seek ways to independently and directly confirm or refute the data .
Mann mentioned one such study that has been submitted to a journal that used holes in the ice to see how temperatures have changed in the past and has confirmed the underlying warming in East Antarctica .
Outside of these impacts , the study also take away " one of the standard talking points of [ global warming ] contrarians , " Mann said .
The argument used by skeptics was " how can the globe be warming if a whole continent is cooling , " Mann explained .
Mann said that this argument was " disingenuous " to begin with because the cooling caused by ozone depletion was reproduced by climate models , but the new study soundly routs contrarian claims , he said .
Mann is one of the scientists behind the blog RealClimate.org , which aims to explain the science behind climate change .
Steig is contributing a post there on the new study to explain the findings .

And while most road signs are under password protection , that password is most generally just the default code " DOTS " — or you can easily reset the password by holding " shift " and " control " while typing " DIPY " ( so that it just defaults to " DOTS " again ) .

A and B - side USB connectors Intel and other companies have formed a group to promote the USB 3.0 , which should deliver more than ten times the speed of the existing USB 2.0 standard .
Ten times faster than the old USB spec , USB 3.0 can transfer a 27 GB file in just 70 seconds .
Plus , with more " lanes " of data within the connector , new USB will be able to simultaneously send and receive information — that might not sound like much , but the old USB could n't do so .
President and general manager of the chipset business unit at AMD , Phil Eisler , released a statement saying , " The future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive .
Lifestyles filled with HD media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer .
USB 3.0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the PC platform . ” Intel stated that the USB 3.0 specification would be optimized for low power and improved protocol efficiency .
The USB 3.0 ports and cabling will be designed with both copper and optical cable capabilities , meaning even higher speeds will be possible in the future .
Jeff Ravencraft , Intel 's technology strategist , said : " The digital era requires high - speed performance and reliable connectivity to move the enormous amounts of digital content now present in everyday life .
USB 3.0 will meet this challenge while maintaining ( USB 2.0's ) ease - of - use experience . "

There are things that I like about President Barack Obama ’s ambitious economic stimulus package .
I think that our infrastructure and energy issues need to be addressed , and that , in doing so , we will be able to provide jobs and other benefits to the economy .
I also agree that something needs to be done about health care .
However , I ’m not sure how beneficial the proposed tax cuts would be .
Right now , the idea is to introduce a $ 500 tax cut .
This cut would be applied on paychecks , so that you would have “ more money in your pocket . ”
Unfortunately , if you divide up that $ 500 over the course of time , the more money in your pocket does n’t amount to much .
Certainly not enough to allow you to do the following , which are stated goals of policy makers :
1. Avoid foreclosure .
2. Increase consumer spending .
While direct help to homeowners in the form of loan modification is expected with the new economic stimulus , one of the selling points of this tax cut is that you could use the money to make a mortgage payment .
Seriously ?
Most of the people in foreclosure trouble need waaaaay more than $ 500 .
As far as consumer spending is concerned , that $ 500 , spread out over two years , would be basically useless .
An extra $ 21 a month is going to do a great deal in terms of kick - starting the economy through consumer spending ?
Riiiight .
Besides , $ 500 seems small potatoes next to the billions being spent on retention packages for folks at the top of the economic food chain .
Trillions go to big banks , while we are stuck footing the bill .
$ 500 of our own money back just does n’t seem like enough .
On a number of levels .

A few months ago I read a New York Times article on South Korean cram schools that said Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious young South Korean .
A parent added : " In our country , college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent of a person 's future . "
It was striking how old fashioned this sounded .
And yet when I was in high school it would n't have seemed too far off as a description of the US .
Which means things must have been changing here .
The course of people 's lives in the US now seems to be determined less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years ago .
Where you go to college still matters , but not like it used to .
What happened ?
_____
Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an advance .
The practice seems to have begun in China , where starting in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an exam on classical literature . [ 1 ]
It was also a test of wealth , because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing required years of expensive training .
But though wealth was a necessary condition for passing , it was not a sufficient one .
By the standards of the rest of the world in 587 , the Chinese system was very enlightened .
Europeans did n't introduce formal civil service exams till the nineteenth century , and even then they seem to have been influenced by the Chinese example .
Before credentials , government positions were obtained mainly by family influence , if not outright bribery .
It was a great step forward to judge people by their performance on a test .
But by no means a perfect solution .
When you judge people that way , you tend to get cram schools — which they did in Ming China and nineteenth century England just as much as in present day South Korea .
What cram schools are , in effect , is leaks in a seal .
The use of credentials was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between generations , and cram schools represent that power finding holes in the seal .
Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into credentials in the next .
It 's hard to beat this phenomenon , because the schools adjust to suit whatever the tests measure .
When the tests are narrow and predictable , you get cram schools on the classic model , like those that prepared candidates for Sandhurst ( the British West Point ) or the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores .
But as the tests get broader , the schools do too .
Preparing a candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years , as prep school does today .
But the raison d'etre of all these institutions has been the same : to beat the system . [ 2 ]

History suggests that , all other things being equal , a society prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from influencing their children 's success directly .
It 's a fine thing for parents to help their children indirectly — for example , by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined , which then makes them more successful .
The problem comes when parents use direct methods : when they are able to use their own wealth or power as a substitute for their children 's qualities .
Parents will tend to do this when they can .
Parents will die for their kids , so it 's not surprising to find they 'll also push their scruples to the limits for them .
Especially if other parents are doing it .
Sealing off this force has a double advantage .
Not only does a society get " the best man for the job , " but parents ' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect ones — to actually trying to raise their kids well .
But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents ' efforts to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids .
We 're dealing with one of the most powerful forces in human nature .
We should n't expect naive solutions to work , any more than we'd expect naive solutions for keeping heroin out of a prison to work .
_____
The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better .
If the tests a society uses are currently hackable , we can study the way people beat them and try to plug the holes .
You can use the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are .
They also tell you when you 're succeeding in fixing them : when cram schools become less popular .
A more general solution would be to push for increased transparency , especially at critical social bottlenecks like college admissions .
In the US this process still shows many outward signs of corruption .
For example , legacy admissions .
The official story is that legacy status does n't carry much weight , because all it does is break ties : applicants are bucketed by ability , and legacy status is only used to decide between the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff .
But what this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much or as little weight as they want , by adjusting the size of the bucket that straddles the cutoff .
By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials , you could probably make them more airtight .
But what a long fight it would be .
Especially when the institutions administering the tests do n't really want them to be airtight .
_____
Fortunately there 's a better way to prevent the direct transmission of power between generations .
Instead of trying to make credentials harder to hack , we can also make them matter less .
Let 's think about what credentials are for .
What they are , functionally , is a way of predicting performance .
If you could measure actual performance , you would n't need them .
So why did they even evolve ?
Why have n't we just been measuring actual performance ?
Think about where credentialism first appeared : in selecting candidates for large organizations .
Individual performance is hard to measure in large organizations , and the harder performance is to measure , the more important it is to predict it .
If an organization could immediately and cheaply measure the performance of recruits , they would n't need to examine their credentials .
They could take everyone and keep just the good ones .
Large organizations can't do this .
But a bunch of small organizations in a market can come close .
A market takes every organization and keeps just the good ones .
As organizations get smaller , this approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones .
So all other things being equal , a society consisting of more , smaller organizations will care less about credentials .
_____
That 's what 's been happening in the US .
That 's why those quotes from Korea sound so old fashioned .
They 're talking about an economy like America 's a few decades ago , dominated by a few big companies .
The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join one and climb to the top .
Credentials matter a lot then .
In the culture of a large organization , an elite pedigree becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
This does n't work in small companies .
Even if your colleagues were impressed by your credentials , they 'd soon be parted from you if your performance did n't match , because the company would go out of business and the people would be dispersed .
In a world of small companies , performance is all anyone cares about .
People hiring for a startup do n't care whether you 've even graduated from college , let alone which one .
All they care about is what you can do .
Which is in fact all that should matter , even in a large organization .
The reason credentials have such prestige is that for so long the large organizations in a society tended to be the most powerful .
But in the US at least they do n't have the monopoly on power they once did , precisely because they can't measure ( and thus reward ) individual performance .
Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can get rewarded directly by the market ?
I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most other people .
As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm , I 'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of credentials and into the new one of performance .
I 'm an agent of the change I 'm seeing .
But I do n't think I 'm imagining it .
It was not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be judged directly by the market .
You had to go through bosses , and they were influenced by where you 'd been to college .
_____
What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America ?
I 'm still not entirely sure .
Startups are certainly a large part of it .
Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large ones , and new ideas are increasingly valuable .
But I do n't think startups account for all the shift from credentials to measurement .
My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates far less than firms do today .
Law firms then made no pretense of paying people according to the value of the work they 'd done .
Pay was based on seniority .
The younger employees were paying their dues .
They 'd be rewarded later .
The same principle prevailed at industrial companies .
When my father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s , he had people working for him who made more than he did , because they 'd been there longer .
Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for the work they do .
One reason is that employees no longer trust companies to deliver deferred rewards : why work to accumulate deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt , or be taken over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out ?
The other is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees large amounts .
This was particularly true in consulting , law , and finance , where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies .
The word is rarely used today because it's no longer surprising to see a 25 year old with money , but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old professional able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it called forth a new word .
The classic yuppie worked for a small organization .
He did n't work for General Widget , but for the law firm that handled General Widget 's acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their bond issues .
Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
I do n't think there was a causal connection .
Startups happened because technology started to change so fast that big companies could no longer keep a lid on the smaller ones .
I do n't think the rise of yuppies was inspired by it ; it seems more as if there was a change in the social conventions ( and perhaps the laws ) governing the way big companies worked .
But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce a principle that now seems obvious : paying energetic young people market rates , and getting correspondingly high performance from them .
At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s .
Was there a connection ?
I do n't know enough to say , but it felt like it at the time .
There was a lot of energy released .
_____
Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be concerned about the number of startups started within them .
But they would do even better to examine the underlying principle .
Do they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work they do ?
The young are the test , because when people are n't rewarded according to performance , they 're invariably rewarded according to seniority instead .
All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for performance .
Measurement spreads like heat .
If one part of a society is better at measurement than others , it tends to push the others to do better .
If people who are young but smart and driven can make more by starting their own companies than by working for existing ones , the existing companies are forced to pay more to keep them .
So market rates gradually permeate every organization , even the government . [ 3 ]
The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations issuing credentials into line .
When we were kids I used to annoy my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do anyway .
As credentials are superseded by performance , a similar role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for .
Once credential granting institutions are no longer in the self - fullfilling prophecy business , they 'll have to work harder to predict the future .
_____
Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence .
But they 're not the final step .
There 's an even better way to block the transmission of power between generations : to encourage the trend toward an economy made of more , smaller units .
Then you can measure what credentials merely predict .
No one likes the transmission of power between generations — not the left or the right .
But the market forces favored by the right turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials the left are forced to fall back on .
The era of credentials began to end when the power of large organizations peaked in the late twentieth century .
Now we seem to be entering a new era based on measurement .
The reason the new model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better .
It shows no sign of slowing .

Kurkure is one of the most famous snack brands in India .
People of all ages enjoy this snack as a combo ( right from chai to fried rice ) or as a snack itself .
Brand Kurkure has always been known for its sumptuous flavours and innovative ads .
The credit of which goes to the Kurkure brand team .
However , Kurkure did have a dark phase where there were rumours about Kurkure containing plastic .
Rumours are always rumours and they are never true .
Like it is with Kurkure , the Kurkure plastic talks are just baseless .
People spreading Kurkure plastic rumours do not understand that Kurkure is a fried extruded product which contains a high amount of oil .
Any product which has that level of Oil or fat will burn e.g.
Namkeens , Fried Papad , Matri , Khakra etc will also burn as such products have very low water in them which is as low as 2 % or even less .
These are all dry products with oil which makes it good for burning .
That ’s all about the Kurkure plastic talk , let ’s just talk about the Kurkure snack now which is available in a variety of regional as well as contemporary flavours that are loved by both young and the old .
My sister and granny both just love this snack .
The former enjoys it with her lunch while the latter enjoys it with tea .
All in all , we just love this snack in our family .
Juhi Chawla had been the brand ambassador for Kurkure since many years now .
We loved her style , her quirkiness , her attitude in all the Kurkure ads .
But she has now given way to the new Kurkure family .
Sadly , she is not a part of this family now , so no more Juhi in Kurkure ads .
The new Kurkure family is a family of 6 members who will represent their love for the product .
Following are the names of the new Kurkure family members and their real names :
1. Social Butterfly – Played by Farida Jalal
2. Chupa Rustam – Played by Boman Irani
3. Perfect Bhabhi – Played by South Actress Ramya Krishnan
4. Bollywood Banker – Played by Kunal Kapoor
5. Bahu Remix – Played by Parineeti Chopra
6. Bhukkad – Played by Shivansh
The names of the new Kurkure family members are really interesting and so are their intro ads .
I wanted to share this post with my readers from a while now but just could n’t spare myself some time for the blog .
Following are the intro ads for the new family members , which one did you like the most :

In 2004 , scientists at the University of North Carolina found that 77 % of fish labeled as red snapper was actually something else .

Some of your favorite foods may be fakes .
Foods masquerading as something else — a more nutritious something else — have been big news in the past two years .
Chinese food companies in particular have been blamed for making deadly alterations to dairy , baby and pet foods by adding melamine .
The chemical makes it appear that the food or beverage has the required level of protein .
But what about food producers in this country ?
What fraudulent foods do U.S. consumers have to fear from American companies ?
Experts say dangerous U.S. - produced foods are comparatively few , but producers have been known to practice " economic adulteration " — adding a little to their bottom line by padding , thinning or substituting something cheap for something expensive .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration regulate the food industry , but with safety issues to deal with , economic adulteration has " really been back - burnered , " says Bruce Silverglade of the non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest .
So in a caveat emptor world , what should consumers look out for ?
Seafood Fish is the most frequently faked food Americans buy .
In the business , it 's called " species adulteration " — selling a cheaper fish such as pen-raised Atlantic salmon as wild Alaska salmon .
When Consumer Reports tested 23 supposedly wild - caught salmon fillets bought nationwide in 2005 - 2006 , only 10 were wild salmon .
The rest were farmed .
In 2004 , University of North Carolina scientists found 77 % of fish labeled red snapper was actually something else .
Last year , the Chicago Sun -Times tested fish at 17 sushi restaurants and found that fish being sold as red snapper actually was mostly tilapia .
" It 's really just fraud , plain and simple , " says Gavin Gibbons of the National Fisheries Institute , an industry group .
One thing consumers do n't need to worry about is scallops .
Tales of skate wings cut into circles and sold as scallops are common .
But Spring Randolph , a consumer safety officer at the FDA and an expert on species adulteration , says the FDA has never found an actual case of it .
Salmon is tricky .
Randolph does have one tip , though .
Farmed salmon gets its coloring from dyes added to food pellets the fish are fed , while wild salmon gets it from the plankton they eat .
" When you cook it , the wild salmon retains its color , and in the aquaculture salmon , the color tends to leak out , " she says .
Suspicious consumers can call the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition hotline at 1-888 - SAFEFOOD .
Olive oil
This luxury oil , touted for its heart - health properties and taste , has become a gourmet must - have .
Americans consumed about 575 million pounds of the silky stuff last year , according to the North American Olive Oil Association .
Sixty - three percent was the higher - grade extra virgin , which comes from the first pressing of the olives .
It 's also one of the most frequently counterfeited food products , says Martin Stutsman , the FDA 's consumer safety officer for edible oils .
There are no national figures on olive - oil fakery .
But after complaints , Connecticut began testing two years ago .
" We were coming across a lot of products labeled as extra - virgin olive oil that contained up to 90 % soybean oil , " says Jerry Farrell Jr. , Connecticut 's commissioner of consumer protection .
Most name brands were fine , Farrell says .
It was often off - brands sold in discount stores that were the problem .
Connecticut was so concerned that in November , it became the first state in the nation to set standards for olive oil , enabling officials there to levy fines and pull adulterated products off store shelves .
California is set to create its own standards this year .
Reports from panels of testers have found as much as 60 % to 70 % of the olive oil sold as extra virgin in the state is a lower - quality olive oil , says Dan Flynn of the Olive Center at the University of California - Davis .
The easiest thing is for fakers to add 10 % vegetable oil in extra virgin , says Stutsman .
" It will still smell as it should , but you 've saved 10 % of the cost . "
Bob Bauer , president of the North American Olive Oil Association , says it 's more of a problem in restaurants than in supermarkets .
Honey
An expensive natural product that 's mostly sugar , honey is easily faked .
" If you can substitute a less expensive source of sugar for the expensive one , you can save some money and gain market share , " says the FDA 's Stutsman .
It used to be that cane sugar or high - fructose corn syrup was mostly used to thin out honey .
But chemically , that was easy to spot .
FDA used an isotope test that would easily identify the adulteration .
So counterfeiters got wily and started using beet sugar .
Its profile is similar to honey , so the FDA had to switch to a much more complicated , multistep test comparing the sugar profiles to see if the proportions and trace materials match .
" But once we started catching people , they create a moving target .
They 'll switch to something more difficult ( to detect ) , " says Stutsman .
Maple syrup
Maple syrup is another high - value item that can be adulterated .
In these tough economic times , Vermont , the USA 's largest supplier to flapjacks everywhere , may up its testing programs .
The boiled - down sap of the sugar maple tree can be diluted with water or sugar by sellers " trying to get more bang for the buck , " says Kristin Haas , food safety director in the state 's Agency for Agriculture , Food and Markets .
Vermont 's testing program has found fraud only three times in the past 17 years , says Haas , but it 's not taken lightly .
" A couple of years back , there was a gentleman who actually went to prison because of this issue . "
When times get tight , the incentive to cheat can rise like sap in the spring , so the state may have to work harder to keep its premier product pure .
Vanilla
A product of the tropics , vanilla pods can be soaked in milk or stored in sugar to impart a delicate vanilla scent to foods .
More commonly , they 're soaked in alcohol that is then used as a flavoring .
But vanillin ( pronounced VAN - ah - lynn ) , a chemical copy of the richly organic vanilla flavor , was created in the laboratory in the 19th century .
When used in foods , it 's supposed to be labeled as an artificial flavor and usually is .
One " too good to be true " product to watch out for is really inexpensive vanilla extract sometimes sold in Mexico and Latin America , says the FDA .
It 's often made with coumarin , a toxic substance that has been banned in U.S. foods since 1954 .
Coumarin is chemically related to warfarin , a blood thinner , and can be dangerous .
It 's " no bargain , " the FDA says .

With a series of forceful actions in recent days , amid an almost unprecedented set of challenges , Barack Obama has taken an unusual step for a president - elect : attempting to alter the country ’s perilous course even before he takes office .
The most dramatic example came Saturday , when Obama announced a far more aggressive economic stimulus plan than previously promised -- a two - year program to add 2.5 million jobs that he said represented “ an early down payment on the type of reform my administration will bring to Washington . ”
That announcement was the latest indication that the president - elect has decided to use the transition period to influence events at a time of crisis , when the current administration appears powerless to stop a slide .
“ There ’s no question that Bush is still president , but people are looking for signs to see what ’s going to happen going forward , ” said an Obama aide who , like others , requested anonymity when discussing deliberations inside the transition .
“ We ’re going to attempt to do that in this period . ”
Advertisement
Obama has moved with unusual speed to fill most of his top White House staff positions .
And over the last week , he settled on a number of key Cabinet appointments designed to remove the uncertainty that has sparked turbulence in the financial markets and to replace it with a sense of confidence in the administration - in - waiting .
He offered the all - important job of Treasury secretary to a pragmatic and experienced regulator , Timothy F. Geithner , and reached out to former campaign rival Hillary Rodham Clinton , an experienced figure known around the world , to be the country ’s top diplomat .
After the Geithner selection was reported Friday , the Dow Jones industrial average soared nearly 500 points .
On Monday , the president - elect will emerge from two weeks of near - seclusion to stand shoulder - to - shoulder with his economics team for a news conference that aides hope will help calm an anxious public .
Obama ’s aggressive posture marks an evolution inside his transition team since immediately after the Nov. 4 election , when he pledged to live by a mantra that the country is led by “ one president at a time . ”
Obama and his aides have been discussing how hands - off he should be with circumstances changing so dramatically : stocks tumbling ; negotiations stalling over an economic stimulus plan and a possible automobile industry bailout ; and another financial giant , Citigroup Inc. , at risk .
Advertisement
The quandary for Obama ’s team has been how to finesse a set of challenges not seen since 1932 : a quickly deteriorating economy and a transition of power between two presidents with vastly different views on how to fix it .
“ They recognize it ’s a careful balancing act , because you want to bring a whole new face to it when you ’re in office , ” said Leon Panetta , a White House chief of staff under President Clinton who has informally advised Obama ’s aides and has had recent conversations with them .
“ But at the same time , there ’s an underlying concern that things seem to be deteriorating rapidly ” -- making the new president ’s job harder .
Panetta said the country is “ caught between a president who does n’t have a lot of credibility even if he tries to do something and a new president who , if it looks like he ’s going to lay out things he ’s going to try to do , it looks like he ’s putting the cart before the horse .
It ’s a tough place for the country to be in right now . ”
Aides are wary too of taking ownership of problems they do not yet have the formal power to address .
Advertisement
Still , with the financial markets and the public clearly looking for reassurance , Saturday ’s announcement -- and Monday ’s news conference -- signal that the transition has entered a phase in which the president - elect will become more visible and vocal .
Obama has yet to stake a firm position on the auto bailout being discussed on Capitol Hill , but he might inject himself into the debate as he takes questions Monday on the country ’s economic woes .
The balancing act was apparent last week as Obama worked behind the scenes to settle on a series of gravitas - heavy Cabinet appointments and looked for creative ways to signal policy changes .
He made no live public appearances .
But he used a videotaped message to a bipartisan meeting of governors to promise quick action on limiting greenhouse gas emissions and enacting a controversial plan to charge companies for the right to emit gases that cause global warming .

Some opponents of a “ cap and trade ” program have said it could further hurt the economy by adding costs for companies .
Obama ’s address suggested he viewed the plan as , rather , a tool to create jobs -- arguing that revenue from emissions charges would be invested in environmentally friendly industries .
Moreover , as he pursues the greenhouse gas limits , Obama stands to benefit from the victory last week by Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) for leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Waxman ousted longtime Chairman John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , who had been viewed as an obstacle to efforts to fight global warming .
Obama did not involve himself directly in the Waxman - Dingell bout , but it was widely believed that the president - elect had a clear favorite -- particularly given that his newly hired legislative liaison is Waxman ’s longtime chief of staff , Phil Schiliro .
In another videotaped message last week -- to European officials , endorsing a bid by his hometown of Chicago to host the 2016 Summer Olympics -- Obama sent a broad signal about changing U.S. foreign policy .
“ In the coming years , my administration will bring a fresh perspective on America ’s role and responsibilities around the world , ” Obama said .
Advertisement
That is likely to be the message when Obama in the coming days officially announces Clinton ’s appointment as secretary of State and lays out the rest of his national security team .
Monday ’s news conference will mark his first full exchange with reporters since Nov. 7 , when he took questions for about 20 minutes in a session most notable for his discussion of what type of dog to get for his daughters .
This time the need for more detail and substance is greater -- as Obama seemed to acknowledge in his Saturday address , discussing his proposal to infuse the economy with money through a major program to build roads , bridges and other infrastructure .
“ The news this week has only reinforced the fact that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions , ” he said .
“ We now risk falling into a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further . ”
Advertisement
Panetta said he hoped that Obama would use public appearances to introduce his Cabinet officials and key advisors and to explain why each was chosen .
“ He ’s got to take advantage of at least some public interviews to convey to the American people a sense of hope that things are going to be OK , ” Panetta said .
Experts said that , so far , Obama seemed to be heeding lessons from past presidents ’ mistakes .
Historians have pointed to parallels between this year and the 1932 transition from Republican President Hoover to Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Historians believe the country ’s economy was further hampered by Roosevelt ’s refusal to cooperate with Hoover ’s administration on strategies to help cure a deepening depression .
And in 1992 , newly elected President Clinton waited too long to hire his top White House staff and moved too quickly and sloppily to begin hiring Cabinet officials , according to his aides .
The result was that Clinton relied too heavily on campaign advisors to build a government , aides said .
Advertisement
Obama , in contrast , has named most of his top staff aides -- including veterans from that Clinton White House -- and is working with those staffers to help build out the rest of the administration .
His chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , a Chicago congressman and former Clinton aide , is considered an expert in policy and the politics of Capitol Hill .
“ What Obama has done is to build the circle around him responsible for managing the decision - making , and now he is working from there , ” said Terry Sullivan , an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a member of a consortium of scholars who study White House transitions .
“ I do n’t know whether he is sending signals that he is ready to govern , or that he ’s just becoming ready to govern . ”
Obama also has set the scene for quick action on policies that might stem public anxiety .
On healthcare , he will rely on two people : his Health and Human Services chief , former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , a master of the legislative process ; and his new budget director , Peter Orszag , a healthcare policy expert with credibility on both sides of the debate over how to make insurance more affordable .
Advertisement
On immigration , an issue viewed by business groups as a key economic concern because of their need for foreign laborers , Obama can rely on his likely choice for Homeland Security secretary , Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano , known for pragmatic views on the issue and support for tough border enforcement .
“ These are not political flacks , ” said Robert Reich , a Labor secretary in the Clinton administration .
Panetta credits Obama for sending strong signals in a time of crisis , but he adds that nothing in the transition matters as much as the messages when he is actually the president .
“ The ultimate test of whether we can change is whether he can govern , ” Panetta said .
“ We wo n’t know that until he walks into the Oval Office and makes the decisions that tell us who he really is . ”

The Bush administration has taken steps to open the Californian coast to oil exploration and drilling in as few as three years .
The move could potentially tap more than 10 billion barrels of oil , enough to power the U.S. for 17 months .
The proposal has been greeted with horror in environmental circles , wary of the threat of oil spills , air pollution and increased shipping traffic in an area rich with migrating whales , millions of seabirds , sea otters , fish and crab feeding grounds .
According to Richard Charter , a lobbyist for the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund , “ You could n’t design a better formula to create adverse impacts on California ’s coastal - dependent economy . ”
The federal government is to take advantage of the expiry of a 27 year - old ban on oil drilling that protected both of the nation ’s coasts , including the stretch from California to the Pacific Northwest .
President - Elect Obama has remained tight - lipped over whether he would overturn the lifting of the oil - drilling moratorium .
If it goes ahead , the plan would open areas from Bodego Bay to the Oregon border and from Morrow Bay to the U.S. - Mexico border for oil exploration , drilling and extraction .
Exploration could start as early as 2010 , with oil rigs going up by 2012 .
The incoming Obama administration will have the final say over whether the proposals will go ahead .
Obama has said that he supports the notion of energy independence and growth in the harnessing of domestic renewable energy sources as part of the energy mix .
However , he has remained ambiguous over the extent to which domestic oil exploration will also form part of his energy plan , and it is likely that moves in this area will be keenly scrutinized in period following his inauguration .

Your problems never cease .
They just change .
I tell the kids that they 're not going to be adults until they 're twenty - eight , because they 're playing a boys ' game .
It delays their maturation .
There 's so much input .
It 's hard for them to focus .
I use the illustration of them going down the highway at eighty miles an hour , eating McDonald 's , with their iPod in their head and the sound turned up so loud that they can't hear anything , and then they drop something on their lap , a gob of mustard or ketchup .
And they look down , and when they look back up , there are all these red lights ahead of them -- that 's how their life is going on , it 's just so much activity going on at one time .
My father was the superintendent of the churches in the state of Montana .
He was content in his beliefs .
He befit the term " true Christian . "
He would turn the other cheek .
He was truly a man of peace .
I think that my carriage and my demeanor are very much what the image of my father was like .
When she preached , my mother was all fire and brimstone .
She was a seeker -- intellectually she sought greater truths .
And she was a competitor -- she was the captain of her basketball team .
There was a time in my life -- I spent fifteen years in my career with New York and New Jersey -- where I always felt if I did n't get those three or four months in Montana to camp , to be on the land , to actually live on the ground and be connected with the ground , then I was n't really connecting myself with my roots , with that pioneer spirit that is so deeply a part of me .
For us tall people , the whole key is that your hips and your knees should form a right angle when you sit down .
That 's where backs and hips get to be problems for big guys .
I just went on a commercial airline for the first time in two years .
I could n't believe the first - class seats were so tight for a person my size .
I hit my head twice on the exit signs near the bins .
It 's harrowing to be an athlete and to think that you need an artificial joint , and then to think what it 's going to do to your life .
But diminishing returns set in .
You can't play tennis or go hiking .
Swimming and biking were my only activities -- I could n't even run anymore .
And then , a few years ago , the pain started .
It got to a certain level where I could n't deal with it any longer , especially the arthritic pain in the hips -- it just became overwhelming .
It got to the point where I could n't sleep .
Some people choose to interpret this current period in my life as a trial .
But I see it as a challenge .
Red Auerbach , nine championship rings , achieving the record -- it does n't enter my consciousness .
I mean , yes , I want to win .
That 's pretty obvious -- that 's what our job is about .
But the actual number of championships does n't enter my consciousness .
The only attachment it has to me is that it puts me in the company of Red Auerbach , and that creates illusions of greatness , because we all thought of Red as the greatest -- we thought what he did was an unattainable goal .
My dad always had this little sign on his desk : " The bigger your head is , the easier your shoes are to fill . "
He really drilled that in .
Here 's the thing .
If I were Bill Russell , and there were eleven championships and I 'd been the MVP five times , I might have a vaulted opinion of my own self - worth .
My erstwhile mentor , companion , and colleague Tex Winter always states , " You 're only a success for the moment that you complete a successful act . "
Michael Jordan ?
The thing that strikes you about a person of that ilk is the amazing amount of energy and personal pride that they take in their performance .
They have a sense of confidence that goes beyond a sense of failure -- somehow , the fear of failure can't inhibit their ability to perform .
Michael befits that as great as any athlete I 've ever seen .
He met every level of expectation .
They 're always going to be your children .
A bump on the head is pretty traumatic when you have a six - month - old .
And then you have a sixteen - year - old and it's a traffic ticket , a college student and a DUI .
You have to be able to find a way to help them out of their life problems without being overbearing .
When I was young , I was dedicated to become a minister -- my brothers and I were formally brought in front of the congregation in a dedication ceremony , where we were dedicated to the future service of God .
Today my mother likes to point out that none of us boys became ministers .
But I like to say , " Well , you know , my parish is just fifteen . "
My team is my parish .

Introduction
The prepuce is a common anatomical structure of the male [ 1 ] and female [ 2 ] external genitalia of all human and non-human primates ; it has been present in primates for at least 65 million years , and is likely to be over 100 million years old , based on its commonality as an anatomical feature in mammals [ 3 ]
Certain cultures have excised the prepuce from children to conform to societal standards , while other cultures accept the complete external genitalia as normal ( Fig. 1 ) .
The motives for circumcision in preliterate cultures are difficult to define , but include rites of passage , blood sacrifices and cultural markings [ 4 ] .
Ritualistic , childhood genital surgery has become popular in the last several thousand years , making the prepuce the most vilified normal anatomical structure of the human body .
Rather than acknowledging the prepuce as normal anatomy , some contemporary physicians consider the penile [ 5 ] and clitoral prepuce ( or clitoral hood ) [ 6,7 ] to be dangerous and unhealthy .
However , before theoretical justifications for circumcision can be considered , a complete understanding of the normal anatomy and function of the prepuce is required .
This paper reviews the embryology , anatomy and function of the prepuce .

Overview
The prepuce is an integral , normal part of the external genitalia that forms the anatomical covering of the glans penis and clitoris .
The outer epithelium has the protective function of internalising the glans ( clitoris and penis ) , urethral meatus ( in the male ) and the inner preputial epithelium , thus decreasing external irritation or contamination .
The prepuce is a specialized , junctional mucocutaneous tissue which marks the boundary between mucosa and skin ; it is similar to the eyelids , labia minora , anus and lips .
The male prepuce also provides adequate mucosa and skin to cover the entire penis during erection .
The unique innervation of the prepuce establishes its function as an erogenous tissue [ 8 ] .
Ritualistic circumcision involves the involuntary removal of normal , healthy genital tissue from infants and children for religious , societal or theoretical medical benefits .
Although the amount of genital tissue removed is variable , the penile prepuce is removed in nearly all male circumcisions , and the clitoral prepuce is removed in a Fourcroy grade 1 female circumcision [ 9 ] ( see Elchalal , pp.103-108 ) .
Embryology
The male prepuce is formed by a midline collision of ectoderm , neuroectoderm and mesenchyme , resulting in a pentalaminar structure composed of a squamous mucosal epithelium lamina propria ( corion ) dartos muscle , dermis and outer glabrous skin [ 10 ] .
The embryology of the penile prepuce has been controversial since the original account given by Schweigger - Seidel in 1866 [ 11 ] , who described a preputial fold that progressively extended and fused with the epithelial covering of the glans .
Glenister cited Retterer ( 1885 - 1915 ) as the first to show that the prepuce was formed by a combination of preputial folding and the ingrowth of a cellular lamella [ 12 ] .
This ingrowth creates the prepuce , glans , corona and coronal sulcus mucosa .
This results in a common mucosal epithelium of the glans penis and the inner mucosal lining of the prepuce .
The squamous mucosa of the glans penis , coronal sulcus and prepuce should be considered as one tissue compartment [ 10 ] with a common cytokeratin polypeptide pattern [ 13 ] .

After Kayaba et al . [ 22 ] .
The tight preputial ring is shown in green and the type IV and V as red ; a type IV prepuce retracts to the glans corona and type V retracts to completely expose the glans .
The fused mucosa of the glans penis and the inner lining of the prepuce separates gradually over years , as a spontaneous biological process .
Topical steroid [ 14 - 16 ] and nonsteroidal [ 17 ] anti-inflammatory ointments are known to accelerate the glans - prepuce separation .
In male rhesus monkeys exposed to intrauterine diethylstilbestrol , the normal separation of the glans / prepuce is delayed from a normal age of 2.5 - 3 years to 4.5 - 5.5 years [ 18 ] .
Despite this research , the hormones and / or growth factors responsible for this separation of the glans - prepuce are poorly understood .
Gairdner found that 96 % of newborn males have a fused mucosa ; in 20 % of boys aged 5 - 13 years , he reported that the prepuce could not be completely retracted [ 19 ] .
Øster confirmed in a large study that preputial non-separation ( adhesions ) is very common in children and teenagers .
The separation of the prepuce / glans penis mucosa is usually complete by about age 17 years , as confirmed by later Chinese studies ( Fig. 2 ) [ 20,21 ] .
Recent work by Kayaba et al. verified that the preputial orifice may be tight in young boys , but resolves over time ( Fig. 3 ) [ 22 ] .
Without knowledge of the normal development of the penis , some physicians advocate childhood circumcision as a surgical treatment of normal anatomy [ 5 ] .
One study stated that microscopic examination of the prepuce circumcised for phimosis showed normal histology in 46 % of cases [ 23 ] .
As the mean age in that study group was 8.7 years , almost half of these boys were circumcised for a normal stage of penile development [ 22 ] ; a tight preputial orifice with normal histology is not pathological in young boys , but should be considered a normal stage of penile development .
Neonatal circumcision , before the prepuce has naturally separated , involves tearing the common prepuce / glans penis mucosa apart , with the concomitant risk of glanular excoriation and injury .
Manipulation and retraction of the immature prepuce must be avoided to prevent scarring , bleeding , phimosis and psychological trauma [ 24 ] .
Frequently after circumcision , the immature mucosa of the glans and the preputial remnant will fuse [ 25 ] .
Of historical interest , true aposthia ( absence of a prepuce ) with normal development of the urethra and glans must be very rare : however , it is referenced in Jewish law of 1567 CE , relative to a child born circumcised [ 26 ] .
This probably represented hypospadias with incomplete development of the prepuce .
However , some authors believed that `aposthia ' in Jewish males proved the effects of circumcision could be passed on in a Lamarckian - type hereditary transfer of somatic alterations [ 26 ] .
Although it is generally accepted that normal preputial development is required for the successful canalization of the glans urethra [ 27 ] , hypospadias [ 28 ] and epispadias [ 29 ] have been reported with normal preputial development .
These reports underscore the complex development of the prepuce and distal urethra .
Megameatus with an intact prepuce [ 30 ] and subcoronal hypospadias with complete prepuce [ 31 ] are two other variants of hypospadias that are important to recognize as contraindications to newborn circumcision .
The clitoral prepuce develops similarly to that in the male [ 12 ] .
The prepuce of the clitoris forms independently of the urogenital and labioscrotal folds , which form the labia minora and labia majora , respectively [ 32 ] .
The clitoral prepuce is formed by a cellular lamella which grows down on the dorsum of the clitoris [ 12 ] and is fused to the clitoris in the fetus [ 33 ] .
Some authors state that the clitoral prepuce is formed by a splitting of the urogenital folds around the clitoris , with development of the prepuce superiorly and the clitoral frenulum inferiorly [ 34 ] .
However , this theory is discordant with earlier studies [ 12 ] and has not been explicitly proved .
The urogenital groove on the ventral surface of the clitoris prevents circumferential preputial development and results in the hoodlike appearance of the clitoral prepuce .
The urogenital groove of the clitoris eventually regresses and develops into the labia minora [ 32 ] .
In the female , there is no mesenchymal proliferation in the prepuce to form a dartos muscle layer .
Physicians can allay parental fear of normal , intact external genitalia by explaining normal development and maturation .
With this understanding , physicians will also be less likely to amputate normal , healthy genital tissue from children .
Innervation of the prepuce
The male prepuce has somatosensory innervation by the dorsal nerve of the penis and branches of the perineal nerve ( including the posterior scrotal nerves ) [ 35,36 ] .
Autonomic innervation of the prepuce arises from the pelvic plexus .
The parasympathetic visceral efferent and afferent fibres arise from the sacral centre ( S2 - S4 ) , and sympathetic preganglionic afferent and visceral afferent fibres from the thoracolumbar centre ( T11 - L2 ) .
The parasympathetic nerves run adjacent to and through the wall of the membranous urethra [ 35 ] .
Although most neonatal and childhood circumcisions are performed with no anaesthesia [ 37 ] , the complicated innervation of the penis explains why a dorsal penile nerve block provides incomplete pain relief for neonatal male circumcision [ 37,38 ] .
Likewise , a penile ring block cannot block the visceral afferent fibres from the cavernosal nerve nor the posterior scrotal somatosensory branches of the perineal nerve [ 38 ] .
A eutectic mixture of local anaesthetic cream ( EMLA ) does not relieve the pain associated with circumcision because of the complexity of penile innervation and the multiple layers that would have to be penetrated by the topical cream in the newborn penis [ 39 ] .
Amazingly , some modern urology textbooks even recommend wine as an anaesthetic for newborn circumcision [ 24 ] .
Researchers have documented that women with complete spinal cord injury may achieve orgasm with self - stimulation , suggesting that some sensory pathways of the genital tract may bypass the spinal cord by way of the vagus nerve [ 40 ] .
Whether the external genitalia , including the prepuce , are innervated by the vagus nerve has yet to be determined .
Although the sensory and autonomic innervation of the penis and clitoris are similar , there is a remarkable difference in their encapsulated somatosensory receptors .
Sensory receptors can be classified as mechanoreceptors , e.g. Meissner 's corpuscles ( Fig. 4 ) , Vater - Pacinian corpuscles ( Fig. 5 ) and Merkel cells ( Fig. 6 ) ; and nocioceptors ( free nerve endings ) [ 41 ] .
A multitude of names have been used to describe these encapsulated receptors , e.g. Krause , Dogiel , genital corpuscles , Endkalpsen [ sic ] and mucocutaneous end -organs [ 42 ] , but the term corpuscular ( encapsulated ) receptors will be used here to include all of these mechanoreceptors .
Most of the encapsulated receptors of the prepuce are Meissner corpuscles , as they contact the epithelial basement membrane .

The glans penis is primarily innervated by free nerve endings and has primarily protopathic sensitivity [ 43 ] .
Protopathic sensitivity refers to cruder , poorly localized feelings ( including pain , some temperature sensations and certain perceptions of mechanical contact ) [ 44 ] .
In the glans penis , encapsulated end - organs are sparse , and found mainly along the glans corona and the frenulum [ 43 ] .
The only portion of the body with less fine - touch discrimination than the glans penis is the heel of the foot [ 45 ] .
In contrast , the male prepuce ridged band ( Fig. 7 ) at the mucocutaneous junction has a high concentration of encapsulated receptors [ 46 ] .
The innervation difference between the protopathic sensitivity of the glans penis and the corpuscular receptor - rich ridged band of the prepuce is part of the normal complement of penile erogenous tissue .
In females , the glans clitoris and the inner plate of the prepuce have corpuscular receptors on their oppositional surfaces [ 47 ] .
The glans clitoris also has a much denser concentration of Vater - Pacinian corpuscles than either the glans penis or the male prepuce .
The fused common epithelium of the clitoris and the inner plate of the prepuce are reported to have intraepithelial nerves [ 33 ] .
Merkel cells mediate tactile sensations , and are found in glabrous skin ; they have been reported in the clitoris and can be identified in the male prepuce ( Fig. 6 ) [ 49 ] .

Mucosal epithelium ( inner plate of the prepuce )
The mucosal epithelium of the male prepuce is the same as the squamous mucosal epithelium that covers the glans penis [ 10 ] .
The glans penis and the inner prepuce share a common , fused mucosal epithelium at birth .
Regardless of the embryological explanation , this common epithelium does not separate until the proper hormonal and growth factors are present .
The epithelium of the clitoral prepuce is fused in the foetus and has intraepithelial nerves [ 33 ] .
The fused inner plate of the male prepuce / glans has also been reported to have intraepithelial nerves [ 50 - 52 ] .
Ohmori [ 50 ] described intraepithelial nerves within the common prepuce - glans penis epithelium in an 11.5 - cm male embryo , but later studies by Winkelmann on newborn prepuces failed to identify intraepithelial nerves [ 53 ] .
It is understandable why Winkelmann did not find these nerves , as he only studied amputated foreskins and not the normal , fused , prepuce / glans penile unit .
Studies of the complete human foetal penis with careful attention to this area will be required before the assertions of Dogiel and Ohmori for intraepithelial nerves of the male prepuce can be dismissed .
The mucosal epithelium also contains Langerhans cells , but does not contain melanocytes .
Lamina propria of preputial mucosa
The lamina propria of the male and female prepuce is very vascular , which explains the common haemorrhagic complications associated with circumcision .
The male prepuce has looser collagen than the dense collagenous lamina propria of the glans penis .
The ridged band of the prepuce is near the mucocutaneous tip ( acroposthion ) of the male prepuce and , in the unretracted prepuce , usually lies against the glans penis [ 46 ] .
The mucosal lamina propria ( corion ) is devoid of lanugo hair follicles , sweat and sebaceous glands [ 46 ] .
Even in modern textbooks , Tyson 's glands are often described as the source of smegma [ 54 ] ; however , no evidence of Tyson 's glands has ever been described outside of Cowper 's macroscopic description of these glands in 1694 [ 55 ] .
This may be one of the longest held myths in medicine [ 55,56 ] .
Cowper 's description of Tyson 's glands in the human is actually of hirsutoid papillomas of the glans penis , which are fibroepithelial structures and not glandular structures [ 55 ] .
Although other mammals have true clitoral and penile preputial glands which secrete sex pheromones , there is no current evidence of these glands in humans [ 57 ] .
Dartos muscle
The dartos smooth muscle is specific to the male external genitalia and the vast majority of the penile dartos muscle is contained within the prepuce .
The dartos muscle consists of smooth muscle cells invested with elastic fibres ( Fig. 8 ) .
From the prepuce , the delicate , attenuated penile dartos muscle surrounds the shaft of the penis and is continuous with the scrotal dartos muscle .
The penile dartos muscle is temperature - dependent and allows for the volume changes required for erection [ 58 ] .
The function of the dartos muscle has been well described by Jefferson , and its loss to circumcision explains the altered response of the circumcised penis to temperature changes .
In the infant , the muscle fibres are intertwined and arranged in a mosaic - like pattern [ 59 ] , causing the distal prepuce to pucker and close like a one - way valve [ 60 ] .
When comparing the dartos muscle layer of the prepuce in males before and after puberty , the ratio of muscle fibres to elastic fibres decreases .
This may explain why on gross inspection the distal prepuce is puckered in the infant and appears more relaxed in the adult .
The increase in elastic fibres may be necessary for the uncomplicated eversion of the glans in the adult .
While the aetiology of this transformation is unknown , steroid hormones may have an influence , as their topical application can accelerate the retractability of the prepuce in prepubescent boys [ 61 ] .
Nerve bundles of the prepuce run alongside the dartos muscle .
Dermis of the prepuce
The dermis of the prepuce consists of connective tissue , blood vessels , nerve trunks , Meissner corpuscles within the papillae , and scattered sebaceous glands .
The dermis of the male prepuce appears to have more elastic fibres than the lamina propria of the prepuce .
The difference between the elastic fibres in the preputial lamina propria and dermis may also help form the `muzzle ' configuration around the glans penis .
The elastic tissue of the prepuce dermis , along with the dartos muscle arid frenulum , tether the prepuce and help return it to its anatomically correct position after deployment during erection or after manual retraction .
The clitoral prepuce has only a dermal component with fewer elastic fibres than the male prepuce .
The outer layer of the male and female prepuce has occasional sebaceous glands and sweat glands .
Outer epithelium ( glabrous skin of the prepuce )
The outer epithelium of the prepuce consists of stratified squamous cells that are keratinized .
Melanocytes are present in the basal layers .
Langerhans cells and Merkel cells are also present ( Fig. 6 ) .
The Langerhans cells are the first line of the body 's immune defence system and are required for normal immune function .
Merkel cells are specialized neuroendocrine cells that mediate tactile sensations and stain positively with cytokeratin 20 [ 10 ] .
The Merkel cells of glabrous skin contain characteristic membrane - bound dense core granules and are sometimes associated with unmyelinated neurites [ 48 ] .
Merkel cells may express VIP , neurone - specific enolase , chromogranin A and cytokeratin 20 [ 10 ] .
The function and concentration of Merkel cells within the external genitalia has not been extensively studied .
The preputial sac
The male preputial sac is moistened by secretions from the prostate , seminal vesicle and urethral glands of Littre [ 56 ] .
Urine is not a normal component of subpreputial wetness [ 56 ] .
The rich vascular plexus of the prepuce mucosa may facilitate production of a fluid transudate similar to that of the vaginal / vulva mucosa [ 62 ] .
The female preputial sac is kept moist by a fluid transudate .
Unlike some other mammals , the female preputial sac has not been shown to contain any preputial glands .
VIP mediates the moistness of the aroused female genitalia [ 62 ] , but it is unknown whether it also contributes to the preputial moistness of the aroused male .
The moist , lubricated male preputial sac provides for atraumatic vaginal intercourse .
The preputial sac is colonized by Cornybacterium , Gram - negative anaerobes ( especially Bacteroides melamnogemcus ) , Enterococci , Enterobacteria and coagulase - positive Staphylococci [ 63 ] .
Although Mycobacterium smegmatis is reported in a modern textbook as a possible factor in penile carcinogenesis [ 64 ] , attempts to show that M. smegmatis produces carcinogens or procarcinogens have been unsuccessful [ 65,66 ] .
In the study by Neubert and Lentze [ 63 ] , acid - fast bacteria could be seen on the Ziehl - Nielsen smears , but nothing could be cultured in Lowenstein - Jensen medium .
Therefore , the acid - fast organisms found in the preputial sac by Neubert and Lentze could have been mycobacterial contaminants from soil and water , such as M. gordonae [ 67 ] .
Although M. smegmatis may be a commensal organism within the preputial sac it does not cause genital tract disease .
However , M. smegmatis can cause non-genital soft - tissue infections after trauma or surgery [ 68 ] .
The normal bacterial flora of the clitoral preputial sac has not been reported , but it would be assumed to be similar to the vulva , and would include Cornybacterium .
Of interest , one study found M. smegmatis more commonly in female labial smears ( 46 % ) than in male urethral smears ( 4.5 % ) [ 69 ] .
Furthermore , this study showed that circumcision had no effect on the recovery of acid - fast bacteria from the male urethra , and the presence of acid - fast bacteria did not cause urethritis .
These data support the contention that M. smegmatis is a benign commensal organism within the external genital tract .
The preputial sac contains desquamated squamous epithelial cells similar to other mucosal cavities such as the oral cavity or vagina .
This white , creamy material may collect under the prepuce of the clitoris ( smegma clitoridis ) or penis ( smegma preputii ) .
Male smegma has been shown to contain squalene , beta - cholestanol , sterols and long - chain fatty acids [ 65,66,70 ] .
In men over 35 years old , 9,10 - methyleneoctadecanoic acid is present , but it is not found in younger ( 17 - 20 - year - old ) males [ 70 ] .
The function of the steroids , sterols and fatty acids produced within the human prepuce are unknown , but are considered to be protective elsewhere on the skin .
In mammals that have preputial glands , sex pheromones and aggression - promoting pheromones are known to occur [ 57,71 ] .
Clinically , the presence of smegma preputii is a rare finding ; in a prospective examination of 4521 uncircumcised boys , only 0.5 % had smegma [ 72 ] .
In adult men with clinically confirmed phimosis , only 6 % had smegma present on examination [ 73 ] .
Smegma can also be found in up to 25 % of circumcised male children [ 25 ] and can be detected in circumcised adults .
Immunological aspects of the prepuce
Although it has been known for many years that Langerhans and dendritic cells play an essential role in the cutaneous mucosal immune system , only recently has the mucosal immune system been used to prevented urinary tract infections by introducing antigens , i.e. immunisation , via the vaginal mucosa [ 74 ] .
The immunologically active mucosal system of the prepuce may also provide a logical route of administering mucosal vaccines [ 75 ] .
Although it has been known that Langerhans cells can secrete cytokines [ 76 ] , only recently has it been discovered that squamous epithelial cells , with no Langerhans cells , can secrete cytokines and interleukin - 1 that stimulate the immune response of T cells [ 77 ] .
The cytokines released by the preputial mucosa and skin have not been carefully studied .
Weiss et al. were unable to document Langerhans cells in the mucosal surface of newborn foreskins [ 78 ] , but in the adult prepuce , Langerhans cells are easily identified in the mucosal epithelium .
The inability of Weiss et al. to find Langerhans cells in the newborn can be explained by the fusion of the preputial mucosa to the glanular mucosa in the sterile intrauterine environment .
Langerhans cells would not be expected in the fused prepuce / glans penile mucosa until later in life , when the prepuce becomes retractable and the mucosa is exposed to antigens .
The role of the diversity of subpreputial flora in preventing infection has yet to be explored , as the study of the immunological function of the prepuce is in its infancy [ 79 ] .
Circumcision has been justified by some because it removes the Langerhans ' cells of the prepuce [ 80 ] and therefore supposedly decreases the risk of HIV infections .
This theory is flawed , as even after circumcision , there is residual penile mucosa of the glans , and there are Langerhans ' cells in the penile shaft epidermis .
Surgical removal of the Langerhans cells in all mucosa and skin to prevent infections is not feasible , nor rational .
In addition , the aggressive circumcision campaign in the USA has not prevented sexually transmitted infections , including HIV .
Therefore , Langerhans cells of the prepuce should be understood as normal mucosal immune cells , rather than a pathological entity requiring excision .
Preputial coverage of the glans
There is variability in the preputial coverage of the intact glans penis and clitoris .
Some adult men have the glans penis completely covered by the prepuce while others have only partial coverage of the glans [ 46,63 ] .
In a similar manner , the glans clitoris can be partially or completely covered by the prepuce ; this merely represents anatomical variation .
Sexual function
The prepuce is primary , erogenous tissue necessary for normal sexual function [ 8 ] .
The complex interaction between the protopathic sensitivity of the corpuscular receptor - deficient glans penis [ 42 ] and the corpuscular receptor - rich ridged band of the male prepuce [ 45 ] is required for normal copulatory behaviour .
The increased frequency of masturbation , anal intercourse and fellatio reported by circumcised men in the USA [ 81 ] may possibly be due to the sensory imbalance caused by circumcision .
Clearly , amputation of the prepuce causes changes in sexual behaviour in human males [ 81 ] and females [ 82 ] .
The effect of circumcision on penile anatomy
Surgical amputation of the prepuce removes many of the fine - touch corpuscular receptors from the penis and clitoris .
In males , circumcision is essentially a partial penile mucosectomy .
The residual exposed glans mucosa becomes abnormally keratinized with an increase in the number of cell layers in glanular mucosal epithelium .
The urethral meatus is exposed and prone to irritation .
Meatal stenosis can be a complication after circumcision .
During circumcision , the frenular artery may also be ablated , depriving the anterior urethra of its major blood supply .
The combined effect of urethral ischaemia and irritation results in the development of meatal stenosis in 5 - 10 % of circumcised males [ 25,83 - 86 ] .
The risk of glanular injury when tearing the fused penile mucosa , and the development of meatal stenosis , makes circumcision in the newborn period inadvisable [ 87 - 89 ] .
During circumcision , most of the penile dartos muscle is removed ; all that remains is a few bundles of muscle at the circumcision scar .
It has been observed that the flaccid penis in circumcised males tends to hang less vertically than in those with complete anatomy .
The loss of dartos muscle support may explain the difference .
Certainly , the loss of most of the penile dartos muscle makes the penis less able to make positional adjustments during erection and with temperature changes .
For unknown reasons , keloid formation after circumcision is quite rare [ 90,91 ] .
Although the circumcision scar has not been thoroughly studied , there are several different theories as to what happens when the nerves of the sensory receptors of the prepuce are transected during circumcision .
Some have speculated that after circumcision , these nerves regenerate and develop new encapsulated receptors [ 92 ] .
According to this theory , there would be a significant loss of penile sensitivity after circumcision , but this loss would not be apparent 6 months after the circumcision [ 92 ] .
This notion is in direct conflict with human and animal studies that show when a nerve is transected , and the distal tissue is amputated , the proximal nerve undergoes acute axonal swelling [ 93 - 95 ] .
After acute injury , the axon begins to sprout and branch at the injury site .
Without the distal nerve , this frustrated attempt at re-innervation results in a bulbous , disordered tangle of axons , Schwann cells and fibrous tissue .
Histology of the male circumcision scar shows amputation neuromas , Schwann cell proliferation and the bulbous collection of variably sized neurites .
Amputation neuromas do not mediate normal sensation and are notorious for generating pain .
Animal studies show that extirpation of the external genitalia results in acute retrograde degeneration of the nerve axon back to the spinal cord [ 96 ] .
Therefore , the changes in circumcised male sexual behaviour [ 81 ] may be related to a central nervous system alteration by retrograde axonal degeneration , or to peripheral nervous system damage by loss of the prepuce ridged band and amputation neuroma .
It is assumed that amputation neuromas also form at the female circumcision scar , although we are unaware of a formal histology study .
Although foreskin restoration cannot regenerate dartos muscle or encapsulated sensory receptors , it appears that the residual stump of prepuce could be stretched to provide partial covering of the coronal sulcus and corona .
This re-covering of the corona , combined with a reversion of the epithelium to the normal squamous mucosa of the glans , may account for the improved sensitivity reported by men who have nonsurgically restored their foreskins [ 97 ] .
Likewise , it appears that restoration of the female vulva after circumcision may provide subjective improvements in sensitivity and selfesteem [ 98 ] .
Further histological examination and somatosensory evaluation of the circumcision scar and the restored foreskin is needed to explain the altered sensitivity reported by circumcision and restoration .
Discussion
The prepuce is a specialized , specific erogenous tissue in both males and females .
Therefore , surgical excision should be restricted to lesions that are unresponsive to medical therapy , such as lichen sclerosis of the penis ( balanitis xerotica obliterans ) or vulva , which is unresponsive to other therapies ( e.g. topical clobetasol , intralesional corticosteroids , topical testosterone propionate ointment , etretinate , and carbon dioxide or laser vaporization ) [ 99 ] .
Preputial plasty [ 100 ] should be considered in place of circumcision whenever possible , so as to preserve the corpuscular sensory receptors , dartos muscle , penile mucosa and complete function of the penis , while avoiding abnormal exposure and keratinization of the glans penis .
Although some cultures celebrate the abnormal anatomy caused by circumcision , many women [ 101,102 ] and men [ 103 ] have reported this abnormal penile / clitoral exposure to be uncomfortable .
The male prepuce contains the vast majority of the penile dartos muscle that cannot be regenerated after circumcision .
The preputial mucosa and outer epithelium provides adequate epithelial coverage of the erect penis .
The loss of the prepuce ridged band and the formation of an amputation neuroma are two further complications associated with male circumcision .
Although a Fourcroy grade 1 female circumcision would excise less tissue than in a male , this comparison cannot be used to justify female circumcision .
Excision of normal , erogenous genital tissue from healthy male or female children cannot be condoned , as the histology confirms that the external genitalia are specialized sensory tissues .
The complex anatomy and function of the prepuce , along with the fused prepuce / glans penile mucosa in the immature penis , dictates that neonatal circumcision be strictly avoided , as recommended by the Australasian Paediatric surgeons [ 88 ] , Canadian Paediatric Society [ 89 ] , and a paediatric urology textbook [ 87 ] .
Removal of normal genital anatomy in children and infants should be deferred until the individual can make an informed decision [ 104 ] .
If external genital tissue must be excised to combat a disease process that threatens the child 's health , and is unresponsive to medical therapy . , then the amount of tissue should be limited so as to preserve the anatomy and function of the external genitalia .
All genital tissue excised from children should be microscopically examined to confirm the clinical opinion of the disease .
As physicians and parents learn the normal anatomy and functions of the external genitalia , there will be greater understanding of its essential nature , and more attempts to limit its removal .

Four days into his reign , Pope Benedict called the journalists who had been covering his election to what was billed as a press conference .
Addressing the assembled correspondents , photographers , camera operators , sound recordists and producers , he noted that the media were capable of reaching and influencing not only individuals , but whole masses of people - indeed , the whole of humanity .
He thanked us all for our hard work in putting that awesome power at the service of the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican for a few days .
Then he blessed us - and , just as the reporters present were preparing to stick up their hands to ask questions - he left .
It was an eloquent demonstration of the pontiff 's view of the media - as a conduit for getting his church 's image and message out to the ' masses ' of whom he had spoken .
The notion that the media had an intrinsic power of their own to question , reveal and , at times , cause trouble was certainly not apparent then , and has never been apparent since .
Benedict 's predecessor , John Paul II , was an outgoing former actor with a natural talent for gauging the effect of his words .
The new pope is a shy ex-professor .
Yet he has not so far seen fit to equip himself with an adviser to guide him through the minefield of making public declarations on sensitive , complex issues in a media age .
A savvy confidant , like the previous papal spokesman , Joaquin Navarro - Valls , who came from a national daily newspaper , Spain 's ABC , might well have prevented the crisis that enveloped the Vatican this week .
He would have spotted immediately the danger in the pope quoting someone describing the teachings of Mohammad as ' evil and inhuman ' and tried to persuade the pontiff to express his ideas in a rather more tactful fashion .
But tact is one thing ; substance another .
It is doubtless true , as the Vatican Secretary of State , Cardinal Bertone , said yesterday that the Pope had no intention of offending Muslims .
However , both yesterday 's statement and the Pope 's own track record make it quite clear that Benedict XVI sees it as his duty to speak out about the way in which violence in the name of religion seems to be tolerated by some Muslim clerics and actively encouraged by others .
Bertone said the Pope , like the Catholic Church , ' esteems Muslims , who adore the only God ' .
But it is equally no coincidence that the Vatican yesterday chose to set in a bold type the passage of his statement in which he stressed that the Pope had called for a ' clear and radical rejection of the religious motivation for violence , from whatever side it may come ' .
Benedict , as his friend and associate noted , is sincerely committed to dialogue between Christians and Muslims , but he also believes that the link between terrorist violence and its sponsorship by some Muslim clerics is a big obstacle to further progress .
His reaction to 11 September gave a first hint of his view .
' It is important not to attribute simplistically what happened to Islam .
It would be a great error ' , he told Vatican Radio .
But that did not prevent him from asserting immediately afterwards that ' the history of Islam also contains a tendency to violence ' .
There were two strands , he added : the other being a ' real openness to the will of God ' .
' It is thus important to help the positive line , which does exist in its history , to prevail and to have sufficient strength to win out over the other tendency . '
That is the sort of thing his predecessor would never have said .
The overriding preoccupation of John Paul 's papacy was communism .
For the Vatican , as for the United States until the 1990s , Islam was a potentially valuable ally in the struggle with Marxism .
John Paul became the first pope to visit a mosque , and he made sure that an expert on Islam , Francis Arinze , was appointed to head what became the Pontifical Council for Inter - Religious Dialogue , the Vatican 's ministry for relations with other faiths .
Benedict , on the other hand , was elevated to the papacy against an international background in which the dominant confrontation was between aggressive Muslim fundamentalism and the West - secular in parts and Christian in others .
Because the Pope did not use words like ' evil ' or ' inhuman ' , it did not get splashed across the world 's headlines .
But this is not the first time since he became pontiff that Benedict has spoken with concern about the links between Islam and terrorism .
In August last year , he went beyond anything his predecessor had dared to say at a meeting with Muslim leaders in Cologne , challenging them to condemn ' any connection between your faith and terrorism ' .
Unabashedly lecturing his listeners , he added : ' Words are highly influential in the education of the mind .
You therefore have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation .
There is no room for apathy and disengagement , and even less for partiality and sectarianism . '
Under Benedict , the key issue , in Vatican - speak , is not ' dialogue ' but ' reciprocity ' .
Even before his election , there was a growing feeling among Catholic prelates that dialogue with Islam consisted largely of Catholic initiatives .
What is more , endless discussion did not seem to be solving the biggest outstanding problem between the two religions : that while Muslims were free to build mosques , worship and proselytise in the West , Christians were often denied religious freedom in Islamic countries .
Some of the smaller states on the Arabian peninsula have begun to allow Christians to practise their faith openly , but Saudi Arabia , for example , still bans all public expression of non-Muslim religions .
In several other countries , Islamic law effectively deprived Christians of basic rights .
Benedict has made it clear that he sees freedom of worship as merely a start and that , for there to be full reciprocity , Catholic priests will need to be free to fish for souls in Muslim lands .
Last May , he told a Vatican conference on immigration to and from Islamic countries , that while Christians had to respect Muslims , they also had the right to offer them what he called ' the Christian proposal ' .
The German pope unquestionably respects Islam .
But he equally unambiguously intends to stand his ground .
The signs have been there ever since his inaugural mass .
During the service , prayers were read out asking for God 's intercession on behalf of oppressed Christians .
Few noticed , but one was read in Arabic .
Palaiologos : the emperor who called Islam evil and inhumane
Manuel Palaiologos , 1350 - 1425 , Byzantine emperor ( 1391 - 1425 ) , son and successor of John V
He is n't exactly a household name .
And until Pope Benedict 's speech , few will have heard of Manuel II Palaeologus , the medieval Christian ruler and scholar who described Islam as ' evil and inhuman ' .
Emperor , poet , theologian and dad - he married the daughter of a Serbian despot and had seven children - Manuel II was probably not the most objective observer of the Muslim world .
Born on 27 June 1350 , he spent most of his career trying to stop his Byzantine empire from falling into the hands of the Ottoman Turks .
Largely , he did n't succeed .
The Ottomans , a Turkish warrior tribe , had begun chipping away at his Byzantine frontiers a century earlier .
They sent pirates into the Aegean , and reached Europe in 1308 .
By the time Manuel II ascended the throne in 1391 the Ottomans had already overrun most of Asia Minor .
Muslim colonists had overwhelmed Greek settlements .
Manuel II wrote the unhappy letter quoted by the Pope around 1391 , shortly after escaping from the Ottoman court where he had been held prisoner .
A few years later the Ottomans turned up on his doorstep , laying siege to his imperial capital , Constantinople .
The Ottomans called off their siege only five years later .
In 1399 Manuel made an unsuccessful journey to Rome , Paris and London .
His aim was to get help in his lifelong struggle against Islam from the Christian West .
His best efforts failed although Manuel then enjoyed a brief period of respite before the Ottomans besieged Constantinople again in 1422 .
One of his last acts as emperor was to sign a humiliating treaty agreeing to pay tribute to the Ottoman sultan .
He died on 21 July 1425 .
The Turks finally conquered Constantinople in 1453 .
They went on to engulf much of south - east Europe .
