Also myriad nights spent at home " Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has billed taxpayers for 312 nights spent in her own home during her first 19 months in office , charging a " per diem " allowance intended to cover meals and incidental expenses while traveling on state business , " The Washington Post reported Tuesday .
Among these events included a college basketball game -- and a sled race in which her husband competed .
" The governor also has charged the state for travel expenses to take her children on official out - of - town missions , " the paper added .
" And her husband , Todd , has billed the state for expenses and a daily allowance for trips he makes on official business for his wife . "
" Palin , who earns $ 125,000 a year , claimed and received $ 16,951 as her allowance , which officials say was permitted because her official " duty station " is Juneau ... while her husband charged the state $ 43,490 to travel , and many of the trips were between their house in Wasilla and Juneau , the capital city 600 miles away , the documents show . "
Excerpts : Speaking from Palin's Anchorage office , gubernatorial spokeswoman Sharon Leighow said Palin dealt with the plane and also trimmed other expenses , including forgoing a chef in the governor 's mansion because she preferred to cook for her family .
The first family 's travel is an expected part of the job , she said .
" As a matter of protocol , the governor and the first family are expected to attend community events across the state , " she said .
" It 's absolutely reasonable that the first family participates in community events . "
The popular governor collected the per diem allowance from April 22 , four days after the birth of her fifth child , until June 3 , when she flew to Juneau for two days .
Palin moved her family to the capital during the legislative session last year , but prefers to stay in Wasilla and drive 45 miles to Anchorage to a state office building where she conducts most of her business , aides have said .
She wrote some form of " Lodging -- own residence " or " Lodging -- Wasilla residence " more than 30 times at the same time she took a per diem , according to the reports .
In two dozen undated amendments to the reports , the governor deleted the reference to staying in her home but still charged the per diem .
Palin charged the state a per diem for working on Nov. 22 , 2007 -- Thanksgiving Day .
The reason given , according to the expense report , was the Great Alaska Shootout , an annual NCAA college basketball tournament held in Anchorage .
In separate filings , the state was billed about $ 25,000 for Palin 's daughters ' expenses and $ 19,000 for her husband's .
The family also charged for flights around the state , including trips to Alaska events such as the start of the Iditarod dog-sled race and the Iron Dog snowmobile race , a contest that Todd Palin won .

Why are we asking this now ?
The United States and Iraq are close to agreeing a security accord under which the US would pull its combat troops out of Iraqi cities , towns and villages on 30 June 2009 , and out of Iraq by 31 December 2011 .
This will only happen if a joint Iraqi - American ministerial committee agrees that security in Iraq has improved to the point where the half million strong Iraqi security forces can take over .
Other aspects of the draft agreement show that the government of the Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , is increasingly confident of its own military and political strength .
The new accord is very different from the one the US proposed as recently as March , which would simply have continued the US occupation , much as it has been under the UN mandate , which runs out at the end of the year .
The main point about the agreement , if it is implemented as expected , is that the US will cease to be the predominant military power in Iraq from next summer for the first time since the US - led coalition overthrew Saddam Hussein in 2003 .

Will Iraq be able to hold together as US troops depart ?
Yes it will , but not because the three main Iraqi communities love each other .
The Shias are coming out the winners , and this was always inevitable once the US had decided to overthrow the predominantly Sunni regime of Saddam Hussein .
Shias make up 60 per cent of the Iraqi population , and the Sunni Arabs and the Kurds are each about 20 per cent .
Mr Maliki leads a Shia - Kurdish government in which the most powerful element is the Shia religious parties .
The insurgency in which 4,300 American soldiers were killed and 30,000 were wounded was a rebellion of the Sunni community .
This was the war to which the world paid most attention .
But there was a second savage civil war between the Sunnis and Shias , which the Shias won decisively .
They now control most of the government and the army .
They hold at least three - quarters of Baghdad after fierce fighting in the capital in 2005 - 07 .
The Sunnis are now too weak to set up a separate canton .
The Kurds need to remain part of Iraq , however much they may yearn for independence , because otherwise they face invasion by Turkey .
The central government is becoming increasingly assertive against the Kurds , particularly over the issue of who holds Kirkuk and the right to award contracts for oil exploration and exploitation .
Does this mean that the Surge worked and the US has won in Iraq ?
This is mostly propaganda .
The Surge was the increase in US troop levels by 30,000 men , from February 2007 , and more aggressive tactics by the US army under the command of General David Petraeus .
But even before the Surge , it was clear that the Sunni community was being driven out of large parts of Iraq , above all from greater Baghdad .
There was also a backlash against al - Qa'ida , which had overplayed its hand by declaring " the Islamic State of Iraq " in late 2006 .
It has sought to marginalise or kill hostile Sunni tribal leaders .
It killed or mutilated anybody who failed to obey its extreme fundamentalist Islamic beliefs .
Hairdressers were shot dead for giving " un - Islamic " haircuts .
But , above all , the Sunnis could see that al - Qa'ida 's brutal and bloody use of enormous vehicle bombs against Shias had provoked a devastating reaction .
Sunni nationalist insurgents had no choice but to end their guerrilla war against the US forces and seek US support and aid .
There are now 103,000 members of Al - Sahwa , or the Awakening Movement , who are paid for by the US .
American military fatalities are down to only 18 so far this month .
But the fall in violence is only partly to do with the actions of the US .
It is a great mistake to imagine that the US makes all the political weather in Iraq .
The main reason for the end of the Sunni insurgency against the US forces is the defeat of Sunnis by Shias in the battle for Baghdad .

Is al - Qa'ida finished in Iraq ?
It is much weaker than it was .
It has lost its old bastions in Anbar province to the west and in much of Baghdad .
But it is a mistake to think that it is wholly eliminated .
The grim evidence for this is carefully planned assassinations of Awakening Movement members , usually by suicide bombers , that would require good intelligence and organisation .
Al - Qa'ida clearly still has the capacity of launching massive suicide bombs against Shia civilian targets .
Crowded street markets are very difficult to protect .
Surely life in Baghdad and the rest of Iraq is getting better ?
It certainly is improving , but there is a misconception outside Iraq about what this means .
At the height of the Sunni -Shia sectarian conflict , some 3,000 people were being murdered every month .
In July , this figure was down to about 900 , according to the Iraqi Interior Ministry .
This is better , but scarcely represents a return to normal life .
Baghdad is still the most dangerous city in the world .
Sunnis and Shias seldom visit each other 's districts .
The best barometer for the real state of security in Iraq is the ability of the 4.7 million refugees inside and outside the country to return home .
There are about one in six Iraqis who have lost the places in which they used to live .
Often these displaced people live in miserable conditions in Jordan , Syria or other parts of Iraq , but it is still too dangerous , despite all the talk of conditions improving in Iraq , for them to reclaim their homes .
Where does Iran stand in all this ?
This is the most misunderstood element in the Iraq crisis .
The present Iraqi government had two main allies : the US and Iran .
Their dispute is over who should have influence over that government .
Iran has played a crucial role in the success of the so - called Surge .
The Iraqi army fought poorly against the militiamen of the Mahdi Army in March and April .
It was Iran that mediated a ceasefire on the Baghdad government 's terms .
It was Iran which pressured the Mahdi Army 's leader , Muqtada al - Sadr , to call his man off the streets .
A prime reason why Iraq is not going to disintegrate is that Iran does not want it to .
So the departure of US troops from Iraq will not mean a renewed civil war ?
No .
The main civil war is over .
The Shias won and the Sunnis lost .
But the Sunni minority in Baghdad looks vulnerable without American protection .
The Iraqi army is increasingly moving against the Sunni Awakening Movement in Anbar province and elsewhere .
Will Iraq fall apart if the Americans go ?
Yes ...
* Shias , Sunnis and Kurds seem unable to agree on anything
* Almost five million Iraqis are refugees and cannot return to their homes
* The Americans are the only non-sectarian military force
No ...
* The Shia - Kurdish government looks as if it is here to stay
* Sectarian killings are down , though Shias , Sunnis and Kurds live in their own enclaves
* The occupation has always been opposed by the majority of Iraqis outside Kurdistan
Last week , Luis Moreno - Ocampo , chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) filed charges for the first time against a sitting head of state , charging President Omar al - Bashir of Sudan with three counts of genocide , five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes .
Fareed Zakaria had Sudan 's ambassador to the United Nations on his CNN show , GPS , to discuss the charges , which he called " a joke " and cited the U.S. ' 2002 withdrawal from the ICC treaty as an example of why Sudan does not recognize the court 's authority and will not cooperate with it :

ZAKARIA : Will your government mount a defense in the International Criminal Court ?
MOHAMAD : We have no relation with the International Criminal Court .
We do n't recognize its authority .
We are not going to cooperate with it .
ZAKARIA : But of course , you know that other governments that did not recognize the Criminal Court were still forced to extradite their leaders .
I 'm thinking of Yugoslavia .
MOHAMAD : No .
I do n't care about them .
As far as we are concerned , we are not members .
We have been told these days repeatedly that the ICC is an independent body .
And so , OK , if it 's an independent body , I am not a U.N. organ .
We have full right to be part of it or not .
And we choose not to be part of it , like the United States .

Complicating the ICC 's ability to pursue war crimes charges , as referenced in the interview by Sudan 's UN ambassador , is President Bush 's " unsigning " of the International Criminal Court treaty in 2002 .
Though President Bush has publicly denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide , the administration has soft - pedaled sanctions against the Sudanese government to preserve its extensive intelligence collaboration with Sudan , once a safe haven for bin Laden that has become a crossroads for Islamic militants making their way to Iraq and Pakistan .
The most major impediment to ending the genocide in Darfur has been China 's longstanding diplomatic protection and economic support in return for its access to the 500,000 barrels of oil that Sudan produces daily .
China , also not a signatory to the ICC treaty , was revealed in a report about a week ago by the BBC to be in violation of the UN arms embargo there through its export of weapons and training of fighter pilots .
Supporters of Barack Obama who would like to see the United States reembrace the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) treaty , thereby reaffirming its commitment to human rights , have created a group on the candidate 's website , my.barackobama.com .
Sources close to Wanderlei Silva ( 32 - 8 - 1 ) have indicated that the explosive ( and long - rumored ) third showdown between " The Axe Murderer " and Quinton " Rampage " Jackson ( 28 - 7 ) is indeed set , according to MMACanada.net .
The blockbuster light heavyweight match up will co-headline UFC 91 : " Couture vs. Lesnar " at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas , Nevada , on November 15 .
Bout agreements have been distributed to both fighters and are just now awaiting signatures .
Representatives from Silva 's management team , however , indicate that the Brazilian camp will have its end of the agreement signed and completed by the end of the day .
" The Axe Murderer " and " Rampage " of course share quite a bit of history , fighting twice overseas in Japan under the Pride FC banner .
Silva was victorious on both occasions and in rather convincing fashion -- the fights ended with brutal knockouts .
Since that time , Jackson has indicated that he was not necessarily competing on a level playing field .
He and / or his handlers have hinted at everything from unchecked steroid use to crooked officiating .
One thing is for certain -- Jackson is now a much improved fighter who is dedicated to training with partners who can elevate his game .
That was something that he was clearly missing in " The Land of the Rising Sun . "
And now he gets to prove that with the right approach -- and under strict supervision of a regulated sanctioning body -- he can exact revenge once and for all .
Silva 's last appearance was an absolute mauling of " The Dean of Mean " Keith Jardine at UFC 84 : " Ill Will " back in May .
He definitely looked like the " Axe Murderer " of old with a quick and vicious knockout .
For " Rampage , " this will mark his first fight after his highly publicized run-ins with the law and his subsequent split with long - time trainer , Juanito Ibarra .
He will also look to bounce back from his controversial unanimous decision loss to Forrest Griffin at UFC 86 : " Jackson vs. Griffin " in July , which cost him his 205 - pound title .
This is definitely a huge fight that the hardcore fans have been dreaming about -- Silva and Jackson have an epic feud and a real distaste for one another .
This should definitely be another instant classic .

Medieval historians generally are n't bothered by words .
The intrepid medievalist is always ready to leap into the rough - and - tumble milieu of Old English word origins , medieval French literature , and Latin Church documents .
Icelandic sagas hold no terror for the medieval scholar .
Next to these challenges , the esoteric terminology of medieval studies is mundane , no threat to the historian of the Middle Ages .
But one word has become the bane of medievalists everywhere .
Use it in discussing medieval life and society , and the average medieval historian 's face will screw up in revulsion .
What word has this power to annoy , disgust , and even upset the ordinarily cool , collected medievalist ?
Feudalism .
What Is Feudalism ?
Every student of the Middle Ages is at least somewhat familiar with the term , usually defined as follows :
Feudalism was the dominant form of political organization in medieval Europe .
It was a hierarchical system of social relationships wherein a noble lord granted land known as a fief to a free man , who in turn swore fealty to the lord as his vassal and agreed to provide military and other services .
A vassal could also be a lord , granting portions of the land he held to other free vassals ; this was known as " subinfeudation " and often led all the way up to the king .
The land granted to each vassal was inhabited by serfs who worked the land for him , providing him with income to support his military endeavors ; in turn , the vassal would protect the serfs from attack and invasion .
This is a simplified definition , and many exceptions and caveats go along with this model of medieval society .
It is fair to say that this is the explanation for feudalism you 'll find in most history textbooks of the 20th century , and it is very close to every dictionary definition available .
The problem ?
Virtually none of it is accurate .
Description Inaccurate
Feudalism was not the " dominant " form of political organization in medieval Europe .
There was no " hierarchical system " of lords and vassals engaged in a structured agreement to provide military defense .
There was no " subinfeudation " leading up to the king .
The arrangement whereby serfs worked the land for a lord in return for protection , known as manorialism or seignorialism , was not part of a " feudal system . "
Monarchies of the early Middle Ages had their challenges and their weaknesses , but kings did n't use feudalism to exert control over their subjects , and the feudal relationship was n't the " glue that held medieval society together , " as had been said .
In short , feudalism as described above never existed in Medieval Europe .
For decades , even centuries , feudalism has characterized our view of medieval society .
If it never existed , then why did so many historians say it did ?
Were n't entire books written on the subject ?
Who has the authority to say that all those historians were wrong ?
If the current consensus among " experts " in medieval history is to reject feudalism , why is it still presented as reality in nearly every medieval history textbook ?
Concept Questioned
The word feudalism was never used during the Middle Ages .
The term was invented by 16th - and 17th - century scholars to describe a political system of several hundred years earlier .
This makes feudalism a post - medieval construct .
Constructs help us understand alien ideas in terms more familiar to our modern thought processes .
Middle Ages and medieval are constructs .
( Medieval people did n't think of themselves as living in a " middle " age — they thought they were living in the now , just like we do . )
Medievalists might not like the way the term medieval is used as an insult or how absurd myths of past customs and behavior are commonly attributed to the Middle Ages , but most are confident that using Middle Ages and medieval to describe the era as between the ancient and early modern eras is satisfactory , however fluid the definition of all three timeframes might be .
But medieval has a fairly clear meaning based on a specific , easily defined viewpoint .
Feudalism cannot be said to have the same .
In 16th - century France , Humanist scholars grappled with the history of Roman law and its authority in their own land .
They examined a substantial collection of Roman law books .
Among these books was the Libri Feudorum — the Book of Fiefs .
' Libri Feudorum '
The Libri Feudorum was a compilation of legal texts concerning the proper disposition of fiefs , which were defined in these documents as lands held by people referred to as vassals .
The work had been put together in Lombardy , northern Italy , in the 1100s , and over the intervening centuries , lawyers and scholars had commented on it and added definitions and interpretations , or glosses .
The Libri Feudorum is an extraordinarily significant work that has been barely studied since 16th - century French lawyers gave it a good look .
In their evaluation of the Book of Fiefs , the scholars made some reasonable assumptions :
The fiefs under discussion in the texts were pretty much the same as the fiefs of 16th - century France — that is , lands belonging to nobles .
Te Libri Feudorum was addressing actual legal practices of the 11th century , not simply expounding on an academic concept .
The explanation of fiefs ' origins in the Libri Feudorum — that grants were initially made for as long as the lord chose but were later extended to the grantee 's lifetime and afterward made hereditary — was a reliable history and not mere conjecture .
The assumptions might have been reasonable , but were they correct ?
French scholars had every reason to believe they were and no real reason to dig any deeper .
They were n't so much interested in the historical facts of the time period as they were in the legal questions addressed in the ​ Libri Feudorum .
Their foremost consideration was whether the laws had any authority in France .
Ultimately , French lawyers rejected the authority of the Lombard Book of Fiefs .
Examining Assumptions
However , during their investigations , based in part on the assumptions outlined above , scholars who studied the Libri Feudorum formulated a view of the Middle Ages .
This general picture included the idea that feudal relationships , wherein noblemen granted fiefs to free vassals in return for services , were important in medieval society because they provided social and military security at a time when the central government was weak or nonexistent .
The idea was discussed in editions of the Libri Feudorum made by legal scholars Jacques Cujas and François Hotman , who both used the term feudum to indicate an arrangement involving a fief .
Other scholars soon saw value in the works of Cujas and Hotman and applied the ideas to their own studies .
Before the 16th century ended , two Scottish lawyers — Thomas Craig and Thomas Smith — were using feudum in their classifications of Scottish lands and their tenure .
Craig apparently first expressed the idea of feudal arrangements as a hierarchical system imposed on nobles and their subordinates by their monarch as a matter of policy .
In the 17th century , Henry Spelman , a noted English antiquarian , adopted this viewpoint for English legal history .
Although Spelman never used the word feudalism , his work went a long way toward creating an " - ism " from the ideas over which Cujas and Hotman had theorized .
Not only did Spelman maintain , as Craig had done , that feudal arrangements were part of a system , but he related the English feudal heritage with that of Europe , indicating that feudal arrangements were characteristic of medieval society as a whole .
Spelman 's hypothesis was accepted as fact by scholars who saw it as a sensible explanation of medieval social and property relations .
Fundamentals Unchallenged
Over the next several decades , scholars explored and debated feudal ideas .
They expanded the meaning of the term from legal matters to other aspects of medieval society .
They argued over the origins of feudal arrangements and expounded on the various levels of subinfeudation .
They incorporated manorialism and applied it to the agricultural economy .
They envisioned a complete system of feudal agreements running throughout Britain and Europe .
But they did n't challenge Craig 's or Spelman 's interpretation of the works of Cujas and Hotman , nor did they question the conclusions that Cujas and Hotman drew from the Libri Feudorum .
From the vantage point of the 21st century , it 's easy to ask why the facts were overlooked in favor of the theory .
Present - day historians engage in a rigorous examination of the evidence and clearly identify a theory as such .
Why did n't 16th - and 17th - century scholars do the same ?
The simple answer is that history as a scholarly field has evolved over time ; in the 17th century , the academic discipline of historical evaluation was in its infancy .
Historians did n't have the tools , both physical and figurative , taken for granted today , nor did they have the example of scientific methods from other fields to incorporate into their learning processes .
Besides , having a straightforward model by which to view the Middle Ages gave scholars the sense that they understood the time period .
Medieval society becomes so much easier to evaluate and comprehend if it can be labeled and fit into a simple organizational structure .
By the end of the 18th century , the term feudal system was used among historians , and by the middle of the 19th century , feudalism had become a fairly well - fleshed - out model , or construct , of medieval government and society .
As the idea spread beyond academia , feudalism became a buzzword for any oppressive , backward , hidebound system of government .
In the French Revolution , the " feudal regime " was abolished by the National Assembly , and in Karl Marx 's " Communist Manifesto , " feudalism was the oppressive , agrarian - based economic system that preceded the industrialized , capitalist economy .
With such far - ranging appearances in academic and mainstream usage , breaking free of what was , essentially , a wrong impression would be an extraordinary challenge .
Questions Arise
In the late 19th century , the field of medieval studies began to evolve into a serious discipline .
No longer did the average historian accept as fact everything that had been written by his or her predecessors and repeat it as a matter of course .
Scholars of the medieval era began to question interpretations of the evidence and the evidence itself .
This was n't a swift process .
The medieval era was still the bastard child of historical study ; a " dark age " of ignorance , superstition , and brutality , " a thousand years without a bath . "
Medieval historians had much prejudice , fanciful invention , and misinformation to overcome , and there was no concerted effort to shake things up and re-examine every theory ever floated about the Middle Ages .
Feudalism had become so entrenched that it was n't an obvious choice to overturn .
Even once historians began to recognize the " system " as a post - medieval construct , its validity was n't questioned .
As early as 1887 , F.W. Maitland observed in a lecture on English constitutional history that " we do not hear of a feudal system until feudalism ceased to exist . "
He examined in detail what feudalism supposedly was and discussed how it could be applied to English medieval law , but he did n't question its existence .
Maitland was a well - respected scholar ; much of his work is still enlightening and useful today .
If such an esteemed historian treated feudalism as a legitimate system of law and government , why should anyone question him ?
For a long time , nobody did .
Most medievalists continued in Maitland 's vein , acknowledging that the word was a construct — an imperfect one , at that — yet going forward with articles , lectures , treatises , and books on what feudalism had been or , at the very least , incorporating it into related topics as an accepted fact of the medieval era .
Each historian presented his or her own interpretation of the model ; even those claiming to adhere to a previous interpretation deviated from it in some significant way .
The result was an unfortunate number of varying , sometimes conflicting , definitions of feudalism .
As the 20th century progressed , the discipline of history grew more rigorous .
Scholars uncovered new evidence , examined it closely , and used it to modify or explain their view of feudalism .
Their methods were sound , but their premise was problematic :
They were trying to adapt a deeply flawed theory to a wide variety of facts .
Construct Denounced
Although several historians expressed concerns over the indefinite nature of the model and the term 's imprecise meanings , it was n't until 1974 that anyone thought to point out the most fundamental problems with feudalism .
In a groundbreaking article titled " The Tyranny of a Construct : Feudalism and Historians of Medieval Europe , " Elizabeth A.R. Brown leveled a finger at the academic community , denouncing the term feudalism and its continued use .
Brown maintained that the feudalism construct , developed after the Middle Ages , bore little resemblance to actual medieval society .
Its many differing , even contradictory , definitions had so muddied the waters that it had lost any useful meaning and was interfering with the proper examination of evidence concerning medieval law and society .
Scholars viewed land agreements and social relationships through the warped lens of the feudalism construct and either disregarded or dismissed anything that did n't fit into their version of the model .
Brown asserted that , even considering how difficult it is to unlearn something , continuing to include feudalism in introductory texts would do readers a grave injustice .
Brown 's article was well received in academic circles .
Virtually no American or British medievalists objected to any part of it , and almost everyone agreed : Feudalism was n't a useful term and really should go .
Yet , it stuck around .
Has n't Disappeared
Some new publications in medieval studies avoided the term altogether ; others used it sparingly , focusing on actual laws , land tenures , and legal agreements instead of on the model .
Some books on medieval society refrained from characterizing that society as " feudal . "
Others , while acknowledging that the term was in dispute , continued to use it as a " useful shorthand " for lack of a better term , but only as far as it was necessary .
But some authors still included descriptions of feudalism as a valid model of medieval society , with little or no caveat .
Not every medievalist had read Brown 's article or had a chance to consider its implications or discuss it with colleagues .
Additionally , revising work conducted on the premise that feudalism was a valid construct would require the kind of reassessment that few historians were prepared to engage in .
Perhaps most significantly , no one had presented a reasonable model or explanation to use in place of feudalism .
Some historians and authors felt they had to provide their readers with a handle by which to grasp the general ideas of medieval government and society .
If not feudalism , then what ?
Yes , the emperor had no clothes , but for now , he would just have to run around naked .
If Mad Max rode a bike , it would look like the solar - electric trike Australian tinkerer Joe Blake 's spent 15 years building .
It 's just the thing for roaming the post - apocalyptic wastelands , even if Blake uses it for the more mundane task of running to town for tinnies and Vegemite .
Blake is a solar power junkie , avid cyclist and dedicated DIY 'er who lives at the top of a nasty hill about 16 miles outside of " The Big Smoke " ( Perth ) .
The altitude is n't a problem when he 's headed into town but it makes getting home a quad - busting exercise in masochism .
He figured putting an electric motor on his Greenspeed tricycle might make things easier and set to work figuring out how to do it .
Then someone stole his trike .
Blake , 58 , has spent more time on two or three wheels than four since getting hip to the threat of global warming 46 years ago when he read " No More Ice Ages , " Isaac
Asimov 's prescient essay about climate change .
" From that time on I 've tried to make as small an impact as possible on the environment , " Blake tells us .
He bought the trike in 1993 and started playing with the idea of fitting it with an electric motor , but it was stolen before he got very far .
Blake did n't see the bike again until a friend spotted it in a bike shop five years later .
Trike back in hand , Blake resumed tinkering but did n't get far because the technology was n't up to snuff .
" I was waiting for both electric motors and batteries to reach a satisfactory level of performance before committing myself , " he says .
Blake eventually decided to do the best he could with what he had .
He fitted the Greenspeed with a 200 - watt Heinzmann 24 - volt motor wired to a pair of 12 - volt , 12 ampere - hour lead - acid batteries fed by photovoltaic panels that put out 10 watts .
That is n't much , but it keeps the batteries alive during the 31 - mile ride to Perth and back .
The motor does n't drive the wheels full time ; rather , it provides an " electric assist " to help Blake over hills or through a head wind .
" On the flat with no wind , the motor will drive the outfit to 24 km/h , " Blake says .
That 's 15 mph for the metrically challenged .
" The motor has sufficient capacity to enable me to ride up the hill one or even two gears higher than I normally do it , and takes about 30 minutes off my ascent time . "
Blake is n't sure how much weight he 's added to the trike but figures it weighs twice as much with all the technology .
" It 's certainly noticeable when I 'm pedaling , " he says , yet he can still hit 25 mph on a flat stretch of road without any help from the motor .
Once home , he hooks the bike up to a 40 - watt solar array that recharges the batteries in about 24 hours .
Blake has n't kept tabs on what the project 's cost since he 's been plugging away at it for so long , but he figures he could build another one for about $ 8,000 Australian ( US $ 6,800 ) , including the price of the trike .
" If I were to cut corners , we 're probably looking at $ 4,000 . "
That 's a lot cheaper than building a Mad Max Interceptor .

Legendary American physicist John
Wheeler , who coined the term " black hole " , helped build the first generations of US atomic bombs , and worked with some of the most fabled names in 20th century physics , has died .
The famous professor passed away from pneumonia at his home in New Jersey , aged 96 .
Wheeler was described by Max Tegmark of MIT , speaking to the New York Times , as having been " the last Titan , the only physics superhero still standing " .
As a young man , having gained his PhD in Physics at the age of 21 , Wheeler argued with Einstein and collaborated with Niels Bohr on quantum theory .
He was a keen volunteer for the " Manhattan Project " , the World War II race by America to develop the first atomic bombs , and all his life regretted that the first weapons were not ready in time to change the course of war in Europe .
Wheeler 's younger brother Joe was killed fighting in Italy in 1944 .
Apparently aware of at least the outlines of the Manhattan Project , Joe had exhorted his elder sibling to " hurry up " before his death .
" In my mind , I was answering a call to national service , " Wheeler later said of his work in the US weapons programmes .
After helping to develop the " Fat Man " bomb which struck Nagasaki in 1945 , he worked on more powerful hydrogen - fusion warheads during the Cold War .
Initially resistant to the theory of collapsed matter singularities put forward by his old Manhattan Project colleague Robert Oppenheimer , Wheeler was later won over and was credited with being the first physicist to use the term " black hole " to described the phenomenon .
Until then , various other unwieldly names had been in use .
Wheeler 's own contributions to black - hole theory included the famous dictum that " black holes have no hair " , the elimination of the concept of " naked " singularities , and of course the " Hoop Conjecture " ( formulated with Kip Thorne ) regarding the size of a black hole to be expected from the implosion of a given star .
He also teased Einstein with suggestions of a " smoky dragon " of subatomic possibility , a notion akin to the half - dead half - alive cat in a box conundrum .
As a teacher , Wheeler was equally prominent .
His many eminent students included Thorne and noted physics wildman Richard Feynman , who famously said of his mentor : " Some people think Wheeler 's gotten crazy in his later years , but he 's always been crazy . "
Wheeler also supervised the PhD thesis of Hugh Everett , outlining the " many worlds " theory of parallel alternate universes .
The legendary boffin's wife Janette , whom he married in 1935 , died last year at the age of 99 .
They left three children and a total of 41 further descendants , according to the NYT .
Renowned brainbox Freeman Dyson considered
Wheeler to have hugely advanced interest in physics and the search for new knowledge .
He said in 2003 : " Wheeler is a prophet , standing like Moses ... looking out over the promised land that his people will one day inherit . ” ®

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A California law firm will sue Fannie Mae FNM.N on Tuesday on behalf of holders of the mortgage finance company 's preferred shares , a lawyer with the firm said late on Monday .
“ We will be filing tomorrow ... against Fannie Mae for preferred shareholders who were told just two months ago , ‘ Buy the preferred shares , you can never go wrong , ’ ” attorney Joseph Cotchett , of Cotchett , Pitre & McCarthy in Burlingame , California , told Reuters .
The lawsuit will be filed in federal court in New York , Cotchett said .
What binds America is values in our Constitution
Diversity in America is as old as the nation itself .
As the home to citizens of more ethnic backgrounds and religious faiths than any other nation on earth , America is not sustained by the same type of cultural unity as most European or Asian nations .
So what holds us together ?
For well over two centuries , the values of our Declaration of Independence and Constitution have served to unify Americans of every background : e pluribus unum .
In signing the Constitution on this day in 1787 , our founders built America on the values that have sustained us to this day , the ideals of self - government , liberty , and equality - all in pursuit of a more perfect union .
Yet these ideals are not automatically renewed in each generation .
In the words of education reformed John Dewey , " democracy must be reborn in every generation , and education is its midwife . "
Dewey was not alone in understanding schools as the primary means of ensuring that Americans have the civic knowledge and virtue necessary for responsible citizenship .
Nearly forty state constitutions cite the civic mission of schools as the reason for the establishment of their public school systems .
Despite this original mission , over the past generation the number of civics classes offered to youth has been in steady decline .
Until the 1960s it was common for students to take three civics courses focused on citizen responsibility in a democracy , but today most schools only offer a single , often optional course for seniors about to graduate high school .
This decline undermines the health of a democracy premised on citizen participation .
On the last national civics assessment , released in 2006 , two - thirds of students scored below proficient and less than a fifth of high school seniors could explain how citizen participation benefits democracy .
This decline comes at a time when we most need citizens to understand their role in our democracy .
The great challenges America faces - from energy dependence to a growing deficit to the war in Iraq - demand shared sacrifice on the part of an engaged citizenry .
A nation that is becoming more culturally , ethnically , racially , and economically diverse faces grave threat if young people are not prepared for active citizenship and feel a sense of civic obligation toward each other and their nation .
Moreover , a growing civic achievement gap threatens our most core ideals of equal citizenship .
On the last national civics assessment , African - American and Hispanic students are twice as likely as their White counterparts to score below proficient on national civics assessments , and a similar gap exists based on a student 's economic class .
This knowledge gap correlates with a gap in attitudes .
Minority and low - income students are less likely to trust each other and our national institutions , resulting in vast differences in political participation based on race and class .
In a democracy premised on citizen participation and citizen equality , the civic participation gap threatens the cornerstone of our national legitimacy .
How can our government fulfill Lincoln 's goal of being " of the people , by the people , for the people " if only some people have the tools to participate ?
Each generation in our history has been more diverse than the one that came before it .
We must ensure that every citizen - from the descendant of the Pilgrims to the newest American - shares the knowledge and the tools necessary to affect change in their communities .
Only through civic education can we preserve the Constitution 's ideal of a society in which " We the People " control our own futures .
Ever use a phone headset while driving ?
It s distracting .
You might find yourself precariously steering with your left knee while positioning the plug into the jack , dialing with one hand and steadying the earpiece with the other .
God help you if you re using a clutch .
Some headset models are less clumsy , but such madness is and will remain perfectly legal in California , because its hands - free a fitting term for such acrobatics .
Driving while talking on the phone the old - fashioned way , however , will be punishable by a small fine beginning July 1 .
Do those gizmos really make driving while gabbing safer ?
Studies done by the New England Journal of Medicine ( 1997 ) , the National Safety Council ( 2001 ) , the University of Utah ( 2003 ) , the Swedish National Road Administration ( 2003 ) , the Canadian Automobile Association for Traffic Safety ( 2004 ) , the British Medical Journal ( 2005 ) , and Carnegie Mellon University ( 2008 ) indicate theres little if any difference whatsoever .
In 2003 the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimated 2,600 annual phone - related road deaths nationwide .
The California Highway Patrol counted only six phone - related traffic fatalities statewide in 2006  out of over four thousand .
How many more people crashed because they were sleepy , angry , ill , talking to a passenger , eating , or dialing the radio ?
Do we need laws against such distractions too ?
The Public Policy Institute of California considers the CHP figure way too low : it estimates the new headset rule could save 300 lives statewide annually , based on declining accident rates in states with similar laws .
But crediting the trend to the law assumes general compliance .
Yet people still break drunk - driving and drug laws as much as ever , despite increasingly draconian penalties that make this meager fine look like a joke .
Fatal traffic accidents are a horrifying epidemic .
They claim forty - two thousand American lives yearly and one out of fifty deaths worldwide .
This leading cause of death surpasses terrorism , illegal drugs and crime combined .
If phone use is a major factor , why the wrist slap ?
( On the other hand , 1.1 million people worldwide died on roads last year , including in dozens of countries with cell phone restrictions , many stricter than the California law . )
The analogy between driving on the phone and drunk driving is overblown , but consider : after Clinton lowered the blood alcohol limit in 2000 , police spent much more time stopping , arresting , and processing lighter drinkers at the cost of catching heavier ones .
This might be why from 2000 to 2003 , drunk - driving deaths began to inch upward again , after two decades of decline ,  argued Radley Balko in The Washington Times in 2005 .
Instead of reducing reckless driving , strict DUI laws can miss the point .
These cell phone tickets will only waste more police time .
But theyll bring in revenue the real motivation behind many traffic laws .
Consider red - light cameras .
In Los Angeles , about 80 % of red - light camera tickets go to drivers making rolling right turns .
Meanwhile , Dallas and other cities are rethinking the cameras altogether : when they successfully discourage drivers from running red lights they bring in less ticket revenue .
Cant have that .
Perverse incentives explain why , aside from proposing more fines , cops and privacy invasions , politicians never really confront the unacceptable traffic death toll .
When cracked paint or tainted spinach hurts even a few , public activists and politicians loudly demand investigations and new regulations .
When 42,000 Americans die on government roads , it is mostly ignored .
But if a business produced nearly so many dead customers , it would be seen as a conclusive indictment of capitalism .
People understandably hold government to especially low standards , but why not consider private and community ownership of roads ?
Half the roads in nineteenth - century America were not built by tax - and - spend government .
And today , all residential roads are private in places such as North Oaks , Minnesota .
With government out of the way , road rules would still be standardized to cultural norms , but the market would set particular safety policies .
Business owners would have to provide safe roads while avoiding costly , counterproductive practices that alienate their clientele .
Most important , Americans would not accept nearly as many deaths on private roads as they now assume as a fact of life on government roads .
Such a proposal is radical but Californias 4,000 annual road deaths demand a dramatically different approach .
All this new law promises is a boost to the headset industry .
The prices of cars and some private jets are steadily going down as fuel prices increase .
While taking public transportation or purchasing a hybrid vehicle may be viable options , these motion simulators are hard to beat when it comes to value .

When I first saw 280 North ’s “ 280 Slides ” application , I have to admit I was very impressed .
They built a truly native - feeling ( well , if you ’re on a Mac ) tool on the standard web platform .
Not an easy feat , and clearly some big brains operating on the problem .
But the more I read about their toolkit ( Objective - J ) , the more unsettled I felt .
It ’s the same feeling I get when I see tools like Flex .
These are some seriously complicated development environments , meant to abstract away to the fundamental building blocks of the web .
When 280 North released their Objective - J toolkit a few days ago , called Cappuccino , I poured through their documentation and demos to get my head around what they had built .
And it ’s very impressive .
But as a jQuery addict , I did n’t like their dismissal of it as at tool for making small adjustments to a web page .
I feel that you can build a full - fledged web application in jQuery just as simply — or simpler — by embracing HTML / CSS as a layout engine , and JavaScript as a scripting language .
So I tackled re-implementing their FlickDemo application ( several hundred lines of Objective - J ) using jQuery and jQuery UI .
It took about 3 hours to build , and ended up being about 45 lines of code ( plus the frameworks , of course ) , and just under 200 lines of CSS declarations .
What I did n’t do : I did n’t bother hacking the CSS to work in Internet Explorer .
It ’s not that it could n’t be done — jQuery supports it just fine — I ’m just lazy .
So you ’ll need a modern WebKit or Gecko browser to see the demo .
I also did n’t implement the drop shadows that Cappuccino uses on their images .
Also , the jQuery version does n’t take over all you keyboard shortcuts , so you can still navigate around in your browser .
Original Cappuccino version
My jQuery version
Download the source here : flickrDemo-jQuery.zip
Update : Due to popular demand , I ’ve changed the behavior of the slider so the image size updates in realtime .
Total change : one word .
Update 2 : Alexander Simmerl was nice enough to provide an upgrade to the image loading , bulking up the code by a few lines but greatly improving the load animation .
In the comments , dak contributed a 2 - line CSS fix for the inline - block layout problems in FF2 and IE7 , which I ’ve also merged .
I think this is as far as I ’ll take the demo .
Ultimately , it ’s not that compelling of an application ( but it does make a good demo ) .
To respond to some of the criticism I ’ve read , my point was not to argue that jQuery was a drop - in replacement for Cappuccino .
Clearly there ’s a ton of nuances to the Cappuccino runtime that would need to be carefully reimplemented if we wanted a 100 % identical demo .
My point is that it ’s quite simple to do web application development in jQuery , and something as heavy as Cappuccino is not the only option ( and in many cases , probably not the best option ) .
I see Cappuccino as a kind of AIR - in - reverse ( native apps that run in a web browser ! ) and possibly an interesting technology path for coders that are already familiar with Cocoa but do n’t have experience with the nuances of direct web development .
One thing I ’m sure of is HTML / CSS / JavaScript are not going anywhere … they may be complimented by frameworks like Cappuccino , but the core will remain .

As Pakistan reeled from one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in its history , rescuers today continued the search for victims of a suicide truck bombing that leveled a five - star hotel frequented by foreign diplomats and the nation ’s elite .
At least 40 people were killed and 250 wounded when a truck full of explosives was rammed into the gates of the Marriott Hotel .
The thunderous blast in the heart of the Pakistani capital reverberated for miles , carving out a crater 30 feet deep and setting off a fire that continued to burn into the early hours of today .
Dozens of people were believed trapped inside .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack , which came hours after Pakistan ’s new president , Asif Ali Zardari , delivered his first speech to lawmakers .
Islamic militants have vowed to destabilize Zardari ’s government , which is faced with deepening economic gloom and growing public anger over Pakistan ’s alliance with the U.S. , especially over American military operations against the Taliban and other Islamic extremists who have set up base in Pakistan .

Western anti-terrorist officials were eager to see whether responsibility for the attack would be claimed by the core leadership of Al Qaeda or by one of an array of radical fundamentalist groups operating in the lawless regions along the border with Afghanistan .
Fundamentalist groups , including Lashkar - e - Taiba , Jaish - e - Muhammad and Lashkar - e- Jhangvi , appear to be stepping up their coordination to attack the Pakistan government in retaliation for efforts to combat extremism in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , officials said
The size of the truck bomb , the successful strike against a well - guarded target and the apparently careful planning were all signs of a skilled and experienced militant group .
“ I do n’t think it was the Taliban , ” said Sajjan Gohel of the Asia - Pacific Foundation , a London - based think tank on terrorism and security issues .
“ It seems more Al Qaeda , or a group affiliated with Al Qaeda , because of the scope and the ferocity of it . ”
Advertisement
If Al Qaeda was involved , it probably would claim responsibility in an emphatic way to demonstrate that it remains viable despite the loss of key leaders this year in Pakistani government offensives and U.S. air attacks .
After a bombing at the Danish Embassy in Islamabad killed six people in June , Al Qaeda released a detailed video claiming responsibility for the blast and identifying the suicide attacker as a Saudi militant .
Saturday ’s bombing struck an American brand - name hotel that has been an institution here , a longtime gathering place for Pakistani officials and foreigners engaged in social networking and political intrigue .
“ That ’s to show that they could strike in the heart of Islamabad , ” Stephen Cohen , a Pakistan expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , said of the militants ’ apparent motive .
“ It was a symbolic target . ”
The hotel is less than a mile from Pakistan ’s parliament and is near the prime minister ’s residence , where Zardari and many of his ministers were dining when the blast went off about 8 p.m.
Commandos swiftly surrounded the house and kept the officials sequestered inside for several hours .

The suicide bomber ’s truck was packed with more than a ton of explosives , authorities said .
The massive blast ripped through the Marriott Hotel ’s walls , blew out ceilings , scorched trees , reduced nearby cars to charred husks of twisted metal and shattered windows hundreds of yards away .
Flames began shooting out of the windows of many of the hotel ’s 290 rooms .
“ I felt that a powerful earthquake had struck , ” said Mohammed Mushtaq , who works at a government building across from the hotel .
Although the hotel had been targeted by at least two smaller attacks in recent years , this time the bombing ’s planners picked an hour when the building was sure to be overflowing with people : after sunset , as hotel guests and other visitors sat down in one of several restaurants to break the daily fast observed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan .
Ahmed Yasin , a hotel employee , said he saw people bolt toward the rear exits after the blast tore through the front section and reception area .

Dazed and bloodied survivors staggered through smoke and rubble .
Body parts were strewn over a large area .
Among the wounded were a number of foreigners , including citizens of Germany and Saudi Arabia .
The State Department said at least one American was killed and that several others were injured and that officials were working to notify the next of kin .
Lou Fintor , an embassy spokesman , said there were no official functions scheduled at the Marriott on Saturday evening .
But American delegations often stay at the Marriott ; last week the staff of Navy Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , was there .
In Washington , the Bush administration strongly condemned the bombing .

“ This is a reminder of the threat we all face .
The United States will stand with Pakistan ’s democratically elected government as they confront this challenge , ” said Gordon Johndroe , a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House .
Zardari , who is scheduled to meet Bush at the United Nations this week , made a brief statement on national television after the bombing , vowing to rid his nuclear - armed country of the “ cancer ” of terrorism .
He reminded Pakistanis that he was no stranger to the horrors of such violence :
His wife , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , was assassinated last December .
Earlier in the day , during his first address to parliament , Zardari pledged to “ root out terrorism and extremism wherever and whenever they may rear their ugly heads . ”
But his actions are severely constrained by Pakistan ’s military and intelligence services , which remain the most powerful institutions in the land and elements in which have a long history of actively aiding Islamic fighters .

During the tenure of former President Pervez Musharraf , U.S. officials expressed dissatisfaction with what they saw as a less - than - full - bore campaign by the Pakistani army against the Islamic militants who took refuge in the rugged , lawless tribal regions .
Many of these militants are associated with the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
In recent months , U.S. security forces have stepped up their fight against Al Qaeda ’s core leaders in northwest Pakistan , unleashing missile strikes and cross - border military operations from Afghanistan .
Zardari and other Pakistani leaders have denounced such operations as infringements on their country ’s sovereignty .
“ They find it easy to criticize the U.S. for incursions rather than deal with the real problem , which is radical extremism , ” Cohen said .
He added that a crucial question now is whether , after the brazen and spectacular attack on such a high - profile target as the Marriott Hotel , the Pakistani military will be roused to push back against the militants with more force .

“ It ’s 100 % the army .
If they feel this is an existential attack on Pakistan , then they have to mount a savage operation to counter it .
There ’s no two ways about it , ” Cohen said .

There have been no reported problems in the UK , but the company said that anyone who believed their machine was part of the recall should contact the firm to organise a free inspection and rework of the wiring where needed .
The world just got a bit riskier for us road warriors .
You see , theres this perfect storm of risks lined up to make our lives a little more dangerous .
Heres why , and heres what we can do to fight back .
In the last couple years , a new breed of mobile user has sprung up .
Thanks in large part to the iPhone ( and the iPhone - wannabees ) , the world now has a lot more mobile devices hungry for a live ( and free ) Wi -Fi connection .
Sure , weve been using Wi -Fi for years , but at least for many of us , what was once the casual and even occasional laptop login has become a more convenient and far more frequent quick check for email , stock reports , headlines , etc .
We re using our hyper - mobile devices all the time now .
Standing in line at the coffee shop , we quickly fire up our pocket - sized devices to see whats going on in the world .
Now , heres where the risk storm comes in .
When you point your Wi-Fi interface at a local wireless access point ( WAP ) , you re implicitly trusting it .
Say , for example , you re in your favorite coffee shop and turn on your mobile device and see theres a Wi -Fi net presentsay , something like  Acme - wireless . 
You see its not using WEP , so you blindly and courageously take the leap of faith and connect to it .
Once on the wireless , you bring up your browser and try to connect to a Web site .
Looks fine , so you login to that web site , perhaps providing your login credentials ( or a browser - stored cookie containing your login credentials ) .
Away you go and away your login credentials go .
Youve just fallen for the oldest trick in the book , the dreaded man in the middle attack ,  and your attacker now has your credentials / cookie .
How could that have happened , you ask ?
Well , when you signed onto  Acme - wireless ,  you trusted that it was indeed  Acme - wireless  and that it is operated by an honest business .
The only proof you had that it was indeed  Acme - wireless  was that it said so .
Youve been duped .
Yes , it s easy to do .
It would be absolutely simple to configure a laptop PC to masquerade as  Acme - wireless  and then to collect login credentials from unsuspecting mobile users seeking a free Wi -Fi fix .
After all , the Wi-Fi standard provides no mechanism for the user to authenticate the server .
None . Nada .
Zip .
And that s just one kind of Wi -Fi - based attack .
It gets worse .
When you connect over Wi -Fi , a lot of relatively sensitive information ( e.g. , passwords , session IDs , cookies ) is routinely passed unencrypted and is thus open to being trivially sniffed by anyone else on the same Wi -Fi site .
That person sitting next to you in the coffee shop could well be running a sniffing tool like Wireshark and collecting anything sensitive that your browser or email client emits .
Now , combine all that with the fact that our hyper - mobile devices are getting smaller and smaller , while at the same time becoming more and more capable as powerful computing devices .
Further , we re starting to trust them more and more for connecting to sensitive network services , including financial services and such .
That is to say that they are without a doubt becoming serious targets by the miscreants of the world who want to liberate your money from your wallet .
TYLER , Texas ( AP )  A Texas man accused of starting a " kindergarten " where children as young as 5 learned to have sex with each other and were given Vicodin - like " silly pills " to help them perform took the stand Friday and denied the charges .
Patrick " Booger Red " Kelly , 41 , is charged with engaging in organized criminal activity and aggravated sexual assault of a child .
He is accused of helping teach the kids to have sex with each other and dance provocatively .
He also allegedly helped run the Mineola Swinger 's Club , where prosecutors say the children performed for paying audiences .
The children , ages 5 to 7 , were given Vicodin - like drugs passed off as " silly pills " to help them perform , prosecutors said .
Kelly denied knowledge of such pills .
He said he did n't touch the children or make the kids do any kind of sexual dancing .
If convicted , Kelly could face life in prison .
That was the sentence jurors handed down this year in the trials of two others linked to the club , Jamie Pittman and Shauntel Mayo .
Four other defendants in the case are awaiting trial .

The awkward moment when Charlie Gibson tries his best not to press the point that Sarah Palin does n’t know what he ’s referring to when he asks her about the “ Bush Doctrine ” …
The time crept by so slowly and painfully that the 23 - year - old Columbia University journalism student had decided it was time to end her life .
Over many torturous hours , she had been repeatedly raped , sodomized and forced to perform oral sex , a prosecutor told a jury on Thursday .
The accused , Robert A. Williams , 31 , had doused the woman ’s face and body with boiling water and bleach , forced her to swallow handfuls of pills and to chase them with beer , sealed her mouth with glue , and bound her wrists and legs with shoelaces , cords and duct tape , said the prosecutor , Ann P. Prunty .
And now , Ms. Prunty said , he was asking the woman to gouge out her own eyes with a pair of scissors .
And so the woman , sitting on the floor of her studio apartment in Hamilton Heights and holding a pair of scissors between her knees  the blade pointing toward her face  tried to stop the suffering .
She lowered her face to the blade , but turned her head at the last moment , trying to stab herself in the neck instead of her eyes .
The scissors slipped from her grasp , the suicide attempt failed , and the woman suffered several more hours of torture , Ms. Prunty said .
PETER ’S NEW YORK , Sept. 27 , 2008 — As Congress considers a bailout package to stave off the collapse of the American financial system , it might do well to remember that it was legislation it passed some 40 years ago that led to the current crisis .
In 1965 and 1968 , during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson , Congress voted in two stages to remove the reserve requirements for Federal Reserve notes .
These requirements were that for every note issued , there had to be 25 percent of its value in gold held in reserve .
At the same time , the value of the dollar was maintained at $ 35 for an ounce of gold .
These restraints put some definite limits on what the Federal Reserve was able to do .
If it wanted to issue more currency , it had to bolster the nation ’s gold reserves .
After Congress removed gold reserve requirements , the Fed had no limits on the amount of currency it could issue .
This was truly the end of the dollar as a stable monetary unit .
Nixon 's abandonment of a fixed parity between gold and the dollar in 1971 was a direct result of the lifting of reserve requirements , even though Nixon is often blamed for a situation not of his own making .
The removal of reserve requirements paved a very bumpy road that has led to the present economic debacle .
The solution is not a bailout , however , but a return to the gold standard .
It is not a matter of nostalgia for the good old days .
It is a call for a return to a stable and honest monetary regime .
Fiat currency such as is issued by the Fed does not behave well as money .
It has liabilities that are not curable .
We are reaping the results of these liabilities .
One of them is that it cannot supply enough money to the economy , because the monetary base is continually revalued downward .
This is what we call inflation , or — what is merely the other side of the same coin — monetary contraction .
Pundits have continually derided the gold standard over the past 30 or 40 years .
But a commodity standard such as the gold standard is remarkable in that it allows the monetary base to expand while keeping the purchasing power of the monetary unit stable .
It is these two characteristics that make a commodity standard such as the gold standard attractive , and , in fact , indispensible to a well - functioning economy .
How do we get back to a gold standard ?
It 's easy .
Go to the corner store , offer the proprietor to buy something with gold , and see what he charges you .
When you have completed the transaction , you and the proprietor are on the gold standard .
When this practice expands , a more universal gold standard comes into being .
Money is really only a convenient form of barter , and can never be more or less than that .
The use of gold for this streamlined barter system is a natural choice because of its various properties .
Bank notes , on the other hand , carry with them an additional element of risk that is often unstated , but very real .
They are mere promises to pay , and the promise is often not kept .
The difference between gold and a bank note is the difference between a well - functioning monetary system and a scam , and a scam is what our country has labored under since the removal of gold reserve requirements in the 1960s .
There are subjects I find ways to avoid or not dwell on for too long ... I do n't think am a terribly courageous woman for doing so .
But then , these subjects are so painful for me that if tackled , leave me totally depleted , enraged like some animal gone wild in a metal cage , or terribly hopeless ...
Hopelessness not to be understood as in " I want to kill myself now " kind of hopelessness , but a hopelessness that is best translated as loss of Faith .
Again loss of faith not in a strictly religious / metaphysical sense , but loss of Faith in the broadest of terms ... Can be summed up as loss of Faith in humanity , in human kind .
Not to be underestimated at all .
Dark stuff is made of a lost humanity .
The darkest moments of an Occupation ...
These darkest moments can be found everywhere in Iraq .
In the smelly rotten prisons .
In the torture wounds of the detainees .
In the snatched childhoods .
Under the rubbles of a bombed home .
In the morgue underneath the putrid stench of Death .
In the wails at the overfilled cemeteries .
In the destroyed ancient statues and a weeping History .
In a river that stood still .
And in a lone Palm tree thirsty for some water ...
But above all , these darkest moments are found in the silence of Women .
The women who have been silenced and the women who fear it .
The women who witnessed it and the women who dare not break it ...
The other day I was zapping from boredom ... I hardly ever watch TV and it is only recently that I owned one .
A friend wanting to update hers with a " new slimmer version " gave me her old one .
So I was zapping away through a thousands channels , wondering would if it ever be possible to watch all the channels , all at once and be done with it ?
Instead of this monotonous zapping -- only to fall on some idiotic program in Russian , Polish , Chinese , Turkish , Arabic , English , Hindi , Portuguese , Italian , Spanish , German , French , Kurdish , Persian , Hebrew and Assyrian - l'embarras du choix in this vast box of nonsense .
I finally settled to what is familiar .
I watched some Lebanese program that invites " controversial " guests and deals with " controversial " topics .
I must admit , the Lebanese are possibly the only ones in the Arab world who dare along these lines ... Until Iran decides otherwise .
The subject was no biggie , it was about Al - Moda - Fashion . "
Are you a slave of Fashion ? " to be more precise .
The invited " controversial " guest , Mariam Noor , some self proclaimed -- esoteric , mystical guru , with a heavy debit of verbiage that borders on lunacy ... A mishmash of religion , new age , color therapy , numerology , macrobiotics , and alternative living ... and the others -- some eccentric guests who are bent on " affirming their individuality " through liposuction , botox , silicone , plastic surgery , spiky hair , piercing , tattoos , bleached hair , and the heavy metal look with chains , whips and studs ... and of course mainstream Al - Moda adepts ...
I was about to zap away from this crap , when suddenly , the set switched off the lights and the TV room was immersed in darkness , and some deformed voice from behind a thick veiled screen was asked a question by the presenter .
" Tell us X , have you been a victim of Fashion yourself ? "
The woman behind the thick veiled screen was an Iraqi .
I could tell from her accent .
- Yes , I was a victim of Al - Moda .
I was punished for following it .
- Tell us what happened to you ?
- I was walking in the street , heading home , when I noticed several cars encircling me .
I was gagged and thrown in one of the cars ... ( she stops )
- Then what happened , did they do anything to do ?
X replies -- I was held for several days and one day I found myself unconscious in a hospital .
Obviously X was repeatedly gang raped by her kidnappers .
- Who were they and why do you think they did this to you ?
- They were religious extremists dressed in black , and they said they will teach me a lesson for following the Moda .
- What were you wearing on the day of your abduction ?
Of course , the audience , including me were wondering what on earth this poor X was wearing that day .
What kind of indecent dress would merit such a punishment .
X hesitantly said with a trembling voice , shaking with guilt - I was wearing a pair of blue jeans and a long sleeved t.shirt .
But , she continued , I have always dressed that way before ...
- And now how do you dress ?
- I wear long skirts and a veil
- Even though you escaped to Lebanon ?
- Yes even here .
X 's severe punishment for wearing a pair of blue jeans and a long sleeved T - shirt merited that she gets gang raped and later found unconscious in some hospital bed , and eventually exiled ...
X 's story is common .
I have heard many of them and worse ...
So far , according to official governmental data and we all know that the current puppet government is a master of deceit , confirms that over 20'000 women have been punished and their punishment has resulted in death -- for " immoral " behavior .
" Immoral " behavior in the " new liberated " Iraq consists of wearing a pair of blue jeans and a long sleeved T - shirt , going out unveiled , wearing make up ( unless one is a Green Zone hooker , i.e working for the occupation and its proxies ) , falling pregnant following rape , dishonoring the family through some love affair , suspicion of adultery , accusations of lewdness , mixing and talking with men ... Just about anything really .
Anything that ticks the men off ...
When the stories from Basrah emerged , the stories of over 150 women raped , mutilated , decapitated , tortured and murdered for " immoral " behavior by the sectarian militias waiting for their Mahdi .
I wrote to a friend and told her - these are not the true figures .
- the true figure is in the thousands .
Not counting the Sunni " Nawasib " victims of sectarian rape and torture - because it is HALAL to do so with them .
And not counting the thousands of women who are raped and rotting away in prisons with no charges and no trial .
And not counting the thousands who are already gone ... murdered either by the occupier or its proxies .
The American occupier was the first one to set precedence , in Abu Ghraib , when hundreds of women were repeatedly raped and tortured by your brave boys .
And of course the story of Abeer from Mahmoudiah was one of the few ones that was leaked ...
I tell you , there are hundreds of other stories that are muffled and covered , blacked out ... under thick veils , behind thick screens , caged in metal boxes ...
A REMINDER of one of the stories .
The story of Nadia released from Abu Ghraib .
I am going to copy it in its entirety and I want you to read it more than once and not gloss over it in a couple of seconds ... I want it to sink in into your being and become part of it - a reminder , a symbol of your Occupation .
“ I was visiting one of my relatives , and suddenly the American forces attacked the home and started to inspect it .
They found some light weapons .
So , they arrested all people in the home including me .
I tried to explain to the interpreter , who was accompanying the American patrol , that I am just a visitor .
However , my trials failed .
I cried , begged them , and I lost consciousness from fear when they took me to Abu Ghraib prison .
They put me alone in a dark and dirty prison cell .
I expected that I will be released soon , especially when the investigation proved that I had n’t committed a crime .
The first day was so burdensome .
The cell was malodorous , humid and dark , and this condition increased the fear inside me more and more .
The laughs of the soldier outside the cell made me even more scared .
I was afraid of what would happen to me .
For the first time I felt that I was in a difficult gridlock and that I had entered an unknown world that I would not get out of .
In the middle of these different feelings , I heard a voice for an American soldier woman who was speaking in an Arabic language .
She said to me : “ I did n’t imagine that the weapons ’ traders in Iraq are women . ”
When I started to explain to her the circumstances of the situation , she beat me cruelly .
I cried and shouted “ By Allah !
I am oppressed , By Allah !
I am oppressed ”
The soldier showered me with insults in a way that I have never thought possible or that I would ever be subjected to under any circumstances .
Then , she started to deride me saying that she was monitoring me all the day via the satellite , and that they can track their enemies even inside their own bedrooms by American technology .
Then she laughed and said : “ I was watching you when you were making love with your husband . ”
I replied in a confused voice “ But I am not married ” .
She beat me for more than one an hour and she forced me to drink a glass of water , and I knew later that they put a drug in it .
I regained my consciousness after two days to find myself naked .
I knew immediately that I have lost something that all the laws in the earth will not be able to return it to me once again .
I had been raped .
A hysterical fit attacked me and I started to hit my head violently against the walls till more than five American soldiers head by that soldier women entered the cell and started to beat me , and they raped me alternately while they laughing and listening to a loud music .
Day by day the scenario of raping me was repeated .
And every day they invent new ways that are crueler than the prior ways .
After about one month , a Negro soldier entered my cell and threw me two pieces of American military clothes .
He said in weak Arabic language to wear them .
After he put a black bag on my head , he led me to a public toilet where there are pipes for cold and hot water and he asked me to bathe .
He then closed the door and left .
I was so exhausted and feeling pain , and despite the tremendous number of the bruises in my body , I poured out some water on my body .
Before I finish my bath , the Negro soldier came in .
I frightened , and I hit him in the face with the water bowl .
His reaction was so tough .
He raped me cruelly and spit on my face , then he left and returned with two soldiers who returned me to the cell .
The treatment continued that way , to the extent that sometimes I was raped ten times in a day , the matter which affected my health negatively .
After more than 4 months , a woman soldier woman came , and I concluded from her conversation with other soldiers that her name is Mary .
She said to me “ now you have a golden opportunity , since an officer who has a high position will visit us today , if you deal with him positively , you would be released , especially because we are sure you are innocent .
I replied , “ If you are sure of I am innocent , why you do n’t release me ? ”
She screamed in nervousness , “ The only way that guarantees your releasing is to be positive with them . ”
She took me to the public toilets , and she supervised my bath while she was holding a thick stick , hitting me by it if I did n’t perform her orders .
Then , she gave me makeup , and warned me not to cry and ruin my makeup .
Then she took me to an empty small room where there was nothing but a cover on the floor , and after one an hour she came accompanied with four soldiers who was holding cameras .
She took off her clothes and she harassed me as if she was a man .
The soldiers were laughing and listening to a noisy music , and taking photographs to me in all poses , and they were emphasizing on my face .
The woman asked me to smile otherwise she is going to kill me , and she took a gun from one of her colleagues and fired four bullets near my head , and swore that the fifth bullet will be fired in my head .
After that , the four soldiers raped me alternately the matter which made me lose my consciousness .
When I regained the consciousness I found myself in the cell and the traces of their teeth , nails and cigarettes are in everywhere in my body . ”
After one day Mary came and told me that I was cooperative , and I will be released but after I watch the film that they have shot .
I was in pain when I saw the film , and she ( Mary ) said : “ you have been created for the sole purpose for us to enjoy ” .
At the moment I became very anger and I attacked her although I was afraid of her reaction , and I would kill her except for the interfering of the soldiers .
When the soldiers released me she showered me with hitting , then they left me .
After this incident , nobody harassed me for more then one month ; I spent that period in the praying and invocation to Allah , the All - Mighty who has all power , to help me .
Mary came with some soldiers who gave me the clothes that I was wearing when they arrested me and took me to an American car .
Then they threw me on the highway road after giving me 10,000 Iraqi Dinars .
I went to a home that was near the place where I have been thrown out and since I know the reaction of my family , I preferred to visit one of my relatives to let them know what happened after my absence .
I knew that my brother had held a consolation board for me for more than 4 months , and they considered me as a dead person .
I understand the knife of shame is waiting for me .
So , I went to Baghdad where I found a good family who lodged me , and I worked with this family as a maid and governess for their children .
Who will quench my thirst ?
Who will return my virginity ?
What is the offense of my family and kin ?
I have inside me a baby , and I do n’t know who his father is . ”
- End .
Different versions of Nadias , different versions of similar stories .
I have seen them , met them , looked at them , looked into their eyes ...
They pretend nothing happened , hiding behind a silence , but I can still detect the fear roaming in the corner of their eyes ...
Occasionally , one would slip bits of a story in between other stories ... pretending hers is not as bad .
Comforting herself in others miseries ...
But anyone with a modicum of perception , of sensitivity , of heart , can tell that something has been irretrievably broken .
Beyond , behind , the experience , is loss of Faith in human kind , in humanity .
Let me stop for a while and smoke another cigarette ... and gather my feelings , my emotions , scattered around -- like white pearls from a forced , broken , torn Necklace .
Like tear drops from a rainy Sky .
Like little red balls from a braised Fire ...

With the end of the Cold War , many analysts and policy makers imagined that the developed world might actually move away from its irrational attachment to militarization and war .
The most optimistic envisioned a huge , international peace dividend , shifting untold billions previously spent on conventional and nuclear weapons to tackling poverty and inequality around the world .

Alas , the U.S. had no intention of dismantling NATO .
For the U.S. , it was simple : NATO provided the sheen of legitimacy for the extension of U.S. power well beyond its original mandate of Europe .
But ironically the Bush administration -- the most imperial of U.S. governments in generations -- may well go down in history as the one that crippled NATO and effectively left the U.S. isolated .
If there is a silver lining to the grotesque destruction of human life in Iraq and Afghanistan and the inexplicably stupid adventure in Georgia , it is the possibility that the U.S. will lose its already reluctant EU partners in making the world safe for U.S. oil companies .
NATO risks , if not outright dissolution , then certainly a credibility crisis leading to political and military paralysis .
NATO watchers repeatedly declare that losing in Afghanistan simply " is n't an option . "
But as virtually every analyst not on mind - altering drugs is saying , losing in Afghanistan with the current commitment of NATO partners is , in fact , the only option .
The longer they stay , the more inept and indecisive they appear .
To even maintain the status quo there needs to be a doubling of the troop levels , and this simply will not happen .
European populations have no stomach for body bags from a war that is not in Europe 's interests .
France is now rethinking its existing commitment , despite its president 's statement to the contrary .
When , not if , the EU members of NATO pack their bags , it will be the end of any extra-territorial adventures .
The U.S. will be totally on its own , save for Israel and , regrettably , Canada .
Boosting Putin 's popularity
The situation in Georgia presents even greater problems for NATO as it exposes a widening gulf between the dominant EU powers -- Germany , France and Britain -- and the U.S. While the U.S. and its client state Georgia have so far won the media war in framing the conflict , this does nothing to change the facts on the ground .
The U.S. seems completely oblivious to a reality that everyone else recognizes : Russia is now the hegemon in the region and is back on the world stage with a vengeance .
Bush 's huffing and puffing and issuing of repeated empty ultimatums makes the " sole remaining superpower " look weak and confused .
The Russian leadership , both Putin and Medvedev , show sneering contempt for the U.S. for one reason : they can .
There is virtually nothing the U.S. can do .
To be sure , Putin is ruthless and authoritarian .
But he is also enormously popular , about four times as popular as George Bush is in the U.S.
Why ?
Because the U.S. and the West in their efforts to turn the former Soviet Union into a free - market wild west , humiliated Russia and created the conditions for a resurgent nationalism that Putin plays like a fiddle .
Russians do n't care that much if he runs roughshod over democracy if he re-establishes their pride in Russia a great power .
Winning the media spin might just be the worst outcome for the West as it will undoubtedly fan the flames of national grievance in Russia even more .
The facts are clear enough .
Georgian President Saakashvili unleashed a brutal , 12 - hour assault with hundreds of rockets and artillery shells on the largely defenceless South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali , destroying apartment blocks , hospitals and other civilian infrastructure .
It was utterly unnecessary destruction for the operation 's stated purpose of occupying the territory .
Despite U.S. denials , it is inconceivable that the Bush administration did not know and approve of the invasion plans .
The U.S. and Israel have hundreds of military advisors embedded at virtually every level of the Georgian army .
Georgia and the encirclement of Russia
Georgia was simply playing its assigned role as an outpost of U.S. neo-con ambitions to encircle Russia with free - market client states and isolate it .
The media portrays Saakashvili as a democrat .
There is no reference to his increasingly authoritarian rule -- the brutal put - down of peaceful demonstrations last November , the widely reported abuse of state resources , controls on the media , the arrest of opposition activists , and the suppression of civil liberties .
Some democrat .
There is also no reference to the fact that Saakashvili came to power in 2003 largely thanks to millions of dollars from the American Soros foundations poured into organizations that attacked former president Eduard Shevardnadze and promoted the pro-American Mr. Saakashvili for president .
For years , the U.S. could afford to dismiss Russian declarations that such encirclement was a threat to its national interests and would be resisted .
Russia was weak .
But the U.S. occupation of Iraq , instead of unleashing its huge oil supplies , and being a bonanza for American oil companies , has severely weakened the U.S. and contributed to the huge increase in oil prices -- giving back to the Russian state the financial power it had lost .
The Bush administration , still addled by ideology , apparently did n't notice and continued to dismiss Russia as if it were still a bankrupt state .
The Georgian attack was either a wag - the - dog strategy to help the Republicans win the White House , or one of the most spectacularly incompetent applications of foreign policy in U.S. history .
In either case , the U.S. miscalculated not only Russia 's response , but more importantly , the entire geo-political balance of power in the region .
Someone , such as the usually astute Israelis , should have told the U.S. that in this confrontation , Russia holds virtually all the cards .
Why the US needs Russia
The U.S. needs Russia much more than Russia needs the U.S. Russia actually supports America 's determination to defeat the Taliban and allows non-lethal military supplies to travel through its territory .
It continues to play a critical partnership role with the U.S. in persuading both Korea and Iran to abandon any plans for nuclear weapons .
It co-operates with U.S. counter - terrorism and counter - narcotics efforts .
And it has a veto in the UN -- an institution the U.S. has suddenly found very useful and which Russia can neutralize with the raising of a hand .
Russia has a huge arms export capacity and currently sells to Iran , Venezuela , and Syria .
So far , it has not sold its most sophisticated weapons systems , like its S - 300 anti-aircraft missile system .
But that could change , as a worried Israel knows full well .
In fact , Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad met with President Medvedev in Russia on Aug. 20 , less than two weeks after the Georgian assault , to talk increased co-operation .
It was no coincidence .
Al - Assad knows all about geo-political power imbalances and how they can be manipulated .
As Russia criticized Israel for providing a wide variety of arms to Georgia , al - Assad attacked Georgia as the aggressor and declared publicly : " Our position is that we are ready to co-operate with Russia in any project that can strengthen its security . "
But the biggest casualty of this historic U.S. blunder has already taken place .
U.S. plans to expand Georgia 's current role as a transit point for Caspian basin oil and gas pipelines to Europe is already in tatters .
Private companies hate uncertainty , and it will be a long time , if ever , before they consider building another pipeline through a country with such unreliable leadership -- one possibly headed back into Russia 's sphere of influence .
This was the principal reason the U.S. poured so much military assistance into Saakashvili : European dependence on Russian oil and gas ( now standing at 40 per cent of EU consumption ) gave Moscow too much power .
Resurgent Russia
The disastrous military adventure OK'd by the U.S. gave Putin the excuse he needed to declare the return of Russia as a regional power and nip American energy plans in the bud , with huge consequences .
Now more than ever , the EU countries will be loathe to anger Russia .
America 's recent signing of the missile defence agreement with Poland has further angered Putin , and it is European countries that could suffer the consequences .
European members of NATO recently moderated the aggressive American push for membership for the Ukraine and Georgia by saying it would come " eventually . "
But that now looks to be a very long way off .
Would the European members of NATO really want to engage in a war with Russia over another incursion into tiny Georgia ?
They would be obliged to do so if Georgia was a member .
U.S. foreign policy disasters in Iraq , Afghanistan and now Georgia threaten to drive NATO -- corporate globalization 's most legitimate policeman -- back into its old barracks and with its old , narrow mandate .
So just as the U.S. is being forced to recognize that its superpower status can be regionally challenged , it could be virtually alone in trying to police the planet .
Ideology makes you stupid
The rigid adherence to ideology -- any ideology -- ultimately makes its adherents stupid .
The neo-cons behind the Project for the New American Century -- Dick Cheney and company 's blueprint for American global dominance -- so fervently believed in their project that they dismissively rejected the conventional approach to foreign policy .
The PNAC , by simply believing the U.S. had the right to police the world , assumed that it could .
The resulting doctrine of " full - spectrum [ military ] dominance " over the entire planet was effectively immune to any real - world evidence to the contrary .
In part because the PNAC brain trust and their president had contempt for the role of government , they simply bypassed the judgment of conventional state institutions and replaced reason with faith .
One Bush aide ridiculed what he called the " reality - based community " which consisted of people who naively " ... believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . "
He told American writer Ronald Suskind : " We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality . "
Indeed they do .
But it is looking less and less like the one their faith led them to imagine .

Yo , commoner !
Get ready to get stuck again , this time cleaning up the toxic housing - related bad debt that ’s taking down the banks .
S&L depositors in 1985 : Crooks in high places told us it would only cost a mere $ 50 billion to bail - out the savings and loan mess .
All told , it was closer to $ 1.4 trillion .
Alan Greenspan , Paul Volcker , Barney Frank and others want to create something along the lines of the Resolution Trust Corp. , a public boondoggle created during the fabled savings and loan “ crisis ” in the late 1980s .
“ Stocks would view the creation of some RTC - type solution positively because it would be viewed as something closer to a fundamental solution to the underlying problem that is afflicting financial markets now , ” said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities American in New York , reports News for Yahoos .
Ah , yes , a “ fundamental solution , ” that is to say fleecing the commoners all the more .
Last time around , crooks in high places told us it would only cost a mere $ 50 billion to bail - out the savings and loan mess .
All told , it was closer to $ 1.4 trillion .
The S&L thing was all about “ deregulation ” — that is , allowing criminals and loan sharks to run things without oversight , sort of like allowing wolves to run a chicken coop — “ imprudent ” real estate lending , allowing insolvent savings and loan institutions to remain open for business , shady brokered deposits , risky lending , out - of - your - mind lending , the whole rotten ball of wax .
It was a great deal for the criminals , though , for instance the Bush crime family .
Jeb Bush , George Bush Sr. , and his son Neil Bush have all been implicated in the Savings and Loan scandal .
Jeb Bush defaulted on a $ 4.56 million loan from Broward Federal Savings in Sunrise , Florida .
Neil Bush , as director of Silverado Savings and Loan , allowed that institution to go belly up at a cost of $ 1.6 billion to taxpayers .
Neil allowed all kinds of bad loans to shady characters .
One “ investor ” ( criminal ) , Bill Walters , defaulted on a $ 106 million dollar loan Neil dished out , apparently like breath mints – and why not , he probably knew you ’d be on the hook for the balance .
Try defaulting on your mortgage like Jeb did and see what happens .
Jeb was eventually rewarded by the idiotic voters of Florida and elected governor .
Go figure .
Now the bankers and Congress are itching to resurrect the Resolution Trust Corp .
Tony Crescenzi of the Boston Globe explains how this scam will work :
Basically the U.S. will end up buying the toxic assets from the banking system in a more comprehensive way then we ’ve ALREADY been doing .
Staring down the worst financial crisis in decades , U.S. lawmakers are strongly considering whether they need to dust off a 1980s - era plan to help save the banking industry and stabilize the economy more broadly .
Both Democrats and Republicans have shown interest over the past two days in the idea of creating a government corporation to help deal with the toxic assets that have already brought down financial behemoths Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Bros. , and forced the government to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In other words , in order to “ stabilize the economy ” deliberately wrecked by the banksters , “ lawmakers ” — that is , high paid whores for bankers and transnational corporations — will agree to crank up the already staggering national debt with this scheme .
Recall Chris
Dodd saying there would be no more government bailouts for other banks or institutions after $ 80 billion AIG bailout .
Man , that Chris is a funny guy… he also takes you for an idiot .
But of course , there will be bailouts and sweetheart deals for the bankers into the indeterminable future .
Because the average American can hardly count on his fingers and toes , let alone understand Basic Economics 101 .
He does not know a predatory financial Mafia is running the country and his “ representative ” is on the hook to the international bankers .
He ’s clueless , and that ’s why he keeps voting for Tweedledee Democrat or Tweedledum Republican .
It ’s really too bad , though .
Thomas Jefferson was spot on when he wrote : “ I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance .
The issuing power ( of money ) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs . ”
He also said that if we allow the bankers to run roughshod over the republic — er , excuse me , former republic — our “ children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”
As for the latter , it is already coming true .
“ From Seattle to Athens , Ga. , homeless advocacy groups and city agencies are reporting the most visible rise in homeless encampments in a generation , ” reports MSNBC .
“ Nearly 61 percent of local and state homeless coalitions say they ’ve experienced a rise in homelessness since the foreclosure crisis began in 2007 , according to a report by the National Coalition for the Homeless .
The group says the problem has worsened since the report ’s release in April , with foreclosures mounting , gas and food prices rising and the job market tightening . ”
It ’s past time to storm the castle , that is to say the whorehouse in the district of criminals .
Unfortunately , far too many Americans are clueless about what is happening to them and even if they had an inkling they ’d be hard pressed to find the district on a map .

There are so many aspects of the proposed bailout that should send shivers down any thinking individual 's spine that I hope each and every C&Ler take a few minutes to contact their representatives tomorrow to express their distrust of the bailout as written .
From the ironically - labeled Section 8 :
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
to the announcement by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ( oh hell , let 's just call him President Paulson now , because he 's effectively running the country ) that the bailout would include foreign companies as well :
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The original legislation we saw said that you would be buying up the mortgage - related assets from financial institutions having headquarters in the United States .
Yet last night , the fact sheet put out by the Treasury seemed to expand that .
It said only that the financial institutions have to have significant operations in the U.S. , and that you could waive that at your discretion .
So , will foreign financial institutions be eligible to have their assets bought ?
PAULSON : Yes , and they should , because as you think about this , if a financial institution has business operations in the United States , hires people in the United States , if they are clogged with illiquid assets , they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution .
That 's a distinction without a difference to the American people .
The key here is about protecting the system .[..]
But , remember , this is about protecting the American people and protecting the taxpayers .
And the American people do n't care who owns the financial institution .
If a financial institution in this country has problems , it 'll have the same impact ...
What a giant , steaming load of bovine excrement .
The LAST thing on Paulson 's mind is protecting the taxpayers ... we are financing his buddies ' golden parachutes , with no oversight , no changes and no guarantees that we wo n't be IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE in a couple of months .
Because if Paulson gave two bits about the American people , he would be in favor of the Democratic plan to give some relief to homeowners instead of making sure that he can hand cash over to foreign companies .
Note the complete sidestep ( shame on you , Stephanopoulos , for letting him get away with it ) of what the taxpayers get back in return .
Even conservative blogs are finding this bailout to be ridiculous :
We 're setting precedents that will govern the behavior of the international business community for decades to come .
Do we really want to signal that risks are public and rewards are private ?
For that matter , do we really want such fundamental decisions being made by obscure , unaccountable men like Bernanke , Paulson , and SEC chair Chris Cox ?
Should n't Congress and the president be more than bit players ?
Speaking of those who have forgotten history , dooming us all to repeat it , C&Ler Diane emailed me a link to this BBC - Radio4 documentary , Document , that has quite a few parallels to today 's financial climate .
Granted , those of us who work in drug policy reform knew this already .
Nonetheless , it ’s doubly satisfying when a former longtime White House employee states the obvious .
The Failure of the Office of National Drug Control Policy
via Huffington Post
As an insider in the nation ’s war against drugs , I spent almost fifteen years in the executive office of the President .
Eleven of these years were in the Office of National Drug Control Policy where I served four of the nation ’s so - called drug czars preparing the federal drug control budget , writing many of the national drug control strategies , and conducting performance measurement and analysis of the efficacy of those strategies .
I left government in 2000 , but continue to be highly involved in shaping drug policies and measuring performance in drug policy both nationally and internationally .
In the latest 2008 National Drug Control Strategy , the Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) — the federal executive office agency charged with shaping this nation ’s national drug control strategy — claims that America has reached a turning point in the war on drugs .
In reality , we have little reason to believe a significant change has occurred .
… Though Congress created ONDCP to formulate research - driven and performance - based policy , assess and modify policy through performance measures , and give a precise accounting of the federal drug control budget , ONDCP fails at all of those tasks .
In the 90’s ONDCP created a performance measurement system for evaluating the effects of its policies on drug use , drug availability , and the negative consequences of drug use ; however , this decade , no such performance measurement system has been utilized .
As a consequence , policy is now flying blind resulting in lost opportunities for more success .
Naturally , the author ultimately fails to suggest any significant changes in US drug policy — such as legalizing cannabis for adults , or disbanding the DEA or the Drug Czar ’s office — but , hey , it ’s a start .

It seems that most people are finally awakening to the fact that it is not a good idea to blindly accept the manipulating lies with which we are daily brainwashed , particularly by the communications media .
It is totally acceptable and sensible nowadays to be cynical and critical of any source of information , particularly when associated with politics , big business and the media .
The ' information ' age has literally turned upon itself .
George Orwell in his prophetic book ' 1984 ' said , " Political language ... is designed to make lies sound truthful ... and give an appearance of solidarity to pure wind .
" Hitler 's propaganda henchman Dr. Goebells said , " If you tell people a big enough lie , often enough , they will believe it .
" There are many definitions of lies and the Thesaurus has a great source of words to describe the distorting and twisting of any facts .
Among the word variations that cover the outrageous manipulations we experience daily are fabrication , inference misstatement , falsification , evasion , deceit and deception .
A lie is the deliberate withholding of any part of the truth from someone who has a right to know .
People are becoming accustomed to receiving deceit and deception .
We are being constantly lied to by governments , government officials , drug companies , the medical profession , multinational industry , food companies and politicians .
Lied to by media , by ' reality ' programs , doctored photographs in magazines , by employers and by unions .
Lied to in financial transactions , stockholders reports and false corporate statements .
Lied to by advertising , salesmen and anyone trying to make money to our disadvantage .
Falsification has been piled onto fabrication , until lying -- through omission , distortion , bias or clever wording -- has become a way of life !
The list is truly endless .
Life has become like a jigsaw puzzle , but without the picture on the front of the box so that you do n't know what it 's really supposed to be like .
Governments , multinationals and media are clever enough to make sure you do n't always have all the pieces !
Try to look at the motives behind everything you hear and see , there is always a motive .
What are they ' selling ' ?
Keep an open mind and treat all information with a reasonable amount of suspicion .
Look for seemingly reliable sources , as I do .
We need to be constantly be alert and aware !
Even question me .
We all know there is plenty of truth in our universe ; it 's just a bit hard to find .
Try a little old fashioned commonsense .
Excerpt from Michael 's book ' Solutions With Pearls of Wisdom ' utilizing thirty years of Naturopathic experience .

Michael has diplomas in many alternative subjects and has published 13 books on various topics plus a popular Australian monthly newsletter .
In a dramatic illustration of the potential for microbes to prevent disease , researchers at Yale University and the University of Chicago showed that mice exposed to common stomach bacteria were protected against the development of Type I diabetes .
The findings , reported in the journal Nature , support the so - called " hygiene hypothesis " - the theory that a lack of exposure to parasites , bacteria and viruses in the developed world may lead to increased risk of diseases like allergies , asthma , and other disorders of the immune system .
The results also suggest that exposure to some forms of bacteria might actually help prevent onset of Type I diabetes , an autoimmune disease in which the patient 's immune system launches an attack on cells in the pancreas that produce insulin .
The root causes of autoimmune disease have been the subject of intensive investigation by scientists around the world .
In the past decade , it has become evident that the environment plays a role in the development of some overly robust immune system responses .
For instance , people in less - developed parts of the world have a low rate of allergy , but when they move to developed countries the rate increases dramatically .
Scientists have also noted the same phenomenon in their labs .
Non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mice develop the disease at different rates after natural breeding , depending upon the environment where they are kept .
Previous research has shown that NOD mice exposed to killed ( i.e. , non-active ) strains of tuberculosis or other disease - causing bacteria are protected against the development of Type I diabetes .
This suggests that the rapid " innate " immune response that normally protects us from infections can influence the onset of Type 1 diabetes .
In the Nature paper , teams led by Li Wen at Yale and Alexander V. Chervonsky at the University of Chicago showed that NOD mice deficient in innate immunity were protected from diabetes in normal conditions .
However , if they were raised in a germ - free environment , lacking " friendly ' ' gut bacteria , the mice developed severe diabetes .
NOD mice exposed to harmless bacteria normally found in the human intestine were significantly less likely to develop diabetes , they reported .
" Understanding how gut bacteria work on the immune system to influence whether diabetes and other autoimmune diseases occurs is very important , " Li said .
" This understanding may allow us to design ways to target the immune system through altering the balance of friendly gut bacteria and protect against diabetes . "

This is awesome or awful PR work .
I ’m not sure which .
A collection of things McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told the Washington Post about the “ How Many Houses ? ” scandal that is brewing :
On Obama ’s house :
“ It ’s a frickin ’ mansion . ”
On the McCains ’ definitely - not - elitist housing habits :
“ The reality is they have some investment properties and stuff .
It ’s not as if he lives in ten houses .
That ’s just not the case .
The reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use . ”
On how the McCain campaign apparently sees Obama :
“ In terms of who ’s an elitist , I think people have made a judgment that John McCain is not an arugula - eating , pointy headed professor - type . ”
On something completely irrelevant :
“ This is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years — in prison . ”
A couple observations : ( 1 ) Is n’t it weird how the McCain campaign simultaneously paints Obama as an effete nerd and a super - cool celebrity ?
( 2 ) Noun-verb - POW !
How stupid ...
This is probably the most stupid person ever caught on tape

So you ’ve got MySQL on your web server , but it ’s only opened to local ports by default for security reasons .
If you want to access your database from a client tool like the MySQL Query Browser , normally you ’d have to open up access from your local IP address … but that ’s not nearly as secure .
So instead , we ’ll just use port - forwarding through an SSH tunnel , so your MySQL client thinks it ’s connecting to your localhost machine , but it ’s really connecting to the other server through the tunnel .
If you are using the command line ssh , the command would look like this .
( You can do the same thing graphically in Putty or SecureCRT options if you need to )
ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 geek@webserver.com
The syntax is ssh - L < localport > hostname < remoteport > < username > @< servername > .
We ’re using localhost as the hostname because we are directly accessing the remote mysql server through ssh .
You could also use this technique to port - forward through one ssh server to another server .
If you already have mysql running on your local machine then you can use a different local port for the port - forwarding , and just set your client tools to access MySQL on a different port .
Once you ’ve got the ssh tunnel going , you can open up MySQL Query Browser and enter in the details for your remote server , using localhost as the server host , and adjust the port to whatever you used .
Once you get used to this method , you ’ll wonder why you ever used phpmyadmin or the command line version .

West is ground zero for wildfires
GOLETA , CA - JULY 06 : U.S. Forest Service
Hot Shots set a backfire near a house to try to contain the Gap fire , officially the top priority fire in the state , on July 6 , 2008 near Goleta , California .
The 6,860 - acre Gap fire is spreading across the chaparral - covered Santa Ynez Mountains of the Los Padres National Forest , drawing closer to many houses that were rebuilt after the1990 Painted Cave fire destroyed 400 homes .
An estimated 4,000 people have evacuated from about 1,700 homes in the path of the fire .
President Bush has declared a state of emergency for all of California in response to more than 1,400 fires that were mostly started by dry lightning storms crossing the state on June 20 .
More than 300 continue to burn .
Making matters worse for the more than 19,000 firefighters from 42 states battling the California wildfires , drought is wicking moisture from the vegetation which leads fire experts to fear a possible repeat of the firestorms of 2003 and 2007 that destroyed thousands of homes in southern California .

West is ground zero for wildfires 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
California has been hit by 2,000 fires this year , and climate scientists are predicting that the situation will worsen as temperatures rise .
The American West has been warming dramatically during the past 60 years at a rate surpassed only by Alaska .
This year has been particularly dry for California , with less snowfall , earlier snowmelt and lower summer river flows .
Some of the state 's top scientists say the changing water picture is caused by humans producing greenhouse gases , and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts more intense and longer droughts with warmer spring and summer temperatures in the West .
That , scientists say , leads to increases in the length of the fire seasons , number of fires , time needed to put out the fire and size of the burned area .
" The snow melts sooner , the dry season gets longer and rivers crest earlier .
That gives more of a chance for drying out and therefore a likelihood of more fires , " said Tim Barnett , a climatologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego who led research on the effects of greenhouse gases on the changing hydrology in the western United States .
" If you look at where we will be in 20 or 30 years , we 'll have serious problems , " he said .
Scientists are quick to caution against blaming one fire or heat wave on global warming .
But , Barnett said , " At the minimum , you 're getting a glimpse of your future .
Do you like it ?
I think not . "
Complex causes
Research by teams of scientists at Scripps , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , the U.S. Geological Survey and other institutions have probed associations between land - use patterns and climate change because of increases in fires during the past 25 years .
The picture is complex , particularly in Northern California , they say .
With warmer and earlier springs , moisture has been uneven , and winter precipitation in some parts tends to come as rain , not snow .
At the same time , logging and mining have changed the character of forests , and the practice of preventing low - burning fires in past decades may have made the forests more susceptible to wildfires , experts say .
But taking all of the factors into consideration , including weather patterns shown in tree rings over past centuries , they conclude that the intensity of fires is linked most closely to the rising temperatures , less snowpack , earlier snowmelt and a longer , drier fire season .
The peak time of melting snow is already about 10 to 15 days earlier in different parts of the West .
Scientists have projected a speed - up of 25 to 35 days earlier by the end of this century .
A study just released by Purdue University found that at the end of the century , the snowmelt could come 70 days earlier .
The effect of the lost snow , and increased heat from solar radiation absorbed in the exposed ground and vegetation , would raise temperatures more than have previously been expected .
Temperatures rising
In the western United States , temperatures for the past five years have risen an average 1.7 degrees when compared with the 20th century .
California 's average temperatures between 2003 and 2007 rose 1.1 degrees above the past century's .
That is slightly more than the 1 degree rise for the planet as a whole .
The Colorado River Basin , Arizona , Montana , Utah and Wyoming have had temperatures rise more than 2 degrees in the past five years compared with the past century .
Turning up the heat
The West has had more frequent and severe heat waves , with the number of extremely hot days increasing by up to four days per decade since 1950 , according to research supported by the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization , a coalition of 17 local governments , businesses , nonprofits and Colorado 's largest water provider .
The West has warmed more than east of the Rocky Mountains .
Drought is now more common in the West , while east of the Rockies it is noticeably wetter in general , said Kevin Trenberth , head of the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , operated by a nonprofit consortium of research universities .
Trenberth attributes the difference between West and East to basic climate conditions , but also to the nature of changes in atmospheric circulation .
" All of this indeed promotes wildfire risk , and the ' dry lightning ' is disastrous , especially in areas where trees are damaged such as by bark beetle , " said Trenberth , a lead author of the center 's 2007 scientific assessment of climate change .
This year followed the trend .
" We had very dry conditions in April , May and a bit of June , " said Scott Stephens , associate professor of fire science in UC Berkeley 's department of environmental science , policy and management .
" This year , we had almost zero rain .
When the dry lighting strikes came through , we had 1,000 fires in one weekend , June 20 , one of the highest we 've ever experienced , " something not seen in at least 50 years , he said .
So far , more than 900,000 acres have burned , destroying about 100 houses and threatening thousands more .
People were evacuated in Big Sur , the Sierra foothills and Butte County , communities around Santa Cruz and other spots in Northern California .
" We 're going to have more surprises like this , " Stephens said .
Duration of burns increases
Since 1980 , U.S. wildfires have burned an average of 8,500 square miles per year , a jump from the 1920 - 1980 average of 5,000 square miles per year .
In the past three decades , the wildfire season in the western United States has increased by 78 days , according to work led by Anthony Westerling , formerly at Scripps , now at UC Merced .
Roughly half that increase was due to earlier ignitions , and half to later control .
Burn duration of fires greater than 1,000 acres has increased from 7.5 to 37.1 days in response to a spring - summer warming .
People on the fire lines see that the wildfire intensity and size have changed and question whether global warming is to blame , Stephens said .
" They know that the temperatures are increasing , and the snow is leaving earlier .
One thing is certain : Weather and fire are tied together .
They know that better than anybody . "
The U.S. Forest Service has a study in progress that examines the severity of forest fires in the Sierra Nevada .
Hugh Safford , regional ecologist , and analyst Jay Miller led a team investigating about 200 fires that occurred between 1984 and 2007 in the Sierra Nevada .
The researchers found that fires had increased in severity beginning in the 1980s and continued until today .
By analyzing state and federal data , they also showed that fire frequency , total burned area and average fire size have also increased during the same period .
Rising temperatures play a part , they said .
But at the same time , they found that increases in forest density because of 70 years of fire suppression are also to blame .
The study concluded that " in light of recent alarming projections for increased temperatures and fire - season length by the end of the century , " it is time to rethink the current policy of suppressing fires and , under the proper circumstances , let more fires burn to reduce problem fuels .
“ If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest
of men , I will find something in them which will hang him . ”
– Cardinal Richelieu
This morning Congressman Ron Paul is at his wife ’s side at a Houston hospital .
We hope all will go well and she will be released soon to help take up the “ campaign for liberty . ”
As she recovers , it may be a good time to reflect on Ron Paul ’s most important issue , the right of privacy and the right of citizens to live without an obtrusive , omnipresent , ever watching and listening government .
Conservative Republicans used to be the guardians of this principle .
Now they lead the attack .
In recent years liberal Democrats have argued for this kind of privacy but not anymore .
And the media was always vigilant about it but not now .
Now we all tell each other , Republican and Democrat alike , that , “ If you do n’t have anything to hide , why should you be afraid ? ”
Let the government read your e-mails and listen to your phone calls .
If they can catch a terrorist what is that compared to losing a little of your privacy ? ”
The problem is that the prisons are full of men and women who have been railroaded .
This has been demonstrated in a shocking way by modern DNA , which has identified many innocent men serving prison time for murder and rape .
But there is no equivalent bookkeeping DNA to clear the innocent white collar convicts , whose prosecutors are just as certain that they have their man or woman .
Surely , some of those are also innocent .
When a Secret Service agent saw Michael Reagan , the president ’s son , return an item in a store , he misunderstood and thought he was shoplifting .
Gossip of the young Reagan ’s kleptomania spread through the Service and in time reached the President ’s ears .
For more than two years the President believed his own Secret Service and not his son , until the facts finally cleared him .
If the President ’s son can be misunderstood , so can you and me .
One word spoken in jest over the telephone or out of context in a series of e-mails can trigger the audit that makes you the focus of attention .
And once you are the focus , everything else they see and hear may only affirm their suspicion .
Sometimes this is the work of corrupt officials who , once begun , do n’t want their investment in time and money wasted .
It could jeopardize their career .
That ’s why they focused so long and hard at the wrong man in the Atlanta Olympic bombing and later the Anthrax mailings .
But other times it is only the process , nothing personal .
You were at the wrong place at the wrong time .
Of course , all of us would allow for court ordered surveillance of know terrorists .
And all of us want suspected terrorists blocked from entering the country .
But when the net is cast wide , as in hundreds of thousands of phone calls and e-mails , well , we might as well be in China .
Stories came to me by the box full during my time in the White House .
A grandmother in Alaska who lost her fishing boat to the government because they found a joint of marijuana on it .
And the government official – who participated in the raid – later buying the boat at government auction .
Neat huh ?
Of course , this has gone on all over the world for generations .
It is why Jesus advises to settle a dispute quickly , lest you find yourself in prison .
He makes no comment on your guilt or innocence .
It is only good , general advice about process .
This is why the Constitution and Bill of Rights were written .
The founding fathers were not protecting criminals .
They were protecting us , from an intrusive , sometimes clumsy , sometimes evil government .
We are now forfeiting those hard earned , well reasoned , personal liberties out of panic .
What is particularly interesting is how this ongoing American process is being watched with alarm from other countries .
In Europe , for example , the left and the right and the noble and the commoner have routinely been arrested and imprisoned for political or personal reasons .
Journalists , on the take , would write defaming articles to generate the appropriate outrage and then some ideologue or corrupt judge would give the ruling .
Sometimes you could lose your liberty because you argued with the wrong person over a parking place .
“ Do n’t you know who I am ? ” But in France , even heads of television networks and newspaper chains and big businesses were run in and out of prison when the left - right political battles got fierce .
America ’s justice and journalistic community are almost pure by comparison .
Occasionally you will see a conglomerate order one of its magazines to do a cover story on a motion picture produced by one of its subsidiaries .
But usually , the media is not for sale .
And you do n’t see people thrown in jail over political or personal views .
So it is a bit touching and astonishing , to see Canada , the UK , France , Germany , Italy and other countries fighting for the rights of their citizens caught in the American snare .
They are amazed at this ongoing process in our country .
They , who have suffered outrageous injustices for centuries , or seen it manipulated by the nobility , are now shocked by our own self inspired , dismantling of our own system of justice .
Ron Paul has written “ history demonstrates that the powers we give the federal government today will remain in place indefinitely .
How sure are we that future presidents wo n’t abuse those powers ? ”
Remember Cardinal Richelieu ?
He was the grey imminence in The Three Musketeers .
Only he really existed .
He ruled with power in the 17th century at the First Minister to Louis XIII .
His famous quote is a colorful variation of the modern cliche that “ if the government wants you , it will get you . ”
Guilt or innocence are not even factors .
“ If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men I will find something in them which will hang him . ”
“ Well , ” you say , “ But I ’m innocent . ”
Yeah , so was Jesus , the apostle Paul , John Bunyan , Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandella .
Good luck .
We will send postcards .
NEW HAVEN , Conn . --
Nine - year - old Jericho
Scott is a good baseball player -- too good , it turns out .
The right - hander has a fastball that tops out at about 40 mph .
He throws so hard that the Youth Baseball League of New Haven told his coach that the boy could not pitch any more .
When Jericho took the mound anyway last week , the opposing team forfeited the game , packed its gear and left , his coach said .
Officials for the three - year - old league , which has eight teams and about 100 players , said they will disband Jericho 's team , redistributing its players among other squads , and offered to refund $ 50 sign - up fees to anyone who asks for it .
They say Jericho 's coach , Wilfred Vidro , has resigned .
But Vidro says he did n't quit and the team refuses to disband .
Players and parents held a protest at the league 's field on Saturday urging the league to let Jericho pitch .
" He 's never hurt any one , " Vidro said .
" He 's on target all the time .
How can you punish a kid for being too good ? "
The controversy bothers Jericho , who says he misses pitching .
" I feel sad , " he said .
" I feel like it 's all my fault nobody could play . "
Officials with the Youth Baseball League of New Haven say they will disband Jericho Scott 's team because his coach wo n't stop him from pitching .

Jericho's coach and parents say the boy is being unfairly targeted because he turned down an invitation to join the defending league champion , which is sponsored by an employer of one of the league 's administrators .
Jericho instead joined a team sponsored by Will Power Fitness .
The team was 8 - 0 and on its way to the playoffs when Jericho was banned from pitching .
" I think it 's discouraging when you 're telling a 9 - year - old you 're too good at something , " said his mother , Nicole Scott .
" The whole objective in life is to find something you 're good at and stick with it .
I 'd rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner . "
League attorney Peter Noble says the only factor in banning Jericho from the mound is his pitches are just too fast .
" He is a very skilled player , a very hard thrower , " Noble said .
" There are a lot of beginners .
This is not a high - powered league .
This is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport . "
Noble acknowledged that Jericho had not beaned any batters in the co-ed league of 8 - to 10 - year - olds , but say parents expressed safety concerns .
" Facing that kind of speed " is frightening for beginning players , Noble said .
League officials say they first told Vidro that the boy could not pitch after a game on Aug. 13 .
Jericho played second base the next game on Aug. 16 .
But when he took the mound Wednesday , the other team walked off and a forfeit was called .
League officials say Jericho's mother became irate , threatening them and vowing to get the league shut down .
" I have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior Jericho 's mother exhibited Wednesday night , " Noble said .
Scott denies threatening any one , but said she did call the police .
League officials suggested that Jericho play other positions , or pitch against older players or in a different league .
Local attorney John Williams was planning to meet with Jericho 's parents Monday to discuss legal options .
" You do n't have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that it 's wrong , " he said .
" Now you have to be punished because you excel at something ? "
Trials of genetically modified crops should be conducted within a national high - security facility or in fields at secret locations across the country to prevent them from being attacked and destroyed by anti-GM activists , scientists said yesterday .
Researchers spoke out after protesters ripped up crops in one of only two GM trials to be approved in Britain this year , and ahead of a meeting with government ministers , which has been called to discuss ways of providing better protection for crop trials in future .
Scientists claim the repeated attacks on their trials are stifling vital research to evaluate whether GM crops can reduce the cost and environmental impact of farming , and whether GM variants will grow better in harsh environments where droughts have devastated harvests .
Since 2000 almost all of the 54 GM crop trials attempted in Britain have been attacked to some extent .
In a meeting planned for early September environment ministers will be asked to consider establishing a secure GM crop facility at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany ( Niab ) in Cambridge , where the last remaining GM crop trial - of a blight - resistant potato developed by the German company BASF - is being conducted .
Security for that trial , which includes a perimeter fence and 24 - hour security guards , has cost more than £ 100,000 .
An identical trial at the site last year was damaged by activists in a night raid .
In other proposals scientists will be seeking permission to conduct small - scale GM crop trials at undisclosed locations , and possibly a secure register to hold full details of their trials , instead of making them public .
Under an existing EU directive GM crop trials in Britain can only go ahead once a full description of the crop , along with a six - figure grid reference that effectively pinpoints the planned location of the trial , have been made public .
Last month a Leeds University trial of cyst-resistant GM potatoes was destroyed by anti-GM activists .
Howard Atkinson , who led the research , said the trial , which involved only 400 plants , was too small to be considered a threat to the environment , and that paying for costly security " to protect against zealots " was hard for a university to justify .
Atkinson called on the government to adopt a strategy similar to that in Canada , where small experimental trials of a few acres and less can be conducted in secret , with full disclosure only required for larger commercial trials .
" We demand the academic freedom to gain knowledge and a society that does n't allow scientists to do that has got a problem , " he said .
Wayne Powell , director of Niab , backed the calls for greater security of GM trials , adding that the exact locations of trials was originally required to inform local farmers and growers that GM crops were being planted close by .
" We have to look at the way we 're doing trials in a way that ensures they do n't get vandalised , " he said .
" The consequence of not having field trials is you reject these crops before society has had a chance to consider the benefits . "
While North America and other countries have adopted mass growing of GM soya , cotton and maize , there are no GM crops grown in Britain .
Clare Oxborrow , a food campaigner with Friends of the Earth , said : " The government must stand firm and resist this attempt to keep the public and farmers in the dark over GM crop trial locations . "
Part of me really did n’t want to watch last night .
Several of my friends here in Anchorage could n’t bring themselves to do it , and I understand why .
Doubtless there are many others in Alaska who were glued to their sets .
I knew Palin would deliver the speech well , considering her sportscasting experience .
I knew she ’d look good , and have an air of sincerity and straight talk .
But I also knew she did n’t actually write the speech , so this was going to be more a test of delivery rather than a thoughtful dissertation full of policy details .
But I watched anyway .
It was kind of like a personal test of strength .
I passed .
The stunner of the speech for me ?
“ I said thanks , but no thanks to that Bridge to Nowhere ” .
Frankly , I was surprised she said it the first time , shocked she said it the second time , but again ?
Almost incomprehensible .
This must be her test to see if that old George Bush theory that if you say something enough , people will just believe it , is true .
No other explanation seems possible .
This is easy to fact check .
Really easy .
Palin decided she did n’t want the bridge when she learned that Alaska would have to pay too much for it .
If Stevens and Young had been able to pull it off , we ’d be motoring to Gravina Island right now .
The nastiness of the speech surprised me a bit too .
I had imagined that she ’d be playing the Mom card – sensitive , caring , tough when she had to be , but the feel - good human side of the Republican party .
It would have made it much more difficult for Joe Biden to flay her in the debate without looking mean .
But time and time again , she stuck it to Obama with relish , and not on policy either .
She talked about elitism , lack of ‘ executive experience ’ , did the whole “ parting the waters and saving the world ” snark , mocked the use of the dreaded columns at Mile High Stadium , and criticized the Obama logo .
Are we really reduced to logo bashing ?
McCain has been on the wrong side of so many issues that matter to people in this election , there ’s obviously nothing left .
And that ’s what gives me comfort .
But the cherry on top was her sneering , snarky comment about how being a mayor was like being a community organizer , only with “ actual responsibility ” .
A commenter on this blog summed it up so well : ( hat tip MH& metafilter.com )
“ Jesus was a Community Organizer , and Pontias Pilate was a Governor . ”
Can we cram that all on to a bumper sticker , or will we only be able to make t- shirts …
The fact that this derision of community organizers was met with rousing applause by the delegates did nothing but cement the fact for many viewers that this is really the opinion , and the spirit of the Republican ‘ base ’ .
What did all the good - hearted Republican community organizers out there watching the speech think , not only of the comment , but of the reaction from their own party ?
Whoever the speech writer was , it became apparent rather quickly they were going for zingers , barbs , and clever one - liners , and not really thinking much about how the non-bloodthirsty segment of the viewing audience would feel about it .
Sarah Palin was the Hail Mary pass of the GOP .
The McCain campaign is counting on voters being dazzled by the package , enchanted with the newness , and pumped up by the fightin’ spirit of this unusual political figure .
And they are also counting on the fact that most people will go no deeper than that .
Soon the Republican convention will be wrapping up , and we ’ll be ready to move to the next phase of the campaign .
How will Palin fare in an actual interview ?
What will happen in the debate with Joe Biden , who just said he would be “ unrelenting ” in his challenge of Palin ?
What will Hillary Clinton have to say about this ?
Stay tuned .
Most readers will be aware of so - called " 3D printing " techniques , in which solid objects can be constructed automatically from computer models .
Researchers in California intend to scale the process up radically , using " contour crafting " concrete extrusion to erect buildings in a matter of hours .
" Instead of plastic , Contour Crafting will use concrete , " says Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California .
Khoshnevis and his colleagues have just announced funding for their efforts from Caterpillar , the construction - equipment globocorp .
What do you mean , the picture was back to front ?
Contour Crafting equipment , apparently , can already create a six - foot concrete wall without any human input .
It does this by putting down smooth , neatly - trimmed layers of concrete one on top of another " in a process analogous to inkjet printing " .
Rather than ink , however , the heads on this equipment dispense " concrete , clay or adobe " , which is smoothed as it goes along using an array of trowel attachments .
The gear was designed at the USC Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies ( CRAFT ) , which has lofty goals indeed :
The overarching vision ... is to develop the science and engineering needed for rapid automated fabrication of objects of various size up to mega - scale structures such as boats , industrial objects , public art and whole building structures .
The grand challenge for CRAFT is building a custom - designed house in a day while drastically reducing the costs , injuries , waste and environmental impact associated with traditional construction ... whether it be to provide affordable housing ... extraterrestrial buildings constructed from in situ materials ... [ or ] curved organic designs rather than straight surfaces ...
The USC boffins reckon their robo - gantry gear can do more than just concrete boxes : it can apparently fit the plumbing and electrics as it goes along , do the plastering , and perhaps even fit some structural members .
And there 's no need for boring old boxy shapes , either .
The equipment can happily create domes , vaults or any other shape that can be drawn in CAD software and support its own weight - at no added expense .
Normally , anything other than right angles and verticals costs like crazy , so this latter feature is thought to have architects salivating .
As far as more normal buildings go , the USC constructioneers believe that it will be possible for an automated setup to erect a 2,000 - square - foot , two storey house in 24 hours for about one - fifth of what such a project would normally cost .
Khoshnevis and his chums are chuffed to announce their new partnership with Caterpillar .
They also say that NASA is interested in using their gear for building bases on the Moon or Mars , without astronauts having to loosen their spacesuit trousers and heave hods of bricks about .
Other private and government organisations are involved , including the US Army Corps of Engineers and building - materials firm USG .

The lapsed website of the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit has been snapped up by an opportunistic German marketeer .
Up until recently nhtcu.org redirected to the official website of Serious Organised Crime Agency ( SOCA ) .
SOCA was created in April 2006 with the merger of the National Crime Squad , the National Criminal Intelligence Service , the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit ( NHTCU ) .
NHTCU became SOCA 's e-crime division , and its former website was redirected to the official SOCA site .
But recently this registration was allowed to lapse allowing a German marketeer Uwe Matt of digitalsuccess .biz to buy the domain on 2 August .
German marketeer lays towel on nhtcu website
The change was picked up by Graham Cluley , a security consultant at Sophos , in following a link from a BBC story about moves to extradite accused Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon .
The site contained pictures of surveillance cameras and an odd tale about the splendid security performance of a German hotel earlier this week , Cluley reports .
The content of the site has since been changed to include a link back to the SOCA website , though not an automatic redirection .
At no point did the site host malware .
The German marketeer who bought the site claims his intentions are strictly honourable .
" We have no fixed intentions for this domain at present and would welcome any ideas or suggestions about how it might be best used , " the site 's new owner ( digitalsuccess.biz ) states .
Many organisations still link to the nhtcu.org site , presenting it as a source of information on the fight against cybercrime .
Between 2001 and 2006 NHTCU had considerable success in bringing a motley crew of would - be cyberblaggers and phishing fraudsters to justice ( malware authors were handled by Scotland Yard 's cybercrime division ) .
This work led media outlets , computer security firms and British government departments to link to the NHTCU.org site .
Sophos speculates that Matt may have bought the site simply in order to snap up a domain with a high search engine ranking at a bargain price .
The concern is that there is nothing to stop the sale of the domain to someone with more nefarious designs .
Cluley suggests its new owners would do well to donate the site back to SOCA .
We 've relayed this suggestion to digitalsuccess.biz and await its response with interest . ®
Alright folks , let ’s generate some discussion here !
I have a guest article for you all that should have you reconsidering your computer ’s intelligence .
I ’ll hold off significant comment for now , preferring not to bias the reader too much .
However , I will say , my personal opinion , from the perspective of a software engineer with an interest in philosophy and neurobiology , is chess programs — or maybe the game itself , or more likely commercialization — have been absolute flops at addressing the original question to which they were tasked .
Of course , I ’m speaking of artificial intelligence .
And brute force algorithms just do n’t get us any closer to an answer .
Anyway , allow me to step aside and present , with much gratitude to the author …
Why chess programs find good moves ,
but barely understand chess after all .

Actually , the success of today ’s chess programs is undeniable :
In 2006 Fritz beat world champion Kramnik in a match with six games by 4:2 and only recently Grandmaster Ehlvest lost in a rapid - chess match against Rybka 2.5:5.5 , despite the initial advantage of a surplus pawn for the human opponent .
Every user however , who lets a strong chess engine play against itself in analysis mode , will notice that the engine ’s assumptions do n’t often come true , especially when pursuing an opening variant from the start .
Moves estimated as quite good initially may turn out to be bad later .
Why is this ?
The program has fallen victim to the so - called “ horizon effect ” which affects all engines to the present day .
To explain this it is worth examining the search methods of chess programs more closely .
As early as 1950 Claude Shannon published the minimax algorithm [ 3 ] , which is based on the fact that chess is a game with complete information – chance does not play a role - and both players know all the information necessary to play the game from the start to finish .
The clause from game - theory that in such two - person games the sum of the gains ( i.e. advantages ) and losses ( i.e. disadvantages ) is always zero was already published in 1928 by John v. Neumann [ 1 ] .
So a good move means that the opponent has got only worse moves , all of them in all variants leading to favorable positions which are therefore unfavorable for the opponent .
Now we “ only ” have to define a favorable position in chess , and there is already a method to simply try out the moves more or less exhaustively on an internal board in the following way :
Suppose it ’s
White ’s turn to move .
Then the white moves are successively executed .
Each of these moves leads to a position where it ’s Black ’s turn to move .
If we execute the first move of Black ’s choices after White ’s first move we have completed 2 plies of the first variation .
A ply in chess is a half - move ; a complete chess move consists of the moves of White and Black .
The following diagram shows a 2 - ply game tree :
W Maximum / | \ / | \ B B B Minimum /|\ \ \ / | \ \ \ W W W W W 4 - 3 2 5 - 1
As you recognize , White has 3 choices to move in the start position .
After White ’s first move Black has 3 choices , otherwise Black only has one choice .
Typical chess positions naturally have many more , approx .
35 choices to move on average , but for now it ’s only about principle here .
So this diagram presents a game tree that starts with the root node – that is the start position – and ends in five possible leaf nodes – the end positions .
For each of the possible leaf nodes , the chess engine ’s so - called evaluation function calculates a number indicating the merit of the respective position , so e.g. positive values for positions in favor of White and negative values for those in favor of Black .
According to the Minimax principle , White , when striving for the “ best ” move , must assume that Black will also select the “ best ” move , i.e .
Black minimizes its positional values while White maximizes its own .
In the above diagram Black would pick the move leading to the position with value - 3 ( i.e. the minimum ) in the first subtree , and would pick the moves with the values 5 and - 1 in the middle and right subtree , respectively .
However
White selects the maximum of these values , so from - 3 , 5 , and - 1 the maximum would be 5 and the decision would be made in favor of the middle subtree .
A chess program would therefore assign a value + 5 to the main variant .
In chess the number of leaf nodes in the game tree quickly grows very large , and explodes exponentially .
With n plies this amount would result in n35 leaf nodes .
To make the process more manageable in practice , it was crucial to discover a possibility to cut off whole subtrees in order to be able to evaluate far fewer leaf nodes .
Prerequisite for this possible pruning is move sorting by likely quality ( e.g. first exchange moves then moves attacking opponent ’s pieces etc. ) .
The procedure that really does the task is called Alpha - beta pruning .
It is described more precisely in a Wikipedia article ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning), among other references .
For this discussion it is important that this method does n’t alter the essence of the Minimax algorithm .
The quality of today ’s chess programs is mainly determined by the type of evaluation functions used , because it is only here that the program makes decisions about the assessment of good or bad positions .
Early implementations only accounted for a few criteria in this context , particularly counting the material and recognition of mate and stalemate .
But it was discovered very quickly that this was nowhere near adequate .
Today evaluation function factors also consider factors like king ’s security , pawn structures and space advantage , to name just a few .
Now the phenomenon of the above mentioned “ horizon effect ” should become clear .
The leaf nodes of the game tree are forming the horizon beyond which the chess program only rarely knows what will subsequently develop on the board .
One of these exceptions is the search for so called quiescent positions :
When pieces are captured in a leaf node , this variation will always be extended by pursuing all exchange moves until a quiescent position without captures is reached .
The clear intentention here is to avoid material loss beyond the horizon .
As an illustration of the horizon effect consider the following position taken from the documentation of Salomon Chess [ 2 ] :
Black To Move
As you may notice upon closer examination Black ’s best move is 1 … Ke5 with the intention of advancing the king to his own queenside pawns in order to clear a path for pawn promotion .
If you however set the play level of the engine to fixed search depth of 4 plies , each program using the Minimax method ( and these make up the overwhelming majority ) makes the bad move 1 … b3 .
What happened ?
Among the variants detected is White ’s capture of the knight and White ’s capture of the pawn .
According to the Minimax algorithm , at this moment taking the knight is better for White because the engine stops any further computation and does n’t notice the consequences .
After 4 plies the program is left in inky blackness ; therefore this mistake occurred enabling White to ultimately reach a draw .
In principle , a chess program behaves like a blind man who is feeling his way along the curb with his cane and only notices afterwards that something crucial has happened , e.g. the curb ended and he arrived at a crossing .
When starting from the opening move , it is nearly impossible to reach a good middle game position without additional information due to the tremendous number of moves .
Therefore all successful chess programs use so - called opening books where , according to current opening theory , playable variations for both sides are stored .
For the same reason , endgame tables are used .
In these tables , all moves for all positions with ( very ) few men on the board are stored as results of preceding month - long computations .
In these tables an engine can directly look up whether a certain move wins or not .
If the move wins , it can also look up how many moves are needed to reach checkmate .
A chess program with no such table to consult for a given move will inevitably examine a plethora of unreasonable move combinations .
Though an apparent sheer waste of time , this does imply that tactical maneuvers within the game tree ’s scope ( i.e. on the near side of the horizon ) are not overlooked .
This fact decisively contributes to the considerable success of chess programs over human opponents .
During this quite aimless search the same positions can occur more than once .
In order to avoid evaluating these positions twice , so called hashtables are employed internally in order to store intermediate results of previous evaluations .
The user can take advantage of these tables when analysing games , more of this later .
The quality of a chess program working with the Minimax method can thus be traced to the quality of its evaluation function .
Here programmers are confronted with a considerable challenge :
On the basis of the visible board position , they have to estimate which side is better for all game stages , even with equal material on the board .
Often it ’s more difficult to assess an advantage if the material is not balanced .
Here it is necessary to map all characteristics to a unique numerical value .
The pure material values of the men on the board can be accumulated easily , but then positive values for positional advantages like open rook files and knight outposts or points of negative values for backward pawns and unprotected kings must be assigned .
With the issue of king security alone a clear dilemma emerges : Particularly in the middle game the king should be preferably protected behind a line of pawns , but this piece becomes an active piece in the endgame and then it is disadvantageous for the king to remain at the edge of the board .
This raises the question of where exactly the endgame begins , and if this can be defined by the remaining material alone .
There are more matters of conscience for the programmers .
For in order to eventually get the number of the position value , dynamic elements like piece mobility have to be brought in line with static elements like material values .
In the course of time , programs with sophisticated positional evaluation functions turned out to fare better .
This became particularly apparent with the emergence of Rybka .
Nevertheless , it ’s questionable whether this is the last word on the subject .
For example , consider the position emerging on the board after the following moves of the Tarrasch variation of the French defense ( taken from an analysis by the author ) :
1. e4 e6 2 . d4 d5 3 . Nd2 Nf6 4 . e5 Nfd7 5 . f4 c5 6 . c3 cxd4 7 . cxd4 Nc6 8 . Ngf3 f6 9 . Bd3 fxe5 10 .
dxe5 Nc5 11 .
Bb1 Be7 12 . a 3 a5 13 .
h4 Qb6 14 .
Ng5 Kf8 15 . Qh5 Bxg5 16 .
fxg5 Ke7 17 . g6 h6 18 .
Rf1 Rg8 19 .
Rf7 + Ke8
Control :
White To Move
Modern engines in particular believe that Black is a bit better off here and they typically want to play 20 .
Qe2 ?.
White however has a clear winning line after 20 . Rxg7 ! , for example :
20 . Rxg7 Rxg7 21 .
Qxh6 Rg8 22 . Qh7 Ne7 23 .
Nf3 Kd7 24 .
Bg5 Re8 25 .
g7 Qd8 26 .
Bg6 Rg8 27 . Rc1 b6 28 . b4 ax b4 29 . ax b4 Na6 30 .
Bd3 Nc7 31 .
Bxe7 Kxe7 32 .
Rxc7 + Qxc7 33 .
Qxg8 Qc1 + 34 . Kf2 Qf4 35 .
Qh7 Ra2+ 36 .
Be2 Qf7 37 .
g8=Q 1-
0
Granted ,
White ’s advantage after 20 .
Rxg7 becomes apparent after only 5 or 6 moves , but modern engines reach this search depth very fast .
So what happens here ?
Because positional factors control the evaluation function , sacrificial moves are inserted at the end of the list of moves to be examined .
The search proceeds incrementally , increasing the search depth slowly , that is ply after ply , in order to gain hints for the new sorting sequence in the current search depth from the preceding examination .
Since the value of the sacrifice manifests itself after a relatively long period of time it ’s quite possible that the opportunity to play Rxg7 is missed by a cut - off operation of Alpha - beta pruning .
So gearing the evaluation function towards predominantly positional factors would have precluded the examination of a move that makes no sense at first glance .
Interestingly enough , several older programs such as Fritz 9 and even Fritz 10 still find the rook sacrifice , whereas Fritz 11 as well as Rybka do n’t locate this move .
Another interesting position which most notably highlights the programs ’ weaknesses in the endgame is the following one :
Black To Move
The chess playing human recognizes relatively fast that taking the rook on b2 causes an exchange of rooks which bestows a surplus bishop on Black but leaves Black rather hapless .
For how shall the dark squared bishop take one of the pawns residing on light squares ?
Only the black king could accomplish this , but he is barred by the white king from getting to g2 , the Achilles ’ heel of White ’s configuration .
Therefore the correct plan to win is forgoing the rook exchange and then bringing the bishop to f2 in order to cut pawn g2 off from the rook ’s protection .
Most engines however , promptly take the rook on b3 ending up in a draw after 2 . Kxc7 .
The short term material advantage prevails over the long - term winning route which can be only detected by certain computations in the evaluation function .
For the Alpha - beta procedure must have noticed success or failure in the first place and this can take a long time with the number and length of variants to be excluded .
By the way , Zappa Mexico II seems to invest more effort here than others because this chess program found the key move 1 … Rc4 rather quickly but needed a longer time in order to find the victorious maneuver 1 … Rc4 2 . Re2 Kf7 3 . Ra2 Rd4 + 4 . Kc5 Rd1 5 . Kc4 Be1 6 . f4 Bf2 .
Something that is completely beyond the abilities of today ’s chess programs is the discovery of fortresses .
A position containing a fortress is characterized by a configuation that cannot be “ broken up ” by the opponent even with superior material , i.e. the opponent would have to relinquish its material advantage in order to make any progress in the game .
But then the player with the fortress could draw or even win the game .
This means that a position with a fortress is at worst a draw .
Example :
White To Move
After 1 . Bg4 e1=Q 2 . h3 the black king is incarcerated and the black queen alone cannot bring about any change , because it ’s completely sufficient to have the bishop shuttle between f3 and g4 .
Humans would immediately offer a draw but a chess program would notice the draw only after 50 moves ( by intervention of the 50 - move rule ) .
Here the biggest weakness of all current chess programs becomes evident :
It is the desultory trial and error while searching for moves always with the hope that every now and then something to be exploited will be discovered .
For the most part nonsensical series of moves are examined .
This computation is unnecessarily costly and after all only feasible due to the speed of current processors .
In spite of this computing power , very long variants absolutely cannot be tackled , although in the endgame extremely long lines to checkmate can be found , as can be gleaned from the endgame tables .
An engine which wants to avoid trying out move variants in a hit - or - miss fashion , needs far more chess knowledge than that utilised in today ’s programs .
Current programs cannot explain why a certain move is either good or bad because causal chains are not followed , thus the move and countermove of a variant is only the indirect result of a position value return to the game tree ’s root .
Yet more is required in order to master chess .
It ’s actually amazing that these inadequate methods generally still compute useable moves .
In closing we return to the hashtables mentioned above .
Because these are not automatically deleted when a user steps through an already computed variant using the graphical frontend in analysis mode , the horizon effect can actually be mitigated in this way :
If the program detects hashtable values of recurring positions that were already computed down the line , it can use them to find other , hopefully better , moves .
But overall that ’s small comfort .
When it comes to the truth in chess , one can currently only rely on the endgame table bases .
Ultimate certainty concerning the quality of chess moves can , in general , not be gained by the Alpha - beta algorithm .

A flying saucer is in the works , but it did n’t come from space .
It came from Florida .
Subrata Roy , an engineering professor at the University of Florida , is trying to patent his design of a circular , spinning aircraft he dubs WEAV , short for wingless electromagnetic air vehicle .
The suggested prototype offers several advantages .
It can hover and take off vertically .
With no moving parts , the WEAV should be markedly reliable .
And though his battery - powered model is only six inches across , Roy thinks a larger craft is possible .
Roy applied his experience doing U.S. Air Force - funded plasma research to develop the propulsion system devoid of typical aircraft parts such as propellers and engines .
Here is how it works : Electrodes lining the vehicle ’s surface ionize the surrounding air .
This creates plasma on the vehicle ’s exterior .
An electrical current sent through this plasma generates a force that not only produces the necessary lift and momentum .
It also stabilizes the vehicle in windy conditions .
Looking like a flying bundt pan , the WEAV design is partially hollow and continuously curved .
This larger surface area improves lift and control .
Besides providing surveillance on Earth , Roy also envisions the craft in other atmospheres , such as that of Saturn ’s moon Titan , where high air density and low gravity would be favorable to saucer flight .
But the path from concept to production may not be smooth .
Flying in Earth ’s air requires a thrust at least 10 times greater than in outer space where drag and gravity are lower .
And the plasma necessary to fly also obstructs wave transmission used for communicating with a remote source .
This does n’t discourage Roy .
“ Of course the risk is huge , but so is the payoff , ” he said .
“ If successful , we will have an aircraft , a saucer and a helicopter all in one embodiment . ”

Last week Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak , on a visit to Washington DC , warned that he expects another Taliban offensive before winter .
The Bush Administration appears to fear strikes in the region as well .
The Sunday Telegraph , citing a “ senior US intelligence official , ” insists that the escalation of US attacks in the Pakistani tribal regions this month are designed to disrupt the ability of al - Qaeda and other groups to coordinate pre-election plots .
The increase in US attacks , referred to as “ phase one ” of a three stage plan , have focused on North and South Waziristan .
Several air strikes from US drones have killed dozens in the tribal areas , many of them civilians .
Perhaps the biggest provocation though came early in the month when US ground forces and helicopters attacked a tiny South Waziristan border village , reportedly killing 20 civilians .
Relations have worsened with Pakistan since the beginning of “ phase one , ” with repeated warnings from Pakistan ’s civilian government and Pakistan ’s Chief of Army Staff General Parvez Kayani ordering the military to bar foreign incursions with force .
All this tension came to a head Thursday , when US and Pakistani soldiers traded fire for five minutes across the border between North Waziristan and Afghanistan ’s Khost Province .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has positioned himself as a public friend to the United States , a label that is becoming an increasing liability as anti-US sentiment rises with the Waziristan body count .
And while Zardari continues to praise President Bush publicly , there are fears that his position is increasingly tenuous .
In fact the Washington Times cites regional specialists and US officials who caution the US attacks are creating a potentially dangerous situation for the civilian government , particularly with Zardari out of the country visiting the US .
The Times quotes former adviser Bruce Riedel as saying Zardari “ has little , if any , control of the army , ” and speculating that the Pakistani military may be suspicious of Zardari ’s “ close ties to ( Afghan President Hamid ) Karzai . ”
And while General Kayani seems much less willing to meddle in governmental affairs than his predecessors , he may find himself under increasing pressure to be more proactive if the US strikes continue while the president issues only weak warnings and denies that the more serious incidents have even taken place .
I use YouTube as an example very deliberately , because I want to point out , before moving on , how feminist allies can inadvertently bolster the case of silencers who charge that feminists look for things about which to be offended .
Each time I mention YouTube threads , commenters inevitably say either " YouTube commenters are the lowest common denominator " and / or " Just do n't read those threads . "
I 'm not sure everyone who says those things has really considered the implications , so let 's deal with that first .
The assertion that YouTube threads are n't a legitimate source because they 're ostensibly populated by juvenile delinquents or society 's dregs is n't actually a sound argument .
The same stuff — if more accurately spelled and with fewer Random Capitalizations — can be found in the comments threads of most major progressive political blogs , especially in response to posts about conservative women .
( You want to know if there 's misogyny among progressive blog readers ?
Post something about Ann Coulter . )
Thanks to blogospheric demographics surveys , we know the average blog user is older , better educated , and wealthier than the average person in the general populace ; this is not an issue of maturity or intelligence or class .
Treating sexism as though it is indigenous to any singular demographic , or unique combination of traits — or , the flipside of that equation , regarding any demographic as wholly devoid of entrenched misogyny — is both foolhardy and inaccurate .
And , more to the point , irrelevant :
There are millions of YouTube users and an alarmingly high rate of misogynistic comments .
The quality of who is making those comments is n't of much interest to women who must nonetheless suffer their undeniable quantity .
Which brings us to …Telling women that they should merely abstain from reading and / or participating in YouTube threads — or other places online and offline plagued by unfettered misogyny — is akin to telling women their choices are to tolerate sexual harassment in order to participate in it , or segregate themselves and necessarily limit their opportunities in the public sphere .
In addition to unfairly punishing women , that 's also a tacit endorsement of openly expressed misogyny .
No matter how authentic the genuine feelings of concern that may motivate such a recommendation , when someone advises a woman to disengage herself from a public space in which misogyny is rampant , one also necessarily , if unintentionally , communicates the message that her contributions to that space are not valuable enough to fight to protect .
By slow increments , every unmonitored space thusly becomes uninhabitable by any woman not willing to suffer — and indulge — misogynist bullies .
[ Note : I recognize this experience can be true for GBTQ men , men of color , disabled men , etc. , too , depending on the forum .
]
So , back to the ubiquity of misogyny .
If the nearest comments thread calling Ann Coulter a tranny or Hillary Clinton a " hoe " does n't convince you , perhaps a 7 - part series on the media 's insistence on trivializing women 's lives by categorizing as " Odd News " stories about women that are n't " odd " in any way aside from the fact that there 's a women at their centers will , or a 12 - part series on the impossible beauty standards to which women are held will , or a 15 - part series on consumable disembodied female bodies will , or a 19 - part series on rape jokes will , or a 20 - part series on objectionable advertising , most of which focuses on sexism , will , or a 62 - part series ( make that 63 ) on sexism being used against Hillary will — to any one of which I could add a new entry every single day , had I the time , energy , and inclination .
The truth is , if I actually spent my days actively paying attention to every example of misogyny around me , I would be a profoundly unhappy woman .
Not bitchy or grumpy or short - tempered , but paralyzingly depressed .
Women have to train themselves to avoid consciously reacting to every bit of misogynistic detritus permeating the culture through which we all move , lest they go quite insane .
I write about the things I can't not write about .
If I wrote about all the examples of sexism I see every day , I 'd never sleep .
Tangentially , the idea that addressing " the little things , " like being told to smile or misogynistic t- shirts , somehow demeans feminism or distracts from " real " or " serious " sexism is utterly , completely , devilishly wrong .
Feminism seeks to address all manner of issues , big and small .
That women can ( and do ) utilize the tenets of feminism in every aspect of their lives does not undermine the history of the feminist movement , but instead does it a great honor .
Feminism was never meant to be restricted to suffrage and equal pay , held in reserve like a finite quantity that could run out if it 's used for " the little things . "
Feminism is a renewable resource .
The idea that feminism should be kept under glass , broken only in case of a " real " and " serious " emergency , is predicated on the erroneous assumption that " the little things " happen in a void , as do , presumably , the " real " and " serious " things , when , in reality , they are interwoven strands of the same rope .
And as soon as one begins to judge the worthiness of feminists ' attention on a sliding scale , even generally - regarded " serious issues " like equal pay are dwarfed by global concerns like sex trafficking or government - sanctioned use of rape as a tool of war .
It does n't have to be one or the other — feminists can multi-task .
And , in a very real way , ignoring " the little things " in favor of " the big stuff " makes the big stuff that much harder to eradicate , because it is the pervasive , ubiquitous , inescapable little things that create the foundation of a sexist culture on which the big stuff is dependent for its survival .
It 's the little things , the constant drumbeat of inequality and objectification , that inure us to increasingly horrible acts and attitudes toward women .
Irrespective of intent , the recommendation to " ignore the little stuff , " so often intertwined with accusations of looking for things about which to get offended , is not just ill - advised , but counter to the ultimate goal of full equality .
It 's like a knife in my gut when I see feminists accusing other feminists of " hurting the cause " by focusing on " the little stuff , " because that 's — that 's the stuff , that 's the fertile soil in which everything else takes root and from whence everything else springs , that 's the way that the fundamental idea that women are not equal to men is conveyed over and over and over again .
Which , quite frankly , means that if even we had to look for it , we'd be right to do so .
Er , what , er :
Gibson : Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine ?
Palin :
In what respect , Charlie ?
Gibson :
What do you interpret it to be ?
Palin : His worldview .
Gibson : No , No , the Bush Doctrine .
He enunciated it in September 2002 , before the Iraq War .
.
Palin : I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is to rid this world of Islamic extremism , terrorists who are hellbent on destroying our nation .
There have been blunders along the way , though .
There have been mistakes made .
And with new leadership -- and that 's the beauty of American elections and democracy -- with new leadership comes the opportunity to do things better .
Gibson : The Bush Doctrine , as I understand it , is that we have the right of anticipatory defense .
We have the right to preemptively strike any other country that we believe is going to attack us .
Palin : I agree that a president 's job , when they swear in their oath to uphold our Constitution , their top priority is to defend the United States of America .
I know that John McCain will do that and I , as his vice president , families we are blessed with that vote of the American people and are elected to serve and are sworn in on January 20 , that will be our top priority is to defend the American people .
Actually , the first priority is to defend the constitution of the United States .
Palin does n't even know the oath she is supposed to swear .
And any serious person who has followed the debates about US foreign policy knows what the Bush doctrine is .
But we do not have a serious pick for the vice - presidency in the GOP , do we ?
We have an absurdity .
And a joke .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
I 've traversed through page 76 of the " Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , " and have learned relatively little about how the actual bill will effect the current economic situation .
The text is very dense and appears to be written by multiple parties , comprehension suffers as a result of both .
I am by no means an expert on legislation , so for now I 'd like to focus on the political impact rather than the substance .
After McCain 's galactic stunt last week he 's politically obligated to vote for whatever bill arrives on the Senate floor ; and the Democratic leadership knows this .
There are two paths this bill can go down , neither road is good for McCain .
If the Democrats play their cards right they can turn McCain 's opportunism into a disaster .
I 'll start by arbitrarily assuming the Democratic leadership supports the bill 's content .
If the Democrats want the bill to pass , the bill will pass .
Under this pretense we can assume that the bill leans left and would likely be supported , at least ideologically by Obama .
We already know that McCain has to vote for the bill which leaves Obama in an interesting situation .
If the vote follows party lines and McCain supports the bill , Obama 's vote is not essential for passage .
Using the fact that most American 's do not support a financial bailout of Wall Street , Obama could publicly denounce the bailout while pinning the final result on McCain .
This brilliant tactic would play extremely well among independents and may create dissonance amongst McCain 's base .
The second path includes some theatrics by the Democratic leadership , perhaps they are faking their support .
If they force the bill to the House floor knowing they have the votes to kill it , the Senate vote is simply irrelevant .
It would take at least another week to sort through additional agreements causing the economic cloud to loom over the presidential race for yet another week .
If the vote does n't matter in the Senate Obama can do whatever he wants , he can vote for it , he can vote against , he does n't even have to take a position .
If the bill falters in the House , McCain will be held responsible for the failed compromise .
A stalled bailout falls directly into Obama 's narrative .
The issue dominates until the VP debate , forcing Palin to answer economic questions ; something she knows nothing about .
If the topic is the economy and Palin cannot pull through , John McCain 's campaign is over .
I really do n't see both sides mutually agreeing to the resolution , but tomorrow 's polls may dictate what route the bill follows ; if Obama gets a huge boost from the debate , the bill will likely pass , if not the Democrats will try and further damage McCain 's stock , whatever form that takes .
The House vote is scheduled for Monday , and the Senate 's on Wednesday .
I hope to have some additional commentary on the bill 's content tomorrow .
Tumblr , RMagick and a Photo Frame !
Over the course of the past year or so , I got myself into a habit of using Tumblr for storing insightful snippets and quotes from my daily endeavours on the internet .
Usually , this entails saving a paragraph ( too long for tweet , and not enough for del.icio.us ) so I can revisit it later .
However , having Tumblr to save the quotes is nice , but I rarely ( if ever ) went back to read them .
Pondering this dilemma , I spotted my Phillips digital photo frame , and a quick weekend project was born : Tumblr API , RMagick to render the images , and an SD card full of wisdom and quotes for easy consumption !
Retrieving quotes from Tumblr API
Retrieving your content from Tumblr is about as easy as it can get : one GET request , with a few query parameters .
In return you get an XML file with the quotes , the source link , publication time , and much more .
To parse the XML response , HPricot comes to the rescue :
require ' open - uri ' require ' hpricot ' require ' cgi ' # read last 5 quotes doc = Hpricot .
XML ( open ( " http://username.tumblr.com/api/read?type=quote&num=5 " ) ) # iterate and clean up ( unescape HTML , and remove HTML entities ) ( doc / ' post ' ) . each do | post | text = CGI :: unescapeHTML (( post / ' quote - text ' ) . inner_html ) . gsub ( /&[ ^ ; ]*;?/ , '' ) source = CGI :: unescapeHTML (( post / ' quote - source ' ) . inner_html ) . gsub ( /\<.*?\>/ , '' ) . gsub ( /&[ ^ ; ]*;?/ , '' ) . strip puts " Processing : #{ post [ ' id ' ] }
" end
Rendering wisdom with RMagick
Once the data is cleaned up , we can get to the rendering step .
Installing RMagick can be a dreadful experience , but it appears that as of 2.x release , this process has been vastly improved - everything worked on the first try !
To render the final image , I ’ve decided to adopt the simplest possible route : render each component as a separate image ( quote text , background , source link , etc ) , and then merge the images as layers into a single file .
Easier said than done !
RMagick is not for the faint of heart , and to my surprise , did not have the concept of a text box ( it can only render contiguous lines ) , unless you use the annotate method :
require ' rmagick ' include Magick text =
" A goal is a dream with deadline " # courtesy of http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2007/02/rmagick-renderi.html
# - render the text in a 500x430 box , and truncate if needed quote = render_cropped_text ( text , 500 , 430 ) do | img | img .
fill = " # ffffff " # font color img .
background_color = " transparent " img .
pointsize = 23 img .
antialias = true img .
font = " Helvetica " end quote .
write " text.png "
It ’s not optimized , but it got the job done : ~160 quotes on an SD card , rotating at random intervals for my enjoyment .
Next iteration , automated updates of quotes on my photo frame via RSS and WiFi - any volunteers to write a Sinatra app ?
I ca n’t wait until D - Link DSM - 210 hits the streets !

Muslim cabbies who risk losing their taxi licenses if they refuse to carry passengers with alcohol from the airport wo n't get any help from the Minnesota Court of Appeals .
The Metropolitan Airports Commission adopted an ordinance in March 2007 that suspends a driver 's taxi license for 30 days for refusing to pick up a passenger for any reason at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
The penalty for a second refusal is a two - year license suspension .
Cabbies have a right to appeal a suspension , with the penalty stayed until an administrative hearing officer issues a decision .
Nine men who own or operate taxis at the airport had appealed a district judge 's refusal to issue a temporary injunction blocking the commission from imposing the penalties .
The men said their religious beliefs prohibit them from carrying alcohol .
The Appeals Court ruling Tuesday upholds the lower court 's decision .
Both courts said that the respondents failed to show that they would suffer irreparable harm if a temporary injunction was not granted .
Both courts also noted the appeal process that allows cabbies to keep working while their case is pending .
Airports Commission spokesman Patrick Hogan said Tuesday that there have been only five refusals of service so far this year .
All are in the appeals process , which can take several months to complete , he said .
Between 2002 and 2007 , there were nearly 5,000 refusals , he said .
There are almost 900 taxi drivers licensed to do business at the airport , Hogan said , and they provided more than 731,000 rides in the past year .
PAT PHEIFER
But Obama 's campaign , which has built what many political veterans believe is the best - organized presidential campaign ever , is also making a big push on early voting , which may help him put up a serious challenge for reliably GOP states such as North Carolina and Indiana .
He named North Carolina - a historically Republican state now considered a tossup - as one McCain 's campaign would like to " put away " before Nov. 4 .
" We know who has the propensity to vote absentee , who we can push to vote absentee , who we want to do that , " Beeson said .
" It 's a turnout operation almost from Oct. 1 to Election Day , and you have to maintain that intensity and that focus , " Beeson said .
Rich Beeson , political director for the Republican National Committee , said the GOP 's voter - mobilization efforts used to concentrate on the 72 hours before elections .
With the boom in early voting , he said , the party now makes a five - week - long push , during which they ensure supporters are registered and organize trips to voting locations .
Voters in several states , including those in the important battlegrounds of Iowa and Virginia , have already begun voting .
Over the next few weeks , people in more than 30 states will join them .
The shift toward early voting has enormous consequences for presidential campaigns , transforming the way they build turnout operations , allocate staff and money , and push messages in the media and in TV ads .
This year , some voting specialists believe that as many as one in three voters could have their decision banked before Nov. 4 , compared with one in five who cast early ballots in 2004 and roughly one in seven who did so in 2000 , according to Census surveys and Associated Press tallies .
" In many of these places , the polling place is a thing of the past , " said Michael McDonald , a voting and elections specialist at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va .
The rush to vote early , abetted by the growing liberalization of state election laws , reflects a quiet revolution in American voting patterns that is reshaping the presidential race .
The very notion of Election Day , when Americans gather in school gyms , community centers , and fire stations to pick a president , is slowly giving way to drawn - out election windows - weeks - long periods when voters , at their leisure , can cast ballots at designated spots or send them by mail .
For millions of voters over the next few weeks , the answer will be no .
Confident in their choice of John McCain or Barack Obama , they will line up around the country to cast early ballots - at Albertsons grocery stores around Las Vegas , next to the Barnes & Noble at the Friendly Center shopping plaza in Greensboro , N.C. , and in the student union at Drake University in Des Moines .
If you have already made up your mind in the presidential race , is there any point to waiting until Election Day to vote ?
Yesterday , Obama 's North Carolina campaign posted an Internet video of Obama , just before taking the stage at a rally in Greensboro on Saturday , urging supporters to vote as soon as the state 's early - voting window begins , on Oct. 16 .
" It ca n't be easier , but you 've got to make the effort , " Obama said , pointing backers to his campaign 's sophisticated website , voteforchange.com , where they can register and find their early - voting locations .
Obama 's national field director , Jon Carson , said the campaign is pushing early voting everywhere the law allows .
But he named a number of battleground states where he said the campaign has made early voting a " major focus , " including Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , and Indiana .
He said that while the trend does not necessarily help one political party , it does help the best - run campaign .
" It favors the campaign that has the better organization and gets information into supporters ' hands , " Carson said .
Republicans and Democrats have been engaged in a fierce fight over early voting in Ohio , where , for the first time in a presidential election voters can cast ballots early with an excuse .
From today through Monday , Ohio voters will be able to simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots , a window that Republicans argue disproportionately benefits Democrats .
The Ohio Supreme Court and a federal judge yesterday rebuffed GOP - led legal challenges , allowing the early voting to proceed .
Voters who seek to preempt Election Day are driven by varying motivations : impatience , a desire to avoid crowds , schedules that make getting to the polls difficult .
" It takes a little bit of pressure off , " said Lynn McRoberts , a 21 - year - old political science major at Drake , who is helping McCain 's campaign get students to an early - voting center at the student union on Oct. 15 .
Others are simply tired of the all - consuming presidential race and want to check out early .
" They do n't want to listen to the campaign anymore , " said Matt Griffin , deputy secretary of state for elections in Nevada , where state officials expect at least half of voters to cast ballots before Election Day .
Despite the convenience voting early allows , one potential downside , some specialists say , is that it locks in one 's vote before the presidential race has fully played itself out .
" Not only might you vote with less information that suddenly comes up at the end of the day , but you also will miss the debates , the scheduled things that you might want to see , " said John Fortier , a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of the 2006 book " Absentee and Early Voting : Trends , Promises , and Perils . "
Election laws vary significantly across the country - from states with liberal laws such as Ohio , to Massachusetts , which requires absentee voters to have a reason for missing Election Day .
( Only about 5 percent of Bay State voters voted absentee in 2004 . )
Two states that have moved the furthest from traditional Election Day voting are Oregon , which conducts elections by mail , and Washington , where 37 of 39 counties vote that way .
Interest in early and absentee voting has grown since the 1970s , especially in Western states , which have been the pioneers , researchers say .
Researchers say that those who vote before Election Day tend to be the most partisan , unlikely to be swayed by a late debate , TV ad , or scandal , and that early voting has not favored either party .
With record turnout expected in a number of states , state election officials are actively encouraging voters to cast early ballots , because it lessens the demands on their offices on Election Day .
Colorado has been running public service announcements urging people to vote once the state 's early - voting window opens Oct. 20 .
" It 's a really strong message here , " said Stephanie Cegielski , a legal specialist with the Colorado Secretary of State 's office .
" Get your vote in early . "
Though Beeson acknowledges the strength of Obama 's ground organization , he cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the success either campaign has in getting supporters to cast early ballots over the next few weeks .
He cited as an example New Mexico , where roughly half of voters cast early ballots in 2004 .
In 2000 , Beeson said , Republicans were more successful with early voters in New Mexico but ended up losing the state to Al Gore .
Four years ago , he said , Democrats did a better job with early voting in the state but President Bush ended up beating Senator John F. Kerry .

ANIMAL CARE LABELS
Four main terms indicate the level of care hens received .
For eggs from chickens that live in the sort of utopia conveyed by the images on most egg cartons , look for “ animal welfare approved . ”
Available in limited markets , it is a new label by the Animal Welfare Institute that is given only to independent family farmers .
Flocks can have no more than 500 birds , and chickens over 4 weeks old must be able to spend all their time outside on pesticide - free pasture with a variety of vegetation .
They must have access to dust baths and cannot have their beaks trimmed ( a practice on crowded egg farms ) or be fed animal byproducts .
Image WHATS IN AN EGG ?
The array of labels on egg cartons can be bewildering .
Some provide reliable information about audited claims ( like  U.S.D.A. organic and  certified humane raised and handled ) .
Others are unregulated and unverified .
Credit ... Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times
“ Certified humane raised and handled ” hens and “ American humane certified ” hens are kept cage free , though not necessarily outdoors .
“ Certified humane raised and handled ” is administered by Humane Farm Animal Care , the only animal welfare program audited each year for reliability by the Department of Agriculture .
It is endorsed by many animal welfare organizations .
It has requirements for , among other things , ventilation , density and the number of perches and nesting boxes that must be provided .
It requires that each hen have at least 1.5 square feet of space ( 324 square inches ) .
The “ American humane certified ” label was created by the American Humane Association .
Its standards , similar to those of “ certified humane raised and handled , ” prohibit forced molting ( reducing feed to increase egg production ) and require that hens have at least 1.25 square feet of space ( 225 square inches ) .
“ United Egg Producers Certified , ” formerly “ Animal care certified , ” is presented by the United Egg Producers , America ’s leading trade association for egg farmers , which has standards for caged and cage - free layers .
The group adopted the new name under pressure from the Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau , which agreed with complaints they had received that “ Animal care certified ” misled consumers by implying more humane treatment than the hens were getting .
Even with the new title , many animal welfare advocates say those standards are too low .
The standards permit hens to have as little as 67 square inches of space , less than a letter - size sheet of paper , which is 93.5 square inches .
What Birds Are Fed
ORGANIC
Any product with the “ U.S.D.A. organic ” emblem must meet the standards of the agriculture department ’s National Organic Program .
Among the program ’s requirements : birds must be kept cage free with outdoor access ( though the time and the type of access are not defined ) , they can not be given antibiotics ( even if ill ) and their food must be free from animal byproducts and made from crops grown without chemical pesticides , fertilizers , irradiation , genetic engineering or sewage sludge .
If organic eggs do not have the program ’s emblem , they may be part of an independent or state - run program , and it may take some research to determine the program ’s standards .
Yet not all members of a certifiably self - reflective species will pass the mirror test .
Tellingly , said Diana Reiss , a professor of psychology at Hunter College who has studied mirror self - recognition in elephants and dolphins , “ animals raised in isolation do not seem to show mirror self - recognition . ”
For that matter , humans do not necessarily see the face in the mirror either .
In a report titled “ Mirror , Mirror on the Wall : Enhancement in Self - Recognition , ” which appears online in The Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , Nicholas Epley and Erin Whitchurch described experiments in which people were asked to identify pictures of themselves amid a lineup of distracter faces .
Participants identified their personal portraits significantly quicker when their faces were computer enhanced to be 20 percent more attractive .
They were also likelier , when presented with images of themselves made prettier , homelier or left untouched , to call the enhanced image their genuine , unairbrushed face .
Such internalized photoshoppery is not simply the result of an all - purpose preference for prettiness : when asked to identify images of strangers in subsequent rounds of testing , participants were best at spotting the unenhanced faces .
How can we be so self - delusional when the truth stares back at us ?
“ Although we do indeed see ourselves in the mirror every day , we do n’t look exactly the same every time , ” explained Dr. Epley , a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business .
There is the scruffy - morning you , the assembled - for - work you , the dressed - for - an - elegant - dinner you .
“ Which image is you ? ” he said .
“ Our research shows that people , on average , resolve that ambiguity in their favor , forming a representation of their image that is more attractive than they actually are . ”

When we look in the mirror , our relative beauty is not the only thing we misjudge .
In a series of studies , Dr. Bertamini and his colleagues have interviewed scores of people about what they think the mirror shows them .
They have asked questions like , Imagine you are standing in front of a bathroom mirror ; how big do you think the image of your face is on the surface ?
And what would happen to the size of that image if you were to step steadily backward , away from the glass ?
People overwhelmingly give the same answers .
To the first question they say , well , the outline of my face on the mirror would be pretty much the size of my face .
As for the second question , that ’s obvious : if I move away from the mirror , the size of my image will shrink with each step .
Both answers , it turns out , are wrong .
Outline your face on a mirror , and you will find it to be exactly half the size of your real face .
Step back as much as you please , and the size of that outlined oval will not change : it will remain half the size of your face ( or half the size of whatever part of your body you are looking at ) , even as the background scene reflected in the mirror steadily changes .
Importantly , this half - size rule does not apply to the image of someone else moving about the room .
If you sit still by the mirror , and a friend approaches or moves away , the size of the person ’s image in the mirror will grow or shrink as our innate sense says it should .
( A few years ago I was working at a video store when there were still late fees , and this exchange occurred after I scanned a couple ’s rentals : )
Me : “ Okay , sir , with the late fee from your last rental , your total is $ 9.50 . ”
Husband : “ What do you mean a late fee ?
I always return my movies on time , so you need to remove that late fee right now ! ”
Me : “ Well , sir , you returned – ”
Husband : “ I said I always return my movies on time and you need to remove that late fee right now !
I ’m not paying this ! ”
Me : “ Then you wo n’t be renting these movies tonight .
All late fees must be paid before renting again . ”
Husband : “ I ’m not paying this , so you better take it off now ! ”
Wife : “ What movie is this late fee for anyway ?
We always return our movies on time ! ”
Me : “ This is for Runaway Bride with Julia Roberts .
You rented it on the 6th and it was due on the 11th , but you did n’t return it until the 15th . ”
Husband : “ Oh , yeah , that ’s right ; we never got around to watching it .
I ’ll pay for it . ”
Wife : “ We never rented Runaway Bride and I was out of town on the 6th . ”
Me : “ Well , ma’am , it ’s showing that Jennifer rented the title . ”
Wife : “ Who is Jennifer ? ” * pauses and her face becomes red *
“ Oh , that b****! ”
( The wife proceeds to slap her husband , take the keys , and drive away , leaving her husband in the store . )
Husband : “ Well , I guess I deserved that , huh ? ”
Me : “ Sir , you put your mistress on your account ? ”
Husband : “ Yeah , she likes movies … ”
Me : “ You are aware that she could have opened her own account for free , right ? ”
Husband : “ Oh , s*** , really ? ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Hewlett - Packard
Co plans to cut 7.5 percent of its work force , or 24,600 jobs , seeking to realize savings from its recent acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corp , the company said on Monday .

HP said it would carry out the cutbacks over the next three years , while replacing about half the jobs in new areas of its services business .
It announced the plan ahead of a meeting with Wall Street analysts to detail the merger plans .
Nearly half of the job reductions will take place in the United States , the Palo Alto , California - based company said .
EDS was headquartered in Plano , Texas , near Dallas .
“ We are good at integrating companies ... I believe we will do it well , ” HP Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Hurd told financial analysts at the company ’s headquarters .
The $ 13.2 billion acquisition of EDS , a deal announced in May and closed in August , made HP the world ’s second largest provider of technology services , up from No. 5 previously .
Arch rival IBM is No. 1 in computer services , and HP ’s strategy takes aim at this dominance .
The deal bolsters HP ’s business in the United States and Britain , two strong market for EDS , both among commercial clients and in government agencies .
EDS also gives HP the No. 1 position in “ applications management ” -- providing maintenance and outsourced management of older software systems .
HP said it would take a charge of $ 1.7 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in October .
Accounting for goodwill will cost $ 1.4 billion , while cost of the restructuring will involve anther $ 300 million .
HP estimated $ 1.8 billion in annual cost savings once the three - year cost - cutting program is completed .
DISRUPTIVE ROLE
HP ’s shares fell 3.5 percent to close at $ 45.33 ahead of the analysts ’ meeting Monday afternoon , amid a broad sell - off .
Following the news , HP shares edged up 11 cents to trade at $ 45.44 in after - hours trading .
Ann Livermore , executive vice president of HP ’s Technology Solutions Group , told the meeting the merger with EDS would help the company compete more aggressively for big business customers in a market that will be worth $ 451 billion by 2010 .
She said the combination of HP and EDS position the combined company to play a disruptive role in the computer and technical services market , now dominated by IBM .
HP is well positioned to provide companies looking to cut the costs of managing their technical systems through services such as virtualization and server automation .
The company can also attack the fast - growing centralized data center market with its market - leading position in blade servers and heavy investments in recent years in network management software , she said .
“ This is a market looking to be disrupted , ” Livermore said .
“ We have got ourselves positioned to be where the market is moving ...
The core trends are very much playing to HP ’s strengths . ” .
At the time the merger was announced in May , HP counted 178,000 employees on its books and EDS had 142,000 employees .
Including the value of common stock , options and restricted stock units , the enterprise value of the deal totals $ 13.9 billion .
The deal closed last month .
Hewlett - Packard said the vast majority of the cuts would focus on eliminating overlapping jobs at EDS in corporate functions such as legal , accounting , information technology and human resources , as well as excess office space .
Work - force reduction plans will vary by country , based on local legal requirements and consultation with works councils and employee representatives , HP said .
If you find yourself spending way too much time trying to locate frequently - used Microsoft Office commands through its newly designed interface , this program is for you .
It reintroduces the toolbars found in previous versions of Office .
During the installation process for Classic Menu for Office 2007 , you have the option of selecting which of the MS Office programs you want to apply its changes to .
The program does n't dramatically change the interface .
For MS Word and Excel , it simply added an extra Menu tab that contained all of the old toolbars from previous versions .
If you want to remove all traces of the new interface , the program features a manager that lets you hide the other tabs .
We clicked through each one and they worked exactly as expected .
The program is n't free , but we were unable to locate any kind of trial period .
It may be there , but the program does n't make a point of advertising it .
In terms of help , the manager provides two links that take you to the publisher 's main Web page and to a support page .
Obviously , if you have access to an older version of MS Office , we recommend you go back to that version .
But if you 're stuck using Office 2007 and find yourself reminiscing of the older toolbar - style user interface , we highly recommend this program for you .
Of course , he never really said that , but after a year of repetition from a brain - dead political media , amplified by late - night comics looking for punchlines about two pretty dull - seeming candidates in 2000 , you'd be hard pressed to find a voter in November 2000 who did n't think Gore had really said that .
It was one of a number of exaggerations and outright falsehoods that became running jokes about Gore in 2000 , that he 'd claimed cleaning up Love Canal , etc .
It was a joke , perhaps , but Gore 's credibility became a " serious " issue for enough voters that Gore lost Florida by a few hundred votes , lost the Electoral College , and George W. Bush became president .

Tetrapods , the first four - legged land animals , have also been considered the first organisms that had fingers and toes but researchers at Uppsala University say that is not the case .
Using medical x-rays , they found rudiments of fingers in the fins in fossil Panderichthys , the “ transitional animal , ” which indicates that rudimentary fingers developed considerably earlier than was previously thought .
Our fish ancestors evolved into the first four - legged animals , tetrapods , 380 million years ago .
They are the forerunners of all birds , mammals , crustaceans , and batrachians ( Editor - and reptiles !
We have the most eagle - eyed readers anywhere . )
Since limbs and their fingers are so important to evolution , researchers have long wondered whether they appeared for the first time in tetrapods or whether they had evolved from elements that already existed in their fish ancestors .
When they examined genes that are necessary for the evolution of fins in zebrafish ( a ray - finned fish that is a distant relative of coelacanth fishes ) and compared them with the gene that regulates the development of limbs in mice , researchers found that zebrafish lacked the genetic mechanisms that are necessary for the development of fingers .
It was therefore concluded that fingers appeared for the first time in tetrapods .
This reading was supported by the circumstance that the fossil Panderichthys , a “ transitional animal ” between fish and tetrapod , appeared to lack finger rudiments in their fins .
In a new study , published in Nature , medical x-rays ( CT scans ) were used to reconstruct a three - dimensional image of Panderichthys fins .
The results show hitherto undiscovered elements that constitute rudiments of fingers in the fins .
Similar rudiments have been demonstrated once in the past , two years ago in Tiktaaliks , which is a more tetrapod - like group .
Together with information about fin development in sharks , paddlefish , and Australian lungfish , the scientists can now definitively conclude that fingers were not something new in tetrapods .
“ This was the key piece of the puzzle that confirms that rudimentary fingers were already present in ancestors of tetrapods , ” says Catherine Boisvert .
You remember the transmitter controversy , regarding the alleged bump under Bush 's jacket and the rumor that Bush -- like a pod person -- was receiving his debate answers directly from Rove ?
Watching the RNC on TV , you quickly get the feeling -- especially when it comes to Sarah Palin -- that maybe everybody in that convention is also wearing the transmitter , so uniform are the talking points .
It 's for that reason Todd Heisler 's photo last evening of the Bush tele - speech managed to effectively distill the whole situation down to one shot .
I mean , it 's all there :
The " cowboy " party .
The " white " party .
The " everything 's black - and - white " party .
The " shifted over to the right " party .
The " pretend Bush is relevant " party , and the " pretend Bush did n't have time to show up in person " party .
Given that McCain did n't want Bush here in the first place , it was also a fitting farewell for a photo - op Presidency .

In so doing they have accomplished at least a part of the dream that Jaron Lanier , a computer scientist and musician , and David Sulzer , a biologist at Columbia , enunciated in 1999 .
To create the ultimate time capsule as part of the millennium festivities at this newspaper , they proposed to encode a year ’s worth of the New York Times magazine into the junk DNA of a cockroach .
“ The archival cockroach will be a robust repository , ” Mr. Lanier wrote , “ able to survive almost all conceivable scenarios . ”
If cockroaches can be archives , why not us ?
The human genome , for example , consists of some 2.9 billion of those letters — the equivalent of about 750 megabytes of data — but only about 3 percent of it goes into composing the 22,000 or so genes that make us what we are .
The remaining 97 percent , so - called junk DNA , looks like gibberish .
It ’s the dark matter of inner space .
We do n’t know what it is saying to or about us , but within that sea of megabytes there is plenty of room for the imagination to roam , for trademark labels and much more .
The King James Bible , to pick one obvious example , only amounts to about five megabytes .
Inevitably , if you are me , you begin to wonder if there is already something written in the warm wet archive , whether or not some Slartibartfast has already been here and we ourselves are walking around with little trademark tags or more wriggling and squiggling and folded inside us .
Gill Bejerano , a geneticist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , who mentioned Slartibartfast to me , pointed out that the problem with raising this question is that people who look will see messages in the genome even if they are n’t there — the way people have claimed in recent years to have found secret codes in the Bible .
Nevertheless , no less a personage than Francis Crick , the co-discoverer of the double helix , writing with the chemist Leslie Orgel , now at the Salk Institute in San Diego , suggested in 1973 that the primitive Earth was infected with DNA broadcast through space by an alien species .
Julius von Bismarck 's ' Image Fulgurator ' projects stealth images into the photographs of strangers , while keeping those images invisible to human eyes .
Depending on whom you ask , it 's either a clever hack or an obnoxious intrusion .
Naturally , we had to find out more .
Yesterday , von Bismarck 's device made its premature debut on the internet .
Today we met him in his hometown , Berlin , to talk about the device , the thinking behind it and the inevitable deluge of e-mails from viral marketers wanting use it to smash their way further into our brains .
But first , about that name : According to von Bismarck , ' Image Fulgurator ' comes from the Latin for ' lightning ' ( fulgur ) and means ' Flash Thrower ' .
First , let us make clear that von Bismarck has applied for a patent for the Fulgurator .
He stressed this point .
Of course , anyone with the requisite skills can make one of their own , but Julius wants to keep some degree of control over commercial use .
To see why , consider how it works .
The device is a modified camera – in this case , an old manual Minolta SLR .
A flashgun fires through the camera in reverse , from the back .
The flash picks up the image of a slide inside and projects it out through the lens and onto any surface .
The trick is in the triggering .
The Fulgurator lies in wait until an unsuspecting photographer takes a picture using a flash .
When the device 's sensor sees this flash , it fires its own unit , throwing up an image which is captured by the hapless photographer 's camera while remaining unseen by the naked eye .
Now , imagine for a moment that an ad agency gets hold of this .
You could n't take a photograph of a tourist attraction ever again without worrying that some marketing crap would be pushed into your camera .
As Julius told me , " I see it as a piece of media art .
It could be a dangerous attack on media .
[ But ] if people do shit with it , I feel bad . "
This is the reason for the patent , and although he does n't have an army of lawyers behind him , Julius seems to be on top of the legal side of things .
He 's also moving fast .
This Fulgurator is the first prototype , and the most primitive .
" It works , but it 's not practical , " he says .
" In a few years time , huge companies will use it for shit , " but by then , Julius will be at the next stage .
He already has more working models ( which I was n't allowed to see ) which are refinements of this one .
At its simplest , the Fulgurator is a very easy hack .
A hole has been cut in the back of the camera and a piece of clear , roughened acrylic put in its place .
A rear tube allows the flashgun to slide in .
Everything else remains intact .
The slides themselves are just rolls of processed film ( the pictures are snapped from Julius ' computer monitor ) returned to their canisters and then loaded up as if a normal film .
Any image on the reel can be selected by turning the rewind crank .
When you hold the Fulgurator up , you can see the subject on the acrylic screen and line it with the image on the slide .
You can also focus , to ensure the final projection ends up sharp .
But the magic happens inside the flash sensor on the top .
Ordinary slave flashes ( which fire whenever they detect another flash going off ) are n't reliable enough , so von Bismarck built his own circuitry .
The original was based on the Arduino platform but has evolved into a custom - made circuit .
The knobs were for tweaking the settings on the prototype , stuff which is all now taken care of by software .
Julius had ripped the guts out of the box for a newer version , so we could n't see it in action , but we know what it does .
Modern digicams flash for all kinds of reasons , such as red - eye reduction and focus assistance .
What Julius ' circuit does is to ignore all of these false strobes and fire only when the photo itself is taken .
This is the secret sauce of the Fulgurator .
Clearly , this is a prankster 's dream .
But Julius thinks it has a serious side , too , which is why it looks like a gun .
" It 's important that people know it 's not just a funny idea , " he told me , " it can also do negative stuff . "
It seems that the " negative stuff " consists mainly of pissing people off , like the aforementioned marketing uses .
We 're looking forward to seeing what the next gen hardware can do , though .
Take a look at this picture :
The message is ' Fulgurated ' onto a black laptop bag .
Turning black to white is powerful stuff , but it 's not just slogans that can be fired .
Although Julius frames his nerdery in an artistic context ( he 's studying a German Diploma called " Digital Class " at UDK , Berlin 's art school ) he clearly has a soft spot for tomfoolery .
In the image below , you see an image of a naked body which can be projected onto a clothed person .
The possibilities are endless , but Julius is just getting started .
When I suggested that he put his own URL on the images , so victims could later check to see just what had happened to their pictures , he seemed surprised ( later I learned that he does plan to include it later , to promote his own work ) .
In fact , the whole thing has happened a little too quickly .
Yesterday's ' leak ' onto the internet was intended as a place holder for an entry into Ars Electronica 's Cyber Arts exhibition in September .
Instead , it catapulted him into internet fame and he has already received high - priced offers for his work .
If he manages to keep on top of things , this little hack could make him some big money .

Reasons to Love Python
I 've been dabbling in C# recently , and I 'm afraid I like it .
As statically typed languages go it's a good one .
However , on coming back to Python I remember how much I like it .
It is not just that it is dynamically typed , but it is all the language features that make it concise and expressive .
A programming language is a medium of expression .
— Paul Graham
Here are a few of my favourites ( in no particular order ) :
Generator Expressions
Python generators are very cool , and have been around since Python 2.2 ( 2002 ) .
They behave very similarly to the Yield Return introduced in C# 2.0 in 2005 .
Also in Python 2.2 were list comprehensions ( similar to LINQ over objects introduced in . NET 3.5 in 2007 ) that allow you to combine a loop and filter in a single expression :
result = [ f ( value ) for value in iterable if value > 0 ]
The expression in the square brackets is evaluated immediately and is identical to :
result = [ ]
for value in iterable :
if value >
0 :
result .
append ( f ( value ) )
Python 2.4 ( 2004 ) introduced a novel extension to list comprehensions : generator expressions .
Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions , but instead of square brackets they use parentheses .
generator = ( f ( value ) for value in iterable if value > 0 )
The major difference is that instead of being evaluated eagerly they are evaluated lazily .
The generator expression returns a generator object that is not executed until you consume it by iterating over it .
This means they can be more memory efficient as you can consume individual items from the generator without creating the whole list up front .
One side effect is that they look nicer as the arguments to a function that takes an iterable :
sum ( f ( value ) for value in iterable if value > 0 )
Generators are naturally first class objects that you can pass around your code .
David Beazley has an excellent set of slides on using generators for systems programming ( and will be giving a tutorial on them at PyCon UK ) : Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers
One of the examples he gives is a pipeline of generator expressions for parsing Apache log files and summing the amount of data served :
wwwlog = open ( " access-log " )
bytecolumn = ( line .
rsplit ( None , 1 ) [ 1 ] for line in wwwlog )
bytes = ( int ( x ) for x in bytecolumn if x != '-' )
print " Total " , sum ( bytes )
None of the generators are consumed until the final call to sum .
As it iterates a line at a time ( not keeping the log file in memory ) it can handle huge log files - and as a bonus it runs faster than a typical solution with loops !
Everything is an Object
Everything in Python is an object ( even None ) - functions , classes , methods and modules are all first class objects .
This allows for wonderful programming techniques including higher order functions , factory functions ( for classes and functions ) , creating modules at runtime from databases , meta - programming and so on .
It makes testing massively easier and is particularly useful when combined with Python 's powerful introspection ( inspect any object at runtime to determine its capabilities ) .
Tuples , Tuple Unpacking and Multiple Return Values
Tuples are one of the built - in container types .
Although experts may ' decry ' the description , they are effectively immutable lists .
The syntax is straightforward : ( 1 , 2 ) is a tuple containing two numbers .
They can be indexed or iterated over like lists and are a fantastic way of grouping values where otherwise you might create a custom class just to hold a pair of values !
They are not unlike the new anonymous types that were introduced along with LINQ in C# - but those you can only use inside the scope where you create them .
Tuples in Python turn up implicitly in a few places , and one of these is where a function or method returns multiple values :
def function ( a , b ) :
return a * b , a - b
The return value from function is a tuple of two values .
Being able to return multiple values is enormously useful - especially if you use it with tuple unpacking .
Python can ' unpack ' tuples in assignment statements :
product , difference = function ( a , b )
It is fair to say that out parameters are only needed in C# because it can't return multiple values ( again the alternative is creating a custom class and returning an instance of that instead ) .
You can also unpack tuples into function calls :
parameters = ( a , b )
product , difference = function ( * parameters )
And the converse is collecting all positional arguments into a tuple ( similar to the C# params method signature ) :
def function ( * args ) :
a , b = args
return a * b , a - b
Keyword Arguments
Another small language feature , but invaluable for creating flexible and usable APIs : keyword arguments with default values .
def function ( arg1 = 3 , arg2 = None , arg3 = ' fish ' ) :
. . .
function ( arg1 = 2 )
function ( arg1 = 2 , arg3 = ' nothing ' )
function ( 2 , None , ' something ' )
Arguments with default values can be called positionally ( as normal ) or by keyword .
This allows you to call a function or method only overriding values that differ from the default .
In fact it is so useful that support for it has been built into IronPython for working with .NET objects .
Keyword arguments used in a constructor are the equivalent to constructing the instance and then setting properties afterwards :
form = Form ( Text = " Form Title " )
Decorators
One consequence of first class functions is that ' wrapping ' functions ( one example of higher order functions ) becomes possible .
Decorators were introduced to provide a convenient syntax for doing that .
I did n't follow the debate as I was n't interested in the feature and I did n't think I would use it .
I was wrong - they turn out to be massively convenient for all sorts of things .
A simple example of wrapping a function ( without decorator syntax ) for exception handling and logging :
def wrapper ( function ) :
def inner ( * args , ** keywargs ) :
try :
return function ( * args , ** keywargs )
except Exception , e :
logger .
log ( " Exception occurred in function ' %s ' : %s " %
( function .
__name__ , e ) )
return inner
wrapped = wrapper ( function )
The wrapper function takes a function as an argument .
It defines an inner function that calls the original function ( keeping a reference to it through a closure ) with exception handling and logging .
It returns the inner function that can be used in the place of the original .
( The *args , ** keywargs syntax captures all the positional and keyword arguments that inner is called with and calls function with the same arguments . )
Having created the wrapper function we can actually do the wrapping with the decorator syntax :
@ wrapper
def function ( a , b ) :
. . .
We use this all the time at Resolver Systems - for profiling , mocking out names and ' auto - unmocking ' them within the scope of a single function , invoking methods onto control threads and so on .
The Interactive Interpreter
No discussion of useful Python features can be complete without a mention of Python 's REPL ; the interactive interpreter .
You can explore new libraries or check out language features in a matter of seconds .
You can even do real work from it - Tim Golden ( a Python DBA and WMI guru ) says that when working with databases he often uses the interactive interpreter and " slurp the data in , transform it , push it back out and walk away " .
I 've saved the most important ( and most controversial ) two for almost last :
Explicit Self
Explicit self certainly stirs up some debates .
I like it - it makes Python scoping very explicit .
When declaring an instance method in a class body , you declare the instance as the first argument to be passed in to the method - and by convention you name this argument self .
class SomeClass ( object ) :
def instance_method ( self , arg1 , arg2 ) :
. . .
The useful thing about this is that you can see at a glance which instance attributes your method is using - they are all prefixed with self .
It also makes calling up to base class methods straightforward and consistent without requiring additional syntax :
class SomeClass ( BaseClass ) :
def instance_method ( self , arg1 , arg2 ) :
BaseClass .
instance_method ( self , arg1 , arg2 )
Of course if you really can't cope with the explicit self then you can always use my Selfless Metaclass that uses bytecode hackery to remove the need to declare it .
Indentation Based Block Structure
Some people really do n't like this , which to be honest baffles me a bit .
Here 's what I wrote for the Why Separate Sections by Indentation Instead of by Brackets or End question on the Python wiki :
In order to separate blocks of code ( like for loops , if blocks and function definitions ) the compiler / interpreter needs something to tell it when a block ends .
Curly braces and end statements are perfectly valid ways of providing this information for the compiler .
For a human to be able to read the code indentation is a much better way of providing the visual cues about block structure .
As indentation also contains all the information for the compiler , to use both would be redundant .
As indentation is better for humans , it makes sense to use that for the compiler too .
It has the advantage that Python programs tend to be uniformly and consistently indented , removing one hurdle to understanding other people 's code .
Python does not mandate how you indent ( two spaces or four , tabs or spaces - but not both ) , just that you do it consistently .
Those that get used to the Python way of doing things tend to start seeing curly braces as unnecessary line noise that clutters code .
On the other hand , ' the whitespace thing ' is possibly the single biggest reason why some developers refuse to even try Python .
Interesting to note that both Haskell and F# also allow you to delimit block structure by indentation ( plus Python influenced languages like Boo and Cobra ) .
I have n't even mentioned language features that come as a consequence of being a dynamically typed language : duck typing ( protocols instead of interfaces ) , heterogeneous container types ( no need for generics ) and many more ...
PyCon UK : IronPython Tutorial , Socials and Volunteers Needed
The PyCon UK conference ( national UK Python conference ) draws inexorably nearer - just over a week to go now .
We 've currently got over 200 people registered and about 80 for the tutorials so it should be a great conference .
If you 're coming , do n't forget to register for the social events on the Thursday and Friday evenings :
Today Christian , Menno and I have been working on our IronPython Tutorial .
The handout notes and example code are basically done , just a little polishing off to do .
The tutorial is based around a simple Twitter client , which Menno has named Twatter !
We 've been testing Twatter on Windows , Linux and the Mac ( it does n't look bad on the Mac ) .
At each step we will be introducing a new topic and explain the principles .
We 'll give the attendees the skeleton of the code and then assist you to add new functionality .
It is a very simple application , but we will manage to cover topics including ( all using . NET APIs from IronPython ) :
Windows Forms
Databases
Web services and network access
Handling XML
Threading
Preparations for the conference itself are going well .
We have great sponsorship this year from quite a few companies .
Resolver Systems is paying for the drinks on the Saturday night dinner !
What we still need is more volunteers to help with the practical arrangements .
We particularly need volunteer Session Chairs who will introduce the speakers and make sure they finish on time !
We also need help putting up the signs on the Thursday and Friday .
If you can help please sign up on the volunteer wiki pages or email us using the address from the main PyCon UK website .

Red Cross finds Bush administration guilty of war crimes Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday July 12 , 2008

In a secret report last year , the Red Cross found evidence of the CIA using torture on prisoners that would make the Bush administration guilty of war crimes , The New York Times reported Friday .
The Red Cross determined the culpability of the Bush administration after interviewing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , according to the article .
Prisoner Abu Zubaydahwho said he had been waterboarded , " slammed against the walls " and confined in boxes " so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position . "
The information comes from a new book written by Jane Meyer , who has frequently published articles concerning counter - terrorism in The New Yorker .
The book is titled " The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals , " and will be released next week .
Mayer cited " sources familiar with the report " to explain the confidential document as a warning " that the abuse constituted war crimes , placing the highest officials in the U.S. government in jeopardy of being prosecuted . "
The report was submitted to CIA last year and concluded that American interrogation methods are " categorically " torture that violates both domestic and international law , MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow reported Friday .
Although the CIA had already admitted to the use of waterboarding , Meyer says in the book that several CIA officers confirm the findings of the Red Cross , including the other forms of torture mentioned .
Maddow called George W. Bush a " torture - approver - in - chief who has yet to be held to account for anything " and said that congressman Dennis Kucinich had reintroduced his articles of impeachment against the president .
Maddow questioned constitutional law expert Johnathan Turley about the development .
" The problem for the bush admin is that they perfected plausible deniability techniques , " Turley said .
" They bring out one or two people that are willing to debate on cable shows whether waterboarding is torture and it leaves the impression that its a closed question .
" It 's not .
It 's just like the domestic surveillance program that the federal court said just a week ago was also not just a closed question . "
When asked by Maddow if the chances are now greater that Bush will be prosecuted now or after leaving office by the international community , Turley compared the situation to Serbia in the early 90s .
" I 'd never thought I would say this , but I think it might in fact be time for the United States to be held internationally to a tribunal .
I never thought in my lifetime I would say that . "
WASILLA , Alaska ( CNN ) --
The sports complex that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's supporters call her most visible legacy as mayor of her hometown left the town paying inflated prices for the land and huge legal bills , according to court records .
Sarah Palin , Wasilla , Alaska 's former mayor , is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for .
The complex features a soccer field , a running track and an indoor hockey rink with heated seats .
Palin campaigned for a sales tax increase to finance the $ 14.7 million project , winning approval for the half - cent levy by a margin of 20 votes .
Palin is now the Republican nominee for vice president .
Her supporters call the arena the crowning achievement of her 1996 - 2002 tenure as mayor .
" She really was very , very passionate about this right from the start , " Wasilla Recreation Manager Bruce Urban said .
But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year , after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren , who owned part of the land on which the complex sits .
Watch more on the controversy »
" When they started building , the title to the land was in my name , " said Lundgren , who now lives in Panama .
Diane Woodruff , a City Council member and longtime Palin critic , said that has left Palin 's major campaign pitch -- to be a fiscally conservative reformer -- in question .

" She inherited the city with no debt , and suddenly we have a lot of debt , " she said .

In 1999 , the Nature Conservancy was negotiating to sell the land to the city and Lundgren , but he says that although he signed a purchase agreement with the group , the city did not .
Lundgren purchased 325 acres from the Nature Conservancy , but the city filed a lawsuit claiming ownership of land it believed it owned .
In 2002 , a federal court sided with Lundgren , finding that the city had never signed the proper papers .
But by then , the 80 - acre complex was under construction ; Palin gave the go - ahead to begin while the issue was still in court .
After Palin left office , the city sought to obtain the tract it needed for the sports complex through eminent domain , leading to another court battle .
" I 'm curious as to why somebody in the previous administration did n't make sure that we had clear title before we started building , because certainly once we started building , we were over a barrel , " Woodruff said .
Wasilla eventually agreed to pay Lundgren more than $ 800,000 for the land , along with Lundgren 's legal fees and interest : another $ 700,000 .
Lundgren said he offered to give the city a 20 - acre parcel to avoid further lawsuits , but city officials turned him down .
" They said they needed more than 20 acres , " he said .
" They had additional plans to build a softball field . "
Attorney Kenneth Jacobus , who represented the city , said he had no recollection of an acceptable offer from Lundgren .
The city originally paid $ 145,000 for part of the land .
The rest of it was valued at about $ 21,000 .
It ended up paying more than $ 1.5 million , not counting its own legal fees .
Palin 's successor as mayor , Diane Keller , said the project has brought in more than $ 3 million in revenue for local businesses .
" I think this was a community dream .
It may have been a part of Sarah Palin 's dream , but it was n't only her dream , " Keller said .
The complex is getting a lot of use , but it is not breaking even .
Its operating costs are about $ 900,000 a year , Urban said , and city records show that the city has to pay about $ 100,000 of that .
And Lundgren is still appealing the eminent domain case before Alaska 's supreme court , arguing that Wasilla did n't meet the legal requirements for taking the land .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- " Dark Knight " star Christian Bale has denied allegations by his mother and sister that he assaulted them , and he is cooperating with police , Bale 's publicists said Tuesday .
Christian Bale leaves a central London police station after being arrested and questioned by police .
Bale has not been charged with any crime , his publicists said .
" Christian Bale attended a London police station today , on a voluntary basis , in order to assist with an allegation that had been made against him to the police by his mother and sister , " the statement said .
British media reported that police questioned Bale over an allegation that he assaulted his mother and sister at a London hotel a day before the European premiere of " The Dark Knight . "
Asked about the reports , a spokeswoman for London 's Metropolitan Police said a 34 - year - old man was arrested in connection with an allegation of assault but would not divulge his name .
The statement from Bale 's publicists did not say whether an arrest had been made .
" Mr. Bale , who denies the allegation , cooperated throughout , gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police , " it said .
Bale would have no further comment , the statement said .
A records check turned up no criminal record for Bale in Los Angeles , according to The Associated Press .
A woman believed to be Bale 's sister Sharon said " it 's a family matter " from her home in Corfe Mullen , 110 miles southwest of London , according to the AP .
A man who answered the door at the home of his mother , Jenny Bale , in nearby Bournemouth said she did not want to comment , the AP reported .
Bale is in London after the British premiere of " The Dark Knight , " the latest Batman movie and a Warner Brothers film .
Warner Brothers is owned by Time Warner , also the parent company of CNN .
Bale plays Bruce Wayne / Batman in " The Dark Knight , " which co-stars the late Heath Ledger as the Joker .

The film cashed - in with a record - breaking $ 158.4 million at the box office in its opening weekend .
Bale reprised the role of Gotham 's superhero , which he played in " Batman Begins . "
All About Christian Bale • Criminal Assault
A brief history of the past decade .
Mood stabilizers were initially limited to lithium , valproate , the combination of lithium and valproate , or carbamazepine .
In 2004 , the protocol was amended to define mood stabilizers operationally as any FDA - approved antimanic agent .
A mood stabilizer is a drug that prevents mania and / or depression .
Depakote was the default mood stabilizer since 2000 .
Hundreds of papers promoted its use , though all relied on a single double blind , placebo controlled trial as support for its efficacy .
Mentioned almost no where was that this trial did not show any superiority over placebo .
However , Depakote enjoyed tremendous sales in the years 2000 - 2008 , showing 10 - 20 % growth per year .
Since the academics have no relationship with Abbott and are motivated only by clinical efficacy , we can expect their promotion of Depakote to continue even after it goes generic .
Oh , wait , that happens in 2008 .
Here 's a quick summary of the ( only ) Depakote vs. placebo for maintenance study : manic patients were enrolled , put on Depakote + any other necessary meds until they were stabilized .
Then these patients were randomized to Depakote , lithium or placebo .
At the end of the study , all three groups had similar relapse rates .
Putting them on Depakote was not better than placebo for maintenance .
On this single , failed trial , an entire decade of psychiatry was premised .
However , there is one technical point that I have never , not once , in 8 years , seen written about , discussed , or even alluded to , and when you do bring it up people look at you blankly : the study patients were stabilized on meds , then randomized to drug or placebo .
So those that were randomized to placeboSo actually , being on Depakote was not simply no better than placebo , it was no better thanTake a long hard look at yourselves .
Depakote continued to be grow , continued to be a " mood stabilizer " when it was really simply an acute antimanic .
NB : it may be true that Depakote is a tremendous mood stabilizer ; you can't condemn the drug on one study .
But , importantly , in the decade of " Evidence Based Medicine " why was it at the top of every treatment algorithm and guideline ?
There 's the rub .
But psychiatrists did not use it as a monotherapy mood stabilizer -- it was always " mood stabilizer " plus something else .
In fact , the major discussions in psychiatry 2001 - 2007 were whether / how additional medications would benefit when used with Depakote .
No one asked whether Depakote itself was a mood stabilzier -- that was assumed .
The question was whether adding antipsychotics to Depakote provided additional benefit .
The answer was always " yes " as long as the question had the caveat , " notwithstanding details or generalizability .
" Consider the study of Depakote alone , or Depakote + Risperdal , for the treatment of acute mania .
Which is better ?
The graph is clear : the combination is better than the single drug alone .
BTW , every atypical antipsychotic has a similar study with nearly identical results .
Two sleights of hand : 1 . This is a study of acute mania - - 3 weeks -- not maintenance .
The study does not say that Depakote +
Risperdal will provide better maintenance control over a year .
Yet that is how the results were generalized -- psychiatrists left their patients on " whatever " broke their mania .
You can see how , over time , doses and number of meds keep going up .
2 .
See the y - axis ?
It does n't say " amount of improvement , " it says " percent of patients . "
It does n't say that each person got more better , it says more people responded to two drugs than responded to one drug .
We assume the superiority was the result of the combination .
But how do you know it was n't due entirely to the Risperdal ?
If you give a room full of manics Depakote , 25 % get better .
If you give a room full of manics Risperdal , 25 % get better .
If you gave both to everyone , then 50 % would get better , but it 's pretty clear that the Depakote responders did n't need Risperdal , and the Risperdal responders did n't need Depakote .
Indeed , when you look at change of symptom severity , two meds was no better than more of one med
This chart could simply be the result blasting patients with two drugs , hoping one works .
So this does n't say " if a drug fails , add a second . "
It says , " if a drug fails , switch to something else .
" Which should have been so obvious as to never have necessitated a study .
At some point , someone is going to notice that polypharmacy is n't working as promised ; that it is not particularly safe ; and that it certainly is n't worth the price .
And Depakote was going off patent .
What to do ?
What you do is write a completely unimpressive , pointless article ( based on a multimillion dollar government finded study that tells us nothing we did n't already know for decades , in the most prestigious medical journal ( NEJM ) available , and in it sneakily and gigantically change the definitions of words to prepare for the next wave of psychopharmacology , granting plausible deniability .
Now , in two sentences , all the junk articles that used to apply only to Depakote can now be reused to apply to antipsychotics .
" We 've known since 2001 that mood stabilizers , for example Depakote , are maintenance agents ...
" At first glance , the question seems reasonable , but for the fact that the none of the capitalized words above have any meaning at all , except those with three or less letters .
Seroquel for maintenance bipolar .
Why not , ?
Why would it be any worse than Depakote , a drug which did n't work anyway ?
The problem , however , is that by pushing Depakote as a maintenance agent for so long , everything is reflexively considered second line , an add - on .
So because of the artifice , the semiotics , " bipolar requires mood stabilizers ; Depakote is a mood stabilizer ; bipolar needs Depakote " you can't do a Seroquel monotherapy study .
It has to be done as an adjunct to Depakote or lithium .
The results are , indeed , impressive : people on both Seroquel and Depakote had fewer , and later , relapses than those on Depakote alone .
This holds true whether you are looking at relapses into depression , mania , or all mood episodes .
So , for example , by 52 weeks , about 25 % of Seroquel + mood stabilizer patients had relapsed , while 62 % of mood stabilizer alone patients had relapsed .
That 's an NNT of roughly 2.5 , i.e. you need to put 2.5 people on Seroquel to reliably know one person benefited .
Lipitor 's NNT for reducing heart attacks is 25 Although you 're not supposed to compare results from different studies , I feel completely comfortable saying that the Depakote curve here is about the same as it was the in other maintenance study , i.e. no better than placebo .
( Stop using Depakote . )
Look back at the Depakote study for a hint .
Patients were all stabilized on Depakote / Li with Seroquel over 36 weeks , and then randomized to either continuing Depakote / Li + Seroquel , or to being taken off Seroquel and being left on Depakote / Li .
Those left on Seroquel did well ; those who had the Seroquel removed did not .
So on the one hand , you could say " the combination prevented relapse , " or , you could say , " abruptly stopping your Seroquel results in a relapse . "
Do you see the difference ?
With the Depakote study , stopping your Depakote had no adverse effect .
For whatever reason , stopping your Seroquel apparently does result in prompt relapse .
You are being tricked ( not on purpose ) by the presence of the Depakote , thinking that this is providing you some degree of mood stabilization , and the Seroquel is adding to it .
Wrong .
The Depakote is providing you nothing .
The Seroquelthe mood stabilizer .
And " stopping your meds " is , after all , not a good idea .
There is one other important result of this study .
The patients were not simply on Seroquel ; they were on Seroquel at fluctuating doses , per the judgment of the doctor , 400 mg to 800 mg .
That is key .
Seroquel did n't prevent relapse ; rather , raising the dose whenever they needed it , and possibly lowering it when they did n't , is what kept them stable .
Maybe if they were on a fixed dose of Seroquel the whole time , no opportunity to raise the dose , people would have relapsed more frequently .
But this way , at the first sign of trouble , you pre-empt it by increasing the dose .
In other words , Seroquel did n't prevent relapse ; prompt intervention by the doctor as things developed ( using Seroquel ) prevented the relapse .
This does n't diminish the utility of Seroquel , but it also does n't mean you can put everyone on 600 mg and say , " see you in a year .
" That is , perhaps , why Depakote failed : it relied on a steady dose , titrated to an imaginarily important blood level that it seems never to have occurred to anyone to ask why we target .
Just as Depakote was an overhyped drug that will thankfully die with its patent , it is more than likely that Seroquel for maintenance bipolar disorder represents some sort of top in the antipsychotic market .
It will enjoy massive , and steady , use for several years , but I doubt if there is much growth left in it .
Astra Zeneca thinks it has penetrated a market ; but it has really opened the doors for all antipsychotics in the same market .
You can prescribe Seroquel ; do n't invest in it .
Simultaneoulsy , just as I was a vocal advocate for the use of antipsychotics over the massive overuse of Depakote -- and I thus contributed to the rise of Seroquel ( and others ) , my new target may be the overuse of antipsychotics .
The target is not Pharma or reps , but academic physicians who are politicians posing as scienticians .
Completely absent is the pursuit of science or truth -- e.g , " we did n't expect this result , I guess we were wrong " -- but diversions and sleight of hand .
The point is not the results ; the point is the discussion .
The message does n't matter , the medium is the message .
They have an allegiance to a given concept , and they defend it , promote it .
No different than a PAC .
And when their King dies , they celebrate as if they never believed in him at all .
But at least the rise of Seroquel will benefit humanity in two important ways .
First , it brings evidentiary support to the not common enough practice of fluctuating the doses as needed , up , rather than relying on a set dose .
Second , it means the demise of polypharmacy ( until they invent a new class of drugs ) , the drastic reduction of the number of medications patients will be prescribed , especially when coupled with the slow demise of SSRIs .
A photographer friend of mine came to Chengdu in June to do a photo essay on a few topics of interest in Sichuan  Gong Fu in Ya An , Hakka in the suburbs of Chengdu , and of course the earthquake that had just devastated much of the province .
At the airport in Beijing , he bought a copy of National Geographic ‘s special on China , " Inside the Dragon . "
The magazine had been censored in a very crude and obvious manner .
Some clerk in the vast bureaucracy had used a black marker to cross out references to the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989 , and several pictures of Mao from the Revolutionary Era were glued together .
I sat in my home with several friends , Chinese and foreign , and we chuckled at the efforts of this clerk .
We drank tea , discussed China ’s politics and society , and slowly pried the pages apart .
There was nothing we did n’t discuss that afternoon .
One of my friends grew up in the 1980s and ’90s ; another is a young girl , born in the late 1980s and barely out of college .
There were no taboo topics , and we all considered ourselves very aware of censorship in China .
The government cannot control informal conversations among friends and does not pretend to try .
The Great Firewall ( all sites need proxies )  which encompasses much more than blocked Internet sites  sets the agenda for the Chinese people .
The agenda places the Party at the very top of the food chain and establishes protocols between the people and their government .
The Firewall is there to frame public and private conversations , not end them .
Censorship here is pervasive .
It blankets all modes of public communication .
Newspapers receive daily bulletins on what is not to be covered ; TV is the mouth of the state .
Advertisements , licenses for magazines , company logos , poetry  basically any piece of writing , any photo or graphic , any symbol must conform to the agenda put forth by the government .
The education system is devoted to indoctrination as much as it is to developing a talented and skilled populace .
This indoctrination program is in part responsible for the wave of protests that swept across the world when the Olympic Torch was violated in Paris and London .
The youth of today are not only fiercely patriotic , but they also lack access to any other perspectives .
They ca n’t help but rage against what they deem to be insidious lies emanating from viscerally anti-China foreigners .
" They hate us because we are Chinese . "
The judiciary is in the firm grip of the Party .
There is no such thing as a trial , let alone a fair trial .
Although the number of lawyers in China is rising exponentially , they are paid very little and advance not for their knowledge of the law , but for the breadth of their connections within the Party .
Music and art in the mainland are also subject to Party approval .
When singer A Mei sang the Taiwanese national anthem some years back , her records were banned on the mainland and she was prohibited from performing at any concerts until she showed the appropriate remorse .
Chinese pop is some of the most contentless music in the world .
No one can dispute that the Party line intrudes on all aspects of public life .
This agenda , this system of though control , is based on a collection of " Nos and Don’ts . "
This and that image is not allowed .
These words and those topics are taboo .
In such a system , that which is allowed becomes a point of contention .
A soft spot .
Herein lies the story : the steady push at the soft belly of the Party line .
Chinese are not ignorant of their government ’s heavyhanded censorship ; it is the clearest thing in the world .
The gray area surrounds that which the Party is ready to accept in the name of stability  for stability is the goal of this Great Firewall .
And it goes much further than just public symbols , speech , and writing .
In the months leading up to the Olympics , the Public Security Bureau ( PSB ) made the rounds , letting everyone know what was expected of them .
The artists of Beijing are jittery when foreigners come through to interview them .
Bar owners are nervous and watchful as the guests pile in .
Petitioners brave enough to come to Beijing seeking redress face jail time and beatings .
Walls block off the unsightly neighborhoods of Beijing in the midst of being " renovated . "
At the various foreign houses 
The Heineken House , the Slovenia House , the Budweiser House  Chinese nationals are only allowed in with an invite .
The government not only restricts access to the Web , it also does not want its people to have unfettered access to large groups of foreigners .
Who knows what crazy exchanges might happen in the Heineken House that might affect the Party ’s grip on the nation ?
Rumors of bombs in Chengdu and Chongqing in recent days made the headlines in Tianya , but those links are now removed .
The nation that cries wolf over terrorism in order to suppress its minorities hides all news of the wolves as they lurk at the front door .
This nation  in which 86 percent of the people profess their confidence and optimism in the path the country is walking , where an economic leap has been made that has no precedent in history , on the eve of its great coming - out party  is run by a government riddled with insecurity .
In the Name of Stability
Chinese President Hu Jintao made his rare address to the world  and the foreign press  for the same reason the Party maintains a vigorous Internet Firewall : stability .
Foreign journalists and readers across the world are outraged by blatant censorship of what they can read or write .
Those who actually believed that the IOC and the Chinese government would all of a sudden release 1,000 white doves into the air and declare the Firewall dissolved got what they deserved : blocked sites , frustration , and confusion .
The same goes for those who actually believed that China could somehow rid the entire Beijing area of all traces of smog .
They should have armed themselves .
The " cooperation " between the IOC and China is  at best  a classic example of the frog and the scorpion .
The scorpion says , hey , let me ride across the river on your back .
The frog reluctantly agrees , and then is stung halfway across .
As they both sink , the scorpion says by way of explanation , " I am a scorpion . "
Perhaps a more accurate description puts the Party and the IOC together in the role of the scorpion , with the international community playing the frog .
President Hu ’s address touched on several subjects besides the Olympics , including China ’s peaceful rise , fears of China ’s expansionism , and the slow , gradual development toward a socialist democracy .
If you take away the novelty of the president actually making an appearance , the speech he gave becomes nothing more than the same , old tired slogans of the Party , repeated a thousand times before .
This time it was the big boss who mouthed " peaceful rise " and " mutual benefit " in front of foreign journalists , days before the opening ceremony .
The speech was meant to address the world ’s ire at being lied to and calm the situation before the Games start  to take the steam out of what is and always has been a media blitz on China ’s negative aspects .
The Party hopes that a fine ceremony , a speech by the president , and the release of a site or two from the grip of the censors will distract people from the truth .
Hu ’s conversation with the journalists is basically the scorpion telling the frog , " Do n’t worry , I ’m reforming . "
But do n’t expect the bugs in your hotel room to go away , do n’t expect the PSB to let all of the " undesirables " back in , and by no means expect the domestic media to change their tune .
Living Under a Blanket
The Chinese are used to being censored , but that does not mean they like it .
The deep nationalist and patriotic sentiments of the Chinese people do lead to anger toward foreign media that seem to harp on all of the bad things , but this has nothing to do with how the people feel about their own government and media .
Everything in China  business , justice , free speech , and politics  operates in a gray area where the law of the land is a Party decree that may be reversed next month then reinstated with a clause two months later .
But gray might not be the right color for it , because this is where all of the living takes place .
All of the dynamics that have wrought China ’s 30 - year rise onto the world ’s stage take place in the greasy , gray area between what the Party can handle and what the individual can get away with .
On the street , I rely on the proverbial " cab driver , " whom I can discuss anything with .
Cabbies here are not only informed , they are passionate .
And by " cabbie " I mean every tea- drinking , cig- smoking , card - playing Chinese out there .
Naturally , we will disagree .
But that ’s the whole point  we ’re not talking about the Chinese being " Western , " but being willing and able to discuss things without whipping out some Party slogan .
These street - side , cab - side , teahouse conversations are what help clarify what is possible for the individual in a society that demands conformity .
These were once sufficient prods at the soft spot within Party doctrine to keep the " reform movement " on track toward eventual " socialist democracy . "
But no longer .
In fact , for years now the Internet has been the tip of the spear in the low - level conflict between individual freedom and national duty .
On the Internet , bloggers can get away with almost anything , do so anonymously , and pop up like a gopher after the state ’s censor clerks remove the original post .
Also , China ’s Internet population is not just huge , it is extremely active .
One hundred thousand people might see a post or story that makes it online for one hour before the censors remove it .
And there is nothing more amazing than a Chinese rumor mill  word travels very fast here , via SMS , family ties , Internet , and word of mouth .
Music and art , although gripped by the Party , are not understood by the vast army of clerks whose job it is to make sure artists and musicians conform to the Party line .
Not only are artists able to use subtle imagery and symbols to get their points across , they also use raw , emotional images to get to that which can never be censored : the gut .
Musicians hold concerts in dingy bars , outdoor arenas , and universities that attract large numbers of young Chinese .
Punk rockers , hip hop kids , trance and house enthusiasts  they all show up to dance the night away and define themselves through their music and dress .
The police are often in attendance , but they are clueless as to what the lyrics , dress code , or code of cool might mean .
They stand next to group of weed - smoking , Zack de la Rocha- quoting , freestyle MCs and help light the joint .
The youth are far ahead of the cops and clerks who are there to control them .
An underground culture flourishes here uncensored because the Party does not speak " underground . "
These young kids are actually following in the footsteps of older , experienced rebels who have been getting their music via satellite since the early 1980s .
The Tiananmen movement was the culmination and climax of an underground scene that exploded onto China after the opening up of 1979 .
The " survivors " did not go away .
They did n’t stop digging on good music and searching for good art , they just got smart about it .
There is a tacit understanding between the people of underground  many of whom have now grown rich by selling their art and movies to the French , Swedish , and Canadian galleries that love them  that as long as the underground does not challenge the political power of the Party , things can remain cool .
As long as the Party feels it is " stable , " then the artists , bloggers , cabbies , and young rebels throwin ’ up rebel graffiti on government - sponsored walls can go about their business .
In fact , letting them do their thing actually helps keep the country stable .
When you imagine China ’s public discussion landscape , do not envision a bland , gray expanse of Party doublespeak .
Instead , think of an endless gopher field with a few guys in suits running around wielding clubs .
For foreigners , not being able to log onto Wikipedia or BBC or some other site that is blocked for the time being might be very inconvenient and sinister .
But in China , not only is the blanket familiar , but everyone has a flashlight on underneath .
Gallup Daily : Obama ’s Lead Now at 4 Points Obama ’s position about halfway between his recent highs and lows
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Tuesday through Thursday finds Barack Obama with a four - percentage - point lead over John McCain in the presidential preferences of registered voters , 48 % to 44 % .
While the difference between today 's result and Thursday 's 49 % to 42 % lead for Obama is not statistically significant , some of the broader shifts seen over the past 10 days , spanning both party 's national conventions , have been meaningful .
Support for Obama since just before the Democratic National Convention kicked off on Aug. 25 has ranged from 44 % to 50 % , while McCain 's support has ranged from 41 % to 46 % .
Whereas the race was initially tied at 45 % , Obama pulled into an eight - point lead at several points over the course of his convention .
It now appears the Republican National Convention may be helping McCain to recoup some of his losses , though with Obama 's current four - point lead , the entire convention period to this point has still been a net plus for Obama .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
While both conventions are now over , measurement of public reaction to them is not .
Results , based on interviewing conducted Sept. 2 - 4 , include just one day of interviewing conducted after Wednesday night 's widely viewed acceptance speech by McCain 's vice presidential running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Most interviewing Thursday night was conducted before McCain 's acceptance speech , so Gallup Poll Daily tracking results will start to reflect its impact in Saturday 's report .
The full impact of the GOP convention on voter preferences will not be known until Monday 's report , the first in which all interviews will have been conducted following the convention 's conclusion .
( Click here to see how the race currently breaks down by demographic subgroup . )
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general election results are based on combined data from Sept. 2 - 4 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,779 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

CoRoT exoplanet stands out from the crowd
28 July 2008
This has been reported at the Cool Stars 15 meeting at St Andrews University , Scotland and in two papers , Aigrain et al ( 2008 ) and Moutou et al ( 2008 ) , which have been accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters .
The parent star , CoRoT - Exo - 4 , was observed during the initial run of CoRoT which began on 6 February 2007 and continued for 58 days .
During this period the spacecraft monitored a 1.3° by 2.6° region of the sky close to the anticentre of the Galaxy ( 180° away from the Galactic centre ) .
Lightcurves for all objects observed during this run were processed and analysed for evidence of transits .
Evidence for transits
CoRoT - Exo - 4 was one of a number of stars which showed evidence for a transiting body ( see Figure 1 ) .
Analysis of the light curve data allowed Suzanne Aigrain and collaborators to determine a number of parameters for the system including an orbital period of 9.20205 ± 0.00037 days for the transiting object , designated CoRoT - Exo - 4b .
This is one of the longest periods measured for any transiting planet to date .
Confirmation of the planetary nature of the object
In an accompanying paper Clare Moutou and collaborators report on a series of complementary ground - based observations (*) which were performed to establish the planetary nature of the transiting body and to provide some basic parameters of the exoplanet and its parent star .
They confirm that the parent star is a Sun - like star ( late F - type with a mass of 1.16 solar masses and a radius of 1.17 solar radii ) .
The exoplanet is a gas - giant planet which occupies a previously empty region of the mass - period diagram of transiting planets ( see Figure 3 ) .
In addition to the periodic dips in the CoRoT - Exo - 4 light curve which are associated with planetary transits the light was also seen to vary in a manner typical of a rotating , spotted photosphere .
Auto - correlation methods were applied to the light curve to deduce a rotation period for the star of 8.87 ± 1.12 days .
Planet and Star rotate in sync
Given the similarity between the orbital period of the exoplanet ( 9.20205 ± 0.00037 days ) and the rotation period of the star ( 8.87 ± 1.12 days ) it appears as if the star rotates in sync with the planet 's orbit .
This is unusual especially since the mass and distance from the star seem to preclude any direct effect from the planet on the rotation of the parent star .
Aigrain and collaborators note that the similarity is consistent with a scenario where the planet 's migration was halted at the inner edge of a circumstellar disk which was truncated close to the corotation radius .
Further detailed analysis is required before any firm conclusions can be drawn on the origin of the synchronised rotation .

The outbreak of war in Georgia on Friday offers a disturbing and somewhat surreal taste of what to expect from John McCain should he become our nation ’s Commander in Chief .
As the centuries - old ethnic animosities between Georgia and Ossetia boiled over into another armed conflict , drawing in neighboring Russia , McCain issued a stark - raving statement from Des Moines that is disturbingly reminiscent of the language used in the lead - up to NATO ’s war against Yugoslavia in 1999 , a war McCain zealously pushed for :
“ We should immediately call a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to assess Georgia ’s security and review measures NATO can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation , ” McCain said .
Calling on NATO to “ stabilize this dangerous situation ” is not going down well with Russia , where images of dead Russian peacekeepers and of frightened Ossetian refugees streaming across its borders have put the country in a very vengeful mood .
It ’s hard to imagine what measures NATO could take under a McCain presidency , but in the mind of a man who thinks US troops should stay in Iraq for 100 years , and who runs around singing “ Bomb Bomb Iran ! ” it ’s not hard to guess–and even harder not to be horrified by what it may mean come January 2009 , should he win .
McCain ’s call to NATO - ize the war is not only frightening , it ’s also delusional : both NATO and US forces are already stretched beyond the breaking point , even by Joint Chief of Staff chairman Michael Millen ’s own recent assessment .
But McCain ’s brain remains undeterred by reality , a fact that became painfully clear today in Des Moines when he also demanded , “ The US should immediately convene an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to call on Russia to reverse course . ”
The problem with McCain ’s bold demand about going to the UN is that Russia already tried doing exactly what McCain called for–and got rejected by McCain ’s neocon pals in the Bush Administration .
Early this morning , Russia convened an emergency session of the UN Security Council , calling on both sides to immediately cease hostilities , return to the negotiating table and renounce the use of force–but the last part about renouncing the use of force is exactly what Georgia ’s president Mikhail Saakashvili refuses to do .
The Bush Administration showed that it too has no patience with crunchy “ renounce the use of force ” resolutions .
According to a Reuters report from earlier in the day :
At the request of Russia , the U.N. Security Council held an emergency session in New York but failed to reach consensus early Friday on a Russian - drafted statement .
The council concluded it was at a stalemate after the United States , Britain and some other members backed the Georgians in rejecting a phrase in the three - sentence draft statement that would have required both sides “ to renounce the use of force , ” council diplomats said .
The meaning of this is clear : the United States and Britain are backing Saakashvili ’s invasion .
Why would we back Saakashvili ’s reckless war , when last year even Bush was denouncing the Pinochet - wannabe ’s violent attack on his own people during a peaceful opposition protest in Georgia ’s capital , as well as shutting down the opposition media and exiling of political opponents ?
That would be a brain - teaser if the last seven years had n’t answered this question so many painful times already .
But with McCain , answering this is a little trickier .
When he issued today ’s Des Moines statement calling for Russia to do what Russia already did a few hours earlier , you have to ask yourself : either McCain ’s short - term memory is totally shot , encased in an impenetrable tomb of aluminum - zirconium plaque … or worse , McCain simply does n’t give a damn about reality , he just wants to get Georgia ’s war on , as badly as Saakashvili does .
The awful truth is probably a combination of the two , which is the worst of all worlds , considering McCain ’s raving Russophobia , and his campaign team ’s financial and ideological ties to Saakashvili .
As has been reported , McCain ’s top foreign policy advisor , neocon Randy Scheunemann , has a long financial relationship with Saakashvili to lobby his interests in the United States .
According to the Wall Street Journal :
In 2005 , Mr. Scheunemann asked Sen. McCain to introduce a Senate resolution expressing support for peace in the Russian - influenced region of South Ossetia that wants to break away from Georgia , the records show .
Such resolutions of Senate support are symbolic but helpful to countries in their diplomatic relations .
The Senate approved Sen. McCain ’s resolution in December 2005 , and the Georgian Embassy posted the text on its Web site .
Sen .
McCain has endorsed Georgia ’s goal of entering NATO , a matter for which the country hired Mr. Scheunemann to lobby .
In 2006 , Senator McCain gave a speech at the Munich Conference on Security in Germany in which he said “ Georgia has implemented far - reaching political , economic , and military reforms ” and should enter NATO , a text of his speech on the conference Web site shows .
Scheunemann , a bearded , pear - faced gun geek who looks like what might have happened to an aging GI Joe doll if it had spent years stuffing its face at pricey restaurants while power - schmoozing politicians and petty dictators , also worked for recently - disgraced Bush fundraiser Stephen Payne , lobbying for his Caspian Alliance oil business .
The Caspian oil pipeline runs through Georgia , the main reason that country has tugged the heartstrings of neocons and oil plutocrats for at least a decade or more .
Randy Scheunemann : NeoCon Joe With A Lobbyist Grip !
In 2006 , McCain visited Georgia and denounced the South Ossetian separatists , proving that Scheunemann was n’t wasting his Georgian sponsor ’s money .
At a speech he gave in a Georgian army base in Senaki , McCain declared that Georgia was America ’s “ best friend , ” and that Russian peacekeepers should be thrown out .
Today , Georgian forces from that same Senaki base are part of the invasion force into South Ossetia , an invasion that has left scores–perhaps hundreds –of dead locals , at least ten dead Russian peacekeepers , and 140 million pissed - off Russians calling for blood .
Lost in all of this is not only the question of why America would risk an apocalypse to help a petty dictator like Saakashvili get control of a region that does n’t want any part of him .
But no one ’s bothering to ask what the Ossetians themselves think about it , or why they ’re fighting for their independence in the first place .
That ’s because the Georgians –with help from lobbyists like Scheunemann –have been pushing the line that South Ossetia is a fiction , a construct of evil Kremlin neo-Stalinists , rather than a people with a genuine grievance .
A few years ago , I had an Ossetian working as the sales director for my now - defunct newspaper , The eXile .
After listening to me rave about how much I always ( and still do ) like the Georgians , he finally lost it and told me another side to Georgian history , explaining how the Georgians had always mistreated the Ossetians , and how the South Ossetians wanted to reunite with North Ossetia in order to avoid being swallowed up , and how this conflict goes way back , long before the Soviet Union days .
It was clear that the Ossetian - Georgian hatred was old and deep , like many ethnic conflicts in this region .
Indeed , a number of Caucasian ethnic groups still harbor deep resentment towards Georgia , accusing them of imperialism , chauvinism and arrogance .
One example of this can be found in historian Bruce Lincoln ’s book , Red Victory , in which he writes about the period of Georgia ’s brief independence from 1917 to 1921 , a time when Georgia was backed by Britain :
[ T ]he Georgian leaders quickly moved to widen their borders at the expense of their Armenian and Azerbaijani neighbors , and their territorial greed astounded foreign observers .
‘ The free and independent socialist democratic state of Georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation , ” one British journalist wrote … .
“ Both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside , its chauvinism was beyond all bounds . ”
On Thursday , following intense Georgian shelling and katyusha rocketing into Tskhinvali , refugees streamed out of South Ossetia telling reporters that the Georgians had completely leveled entire villages and most of Tskhinvali , leaving “ piles of corpses ” in the streets , over 1,000 by some counts .
Among the dead are at least ten Russian peacekeepers , who fell after their base was attacked by Georgian forces .
Reports also say that Georgian forces destroyed a hotel where Russian journalists were staying .
In response , Russian jets bombed Georgian positions both inside South Ossetia and into Georgia proper , attacking one base where American military instructors are quartered ( no Americans were reported hurt ) .
By mid-afternoon Moscow time , as local television showed burning homes and Ossetian women and children huddling in bomb shelters , armored Russian columns were crossing into Georgian territory , and Georgia ’s President called for a total mobilization of military - aged men for war with Russia .
The invasion was backed up by a PR offensive so layered and sophisticated that I even got an hysterical call today from a hedge fund manager in New York , screaming about an “ investor call ” that Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze made this morning with some fifty leading Western investment bank managers and analysts .
I ’ve since seen a J.P. Morgan summary of the conference call , which pretty much reflects the talking points later picked up by the US media .
These kinds of conference calls are generally conducted by the heads of companies in order to give banking analysts guidance .
But as the hedge fund manager told me today , “ The reason Lado did this is because he knew the enormous PR value that Georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts , particularly since Georgia is clearly the aggressor this time . ”
As a former investment banker who worked in London and who used to head the Bank of Georgia , Gurgenidze knew what he was doing .
“ Lado is a former banker himself , so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in New York , that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on CNBC and argue Lado Gurgenidze ’s talking points .
It was brilliant , and now you ’re starting to see the American media shift its coverage from calling it Georgia invading Ossetian territory , to the new spin , that it ’s Russian imperial aggression against tiny little Georgia . ”
The really scary thing about this investor conference call is that it suggests real planning .
As the hedge fund manager told me , “ These things are n’t set up on an hour ’s notice . ”
Where this war is leading is impossible to say , but as Iraq and Afghanistan , not to mention Chechnya , have shown , wars have a funny way of lasting longer , costing more in money and lives , and snuffing out whatever individual liberties the affected populations may have .
As good as this war is for Saakashvili , who has become increasingly unpopular at home and abroad , or for McCain , whose poll numbers seem to rise every time the plaque devours another lobe of his brain , it also bodes well for the resurgent Prime Minister Putin , who seems to have become increasingly peeved with his hand - picked successor , President Dmitry Medvedev ’s flickering independence and his liberalizer shtick .
There ’s nothing like a good war to snuff out an uppity sois - disant liberal who ’s getting in your way–even McCain , frozen in an antiperspirant - induced fog , can still grasp this basic reptilian concept .
As I ’m filing this , Russian forces are battling to take back Tskhinvali , while Saakashvili has been alternately claiming to have pulled his forces back , or that his forces are in full control of the city and defeating the Russians .
Meanwhile , Georgia has been on a massive , successful , multi- layered PR offensive in the West , helped by years of cultivating people like John McCain as well as the army of neocons and old cold warriors who naturally gravitate to a fight with Russia .

Wind turbines across Oregon stir up health scare Study suggests living close to an energy farm can cause a variety of physical ailments
Mike Eaton of Boardman , Ore. , now has a view of a wind turbine farm being built near his home .
Some researchers say vibrations and low - frequency noise from the turbines can cause health problems .
" Whoosh !
Whoosh !
Whoosh ! "
That 's the sound Eaton 's wife , Sherry , says they will hear coming from the farm .

" Whoosh ! ... more Photo : RICHARD COCKLE , NEWHOUSE Photo : RICHARD COCKLE , NEWHOUSE Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Wind turbines across Oregon stir up health scare 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
BOARDMAN , ORE . — Sherry Eaton pulled into the driveway of her rural , high - desert home to see one of several giant wind turbines being assembled a half - mile away .
" I started to cry , " Eaton , 57 , recalled of her first sight of the Willow Creek Wind Project in late July .
" They 're going to be hanging over the back of our house , and now there 's the medical thing . "
" The medical thing " is new research suggesting that living close to wind turbines , as Eaton and her 60 - year - old husband , Mike , soon will be doing , can cause sleep disorders , difficulty with equilibrium , headaches , childhood " night terrors " and other health problems .
Dozens of wind turbines are taking shape along Oregon 74 , a designated Oregon Scenic Byway , near the home the Eatons have shared for 19 years .
Dr. Nina Pierpont of Malone , N.Y. , coined the phrase " wind turbine syndrome " for what she says happens to some people living near wind energy farms .
She has made the phrase part of the title of a book she 's written called Wind Turbine Syndrome : A Report on the Natural Experiment .
It is scheduled for publication next month by K - Selected Press of Santa Fe , N.M .
Better if two miles away
In contrast to those who consider wind turbines clean , green and an ideal source of renewable energy , Pierpont says living or working too close to them has a downside .
Her research says wind turbines should never be built closer than two miles from homes .
Pierpont , 53 , is a 1991 graduate of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and has a doctorate in population biology from Princeton University .
Her interest was piqued by a wind farm being built near her upstate New York home , and she studied 10 families living near wind turbines built since 2004 in Canada , England , Ireland , Italy and the United States .
What 's the frequency ?
Pierpont 's findings suggest that low - frequency noise and vibration generated by wind machines can have an effect on the inner ear , triggering headaches ; difficulty sleeping ; tinnitus , or ringing in the ears ; learning and mood disorders ; panic attacks ; irritability ; disruption of equilibrium , concentration and memory ; and childhood behavior problems .
Concerns also are coming out of Europe about low - frequency noise from newly built wind turbines .
For example , British physician Amanda Harry , in a February 2007 article titled " Wind Turbines , Noise and Health , " wrote of 39 people , including residents of New Zealand and Australia , who suffered from the sounds emitted by wind turbines .
According to Pierpont , eight of the 10 families in her study moved out of their homes .
" All these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines , got in the car and drove away from the house , " she said .
Not so , says company
Mike Logsdon , director of development for Invenergy , developer of the 48 wind turbines under construction in the Willow Creek Wind Project , said he 's heard of Pierpont 's findings , but his 5 - year - old company does n't find them credible .
" We 've had a number of other wind farms over the country and residents living by them and never had any problems , " Logsdon said .
Invenergy has built and operates wind farms in Canada and Poland and in 12 states in the United States , Logsdon said .
The company has 1,200 megawatts in production and is building 600 megawatts this year .
The 72 - megawatt Willow Creek Wind Project near the Eatons ' home is scheduled to start producing electricity Jan .
1 .
If Pierpont 's theories gain acceptance , decisions on where future wind energy farms are built could be affected .
Last year , more than one - third of all new power capacity in the United States , roughly 5,000 megawatts , was generated by wind turbines , said Joseph Beamon , spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy in Washington .
Many more planned
Meanwhile , a U.S. Department of Energy report said demand for electricity is likely to grow 40 percent in the next 22 years in the United States alone , with 20 percent of the nation 's power generated by wind turbines , he said .
The Eatons and their neighbors have more to worry about than the Willow Creek Project .
Approval was given July 25 by the Oregon Facilities Siting Council for construction of as many as 400 more wind turbines in the nearby Shepherds Flat Wind Project spanning parts of Gilliam and Morrow counties .
The planned 909 - megawatt project by Caithness Energy of Chicago is expected to be the largest wind farm on earth , generating enough peak energy to power 225,000 homes .
" Man , this whole country is going to be windmills , " said a dismayed Denny Wade , 59 , a railroad worker and neighbor of the Eatons .
Spoiling their view
He and his wife , Lorrie , a 53 - year - old schoolteacher , live three - quarters of a mile from one of Willow Creek 's turbines .
The Wades had planned to sell the home where they 've lived for four years and build a retirement home on a knoll 200 yards away with a view of Mount Hood .
" Now , the view that it had is all windmills , " Wade said .
" I did n't move out there to view windmills . "
But Denny
Wade 's larger concern is his vulnerability to migraine headaches .
Although not everyone living near wind turbines experienced headaches , Pierpont 's research suggests " everyone with pre-existing migraines " developed headaches by living near the wind generators .
The Wades scrapped plans to build a new home and hope to sell their 42 acres and move , they said .
Morrow County planner Carla McLane said potential health issues never were raised during the planning process in her county , and the opportunity to appeal has passed .
The potential effects of turbines on the scenic values of Oregon 74 never were brought up in hearings he attended , said Terry Tallman , Morrow County Commission chairman .
Generally , wind energy farms have been welcomed in this sparsely settled corner of the state , Tallman said .
Tax revenues from the wind farms will be distributed to the counties , public schools , park and recreation districts and fire departments , he said .
" Everybody that I 've talked to has been very happy , " he said , adding that some on whose property the turbines are being built intend to retire on the income they receive .
" I think it 's a good thing , " Ron Wyscaver , 40 , a neighbor of the Eatons and Wades , said of the wind turbines .
Caithness first proposed a 105 - megawatt Shepherds Flat Project in 2002 , then applied to the state for the larger project two years ago , McLane said .
The project was so large it went to the Energy Facilities Siting Council , where it received the go - ahead to start construction .
Potential medial problems aside , Sherry Eaton says the wind turbines will wreck the tranquillity the couple came to this remote setting to find .
She drives 90 miles a day to and from her job in Hermiston so they can live in the high - desert setting .
" When you come home from work , everything drains away from you because it 's so quiet and peaceful , " she said , adding that 's about to end .
" Now we are going to have to listen to those windmills : Whoosh !
Whoosh !
Whoosh ! " she said .
Some were simply considered too indiscrete for the role .
Lt Col Bevan , wrote : " On other grounds I am a little doubtful about using Lady Willingdon .
Although she will almost certainly pass on any information which comes into her possession and spread it around pretty widely , she may possibly over do it and might tend to spoil the market . "
Like many people with bipolar disorder , Laurel Lemke , 54 , of Lakewood , Wash. , cycled in and out of hospitals and tried various treatments before being diagnosed and treated with her disorder .
Though she will likely never be " cured , " her mental illness no longer is central to her life .
Here is how she copes today

If someone had told me when I was in my teens that one day I 'd be a spokesperson for a mental health group , I would n't have believed them .
Chances are , I would n't have understood them either .
When I was 18 , I was drowsy on antipsychotics and hospitalized for my first manic attack .
But a lot has changed since then , and over the last 36 years I 've learned how to manage my health .
And , as a member of NAMI ( National Alliance on Mental Illness ) , I help other people understand mental illness for themselves and their loved ones .

Mental illness made college hell
Today I talk openly about my bipolar disorder , but for a long time I did n't tell anyone about it .
First of all , I did n't really understand the illness , let alone want to share this big secret with people .
Though , at times , it was hard to conceal .
Whenever I was stressed or overtired or feeling enormous pressure , I was at risk of going through another manic episode .
That 's what happened when I started college at a reputable liberal arts women 's school — which will remain nameless .
The unfamiliar surroundings , the irregular class schedule , and the unlimited opportunity offered me too many choices .
And it resulted in unmanageable stress .
I could n't sleep , I would forget to eat , and I would talk incredibly fast .
I even thought I had ESP — when a song would come on the radio , I thought , " Hey , I predicted that song . "
I sensed something was wrong , but I did n't know what it was .
So I visited the college 's infirmary .
During the first few visits , the college doctor focused on my insomnia .
He gave me medication to sleep and sent me home .
But when the sleep medication did n't work , and I was getting more hyper and my energy was peaking beyond control , the doctor sent me to a hospital .
To my surprise , they had me stay in the hospital for six weeks .
Imagine : I had just started college , a bright - eyed , ambitious student and then , three weeks later , I was a patient in a mental ward of a hospital .
It was hard to understand , even harder to accept .
Next Page : Getting the right diagnosis was a challenege [ pagebreak ] Doctors could n't agree on a diagnosis
Back then there was very little medical consensus on bipolar disorder — and there was very little patient consultation on which treatment would be preferred .
The medication I was given snowed me .
I could n't function .
I was sleeping during the day , wide awake at night .
It was horrible .
My family was extremely supportive , but it was a very confusing time .
My condition was not officially called bipolar at this time because I had n't had enough episodes for a clear diagnosis .
At the end of the six - week period , my energy levels stabilized , and I felt like myself .
When I was ready for school , the college would n't accept me — something about me not being an ideal student .
I went to a different college while my father appealed for my reentry .
The following year I returned to my original college of choice , and I eventually graduated .
Stigma about mental illness was very common then , and it remains a challenge now .
I think the best way to combat this stigma is to talk about it , its symptoms , the genetic component , and also how lifestyle choices can influence your susceptibility to more manias .
What triggers her manic episodes
My next manic episode happened when I was 25 .
I have since had seven or eight episodes , and they usually happen when I undergo a major change : my mother 's death , a new job , or a longer commute to work .
Although I find it hard to remember my behavior during my manic stages , I know I have a bundle of symptoms : I tend to lose my sense of humor , I find it hard to follow directions , I can be unreasonably suspicious , and I cry easily .
I am happy to say that my episodes have grown less frequent as I 've aged and become more aware of my personal triggers .
Bipolar can be different for different people and come on differently at different times in their lives .
Today , I manage my bipolar condition by keeping a regular schedule .
Routines .
Without them , I 'd be far less healthy .
I try to exercise regularly , I do n't drink alcohol anymore , and I eat " happy " foods like raw fruits and vegetables .
But even with the most discipline , there 's always a chance that I could slip back into a manic state .
Sometimes my mental illness is in the foreground , sometimes it's in the background .

Her family had a hidden history of mental illness [ pagebreak ] Bipolar disorder ran in her family , but she did n't know it
The genetic component of bipolar is something that I cannot control .
And like many families , I did n't even know that mental illness was in my family until much later in life .
A few years ago , a genealogist contacted me while he was researching my family for another individual .
He told me that my great - grandmother had killed herself and that she likely suffered from some mental illness .
This came as a complete shock to me , and I 'm certain that my father ( he passed away years ago ) did n't know about this either .
Knowing this information about a relative — although tragic — somehow helped me understand and accept my condition a little more .
It also reminded me of the importance of managing my condition .
What will happen on the day ?
A media centre will be established in the Globe of science and innovation .
Since it is not possible for us to take everyone to the CERN Control Centre , from where the LHC is run , we will install part of the control centre infrastructure in the media centre .
At all times during the day , a member of the operations team on shift will be in the Globe and on hand to explain what is happening .
The Globe is equipped with a large screen that will show the activity in the control centre , and there will be regular press conferences via video - conference link with the control centre through the day .
Through the day , visits for TV media will be arranged to the control centre .
There are two vantage points from which the control centre can be observed .
Visits to the control rooms of the LHC ’s experiments will also be available for all media .
Experts will be on hand at all locations throughout the day .
No underground visits will be possible .
The first injection of a beam is scheduled for 9:30 CET , and will be preceded by a planning meeting that will be relayed to the Globe from 9:00 .
You are strongly encouraged to arrive at CERN before 8:30 .
The objective for the day is to have beam circulating in the LHC , the precise sequence of events will evolve through the day .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans took 10.3 billion trips on public transportation last year , marking the highest ridership level since 1957 , according to a new study .
The rate of ridership continued to climb at a quarterly rate of 3.3 % through the first three months of 2008 to 2.6 billion , according to research from the American Public Transportation Association ( APTA ) .
That 's nearly 85 million more trips than the same period last year , the APTA said .
" There 's no doubt that the high gas prices are motivating people to change their travel behavior , " said APTA president William Millar , in a statement .
The number of riders on trolleys and streetcars rose 10.3 % in the first quarter of 2008 , while the number of commuter rail riders grew 5.7 % , according to APTA data .
Ridership on subways , elevated trains and buses also increased .
" People are looking at the gas prices and they 're making a choice , " said Joe Calderone , spokesman for the Long Island Rail Road ( LIRR ) , a commuter rail system in Long Island , New York .
The LIRR , which recently hiked fares , has seen ridership increase 5.4 % during the first 4 months of 2008 , compared with the same period a year ago .
Last year the LIRR served 86.1 million riders , the most since 1949 , according to Calderone .
The average price of gasoline nationwide crossed the $ 4 a gallon mark last Sunday , and the price of regular gasoline is now over $ 4 a gallon in more than half of the states in the country , according to a daily survey from automobile group AAA .
In a survey released last month by IBM's Institute for Electronic Government , a total of 31 % of commuters who normally drive to work said they would change their transportation habits if gas were to cross $ 4 a gallon .
IBM also found that a total of 66 % of drivers would seek other means of transportation if gas hits $ 5 a gallon .
SFGate :
FactCheck.org is one of those ( few ! ) nonpartisan sources where anybody can check out the truthiness in a political advertisement or on - the - trail rhetoric .
Everybody trusts them , so they ’re often cited in campaign ads .
In an ad released Wednesday called — really — “ Fact Check , ” the McCain campaign lied about what Factcheck.org said .
Says who ?
Says FactCheck.org .
In “ its latest ad , released Sept. 10 , the McCain - Palin campaign has altered our message in a fashion we consider less than honest , ” Factcheck said Wednesday on its website .
“ The ad strives to convey the message that FactCheck.org said ‘ completely false ’ attacks on Gov. Sarah Palin had come from Sen. Barack Obama .
We said no such thing .
We have yet to dispute any claim from the Obama campaign about Palin .
“ They call the ad ‘ Fact Check . ’
It says “ the attacks on Gov. Palin have been called ‘ completely false ’ … ‘ misleading . ’
On screen is a still photo of a grim - faced Obama .
Our words are accurately quoted , but they had nothing to do with Obama . ”
Read on ..
At this point I just keep asking myself “ Why would he do something so blatant and stupid ” ?
The McCain camp is no longer even attempting to come remotely close to say or portray things in an honest , straightforward and truthful way ..
Is it because they have nothing to base their campaign on ?
Are they just making outrageous claims in order to draw the attention of the American public and the media away from Barack Obama ?
Are they really THAT lacking in substance ?
If that is the strategy in this , it is pretty lame and disgraceful .
These are not the qualities we as a nation should want and need in our leader .
It shows an utter disregard for truth , and shows Senator McCain to be a man entirely lacking in integrity , character , or honor .
Have n’t we already been through enough with the lies of the last 8 years ?
Are we seriously considering MORE ?
Even WORSE ?
From FactCheck .
Org yesterday : McCain - Palin Distorts Our Finding :
Those attacks on Palin that we debunked did n’t come from Obama .
Summary A McCain - Palin ad has FactCheck.org calling Obama ’s attacks on Palin “ absolutely false ” and “ misleading . ”
That ’s what we said , but it was n’t about Obama .
Our article criticized anonymous e-mail falsehoods and bogus claims about Palin posted around the Internet .
We have no evidence that any of the claims we found to be false came from the Obama campaign .
The McCain - Palin ad also twists a quote from a Wall Street Journal columnist .
He said the Obama camp had sent a team to Alaska to “ dig into her record and background . ”
The ad quotes the WSJ as saying the team was sent to “ dig dirt . ”
Update , Sept. 10 : Furthermore , the Obama campaign insists that no researchers have been sent to Alaska and that the Journal owes them a correction .
Read the rest or their statement …
Joe Garofoli ends his post with this :
To review : The McCain campaign created an ad called “ Fact Check ” then distorted — using “ Factcheck.org ” — the actual facts cited in the advertisement .
There is no way to sugarcoat how lame this is .
To do so would just be putting lipstick on a pig .

This book was entrusted to me by the Knights of Templar , they borrowed it from Our Savior sometime between 28 and 32 AD and forgot to give it back .
It was one of those things where they said they 'd return it in a week , but then they did n't get around to reading it right away .
And you know how you always feel bad returning a book you have n't read , especially when the lender asks you what you thought of it .
So in trying to avoid an awkward moment with the Alpha and Omega , they hung onto it until they had more time .
Well that time turned into about 2000 years , and it got mixed in with some other books and made it into a yard sale box .
At first , the King of Kings ' signature was n't worth much , but after Our Redeemer died on the cross for your sins , apparently the value skyrocketed and then rose more gradually over the next 2000 years as more people learned of the Good Shepherd 's story .
Why am I selling it ?
I could say that I 'm interested in sharing the Word of God with someone else - become a " Fisher of Men " so to speak .
But the truth is I just bought an Xbox 360 and do n't have room on the bookshelf for both .
I 'll either use the money to fight world hunger , or buy that Rock Band game I 've been hankering for .
We are the fundamentals !
And , naturally , the humble , hard - working fundamentals are good .
Who could doubt it ?
Was Barack Obama trying to say that he did n’t think the American working man and woman was good ?
Was this the sort of thing they talked about at those fancy - schmancy Hollywood fund - raisers ?
Which , of course , John McCain hates .
Give him some hard cider and a log cabin , and he ’s happy as a clam .
But wait !
The fundamentals are in danger !
At risk because of “ greed . ”
Which John McCain was shocked to discover has been running rampant in the canyons of Wall Street .
Now in an election like this , you expect a certain amount of tactical reimagining .
McCain used to like reporters , and now he treats them as if they were carrying the Ebola virus .
Fair enough , although given the fact that he ’s terrible at speeches , and the famous town halls have now become Republican - only lovefests , the campaign really should invent some new method of communication .
( And remember , the man does n’t text . )
It is also disconcerting , of course , to hear the Republicans rail against Washington as if the Socialist Workers Party had been running things there for the last eight years .
But really , what would you do if you were McCain ?
There are n’t a lot of options , and he never did like George W. anyway .
This new tactic is different .
McCain has always , genuinely , believed in dismantling government regulations , and there he was , vowing to create new “ comprehensive regulations that will apply the rules and enforce them to the fullest . ”
It makes you think that he ’s trying to impersonate something he ’s not .
Or was n’t .
Or might not be .
The image is getting fuzzy .
This week , while McCain ’s chief economic adviser was telling reporters that it was wrong to “ run for president by denigrating everything in sight and trying to scare people , ” McCain ’s ad people were unveiling a new spot announcing “ Our economy in crisis ! ” and calling for “ tougher rules on Wall Street ” along , of course , with more offshore drilling .
Mournful unemployment - line music swells .
I have absolutely no idea of how John McCain would handle a financial crisis if he were president .
But on behalf of all the nation ’s fundamentals I would like to say that he now has me ready to stage a run on the first bank in sight .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iran is heading toward a major breakthrough in its nuclear program , an Israeli official said on Friday , as the White House warned Iran could face new sanctions if it ignores an international freeze offer .

“ As soon as 2010 ( Iran ) will have the option to reach ( uranium production ) at military levels , ” Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz told an audience in Washington , adding that this would be an “ unacceptable ” development .
Oil prices rose $ 4 in early Friday trade after the warning by Mofaz stirred concerns of a possible attack on the OPEC nation that would disrupt supplies .
There has been speculation that either the United States or Israel could attack Iran ’s nuclear facilities , though both have said force should be a last recourse .
The West accuses Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian energy program ; Iran denies it , and Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said this week that Iran would press ahead on its nuclear path .
Western powers gave Iran two weeks from July 19 to respond to their offer to hold off on imposing more U.N. sanctions on Iran if Tehran would freeze any expansion of its nuclear work .
The White House said on Friday that “ negative consequences await ” if the Iranians do n’t respond positively .
The informal deadline is this Saturday .
“ That would possibly come in the form of sanctions , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters .
The United Nations has already imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran .
Mofaz , a former Israeli defense minister and contender to replace outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , emphasized that any new sanctions should be imposed this year , instead of allowing the Iranians to stall for time past U.S. presidential elections in November .
“ We must insist on Iran meeting the timetable set , ” he said in a speech to the Washington Institute .
“ The red line should be that there is no uranium enrichment on Iranian soil . ”
“ It is a race against time and time is winning , ” the Iranian - born Mofaz warned .
But he also said he supported diplomacy and spoke of other options as “ last resort . ”
Mofaz told reporters that he had handed over to the U.S. government a list of Israeli proposals for new sanctions .
These would “ affect Iranian leaders and others individuals of influence , as well as the general populace . ”
Asked whether there had been any discussion with the Americans of possible U.S. green lights for Israeli military action against Iran , Mofaz said : “ I cannot answer the question , because it was not raised in our dialogue . ”
U.S. officials say they are not sure what to expect from the Iranians this weekend , and that they would want to consult with the other major powers behind the offer about Iran ’s response , or lack of it .
Those countries are Russia , China , Germany , France , and Britain .
“ The Iranians sent mixed messages this week and it ’s really hard to tell what the bottom line is .
And so we ’ll just need to wait and see if they do respond formally , ” Perino said .
Reuters asked Mofaz whether he worried about losing U.S. support when climbing gasoline prices were often blamed on Mideast turmoil .
“ The existence of the state of Israel is more important than the price of gas or oil , ” he replied .
The point is accessible from the cliff above Coastguards decided to leave a group of apparently drunk teenagers on a cliff overnight because it was deemed too risky to help them off .
The incident near Torquay began when an 18 - year - old dialled 999 at about 0045 BST and said he had suffered an epileptic seizure .
Rescue teams airlifted him to the cliff top and he was taken to hospital .
Coastguards criticised the group for " tying up resources " overnight and putting themselves at risk by drinking .
After the first youth was airlifted off the cliff a decision was made to leave the seven others there until daylight , when they made their own way off .
They were having a beach party and were very drunk
Fiona Iris , Brixham Coastguard
The group had been having a party at Long Quarry Point , in South Devon .
They were on an area the size of a football pitch about 20 ft ( 6 m ) above the sea which is accessed by a path from the top of the cliff .
Coastguards decided that after recent rainfall it would be too risky to lower anyone down to rescue them .
Fiona Iris , from Brixham Coastguard , said : " They were n't in any danger .
" They were having a beach party and were very drunk .
" It was decided it was safer to leave them there to sleep it off . "
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the incident had tied up rescue teams overnight .
It warned of the dangers of young people putting themselves at risk by drinking too much .

Kites Could Become Major Source Of Wind Power
August 5th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The idea to use kites for wind power is nothing new , but a development at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands reminds us that we have n’t even begun to tap the potential of these flying contraptions .
A recent experiment performed by a team at the university used kites to create 10 kW of energy — enough to power 10 homes .
This is a not a major breakthrough in and of itself , but the researchers plan to build a larger version of the project called “ Laddermill ” that would create 50 kW of energy .
They eventually want to build a 100 MW version of their project .
If successful , the expanded project would create enough power for 100,000 homes .
The kites are attached to a generator by a string .
Power is created when the string is pulled and the generator turns as winds lift it into the sky .
According to Laddermill project leader Wubbo Ockels , kites are a cheap way to use energy higher up in the air , where winds carry more power due to high speeds ( 7 meters / sec ) .
In contrast , turbines harvest energy closer to the ground , where wind speed is slower ( 5 meters / sec ) .
Unfortunately , Ockels predicts that the technology might not be brought to the market for a long time unless a large amount of money is made available .
But if the kite generators do make it out of the lab , they may silence critics who complain about wind power ’s detrimental effects on birds and scenery .

He said : " At this time of the year north Norfolk is as full of ' furriners ' as it is of natives , and it 's good to remind our visitors that they are in a part of England with its own distinctive language and culture . "
A stretch of Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock has increasingly become a popular shopping district dotted with trendy eateries and neighborhood shops .
But residents say the boulevard ’s wide lanes have also attracted street racers and drivers who ignore the speed limit .
“ It ’s known for speeders , ” said Mike Flores , 60 .
“ In the two years I was there , all you could hear is all these cars flying by and brakes screeching .
And every once in a while , one of them would lose control . ”
On Wednesday night , three people were killed , including a pregnant woman and her teenage sister , after their black Nissan Maxima was struck by another vehicle , slammed into a tree and burst into flames .

Authorities said the cars were driving at least 70 mph and appeared to be involved in a street race .
In the wake of the crash , city officials vowed a new crackdown on speeders and street racers in the area .
Between 1994 and 2006 , there were 286 accidents that resulted in injuries on the stretch of Colorado Boulevard roughly between the Glendale Freeway and Figueroa Street , according to a Times analysis of California Highway Patrol data .
Of those , 108 accidents , or 38 % , involved speeding violations .
Los Angeles Police Det. Felix Padilla , who is investigating the crash , said witnesses saw three cars speeding west on Colorado Boulevard when a Mitsubishi collided with the Nissan about 10:30 p.m. near Highland View Avenue , causing the Nissan to careen out of control and hit the tree .
Police are searching for the third vehicle , described only as a “ small white car . ”
Witnesses said the cars were traveling at “ dangerous ” speeds , about 70 mph in a 35 mph zone , Padilla said .
“ We ’re going by witness accounts that the cars were racing , ” he said .

Rostislav Shnayder , 19 , of Eagle Rock , who was driving a white Mitsubishi Eclipse , was later arrested and booked on suspicion of murder in connection with the accident , police said .
There was no indication that Shnayder was impaired by drugs or alcohol .
Killed in the Nissan were driver Cristyn Nicole Cordova , 19 , and her sister Toni Marie Cordova , 16 , both of Eagle Rock , police said .
Jason Timothy Gomez Hernandez , 19 , a family friend who was in the back seat , was ejected from the vehicle and killed instantly , police said .
Carlos Alberto Campos , Cordova ’s 19 - year - old boyfriend and the unborn child ’s father , was riding in the front seat and also was thrown from the vehicle , police said .
He has multiple fractures and is in critical condition at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena .
Andrew Cordova , 15 , the women ’s younger brother who was in the rear passenger - side seat , was also ejected and sustained multiple injuries and is listed in critical condition , officials said .
Campos and Andrew Cordova both had limbs severed in the crash .

City officials said they are aware of speeding on the stretch of Colorado Boulevard between the Glendale and Ventura freeways , which funnel traffic onto the busy street .
About a year ago , Councilman Jose Huizar , whose district includes Eagle Rock , said the LAPD had assigned a special task force to deal with speeding and street racing on the boulevard .
An increased presence of police officers seemed to help , he said .
Earlier this year , the city synchronized traffic lights to slow motorists .
After Wednesday night ’s crash , police plan to reactivate the task force , Huizar said .

“ It ’s the speeding that ’s the problem , ” he said , “ and once in a while , like in the incident last night , we suspect maybe the individuals just started racing each other .
But there ’s nothing to make us believe this was a planned race . ”
At nearby Eagle Rock High School on Thursday afternoon , students gathering to pick up their fall schedules could be seen crying and hugging one another as word spread about the accident .
Student Jessica Diaz , 17 , said Toni was her best friend .
She described her as caring and thoughtful of others , making cookies and cakes to mark her friends ’ birthdays and other special occasions .
“ She was always happy , ” Jessica said before breaking down in sobs .
“ I miss her . ”

She said she knew Toni ’s sister and did not believe she was involved in street racing .
“ I do n’t think so , especially because her sister was going to give birth next month , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think it was racing .
If anything , it was the other two cars and they got in the middle of it . ”
At the crash site on Colorado Boulevard , five bouquets had been left directly under the bloodstain on the tree -- bunches of roses , sunflowers , lilies and carnations .
Prayer candles were placed nearby .
On Wednesday night , John Chavez , 38 , who lives near the crash site , said he heard a “ loud thump ” about 10:30 , went outside and saw “ blood and debris everywhere . ”
He said he saw a “ torso ” in the street , a person on the pavement screaming for help , and a woman stuck in the twisted wreckage .
Advertisement
“ It was the worst accident I ’ve ever seen , ” Chavez said .
“ It was carnage . ”
Daniel Gutierrez , 54 , a homeless man who was sleeping a block up the street , said he awoke to “ a boom , like an explosion . ”
He said the Mitsubishi hit the Nissan , causing it to fishtail and hit the tree , exploding in flames .
“ I went over there , but it was too late , ” Gutierrez said .
Steve Leonard , 37 , who has lived on Highland View Avenue for nearly nine years , said he heard someone screaming “ Why ? ” and stepped outside to see the accident ’s destruction .

Leonard said he has seen two or three accidents on Colorado Boulevard that he believes involved street racing .
He said he often hears the rumble of engines or sees speeding on the street , especially on weekends or late at night .
“ You can get moving down Colorado pretty fast , ” he said .
“ There ’s not a lot of cross traffic , and you could blow a red light and get going . . . there ’s a lot of whipping down the street . ”
Riverside Police Sgt. Skip Showalter , a member of the statewide street - racing task force , said the group met Wednesday in Sacramento for its quarterly meeting and members were “ talking about how we had n’t had a fatality in a while .
It ’s sad this happened . . . six hours later . ”
Those who engage in street racing risk a misdemeanor charge , five days in jail and car impoundment .
If the race causes death or injury , penalties are much higher and racers can be charged with second - degree murder or gross vehicular manslaughter .

“ You ’ve got street racers who enjoy the thrill of all these dangerous twists and turns in the road , ” Showalter said .
“ It ’s not like a video game , it ’s reality . . . and unfortunately , when you street race in the real world , people get killed . ”

Confessions of a Recovering Feminist An Interview with Jed Diamond
For more than 30 years , I have defined myself as a feminist .
As a feminist , I not only struggled ardently for three decades on behalf of women 's equality in every aspect of human existence , but more specifically , I believed that female values were more desirable than male values , and that patriarchy ( a way of living based on power and control ) was synonymous with masculinity and male values .
Today I am a person in recovery - recovery from alcoholism and various other addictions .
For me , recovery is above all else , a process -- a process which is constantly in flux and never completely finished .
In fact , I have come to believe that the very nature of life itself is process .
Recently I wandered into a bookstore in another state thinking that I might obtain a copy of Fire In The Belly : On Being A Man , by Sam Keen .
When I asked the woman proprietor if there was a men's section in the store , she looked bewildered and replied , " Other than the lesbian and women 's studies section , we believe that every other part of the store is the men 's section , because men run the world . "
When I asked if there was a section pertaining to men's recovery , she answered , " Well , some people are asking for that Robert Bly book , but that 's about it . "
With some exceptions , this is essentially the kind of response I hear when I speak with my feminist sisters about the men's mythopoetic movement which finally made the cover of Newsweek a few weeks ago .
( ed - this article was written in early 1992 ) Many women take a dim view of female interest in the men's movement and wonder why women like me are n't putting more , instead of less , energy into the women 's movement these days .
My answer to that question is that my own healing process has made painfully clear to me that after a lifetime of struggling for gender equity and determination to be seen and treated as whole human beings .
it is now time for the women 's movement ( feminist or otherwise ) to look within at its own shadow .
Earlier in the struggle , it was necessary to focus on our victimization as women which has not ended and which we must continually challenge .
But in the process of healing from any kind of victimization , it becomes crucial at some point to turn inward and face the dark pans of the soul that axe inevitably foisted on the victim in the ordeals of oppression .
I recently watched a talk show in which a famous feminist attorney and feminist psychologist were accompanying a courageous woman who had just won a lawsuit against her father for childhood sexual abuse .
The mood of the survivor was one of vitality , wisdom , empowerment and warmth .
Meanwhile , the two feminist professionals spouted rhetoric and took snide potshots at patriarchy .
At one point , the psychologist stated that more than 90 percent of child sexual assault is committed by males .
She went on to imply that basically women just do n't do this son of thing , and children are much safer with women .
Having been severely abused by women myself and having worked with survivors of all forms of abuse for over a decade , I was aghast at such ignorance and self - righteousness .
The real truth is that women do physically , sexually , emotionally , intellectually and spiritually abuse other human beings .
We have been as ecologically irresponsible us males , insisting on disposable diapers , pre-packaged convenience foods , fur coats and " throwaway " everything .
We are as guilty of emotional incest ( for example , relating to our children as surrogate spouses ) as men are .
In Iron John , Robert Bly speaks of all the subtle nuances of the mother - son wound .
He reminds us that tribal societies knew the devastating consequences of older males not taking responsibility to mentor younger males , and that women , regardless of how well - intentioned , cannot provide the same things for their sons emotionally as men can .
Likewise , Marion Woodman 's works are replete with reminders of the wounds that all children incur at the hands of " unmothered mothers . "
Although many feminists would shudder in horror at the thought of having an " inner male , " any human being who is truly self - reflective will acknowledge the presence of an inner opposite .
The male in all of us who can change the oil , master the computer or backpack the wilderness is as wounded as our femaleness has been in a male - dominated culture .
In the struggle to reclaim " womanpower " and " womanspace . " feminists have failed to own the positive values , as well as the wounding , of the inner male .
I agree with Woodman 's assertion that when women deny the woundedness of the inner male , we become " possessed " by the negative aspects of the wound and gain our gender equity at the expense of our wholeness , turning into extensions of patriarchy in female bodies .
Projection is a crucial underpinning of the patriarchal principle , i.e. , " I 'm fine , and if everyone else would just change , we would all be fine . "
Many women are making their descent into the psyche and the dark night of the soul that looking at the feminine shadow entails .
Similarly , many men are making their descent into the " hairy , scary , wet , swampy places " of Bly 's Iron John .
What is becoming increasingly apparent to me is how much both women and men need each other 's journeys .
To become whole individuals and whole as a planet .
we mast value , and hopefully dialog about our personal confrontations with inner demons .
Much of the men's movement is about men's acknowledging the wounding of their inner feminine and healing the wound through deep grief , connection with nature , the , senses , the body , and finding nurturing and support from each other .
Men journeying on this path have learned much from the women 's movement and finally see their own wounds in ours .
if women are willing to look at their shadow , they will ultimately find somewhere in the psyche a wounded male , and if we are open , there is much the men 's movement can show us about the healing of that pan of ourselves .
In my opinion , political feminism and the " blame game , " as Sam Keen calls it , is outdated .
It may be that the last stage of the women 's movement ( a long , hard look at our inner demons ) will be what is clearly the first stage of the men 's movement .
Nevertheless , we can no longer afford to ignore each other 's journeys .
The bigger picture is about world peace and balanced ecosystems .
Ultimately , these depend on women and men honoring and talking with each other with respect to how we have all been wounded by the war , work and gender - role ethic of the Western , technological mind .
I agree with Keen 's challenge that " What the majority of men have not done is confront the feminist analysis and world view and son out the healing treasures from the toxic trash . "
The women 's movement is not dead , but stagnant and stalled -- not so much because of Reagan or Bush or an evil external " patriarchy , " but because we are not yet willing to take responsibility for the female shadow and the inner patriarchy .
The price we pay for refusing to do so is much too great , for as Keen writes : " We are all huddled together on a worldwide battlefield , brothers and sisters in a nuclear family , one race , indivisible , with destruction and fallout for all . "

From the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve : Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies .
To provide increased liquidity support to these firms as they transition to managing their funding within a bank holding company structure , the Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to extend credit to the U.S. broker - dealer subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley against all types of collateral that may be pledged at the Federal Reserve 's primary credit facility for depository institutions or at the existing Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) ; the Federal Reserve has also made these collateral arrangements available to the broker - dealer subsidiary of Merrill Lynch .
In addition , the Board also authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to extend credit to the London - based broker - dealer subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , and Merrill Lynch against collateral that would be eligible to be pledged at the PDCF .
In one of the most sweeping changes on Wall Street in decades , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , the last two independent investment banks , will become bank holding companies , the Federal Reserve said Sunday night .
The move fundamentally changes one of the mainstay models of modern Wall Street , the independent investment bank .
It heralds new regulations and supervisions of previously lightly regulated investment banks .
It is also the latest signal by the Federal Reserve that it will not let Goldman or Morgan fail .
Given the expected bank failures this year , it is possible Goldman and Morgan Stanley could seek to buy them cheaply in a “ roll - up ” strategy .
Prior to the move , federal regulations prohibited the two investment banks from pursuing such deals .
Indeed , Morgan Stanley ’s recent talks with Wachovia revolved around Wachovia buying Morgan Stanley .
Being a bank holding company would also give the two access to the discount window of the Federal Reserve .
While they have had access to Fed lending facilities in recent months , regulators had planned to take away discount window access in January .
The regulation by the Federal Reserve brings a host of accounting rule changes that should benefit the two banks in the current environment .
In return , they will submit themselves to greater regulation , including limits on the amount of leverage they can take on .
When it collapsed , Lehman had about a 30:1 debt - to - equity ratio , meaning it had borrowed $ 30 for every dollar in capital it held .
Bank of America , on the other hand , currently has about an 11.7:1 leverage ratio .
Morgan Stanley had sought other ways to bolster its capital , and had been in advanced talks with China ’s sovereign wealth fund and others about raising as much as $ 30 billion , people briefed on the matter said Sunday night .

TBILISI ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush ’s pledge to send aid to Georgia means that the U.S. military will take control of the ex-Soviet state ’s ports and airports , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said on Wednesday .
“ You have heard the statement by the U.S. president that the United States is starting a military - humanitarian operation in Georgia , ” Saakashvili said in a television address .
“ It means that Georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the U.S. defense ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions .
This is a very important statement for easing tension . ”
In Las Vegas next week , a twenty - five year journey could come to a successful conclusion , when a British company launches what it believes will be a triumphant combination of science and technology .
Plastic Logic 's e-reader , the Que , will be unveiled on the opening morning of the Consumer Electronics Show .
It could be one of the show 's stand - out products - or it could end up buried under an avalanche of hype about a forthcoming rival device from a better - known firm .

If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content .
This journey began in the 1980s at Cambridge University 's world - renowned Cavendish laboratory , where the physicist Richard Friend was working on carbon - based materials for semi-conductors .
He tried and failed to get electronics companies interested in the plastic light - emitting diodes which emerged from his research - but when he teamed up with another Cambridge lecturer Henning Sirringhaus , they ended up finding ways to print transistors onto plastic .
It was this work which led to the development of the light , flexible displays which Plastic Logic believes will revolutionise the way we read .
On a snowy day just before Christmas , I went to meet the two men at Plastic Logic 's offices on the Cambridge Science Park .
They are both still teaching at the university , while keeping an eye on the progress of the firm they founded in 2000 .
And while it has taken a decade for Plastic Logic to bring its first product to market , Sir Richard - he was knighted in 2003 - was confident that the long wait would be worthwhile :
" The most impressive thing is it's an integration of fundamental science and world - leading engineering - it's the thing that the British are not supposed to be able to do . "
At that stage , they were not able to show me the final product , but I was allowed to handle prototype displays developed in Cambridge and then manufactured at their plant in Dresden .
They are light and flexible , and Professor Sirringhaus told me the aim was to provide the same experience you get from paper , rather than the one you get from the glass which is needed for conventional screens :
" The whole reading experience is about holding something that is unbreakable .
" It 's light ; you can treat it like paper ; you can stuff it in your briefcase .
If you want to read a business document or paper , then the weight of the glass used in conventional technology is quite significant . "
Plastic Logic has signed deals with a number of major newspaper groups , including the Financial Times and USA Today , to make their titles available each day on the Que e-reader .
The product , which will enter a fast - growing market dominated by products like the Amazon Kindle and the Sony Reader , will be aimed principally at the business market .
While the technology would permit a roll - up screen , it seems they 've gone for something more conventional , so the Que may not look that different from e-readers with a glass screen .
The other crucial figure in the story of Plastic Logic is Herman Hauser , the scientist and venture capitalist who 's been involved in many of the ground - breaking businesses to emerge from Cambridge over the last two decades - you may have caught him in Micro Men , BBC4 's recent drama about the rivalry between Sinclair and Acorn Computers .
He put up the money back in 2000 which allowed Friend and Sirringhaus to form Plastic Logic , and he 's been instrumental in raising more finance as the years have gone by .
What 's really amazing about this business is that that it has gone all the way from research in a laboratory , to manufacturing a product , to building a global sales and marketing team - much of that operation is now based in California - without sacrificing its independence .
Which might just be a mistake .
A less courageous option would have been to license its technology to Amazon or Sony - or maybe Apple - and let them use their undoubted marketing expertise to sell the idea of plastic displays to the world .
There are now convincing reports that Apple has an event scheduled for late January where it will unveil a mystery new product .
The blogs and fan sites are alive with feverish speculation about the iSlate - supposedly the name of a tablet computer which will provide everything from books , TV programmes and music to the solution to global warming .
I 'm as fascinated as anyone to see what Apple really has been hiding up Steve Jobs ' sleeve , but I hope that amid all the hullabaloo , the launch of Plastic Logic 's Que next Thursday will not be overlooked .
I will be in the United States to cover this and a number of other technology stories next week , when this blog will have a new look and a new name .
So thanks for listening in 2009 - and see you next year .

Instead of choosing to appear before a House Judiciary Committee investigating White House influence on the Justice Department , Karl Rove decided to lam it .
The Bush adviser claimed that “ executive privilege ” meant he did n’t have to appear before the committee .
Since the committee is trying to figure out whether Rove pushed for prosecutions of Democrats like former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , they disagreed with his claim and voted to hold him in contempt .
Now that a federal judge has ruled that it is illegal for Bush advisors to ignore congressional subpoenas , Karl might want to lay low for a while .
No one is sure where he ’ll turn up , but the community is being warned should they come in contact with the fugitive .

In short all this long blog is doing is recasting in the liberal context Jesus ' words found in Luke 22:42 : " not my will , but thine , be done . "
When you come face to face with Nature - or - God this is all one can do it is just that , as human beings , we can find ways to live and work with this reality and to do it joyously and creatively .
Doing this together in a beautiful " Garden " ( both earthy ones and those of the spirit ) seems like rather an attractive idea to me .
Perhaps even more attractive than going to church . . .

O glorious nature !
Supremely fair and sovereignly good !
All - loving and all - lovely , all - divine !
Whose looks are so becoming and of such infinite grace , whose study brings such wisdom and whose contemplation such delight , whose every single work affords an ampler scene and is a nobler spectacle than all which every art presented ! - O might nature !
Wise substitute of Providence !
Empowered creatress !
Or thou empowering deity , supreme creator !
Thee I invoke and thee alone adore .
To thee this solitude , this place , these rural meditations are sacred while thus inspired with harmony of thought , though unconfined by words and in loose numbers , I sing of nature 's order in created beings and celebrate the beauties which resolve in thee , the source and principle of all beauty and perfection .
Thy being is boundless , unsearchable , impenetrable .
In thy immensity all thought is lost , fancy gives over its flight and wearied imagination spends itself in vain , finding no coast nor limit of this ocean , nor , in the widest tract through which it soars , one point yet nearer the circumference than the first centre whence it parted .
-
Thus having oft essayed , thus sallied forth into the wide expanse , when I return again within myself , struck with the sense of this so narrow being and of the fullness of that immense one , I dare no more behold the amazing depths nor sound the abyss of deity . -
Yet since by thee , O sovereign mind , I have been formed such as I am , intelligent and rational , since the peculiar dignity of my nature is to know and contemplate thee , permit that with due freedom I exert those faculties with which thou has adorned me .
Bear with my venturous and bold approach .
And since nor vain curiosity , nor fond conceit , nor love of aught save thee alone inspires me with such thoughts as these , be thou my assistant and guide me in this pursuit , while I venture thus to tread the labyrinth of wide nature and endeavour to trace thee in thy works ...
Catholic Clergy Call for Reparation in Response to Communion Desecration Contact : Rev. Fr. John Trigilio , Confraternity of Catholic Clergy , 717-957-2662 BALTIMORE , Maryland , July 29 / Christian Newswire / --
The Confraternity of Catholic Clergy ( a national association of 600 priests & deacons ) respond to the sacrilegious and blasphemous desecration of the Holy Eucharist by asking for public reparation .
We ask all Catholics of Minnesota and of the entire nation to join in a day of prayer and fasting that such offenses never happen again .
We find the actions of University of Minnesota ( Morris ) Professor Paul Myers reprehensible , inexcusable , and unconstitutional .
His flagrant display of irreverence by profaning a consecrated Host from a Catholic church goes beyond the limit of academic freedom and free speech .
The same Bill of Rights which protect freedom of speech also protect freedom of religion .
The Founding Fathers did not envision a freedom FROM religion , rather a freedom OF religion .
In other words , our nation 's constitution protects the rights of ALL religions , not one and not just a few .
Attacking the most sacred elements of a religion is not free speech anymore than would be perjury in a court or libel in a newspaper .
Lies and hate speech which incite contempt or violence are not protected under the law .
Hence , inscribing Swastikas on Jewish synagogues or publicly burning copies of the Christian Bible or the Muslim Koran , especially by a faculty member of a public university , are just as heinous and just as unconstitutional .
Individual freedoms are limited by the boundaries created by the inalienable rights of others .
The freedom of religion means that no one has the right to attack , malign or grossly offend a faith tradition they personally do not have membership or ascribe allegiance .
The Chancellor of the University refused to reprimand or censure the teacher , who ironically is a Biology Professor .
One fails to see the relevance of the desecration of a Catholic sacrament to the science of Biology .
Were Myers a Professor of Theology , there would have been at least a presumption of competency to express religious opinions in a classroom .
Yet , for a scientist to ridicule and show utter contempt for the most sacred and precious article of a major world religion , is inappropriate , unprofessional , unconstitutional and disingenuous .
A biologist has no business ' dissing ' any religion , rather , they should be busy teaching the scientific discipline they were hired to teach .
Tolerating such behavior by university officials is equally repugnant as it lends credibility to the act of religious hatred .
We also pray that Professor Myers contritely repent and apologize .

Creating a BufferStrategy could n't be simpler .
We simply ask the Canvas to do it for us .
The only thing that needs to be specified is how many buffers to use to manage the screen , in this case we 're going to use just 2 .
Finally for each Entity we have we'd like to have an image displayed , using an old term , a Sprite .
However , we might use the same Sprite for multiple entities , for instance the aliens .
It seems logically therefore to keep the sprite as a separate object from the entity .
In addition we do n't want to waste graphics memory so we 'd like to only load each sprite once .
To manage this it'd be nice to add a class to manage loading of the Sprites and storing them for future use .
So we add a pair of classes to our design , Sprite and SpriteStore .
In that window we want to see some things moving around .
The player 's ship , the aliens and the shots that the players fire .
Since all of these things have common properties ( i.e. they display a graphic and move around the screen ) we can infer a common class to represent each one with potentially subclasses to define the specific behaviors of these different types .
Since " thing " is such a terrible name for a class , for our design I 'm going to call them Entities .
From this we get 4 classes .
Entity with 3 subclasses , ShipEntity , AlienEntity and ShotEntity
For our space invaders game we 're going to have a main window .
The window needs to use accelerated graphics .
It also needs to respond to the player 's key presses to move our player 's ship around .
For now we can call this class Game since it represents our main game .
Disclaimer :
This tutorial is provided as is .
I do n't guarantee that the provided source is perfect or that that it provides best practices .
The final game can be see here .
The complete source for the tutorial can be found here .
Its intended that you read through this tutorial with the source code at your side .
The tutorial is n't going to cover every line of code but should give you enough to fully understand how it works .
At this stage we 're just interested in getting the screen swap and timing done , so we add a function called gameLoop that does this :
while ( gameRunning ) { // work out how long its been since the last update , this // will be used to calculate how far the entities should // move this loop long delta = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) - lastLoopTime ; lastLoopTime = System.currentTimeMillis( ) ; //
Get hold of a graphics context for the accelerated // surface and blank it out Graphics2D g = ( Graphics2D ) strategy.getDrawGraphics ( ) ; g.setColor(Color.black ) ; g.fillRect(0,0,800,600 ) ; // finally , we 've completed drawing so clear up the graphics // and flip the buffer over g.dispose ( ) ; strategy .show ( ) ; // finally pause for a bit .
Note : this should run us at about // 100 fps but on windows this might vary each loop due to // a bad implementation of timer try { Thread.sleep ( 10 ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) {} }
Sprites and Resource Management
The Sprite class
So heres the sprite class .
Essentially it just takes and holds an image which can be drawn at a specified location onto a graphics context .
public class Sprite { /**
The image to be drawn for this sprite */ private Image image ; /** * Create a new sprite based on an image * * @param image
The image that is this sprite */ public Sprite ( Image image ) { this .image = image ; } /** *
Get the width of the drawn sprite * * @return
The width in pixels of this sprite */ public int getWidth ( ) { return image.getWidth ( null ) ; } /** *
Get the height of the drawn sprite * * @return
The height in pixels of this sprite */ public int getHeight ( ) { return image.getHeight ( null ) ; } /** * Draw the sprite onto the graphics context provided * * @param g
The graphics context on which to draw the sprite * @param x
The x location at which to draw the sprite * @param y
The y location at which to draw the sprite */ public void draw ( Graphics g, int x , int y ) { g.drawImage ( image , x , y, null ) ; } }
Sprite Loading and Management
Implementing the singleton
Implementing this in our sprite store looks like this :
/**
The single instance of this class */ private static SpriteStore single = new SpriteStore ( ) ; /** *
Get the single instance of this class * * @return
The single instance of this class */ public static SpriteStore get ( ) { return single ; }
Loading the Sprites
The first step is locate the sprite :
URL url = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource ( ref ) ;
The next step is to actually load in the image .
In Java this is a simple matter of using the utility class ImageIO .
To load our image we use this code :
sourceImage = ImageIO.read ( url ) ;
Finally , we need to allocate some accelerated graphics memory to store our image in .
This will allow the image to be drawn without the CPU getting involved , we just want the graphics card to do the work for us .
Allocating the graphics memory is achieved like so :
// create an accelerated image of the right size to store our sprite in GraphicsConfiguration gc = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getDefaultScreenDevice().getDefaultConfiguration ( ) ; Image image = gc.createCompatibleImage(sourceImage.getWidth( ) , sourceImage.getHeight ( ) , Transparency .
BITMASK ) ;
// draw our source image into the accelerated image image.getGraphics ( ) .drawImage ( sourceImage,0,0,null ) ;
Caching the Sprites
// create a sprite , add it the cache then return it Sprite sprite = new Sprite ( image ) ; sprites.
put ( ref , sprite ) ;
// if we 've already got the sprite in the cache // then just return the existing version if ( sprites.get ( ref ) != null ) { return ( Sprite ) sprites.get ( ref ) ; }
Movement
// cycle round asking each entity to move itself for ( int i=0 ; i< entities.size ( ) ;i++ ) { Entity entity = ( Entity ) entities.get ( i ) ; entity.move( delta ) ; } // cycle round drawing all the entities we have in the game for ( int i=0 ; i< entities.size ( ) ;i++) { Entity entity = ( Entity ) entities.get ( i ) ; entity.draw(g ) ; }
The Entity class
Once these properties are defined we can cover the two methods that we require of Entity .
The move ( ) method looks like this :
public void move ( long delta ) { // update the location of the entity based on move speeds x += ( delta * dx ) / 1000 ; y += ( delta * dy ) / 1000 ; }
Next we need to be able to draw an Entity onto our accelerated graphics context .
draw ( ) is implemented like this :
public void draw ( Graphics g ) { sprite . draw ( g , ( int ) x , ( int ) y ) ; }
Now we 've defined our basic entity we should create a few subclasses as place - holders for some more functionality we 'll add later on .
We simply need to create the 3 subclasses of Entity ; ShipEntity , ShotEntity and AlienEntity .
For now we wo n't bother adding anything extra but it normally pays to be aware and add these things up front .
The final step is to create our entities and add them to the game world .
If we add a utility method to central Game class called initEntities ( ) .
This will initialize a set of entities at the game start .
The current implementation looks like this :
private void initEntities ( ) { // create the player ship and place it roughly in the center of the screen ship = new ShipEntity ( this , " sprites/ship.gif " ,370,550 ) ; entities.add ( ship ) ; // create a block of aliens ( 5 rows , by 12 aliens , spaced evenly ) alienCount = 0 ; for ( int row=0 ; row < 5 ; row ++ ) { for ( int x=0 ; x < 12 ; x ++ ) { Entity alien = new AlienEntity ( this , " sprites/alien.gif " ,100 +( x* 50 ) , ( 50 ) +row*30 ) ; entities.add ( alien ) ; alienCount ++ ; } } }
The second step is to create all the aliens .
We loop through creating a block of aliens .
Again each alien is just the creation of the AlienEntity positioned at the right location .
In addition we count how many aliens we 've created so we can track whether the player has won the game .
Assuming the code to support moving and displaying the entities has been added to main game loop , running the game should now show the player 's ship and a bunch of aliens .
Now each type of Entity moves in its own way and with its own constraints .
Lets look at each one .
Ship Entity
public void move ( long delta ) { // if we 're moving left and have reached the left hand side // of the screen , do n't move if ( ( dx < 0 ) && ( x < 10 ) ) { return ; } // if we 're moving right and have reached the right hand side // of the screen , do n't move if ( ( dx > 0 ) && ( x > 750 ) ) { return ; } super.move ( delta ) ; }
Shot Entity
To start the shot moving with initialize the vertical movement to a negative number based on the speed we'd like the shot to move .
The movement method itself looks like this :
public void move ( long delta ) { // proceed with normal move super.move ( delta ) ; // if we shot off the screen , remove ourselfs if (y < - 100 ) { game.removeEntity ( this ) ; } }
Alien Entity
Hopefully , we now know what we want to do , so how ?
First we initialize the movement of the aliens to start them moving to the left based on the predefined speed .
Next we put the detection of an alien hitting the side in the movement routine like this :
public void move ( long delta ) { // if we have reached the left hand side of the screen and // are moving left then request a logic update if ( ( dx < 0 ) && ( x < 10 ) ) { game.updateLogic( ) ; } // and vice vesa , if we have reached the right hand side of // the screen and are moving right , request a logic update if ( ( dx > 0 ) && ( x > 750 ) ) { game.updateLogic( ) ; } // proceed with normal move super.move ( delta ) ; }
Keyboard Input
private class KeyInputHandler extends KeyAdapter { public void keyPressed ( KeyEvent e ) { if ( e.getKeyCode ( ) == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT ) { left Pressed = true ; } if ( e.getKeyCode ( ) == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT ) { right Pressed = true ; } if ( e.getKeyCode ( ) == KeyEvent.VK_SPACE ) { firePressed = true ; } } public void keyReleased ( KeyEvent e ) { if ( e.getKeyCode ( ) == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT ) { left Pressed = false ; } if ( e.getKeyCode ( ) == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT ) { right Pressed = false ; } if ( e.getKeyCode ( ) == KeyEvent.VK_SPACE ) { firePressed = false ; } } public void keyTyped ( KeyEvent e ) { // if we hit escape , then quit the game if ( e.getKeyChar ( ) == 27 ) { System.exit(0 ) ; } } }
To make this class work we need to add it to our canvas as a " KeyListener " .
This is done by adding the following line to the constructor of our Game class :
addKeyListener ( new KeyInputHandler ( ) ) ;
With this source code in place the boolean flags will be set to appropriate values as the keys are pressed .
The next step is to respond to these boolean flags being set in the game loop .
If we add this in the game loop we can add keyboard control to the ship :
// resolve the movement of the ship .
First assume the ship // is n't moving .
If either cursor key is pressed then // update the movement appropriately ship.setHorizontalMovement(0 ) ; if ( ( leftPressed ) && ( !rightPressed ) ) { ship.setHorizontalMovement(- moveSpeed ) ; } else if ( ( rightPressed ) && ( ! leftPressed ) ) { ship.setHorizontalMovement( moveSpeed ) ; }
If the player holds the fire key we'd like the ship to fire a shot up towards the aliens .
However , we do n't want to let the player just keep firing .
It 'd be good to limit how often they can fire .
We 'll put this functionality in a utility method called ( somewhat logically ) " tryToFire ( ) "
// if we 're pressing fire , attempt to fire if ( firePressed ) { tryToFire ( ) ; }
public void tryToFire ( ) { // check that we have waiting long enough to fire if ( System.currentTimeMillis ( ) - lastFire < firing Interval ) { return ; } // if we waited long enough , create the shot entity , and record the time .
last Fire = System.currentTimeMillis( ) ; ShotEntity shot = new ShotEntity ( this , " sprites/shot.gif " , ship.getX( ) +10 , ship.getY ( ) - 30 ) ; entities.add ( shot ) ; }
Collision Detection
First , we 'll need to implement a check to resolve whether two entities have in fact collided .
We 'll do this in the Entity class like this :
public boolean collidesWith ( Entity other ) { me.setBounds (( int ) x , ( int ) y , sprite.getWidth( ) , sprite.getHeight ( ) ) ; him.setBounds (( int ) other.x , ( int ) other.y, other.sprite.getWidth( ) , other.sprite.getHeight ( ) ) ; return me.intersects ( him ) ; }
First we configure the two rectangles to represent the two entities .
Next we use the inbuilt functionality of java .
awt .
Rectangle to check if the two entities intersect with each other .
This is n't the smartest way to do this by any means , but for our purposes it will be good enough .
The next thing we 'll add is a way to notify entities that they have collided with another .
To do this we 'll add a method like this to the Entity class :
public abstract void collidedWith ( Entity other ) ;
ShipEntity
public void collidedWith ( Entity other ) { // if its an alien , notify the game that the player // is dead if ( other instanceof AlienEntity ) { game.notifyDeath ( ) ; } }
ShotEntity
public void collidedWith ( Entity other ) { // if we 've hit an alien , kill it ! if ( other instanceof AlienEntity ) { // remove the affected entities game.removeEntity ( this ) ; game.removeEntity ( other ) ; // notify the game that the alien has been killed game.notifyAlienKilled ( ) ; } }
Game Loop Additions
// brute force collisions , compare every entity against // every other entity .
If any of them collide notify // both entities that the collision has occurred for ( int p=0;p<entities.size ( ) ; p++ ) { for ( int s=p+1;s<entities.size ( ) ;s++) { Entity me = ( Entity ) entities.get ( p ) ; Entity him = ( Entity ) entities.get (s ) ; if ( me.collidesWith ( him ) ) { me.collidedWith( him ) ; him.collidedWith( me ) ; } } }
A smarter way to do this might be to check for the collisions only every so often .
It might also be nice to have a flag on an entity whether it should detect collisions .
Game Logic
notifyDeath ( )
notifyWin ()
notifyAlienKilled ()
public void notifyAlienKilled ( ) { // reduce the alien count , if there are none left , the player has won !
alienCount --; if ( alienCount == 0 ) { notifyWin ( ) ; } // if there are still some aliens left then they all need to get faster , so // speed up all the existing aliens for ( int i=0 ; i< entities.size ( ) ;i++) { Entity entity = ( Entity ) entities .get ( i ) ; if ( entity instanceof AlienEntity ) { // speed up by 2 % entity.setHorizontalMovement(entity.getHorizontalMovement ( ) * 1.02 ) ; } } }
The last step we need is to support entity based game logic .
We implied the requirement when building the AlienEntity .
When a single alien detects the edge of the screen we want all the aliens to change direction .
To support this we 're going to add two sections of code .
Entity Logic
public void doLogic ( ) { // swap over horizontal movement and move down the // screen a bit dx = - dx ; y += 10 ; // if we 've reached the bottom of the screen then the player // dies if ( y > 570 ) { game.notifyDeath ( ) ; } }
Entity Logic Infrastructure
public void updateLogic ( ) { logicRequired ThisLoop = true ; }
// if a game event has indicated that game logic should // be resolved , cycle round every entity requesting that // their personal logic should be considered . if ( logicRequiredThisLoop ) { for ( int i=0 ; i< entities.size ( ) ;i++ ) { Entity entity = ( Entity ) entities.get ( i ) ; entity.doLogic( ) ; } logicRequired ThisLoop = false ; }

It ’s a sad day for me as I can remember when I was a kid growing up in Queens , NY , my parents would take me to Coney Island for its Famous Nathan Hot Dogs , Amusement Park and Boardwalk .
Coney Island says good - bye after 36 years .
The owner of Coney Island ’s Astroland said yesterday she is calling it quits and the historic amusement park will close for good on Sunday September 7th .
Carol Albert , whose family has owned the Brooklyn amusement park for almost a half century , said she gave up on negotiating a two - year lease with Thor Equities after the developer missed the deadline to reply .
Thor spokesman Stefan Friedman said the company is “ extremely disappointed that Carol Albert has decided to give up on the future of Coney Island when her current lease is n’t even up for a number of months . ”
The park was under threat of closing a year ago , but Thor — which owns the land under the park — and Astroland agreed to a one - year lease extension .

Lew Rockwell had a post up yesterday titled " Ron Paul Republicans Drop Prefix . "
There were a few in the MA delegation that did the same thing , the night after the big vote .
Today , I also have an announcement for all of my friends out there in Internetland .
This morning I did something similar .
Instead of dropping the prefix however , I dropped the suffix .
I am a Republican no more .
To be clear , I joined the Republican party for one reason and one reason only , and that was to support Dr. Paul ’s presidential bid .
I ’m not a joiner .
I do n’t like being part of ideologically driven groups , and certainly not this one ( I mean the national GOP here , not my brothers and sisters in the MA delegation who I stand by ) , not after what I saw at the convention .
I simply cannot stomach being a voluntary member of what I perceive to be a bullying , morally and spiritually bankrupt organization focused solely on appearance over substance .
Our current two - party system is nothing more than an elaborate hoax .
It is a divide - and - conquer strategy against the American people , doing little more than creating false divisions among us  the more the better  to get us hating and mistrusting one another .
I saw it all first - hand at the convention , though the negotiations of the infamous deal ,  and in conversations with other Republicans , delegates and strategists .
Politics is a game of deception : Look over here at the war while the economy goes down the tubes .
Trust me 
I ’m on your side ( until I screw you ) .
My involvement in Ron Paul ’s campaign began as a political quest , but it has grown into a spiritual one .
One of the most important things I ’ve taken away from the last 18 months is ( surprised ? ) personal freedom and liberty .
Without understanding the nature of personal freedom and liberty , we cannot ever hope to build a free nation .
Like Ron Paul , I will never abandon the cause of Liberty , but I choose to fight it from outside the bounds of the Republican Party .
Can you imagine if Gandhi , or Martin Luther King felt than in order to change their countries , they had to do it from within the confines of the existing political system ?
What if they said ,  I ’ll start working my way up , beginning with the post of Town committeeman . 
As Dr. Paul said at the end of his speech at the Rally  this movement is much bigger than the Republican party , or the Democratic party or the Libertarian party .
Please understand that I am not here to say that working inside the GOP is bad or wrong or being a sellout .
I do n’t believe that .
Like Dr. Paul , I do n’t want to control your life , or coerce you into thinking that I know what the best path is for you .
There is only one person who knows that , and that is you .

Pro-impeachment group sues over ' Free Speech Zones ' at Republican convention
Impeach for Peace , a Minnesota - based group which plans to demonstrate at the upcoming Republican National Convention at St. Paul 's Xcel Energy Center , has sued for space to demonstrate within sight and hearing of convention attendees .
Backed by the ACLU , the group calls the designated spaces to demonstrate " inadequate and unacceptably small , " and too far from the venue to allow for free speech to be effectively executed .
The City Council and police also denied Impeach for Peace their due process , such as a window for public comment and public hearing , by not giving notice of the restrictions to be placed on demonstrators , the suit alleges .
In addition , the city has reserved the right to change its guidelines at any time in ways that the ACLU contends violates the Minnesota State Constitution .

Note : Updated plan available .
The updated version of this design is at HBS2 Building Plan on Gerardo P. Baron 's website .
This Appropedia page has not yet been updated .
The design of most biogas systems can be traced to either the China Fixed Dome ( CFD ) 6 + million in-use or the India Floating Cover ( IFC ) 2.9 + million in-use .
The Philippine BioDigester Home Biogas System [ edit ]
CFD ( 6+ Million in use )
IFC ( 2.9 + Million in use )
The Philippine BioDigester Home Biogas System ( HBS ) [ 2 ] is a product of both designs .
It is :
Easier to build Less expensive , and Simpler to operate and maintain ( clean & repair )
It can be built as a :
Do -It - Yourself ( DIY ) project where expert masonry skills are not required
using common and inexpensive materials available anywhere .
Biogas production from pig manure where 1 - 2 pigs excrete 1L ( L=liter )
20L / day = 250 Pesos [ 3 ] biogas / month 40L / day = 500 Pesos [ 3 ] biogas / month 60L / day = 750 Pesos [ 3 ] biogas / month
The plan described here is for an 8 cubic meter digester .
It can produce up to 1,000 Pesos [ 3 ] / month of biogas from 80L / day of pig manure .
Recommended Biogas Fueled BURNERS
Other advantages of the HBS [ edit ]
Does not need a concrete dome that is difficult to build , expensive and prone to leaks .
Does not need a floating ( metal ) cover that corrodes , is expensive and difficult to operate .
Does not need a stirring system that corrodes , is laborious and prone to leakage .
The HBS has a simple sediment removal process that is easy and convenient to operate .
The HBS can be located closer to the kitchen or place where the gas will be used to minimize piping problems like clogging and leaks .
Construction Instructions [ edit ]
( Before begining construction , view the " Start - up Instructions " below for some prep operations . )
Select a location for the HBS close to where the gas will be used .
( We recommend collecting manure and bringing it to the HBS for feeding . )
Choose a location away from trees whose roots can break the digester walls .
( Min area : 2.5 mtr x 3.0 mtr )
Dig the ground 2.5 m x 2.5 m wide and 2.0 m deep .
Build the footings and reinforced concrete slab .
Build the reinforced CHB walls .
Upon reaching ground level , layout CHB walls for outlet compartment so that CHB and rebar interlocks are maintained .
( Do not install all CHB for outlet compartment .
See instructions below regarding cover installation . )
The HBS has a below ground section of about 1.6 mtr and an above - ground section of 1.0 mtr .
( This UNIQUE feature expedites sediment removal as described later in operation & maintenance . )
After the CHB walls have dried , install the inlet , outlet and other pipes .
Pipe locations may be changed to same or adjacent sides if preferred or needed .
Install anchor bolts on the outside wall .
Build the concrete slab for the outlet compartment and plaster the inside and outside walls .
Use plaster mixture with a water sealer like Sahara .
Cut the 6 ” orange PVC pipes in half and lay them on the CHB blocks .
Place elbows ( also cut in half ) on the corners .
Grout as needed to keep them in - place .
( This is to protect cover material from sharp edges . )
Clean the surfaces of the halved 6 ” orange PVC pipes and ay the HBS cover as if installing a table cloth .
At the outside CHB wall section , where the anchor bolts are located , apply a 6 ” to 8 ” wide strip of sealant like Vulca - Seal .
Ensure good sealant & plaster adhesion .
Remember , after the cover material is sandwiched between the outside plaster and the wood plank , the sealant must create a gas - tight seal .
On the wall adjacent to the outlet compartment , it is best that some CHB was omitted earlier to allow for HBS cover installation .
Install the omitted CHB after the cover .
Start - Up Instructions [ edit ]
Inoculant Preparation :
Three weeks before construction , place 100L of manure in a 200L drum and mix thoroughly with 50L to 100L of water .
Preparing more is better if possible .
Upon completion of HBS ( all surfaces are fully dried ) , pour all the innoculant prepared into the HBS .
Keep adding manure ( thoroughly dissolved in water with 1:1 ratio ) into the HBS until the outlet compartment is half full .
With biogas outlet valve closed , after a few days , the HBS cover must begin to bulge ( indicating it is filling up with gas .
Try lighting or burning the gas produced .
It should not ignite during the first few days or weeks as the gas produced is CO2 and not biogas .
CO2 will actually extinguish flames or fire .
Keep adding manure daily as needed .
Feeding may be skipped occasionally , with no adverse effect .

Operation and Maintenance [ edit ]
Flame may be visible in dim light ...
But flame may disappear in bright light !
Eventually ( sooner if more inoculant was added and later if little or no inoculant was added at the start ) biogas will be produced indicated by a fire or flame being lighted .
Warning :
The fire or flame produced may be invisible .
( see picture . )
Clogging : Run a gas pipe from the HBS to a burner such the pipe is progressively inclined .
Biogas contains water vapor that condenses and collects in cavities that will hamper flow .
Gas -Piping : Use the thicker 3/4 ” or 1.0 ” black PE water piping material ( available in rolls in most hardware stores ) and PE fittings and valves wherever possible .
Unclogging : Occasionally , it may be necessary to lift sections of the gas pipe to flow accumulated condensate back into the HBS or the burner .
Biogas Burners :
See the pictures for the recommended burners .
Do not use original valve and gas orifice .
Replace those parts with a 1/ 4 ” or 3/8 ” pipe nipple connected by bushings to 1/2 ” or 3/4 ” plastic ball valve to allow high biogas flow into the burner .
Sediment Removal : Do NOT cement ( with PVC solvent or cement ) the elbow on the EXIT PIPE .
This elbow must be able to rotate on the pipe from the outlet compartment .
After biogas is produced , the EXIT PIPE must be set at angled position to allow excess effluent to flow out when the HBS is fed .
On a scheduled basis , like once a week , the EXIT PIPE may be fully rotated to expel sediment accumulated in the outlet compartment .
The sediment or sludge may be used as an organic fertilizer .
For LATEST MODIFICATIONS & INSTRUCTIONS , ASSISTANCE or QUESTIONS , please email , call or text biogas.works@gmail.com as shown below before building .

Things That Podcaster ’s Rejection From the App Store Is Not About
Daniel Dilger has a piece on Roughly Drafted today arguing that Apple ’s rejection of Podcaster from the App Store should not have been a surprise , and in fact should have been expected under section 3.3.3 of the iPhone SDK Agreement .
This is such bullshit it hurts my head .
Dilger quotes from section 3.3.3 of the iPhone SDK Agreement .
It reads :
3.3.3 — Without Apple ’s prior written approval , an Application may not provide , unlock or enable additional features or functionality through distribution mechanisms other than the iTunes Store .
This section of the agreement is clearly not about content distribution .
It ’s about application distribution .
It ’s a way of saying that you ca n’t distribute your app through the App Store as a free demo and then charge to unlock the full version using a non-iTunes service such as PayPal or Kagi .
Podcast downloads are neither “ additional features ” nor “ functionality ” .
And if this guideline did mean that audio content can only be distributed through iTunes , it would rule out a slew of apps that are in the App Store already .
AOL Radio and Pandora both stream music and other audio over the network , directly to your iPhone .
File storage / viewer apps such as FileMagnet and ( today ’s aforelinked )
Air Sharing let you transfer audio and video files to and from your iPhone , and offer playback on the iPhone .
Via email and in comments elsewhere on the web , I ’ve also seen it argued that Podcaster was rejected out of cell network bandwidth concerns .
No way .
First , it ’s not the reason Apple gave Podcaster developer Alex Sokirynsky .
Second , if it were the reason , Apple could have simply asked Sokirynsky to restrict Podcaster to Wi-Fi only .
It is trivial for an iPhone application to restrict itself to Wi-Fi only or to behave differently when using the cell network .
( For example , the guidelines expressly prohibit VOIP features , but only over the cell network . )
But even that does n’t hold up .
Apple ’s own YouTube app will download as much video as you want over the cell network .
So does the MLB At Bat app .
Yes , both YouTube and MLB At Bat request lower - quality video over the cell network than they do over Wi -Fi , but it ’s still video .
And the AOL and Pandora apps stream audio non -stop over the cell network .
Podcaster , so far as I can tell , complies with every written guideline in the SDK Agreement .
If other guidelines exist , Apple should add them to the agreement .
It does n’t even make sense from a thou shalt not hurt Apple ’s music revenue stream standpoint .
Podcaster is different than , say , a hypothetical buy and download music over the air iPhone client for Amazon ’s Music Store .
( I ’d argue that Apple should allow that , but at least if they did n’t , there ’d be a clear financial impetus behind the decision . )
But Podcaster allows over - the - air downloading of free content .
It makes no sense .
The point is not that Apple ca n’t reject apps arbitrarily .
They can .
Elsewhere in the SDK Agreement is a more or less wildcard clause that grants
Apple the right to reject apps — and remove apps which were previously accepted — for whatever reasons it chooses .
The point is n’t about what Apple can do but what they should do .
And they should n’t be doing this .
CORRECTED 5 p.m. : Spelling of Leslie Rahl .
So where were the quants ?
That ’s what has been running through my head as I watch some of the oldest and seemingly best - run firms on Wall Street implode because of what turned out to be really bad bets on mortgage securities .
Before I started covering the Internet in 1997 , I spent 13 years covering trading and finance .
I covered my share of trading disasters from junk bonds , mortgage securities and the financial blank canvas known as derivatives .
And I got to know bunch of quantitative analysts ( “ quants ” ) : mathematicians , computer scientists and economists who were working on Wall Street to develop the art and science of risk management .
They were developing systems that would comb through all of a firm ’s positions , analyze everything that might go wrong and estimate how much it might lose on a really bad day .
We ’ve had some bad days lately , and it turns out Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and maybe some others bet far too much .
Their quants did n’t save them .
I called some old timers in the risk - management world to see what went wrong .
I fully expected them to tell me that the problem was that the alarms were blaring and red lights were flashing on the risk machines and greedy Wall Street bosses ignored the warnings to keep the profits flowing .
Ultimately , the people who ran the firms must take responsibility , but it was n’t quite that simple .
In fact , most Wall Street computer models radically underestimated the risk of the complex mortgage securities , they said .
That is partly because the level of financial distress is “ the equivalent of the 100 - year flood , ” in the words of Leslie Rahl , the president of Capital Market Risk Advisors , a consulting firm .
But she and others say there is more to it :
The people who ran the financial firms chose to program their risk - management systems with overly optimistic assumptions and to feed them oversimplified data .
This kept them from sounding the alarm early enough .
Top bankers could n’t simply ignore the computer models , because after the last round of big financial losses , regulators now require them to monitor their risk positions .
Indeed , if the models say a firm ’s risk has increased , the firm must either reduce its bets or set aside more capital as a cushion in case things go wrong .
In other words , the computer is supposed to monitor the temperature of the party and drain the punch bowl as things get hot .
And just as drunken revelers may want to put the thermostat in the freezer , Wall Street executives had lots of incentives to make sure their risk systems did n’t see much risk .
“ There was a willful designing of the systems to measure the risks in a certain way that would not necessarily pick up all the right risks , ” said Gregg Berman , the co-head of the risk - management group at RiskMetrics , a software company spun out of JPMorgan .
“ They wanted to keep their capital base as stable as possible so that the limits they imposed on their trading desks and portfolio managers would be stable . ”
One way they did this , Mr. Berman said , was to make sure the computer models looked at several years of trading history instead of just the last few months .
The most important models calculate a measure known as Value at Risk — the amount of money you might lose in the worst plausible situation .
They try to figure out what that worst case is by looking at how volatile markets have been in the past .
But since the markets were placid for several years ( as mortgage bankers busily lent money to anyone with a pulse ) , the computers were slow to say that risk had increased as defaults started to rise .
It was like a weather forecaster in Houston last weekend talking about the onset of Hurricane Ike by giving the average wind speed for the previous month .
But many on Wall Street did even worse , as Mr. Berman describes it .
They continued to trade very complex securities concocted by their most creative bankers even though their risk management systems were n’t able to understand the details of what they owned .
A lot of deals were nonstandard in many ways , “ so you really had to go through the entire prospectus and read every single line to pick up all the nuances , ” Mr. Berman said .
“ And that slows down the process when mortgage yields looked very attractive . ”
So some trading desks took the most arcane security , made of slices of mortgages , and entered it into the computer if it were a simple bond with a set interest rate and duration .
This seemed only like a tiny bit of corner - cutting because the credit - rating agencies declared that some of these securities were triple - A. ( 20/20 hindsight : not ! )
But once the mortgage market started to deteriorate , the computers were not able to identify all the parts of the portfolio that might be hurt .
Lying to your risk - management computer is like lying to your doctor .
You just are n’t going to get the help you really need .
All this is not to say that the models would have gotten things right if only they were fed the most accurate information .
Ms. Rahl said that it was now clear that the computers needed to assume extra risk in owning a newfangled security that had never been seen before .
“ New products , by definition , carry more risk , ” she said .
The models should penalize investments that are complex , hard to understand and infrequently traded , she said .
They did n’t .
“ One of the things that has caused great pain is complex products , ” Ms. Rahl said .
That made me think back to some of the great trading debacles of the last century , such as the collapse of Askin Capital Management , a hedge fund that fell apart because of complex mortgage security investments gone bad .
Was n’t the moral of those stories that you should n’t put your money ( or your client ’s money ) in something you did n’t understand ?
Furthermore , even if you are convinced you do understand it , you ’re not going to be able to sell it when you need the money if no one else does .
“ In some ways there is nothing new , ” said Ms. Rahl , who helped investigate what went wrong at Askin .
“ The big deals are front - page news , then they go into the recesses of people ’s memories . ”
And , ultimately , the most important risk - management systems are the ones that have gray hair .
“ It ’s not just the Ph.D. ’s who must run risk management , ” Ms. Rahl said .
“ It is the people who know the markets and have lifelong perspective . ”
And at too many firms it is those people who failed to make sure the quants really did their jobs .
When the online virtual world Second Life first got hot a couple of years ago , Dell was among the companies that joined the craze .
The computer giant built four islands : a factory where users could build custom PCs , a theater , a model of Michael Dell ’s dorm room , and a nursery promoting a plant - a- tree program .
“ We learned right away that maintaining these areas requires a lot of resources , ” says Laura Thomas , an e-business consultant at Dell who headed the efforts .
Of course , if customers had followed , there would have been no problem , but “ there was n’t enough usage of the space to justify the resources needed to keep it dynamic . ”
Dell dismantled the factory last year , right alongside dozens of other companies that scrambled to stanch their bleeding Second Life budget line items .
Second Life was over before it had begun .
Linden Labs , its creator , was surprisingly sanguine about companies fleeing .
“ Our focus has been to build technology that enables users and then stand back and watch what people do , instead of supporting a particular use of Second Life , ” says Glenn Fisher , Linden ’s director of business programs .
At the sametime , Joni West , a feisty San Francisco - based fine artist and business - development consultant , stepped into the breach .
“ I saw all these huge virtual spaces — Adidas , Starwood Hotels , Dell — and they were all empty , ” says West , 47 .
“ It was ridiculous . ”
In just two years , West has rewritten the rules of corporate marketing on Second Life .
An avid user of the site , she realized that billboards , commercials , and streaming video — the all - too - common troika populating most corporate islands — fell flat among hypercreative users who wanted to interact .
Instead , she concluded , companies should try to spark user - to - user discussion — a surprisingly cost - effective option on Second Life .
This insight has produced successful initiatives for clients such as Sun Microsystems , Overstock.com , and Nestlé , and made West ’s firm , This Second Marketing , the leader in shepherding name - brand companies back to the virtual world .
West stumbled into the business potential of Second Life while pursuing her passion for fineart .
“ I thought it would be fabulous to create a virtual art gallery where I could bring people from all around the world , ” she says .
One day , she was sitting a Second Life art gallery couch , doing just that — talking to people from various countries — and she had their rapt attention .
“ At that point , I realized how powerful one - on - one engagement could be in Second Life . ”
West used techniques gleaned from 25 years of marketing experience , including digital and email campaigns , to woo potential clients .
She calmly explained that the previous failures of Second Life were a result of not harnessing the medium appropriately to reach its 14 million users , up to 66,000 of whom are present at any time .
“ I describe the mistake companies made like this : Imagine you ’ve never been to Manhattan .
You cross the George Washington Bridge , and someone hands you a guidebook .
The first place you ’re going is not the Reebok store . ”
Translation : Second Life is not a place to make sales .
It ’s also a venue where large companies do n’t have to spend $ 3 million to build an elaborate island when $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 , usedjudiciously , can have a much larger impact .
Linden Labs concurs .
“ New marketers often try to imitate another medium , ” says Ginsu Yoon , Linden ’s VP of business affairs .
“ Second Life is n’t TV or radio or even the Internet , all of which push information out one way . ”
The topic was Sen. John McCain ’s vice presidential pick , and talk show host Laura Ingraham was on a roll .
Accepting an award from the Republican National Coalition for Life on behalf of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who was under wraps working on her convention speech , Ingraham chastised anyone who would suggest that Palin is not up to the job .
As a pro-life working mother of five , including a special needs infant and a pregnant 17 - year - old , Ingraham said , “ Sarah Palin represents a new feminism .
. . .
And there is no bigger threat to the elites in this country than a woman who lives her conservative convictions . ”
That was the prevailing mood in the Twin Cities this week , as convention - going Republicans expressed delight that Palin , a newcomer to the national stage , would shore up McCain ’s conservative flank .
But her selection , and her unusual family situation , launched a thousand other conversations outside the partisan bubble .

Chatter ranged from what it must do to a 17 - year - old to have her unplanned pregnancy announced to the world to whether discussion of Palin ’s decision to run , given her weighty family obligations , is fair or whether it plays into outdated stereotypes about the perils of working motherhood .
“ The mom part of me says how did this woman expect to run for vice president with a 4 - month - old baby with a disability and a 17 - year - old about to have a baby of her own ? ” said Debra Haffner , a Unitarian minister and sex educator from Westport , Conn. , who has educated parents on teenage sexuality for nearly three decades .
“ It ’s not a feminist perspective . . . but there are times when you put your professional aspirations on hold , and this seems like it might be one of them . ”
She said she thinks Palin has brought such scrutiny on herself .
“ I think when you keep proudly saying ‘ I ’m a hockey mom of five ’ . . . you open your own parenting practice up for consideration . ”
Palin has raised the issue herself .
In 2004 , she told the Anchorage Daily News that she decided not to run for the U.S. Senate because her teenage son opposed it .
Advertisement
“ How could I be the team mom if I was a U.S. senator ? ” she asked .
Talking with reporters Monday , McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt took offense at the idea that Palin might have trouble juggling the vice presidency and her family obligations .
“ Frankly , ” he said , “ I ca n’t imagine that question being asked of a man .
I think it ’s offensive , and I think a lot of women will find it offensive . ”
In an interview Wednesday with Katie Couric , prospective first lady Cindy McCain defended Palin and echoed Schmidt : “ She will be a marvelous vice president , and she is already a marvelous mother .
. . .
I think most of the people asking the questions would n’t be asking this if it were a man . ”

Later , Cindy McCain nodded strenuously when the Wednesday keynote speaker , former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , reacted with outrage to the question of Palin ’s balancing act .
“ When do they ever ask a man that question ? ” he asked .
In fact , the question was asked of a man in March 2007 , when John Edwards , the father of two school - aged children and an adult daughter , announced that his wife , Elizabeth , had terminal cancer .
He continued to pursue the Democratic presidential nomination , which sparked a national conversation about whether a man confronting the death of a spouse and single fatherhood would be able to meet the demands of the presidency .
At the time , one Republican strategist said that Elizabeth Edwards ’ illness would put a strain on her husband ’s ability to wage a campaign .
Advertisement
“ The political marketplace may conclude that he may not be viable because of the distraction , ” he said .
Others look no further than the Democratic ticket for evidence that family strains -- even grievous ones -- can coexist with federal office .
“ Look at Joe Biden , ” said Deborah Roffman , a Baltimore human sexuality educator .
“ His life story involved child care too . ”
Biden ’s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 , just after he was elected , at age 29 , to the Senate .
His two sons were severely injured in the accident .
Biden was sworn into office at their bedside , and his schedule accommodated their recovery needs .
Eventually , he ended up commuting daily between Wilmington , Del. , and Washington .
Debbie Walsh , director for the Rutgers Center for the American Woman and Politics , said Palin had already been caught in a bind between her political obligations and her family .
That happened when she and her husband , Todd , issued a news release announcing that their daughter Bristol was pregnant .
Advertisement
“ It ’s terrible , like a Sophie ’s choice situation , where you are in this horrible position as a mother , ” said Walsh , “ to feel that you have to reveal this piece of information about your daughter and not just to a few people in your family but to the national press corps ? ”
Pepper Schwartz , a University of Washington sociologist , agreed that the parenting questions came up more readily for Palin because she is a woman .
“ I ’m all for being a working mom , ” Schwartz said .
“ But I do have a sense from having two children how totally unsuited and uncapable I would be with five . ”
But Phyllis Schlafly , the 84 - year - old archetypal anti-feminist , thinks people fretting about whether Palin can do it all should just pipe down .
Advertisement
“ People who do n’t have children , or who only have one or two , do n’t comprehend what it ’s like to have five , ” said Schlafly , who was on the convention floor this week .
“ I had six children , ” Schlafly said .
“ I ran for Congress .
An organized mother puts it all together .
The time management mother uses the older ones to help with the younger ones .
You should read that old book ‘ Cheaper by the Dozen . ’ ”

Impeachment a hot topic at ' not Impeachment ' hearing Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 25 , 2008
Print This Email This
After spending long hours , sometimes late into the night , making his case for impeachment before a nearly barren House chamber , Rep. Dennis Kucinich finally got more of an audience for his case against President Bush Friday .
Even though Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers insisted early on that the panel 's evaluation of Bush 's " imperial presidency " was decidedly not an impeachment hearing , the prospect was not far from many minds during the six hours of testimony .
Kucinich formally introduced his articles of impeachment into the record of the committees proceedings -- although he did not utter the dreaded I - word , instead referring to the resolutions by their more legalistic titles " H. Res. 333 , H. Res. 1258 and H. Res. 1345 . "
A committee aide tells RAW STORY that members were cautioned to abide by the Rules of the House , which prohibit lawmakers from " impugning " the president 's character during official debate .
Some apparently took this to mean they could not explicitly call for Bush ' impeachment .
None of this would stop Republicans from accusing the committee 's majority of seeking just that .
The prepared text of Conyers opening remarks referred to Congress 's " power to impeach . "
When he spoke before the committee , Conyers modified that line to the " power to remove through the constitutional process " officials who abused their powers .
Kucinich was similarly circumspect in his testimony to the committee .
" The question for Congress is this : what responsibility does the President and members of his Administration have for that unnecessary , unprovoked and unjustified war ? " he asked .
" The rules of the House prevent me or any witness from utilizing familiar terms .
But we can put two and two together in our minds .
We can draw inferences about culpability .
... " I ask this committee to think , and then to act , in order to enable this Congress to right a very great wrong and to hold accountable those who misled this nation , " he concluded .
Kucinich 's colleague Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) was far more straightforward .
" Based on all of the things this administration has done , it is probably the most impeachable administration in the history of America ,  said Hinchey , who appeared alongside Kucinich and North Carolina Reps .
Walter Jones and Brad Miller .
The New York lawmaker even accused the administration of deliberately letting America 's No. 1 enemy escape after 9/11 .
" I think it is very clear they did not want to capture bin Laden , " Hinchey told the committee .
That Hinchey referred to " they " was no accident .
House rules forbid direct attacks on the president 's individual character or motives , so most of the witnesses were sure to couch ther criticisms as aimed at members of the administration generally .
Hinchey explained his assertion to Politico .
" I think the evidence indicates that very clearly ... bin Laden was close to being captured [ in December 2001 ] , there was a clear understanding of where he was , heading up to Tora Bora , in those mountains .
He could have been captured , " Hinchey said .
" But there was a decision that was made through the Pentagon , and probably that decision had been made outside the Pentagon as well , within the administration , not to aggressively pursue bin Laden . "
Hinchey added : " I believe that the reason for that was that if bin Laden had been captured , it would have been very difficult , if not impossible , for this administration to then justify an attack against another country .
Not Afghanistan , another country .
And , of course , Iraq is the country .
So I think that it was clear , based upon all of the evidence that we have , that this was a purposeful decision that was made not to capture bin Laden . "
In his opening statement Friday , Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , a Kucinich ally in his push 's for impeachment , also threw caution to the wind , outlining an array of Bush administration abuses , he said " certainly include high crimes " including ordering illegal torture and authorizing warrantless wiretapping .
" I am convinced the most appropriate response ... is to hold hearings for impeachment , " Wexler said .
Similarly undeterred from mentioning impeachment was Rep. Hank Johnson ( D - TX ) , who echoed Wexler 's sentiment and warned of the potential consequences of not pursuing impeachment now .
" If this administration during the last 6 months decides to attack the sovereign nation of Iran , " he said , " then Americans will look back and think and rethink whether it would have been worth pursuing impeachment at this time , to deter any further misdoing by this administration . "
Committee Republicans were n't having any of the Democrats ' hesitance .
" These are impeachment hearings before the United States Congress , " said Rep. Steve King ( R - IA ) , pointing out that Conyers 's essentially called for impeachment himself even if he did n't precisely say the word .
Several other Republicans echoed the same sentiment , defending Bush from accusations of " high crimes and misdemeanors " that were n't actually the primary issue Friday .
" To the regret of many , this is not an impeachment hearing , " Conyers said , pointing out that the full House has not voted to authorize such an inquiry as House rules require .
Hundreds gather for hearing More than 100 spectators , including dozens of representatives of anti-war group Code Pink , began assembling outside the hearing room more than an hour before the hearing began .
The Capitol Hill hearing room was packed to capacity , leaving dozens of activists out in the hallway , unable to enter ; some chanted " Shame ! " or " We want in ! "
The hearing began about 15 minutes after its scheduled start time with Conyers 's opening statement .
" We know the executive branch can and does overreach during times of war , " Conyers said .
" As one who was included on President Nixon 's enemies list , I am all too familiar with the specter of an unchecked executive branch .
And the risks to our citizens ' rights are even graver today , as the war on terror has no specific end point . "
More than a dozen witnesses were scheduled to testify , beginning with Kucinich , who accuses Bush and Cheney of lying to Congress in their pursuit of war in Iraq , among a host of other abuses .
" The decision before us is whether Congress will endorse with its silence the methods used to take us into the Iraq war , " Kucinich will say , according to his prepared testimony .
" The decision before us is whether to demand accountability for one of the gravest injustices imaginable . "
The committee 's top Republican , Lamar Smith , mocked the proceedings , comparing them to last month 's hearing featuring former White House spokesman Scott McClellan , who recently wrote a tell - all memoir about his time as Bush 's spokesman .
" If last month it appeared we hosted a ' book of the month club , ' this week it seems that we are hosting an anger management class , " Smith said .
" Nothing is going to come out of this hearing with regard to impeachment of the President .
I know it , the media knows it , even the Speaker knows it .
...
This hearing will not cause us to impeach the President ; it will only serve to impeach our own credibility . "
The American Civil Liberties union praised Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers for convening Friday 's hearing .
" Every year this administration has been in power has compounded the damage to our ideals and Constitution , " Caroline Fredrickson , director the ACLU 's Washington legislative office , said in a press release .
" An executive branch that demands and holds too much power tips the scales of our system of checks and balances . "

She thought about it for four years .
She wanted to try it , but kept balking .
“ I was scared , ” says Francine Choi , a Los Angeles County employee who lives in Long Beach .
“ I was worried I ’d get mugged . ”
And then a couple months ago , filling her BMW at a Chevron near work , she gasped when she saw the total pass $ 60 .
Then and there , she summoned the courage to do it at last .
Choi rode the Metro Blue Line to work the next day .
“ Now I take naps on the way home ” says Choi , 45 , extolling the light - rail line between downtown L.A. and Long Beach and the $ 150 or so she saves by riding it every month .

With gas prices shooting into orbit , mass transit ridership is trending upward -- barely .
Car culture has stubborn roots in Southern California .
The vast majority of Southern Californians are holding tenaciously to the privacy and convenience of their own cars , over the crush of humanity on the region ’s trains and buses .
But longtime riders notice more professionals aboard a system that has mostly served low - income workers who do n’t have the option to drive .
Now the parking structure at the Willow Street stop in Long Beach is full by 8:30 a.m. -- and spaces used to go empty all day .
Some of the riders are not so much new to the system as they are nagged by gas prices to take it more often .

Bryanne Sykes , 50 , decided six months ago to take it every day .
She parks her Volvo S60 in the spillover parking lot at the Willow station , a good quarter - mile walk to the train .
She scrambles to get a seat on the west side , knowing that the sun beats through the windows on the east side during summer .
“ You ride and you start strategizing , ” she says .
Sykes , a student advisor at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising , has been riding the train periodically for 10 years .
But the extra half - hour or so it took her to get to and from work in downtown Los Angeles always put her back in her car .
When her children were young , she could n’t spare the time .
Now , her youngest is in high school and she does n’t need to race home .
As gas prices climbed , her resolve hardened .
She saves about $ 180 a month in gas , minus the $ 62 for a monthly Metro pass .

She loves being able to read the paper and does n’t mind having to park farther away , with all the new riders .
In fact , she is elated that she lost 10 pounds walking about three miles a day to and from her stations .
And the broader spectrum of riders eases what for some is a stigma -- that the train is full of gangbangers and homeless people .
“ The good thing with gas getting more expensive is , more and more people are riding it , ” says Sykes .
In the past , when she got back to Long Beach about 9 p.m. , the lonely walk to her car , down a dark street between the tracks and a park , was eerie .
“ I would stay on the phone with my husband as I walked , ” she said .
“ In the last month , it ’s me and 10 other people with briefcases and computers , ” she says .

Ridership on Metro buses and trains has risen steadily since January , but has yet to surpass the ridership before a rate increase cut passenger numbers last July .
Average weekday boardings on Metro buses were 1.12 million in January , and 1.26 million in May , when the last available statistics were taken .
But May 2006 saw 1.31 million average weekday boardings .
Light - rail ridership has seen roughly the same trend , albeit on a much smaller scale .
The Blue Line has gone from 69,731 average weekday riders in January to 79,291 in May , the Red Line from 124,358 to 141,659 , the Gold Line from 19,001 to 23,141 .
Passenger levels on Metrolink trains , serving the Antelope Valley and Ventura , Riverside , Orange , and San Bernardino counties , jumped nearly 6 % from May to June , and 12 % over last year .
The 48,046 average weekday boardings in June were the highest ever .
Still , up to 97 % of trips in Southern California are in cars , according to the Southern California Assn. of Governments .
In the Los Angeles Metro area , which includes northern Orange County , there are about 4.3 million lone drivers commuting every week day , and 600,000 carpooling vehicles .

But as the economy sinks and gas prices continue to rise , transit officials expect more refugees , like Steve Sendor , a commercial real estate broker from Venice .
As the real estate business withered , he could n’t justify driving his gas - swilling Jeep Grand Cherokee to work in Century City .
With no rail options , he had no choice but to hop on the workhorse of L.A. 's mass transit system , the bus .
“ It ’s not as inconvenient as I thought , ” he said .
“ It adds about 45 minutes of productive time to my day . ”
He reads documents and business news .
And he saves about $ 50 a week , he estimates .

Riders ’ experiences on the buses , of course , vary widely , depending on the route and time of day .
Attorney Susan Seager started taking mass transit from South Pasadena to Century City .
She walks to the Gold Line train , takes it Union Station , where she jumps on LADOT Commuter Express to work .
“ The seats are cushiony and soft , ” she says “ There are no homeless people .
There are no screaming children . ”
But the last Commuter Express leaves Century City at 5:30 , and she often has to take a Metro bus down Olympic Boulevard .
“ It ’s very bumpy , ” she said .
“ Your teeth practically fall out .
The other day a woman was hitting her child .
We had to get into it , ‘ Please , do n’t hit your child . ’
It ’s exhausting to ride the Metro bus . ”
And even on a good day on her beloved train and Commuter Express , the trip takes an hour and 40 minutes -- to go about 20 miles .
“ What I really hate about the commute is how I do n’t see my kids , ” she says .

That minute - to - mile equation is what keeps many people in their cars .
Even with traffic jams , driving is usually faster .
Steve Johnson , 61 , waited last week for a train at Union Station after shopping in the Fashion District .
He said he would love to take mass transit from Simi Valley to South Gate , where he teaches .
One night in 2005 , he planned the trip for the next morning .
But he realized that his route looked like a circuit board .
He ’d be taking Metrolink to Union Station , catching the Red Line to the Blue Line , which he ’d ride to the Firestone stop , where he would catch a bus to his school .
He would leave his house at 4:45 a.m. and be lucky to get there when school started at 7:30 a.m .
He normally left at 6 a.m. and pulled into the school parking lot just after 7 .

He decided to put the trip off a day .
The train he had considered boarding on that January morning was involved in a massive pileup near Glendale that killed 11 people and injured about 180 .
“ Somebody up there was trying to tell me something , ” he said .
Committed to staying in his car , Johnson picks up a car - pooler to cut the cost .
But others find pleasant surprises when they investigate their mass transit options .
Richard Covey , a school teacher as well , discovered an express bus from Laguna Hills to South Coast Plaza that delivers him within walking distance of his middle school in Santa Ana .

He started taking it late March -- and kicks himself for not doing it sooner .
The walking invigorates him , and his stress level dropped precipitously .
Now he has to set his alarm on his 25 - minute ride home so he does n’t sleep right through his stop .
Recently , when he woke up , he looked around at the eight or so other riders .
“ I realized that the only ones awake were myself and the bus driver , ” he said .

The latest political celebrity scuttlebutt is that famous American actor Val Kilmer might be considering a run for Governor of New Mexico in 2010 .
Kilmer has lived part - time in New Mexico for over 20 years , but reportedly has n’t ever voted since registering in 1992 .
While we do n’t know if Kilmer will run , the good news is that if he does , then we have reason to believe he cares about environmental issues .
[ social_buttons ]
The rumor mill for Kilmer ’s candidacy got crankin ’ when current New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson made these remarks : “ I like the idea .
Val Kilmer is a first rate New Mexican .
He was Batman .
You know there have been successful actors going into politics .
I have n’t talked to him about it , I do n’t know how serious he is , but you know if he jumps in a race he ’s got name ID , so it ca n’t be discounted . ”
Richardson apparently is friends on some level with Kilmer .
Kilmer himself also made some intriguing comments in January during a public appearance : “ ” I did get some lobbyists once saying that I ’d make a good governor .
Reagan was n’t much of an actor and look how that worked out for him .
And then there ’s Arnold …
I think you should be able to pronounce the name of the state . ”
Sounds like we might have a good rivalry on our hands if Kilmer ’s candidacy comes to pass .
It seems that Kilmer would also be a candidate who actively supports initiatives to care for the environment .
Here ’s a quick list of interesting tidbits about Mr. Kilmer :
Kilmer owns a 6,000 acre ranch near Sante Fe and raises the more environmentally friendly type of animal : bison .
According to an old article in Esquire , Val is quoted as saying :
I just like looking at them .
I liked looking at them when I was a kid , and I like looking at them now .
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I ’m part Cherokee .
There was such a relationship between the buffalo and the American Indian – the Indians would eat them , live inside their pelts , use every part of the body .
There was almost no separation between the people and the animals .
Later in the same interview Kilmer says the following : “ I ’ve never been that comfortable talking about myself , or about acting . ”
Just my hunch , but this does n’t bode well for a political career .
Kilmer says on his website that “ the Wildlife Center is a charity that I have donated to for over ten years .
We have released over one hundred wild animals on our wilderness retreat that Dr. Ramsey has PERSONALLY treated .
Please check it out . ”
I have , and you can too by clicking here .
He is a Christian Scientist .
Is this an advantage or a liability ?
My guess is that it is a liability , particularly in regard to the U.S. ’s struggling health care system .
The word buzzing on the internet is that Kilmer is set to star in two movies with global warming tie - ins– and both sound great on paper !
In The Thaw , student scientists come upon a wooly mammoth that appears inside a melting icecap .
It contains a parasite that begins to reak havoc .
Personally speaking , The Steam House sounds even better .
In this flic , Kilmer plays a professor who takes six people hostage in a bathhouse to prove that global warming ( extremely high temperatures ) will make people go crazy in the chaos .
Both movies are scheduled to come out next year .
If Kilmer does run for Governor of New Mexico , then it might be the most interesting celebrity candidacy to come along since the current one of comedian Al Franken .

In the years that I ’ve spent roleplaying , I have found myself more than once struggling with the character creation process .
More than anything I think it ’s because the more I play , the more I find that characters will indeed make or break the game .
We have all been through it , we have some new and exciting game to play but we dread having to sit down and write down something interesting for our leads .
We scratch our heads thinking that our ideas are just “ not cool enough ” or just simply amazed at discovering what a blank mind really was .
What I want to do here is simply to tackle a method that is fairly easy to employ and that can help you make a richer and more interesting character , and has the added benefit of being quick , easy and painless .
Introduction
The way I usually created characters was with some sort of variation on the classical write - up process .
It basically means sitting down and writing stuff about your character , the usual things include physical appearance , biography , deeds , family , friends , contacts , blah blah blah .
The problem I personally had with doing this was threefold : a ) it can take a darn long time and in the end it ’s hard to locate the information that will be most relevant for you to actually portray that character in the gaming environment b) you might get so lost in describing this or that , that you later realize that you ’ve spent a lot of time and energy on things that are not immediately useful to you and ( this is the most personal one ) c ) getting everything there in prose makes it look like it is set in stone and you might get the feeling that you need to “ get it right . ”
What we will be doing here focuses on sharp and to the point data .
That does not mean that it ’s not about feelings or details or whatever else .
It means that you do n’t have to pull it together in a wrapped package , and can actually change it and expand upon it at any time .
I ’m going to explain the idea first but you will also have an example at the end , so do n’t worry too much for now .
Time to get rolling !
First step : get a name for your character , a random one if possible .
I ’m not kidding around , names are vitally important to generate a sense of wholeness .
We name things as a part of making them part of our reality and names themselves can tell us a lot about something .
So go and pick a name way before you decide anything about your character .
Plus , you can always change it later .
Second step : we need to start with a basic question about our character .
Does it matter which question we ask ?
Not really , although you might find ( very soon ) that there are some questions that will prove easier to work with than some others , and you ’ll probably start using those as a start point or to continue if you get stuck .
However , do n’t rule out possibilities since the unexpected can also bring out the creativity that we need .
What I usually do is to ask myself , “ What is my character doing ? , ” usually I ’m going for his means of making a living , but really it can also take the form of “ What is my character doing … right now ? ”
Go ahead , write an answer to that question .
It can be any answer really .
Actually I want to make a big point before we go on .
What I need you to do is to write answers .
What I certainly do n’t need you to do is think about the answers making sense or not , or the answers being coherent with what you wrote down before .
That will come after we ’re done .
Once you write it down ( one sentence , two at most ) , ask yourself ‘ Why ? ’ and write a short , one sentence answer to that .
Continue to ask yourself ‘ why ? ’ and write the answers until you feel a little dry about that line of reasoning or you feel you ’re going too far away from your character to answer the question .
Here ’s an example :
Name : Arnald Fowler
What is he doing ?
Studying to be a priest .
( Why ? …)
Because he is at a Monastery .
( Why ? … etc )
Because he is hiding .
Because he does not want to face the fact that he cared about his father .
Because he also hates his father .
Because his father never said he was proud of him .
Because his father felt he was a bad parent and was afraid of sharing his feelings with his son .
There we go .
I stopped at that last one because I would start talking about Arnald ’s father if I kept going .
I will probably want to do that at some point but not now .
It ’s something Arnald probably did n’t know and thus would n’t be able to react to .
When you get to this point you have a three options :
a) Get the first answer and ask ‘ why ? ’ again , although this time , think about it as the main topic and work it from there .
You can make it a more detailed version of the broad strokes you outlined earlier ( although you do n’t have to ) and maybe some lines will be harder than others but if you ca n’t think of an answer to the ‘ why ? ’ question , skip to the next line ; if you ’ve run out of lines go to …
b ) Ask another question .
Again , any question will do .
What ’s his favorite meal ?
Is he in love with someone ?
( or , who is he in love with ? )
Does he like parties ?
Any question that you think you can answer in a sentence will do .
Then you start the ‘ why ? ’ process over .
If you ca n’t think of anything , go to …
c ) Grab one of the answers and start writing about it .
Just get a pen or a word processor and start typing about it .
Give yourself three paragraphs of just brainstorming about it and see if you can ask ‘ why ? ’ about some of what you typed .
Those three options should make it so you do n’t really get stuck here .
Quite frankly I ’ve never used the third one yet and rarely had to use the second one ( except when going for deeper content ) .
Here are some more examples from Arnald :
Why is he studying to be a priest ?
Because it was the best way to stay at the Monastery .
Because they offered shelter and food .
Because they care about the poor and the ill fortuned ones .
Because their God commands them to , and because they believe in protecting the weak .
Why is he at a Monastery ?
It was the best place he found to disappear .
He had been running away , he was tired and hungry and desperate .
Because men had killed his mother and his sister while his father was away and were trying to kill him .
Because a couple of them wanted to have their way with her and she fend them off , hurting one of them .
Because his father had left them and his mother was left alone with two kids to feed and she had done many different things to feed them .
Because his father fell in love with a blonde young one he met while battling a foreign country .
Because his father was a soldier .
Those should give you an idea of how this works .
That is just part of the write up I had for the character and it still took about 25 minutes for the whole thing .
That ’s also part of the process .
If you ca n’t think of an answer go to a different question .
If you do n’t you might get into the idea of trying to get the ‘ right ’ answer and that will really hinder you .
After you ’re done ( by the way do n’t go typing 10 pages of this thing , do a few items at the time , you will always have time to add more ) , read your list once more .
If you notice any really big contradictions , put a mark next to them .
Now remember I told you we would deal with tying up all the ends after we wrote the lists down ?
Well I lied .
Do n’t write anything else down although feel free to think about all the possible ways that these things could make sense .
Remember if it ’s written there , there ’s a reason for it … you just do n’t know it yet .
Final Words
Take these notes that you took and bring them to your roleplaying session , they will be your guideline for playing the character .
That ’s one of the reasons I did n’t want you to write anything specific .
What you need is something to provide inspiration and ideas .
If a situation comes up in play and you ’re reminded about one of your answers ( for example , in my case an easy example would be a mother struggling to feed her kids ) just ask yourself how would the character behave and act accordingly .
Also , if you can , write down the general decision you made at that point ( another example : my character feels compelled to aid that mother , or maybe she makes him feel lonely , or maybe he is even sexually attracted to her ) , these things will serve as prime material for more ‘ why ? ’ questions that you can ask later on .
If some situation comes up and you ca n’t think of anything you ’ve written down that would allow you to extrapolate the logical reaction to it , just select something that seems right , or just select a random reaction ( again , I mean it ) .
Write it down , and after the session run it nice and easy through the method .
You ’ll see that , whatever your answers might be , the process of thinking about them and ways of applying them to real roleplaying situations will give you more material than most character write ups I ’ve ever seen .
Try it out and tell me what you think .
And of course , if you liked this , why do n’t you subscribe ?
That way you make sure not to loose any new tips and methods you can use in your games .
Take care !

Khomeini accordingly delivered notorious rebuke to the Islam - is - a - religion - of - peace crowd : “ Those who know nothing of Islam pretend that Islam counsels against war .
Those [ who say this ] are witless .
Islam says : Kill all the unbelievers just as they would kill you all !
Does this mean that Muslims should sit back until they are devoured by [ the unbelievers ] ?
Islam says : Kill them , put them to the sword and scatter [ their armies ] ....
Islam says :
Whatever good there is exists thanks to the sword and in the shadow of the sword !
People can not be made obedient except with the sword !
The sword is the key to Paradise , which can be opened only for the Holy Warriors !
There are hundreds of other [ Qur’anic ] psalms and Hadiths [ sayings of the Prophet ] urging Muslims to value war and to fight .
Does all this mean that Islam is a religion that prevents men from waging war ?
I spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim . ”
" Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities , but the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it .
No stronger retrograde force exists in the world .

The July 2006 publication of the first Hopkins / CSP psilocybin study drew media attention around the globe ( including some 300 print articles according to Google , plus magazine , radio , and TV coverage ) .
Here 's a sampling :
From The Economist , 13 July 2006 :
The God Pill : Hallucinogens induce lasting spiritual highs in the religious
ONE June night in Mexico in 1955 , Gordon Wasson , a vice - president of J.P. Morgan , became one of the first outsiders to eat what the Aztecs called teonanacatl , the flesh of the gods .
Actually , it is the flesh of a fungus , and it soon became known to hippies as the magic mushroom .
But , whereas the flower children of the 1960s and their descendants gobbled the hallucinogenic fungi in search of a good time , the Aztecs had a deeper purpose .
They used the mushrooms in religious ceremonies for healing , divination and communing with the spirit world .
Now a study led by Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins University , and published this week in Psychopharmacology , has shown that psilocybin – the active component in magic mushrooms – does indeed induce mental states akin to the highest religious experiences .
Moreover , it has lasting positive effects on those who take it .
Experiments involving drugs of any kind need to have a control – that is , an otherwise identical experiment in which something other than the drug is administered – to check that any effects are caused by the drug and not something else .
Ideally , neither experimental subjects nor researchers should know who is in the control group , but for experiments involving psychedelic drugs this is difficult , because it quickly becomes apparent who is high and who is not .
For his control , Dr Griffiths decided to use methylphenidate hydrochloride , otherwise known as Ritalin , a drug that calms hyperactive children .
On one of two occasions , he gave 36 volunteers who had never taken hallucinogenic drugs either psilocybin or Ritalin , swapping the drugs on the second occasion .
The choice of Ritalin was inspired .
Neither the volunteers nor the experimenters could say reliably which drug was being administered on which occasion .
A close eye was kept on the volunteers for eight hours after the drugs were given , to check all was well .
They were then asked about their experience .
Two - thirds of the participants , who were mostly middle - aged college graduates , ranked being given psilocybin as either the best or in the top five best experiences of their lives – on a par with the birth of a first child .
They described feeling peace , intense happiness and a sense of the unity of all things .
The participants were no strangers to spiritual highs .
Almost all engaged at least monthly in religious or spiritual activities such as prayer or attending religious services , and were selected for participation in the trial on this basis .
Yet two months after the trial , 79 % of them reported moderately or greatly increased well - being or satisfaction .
Their positive changes in attitudes and behaviour were confirmed by independent assessments made by friends and family .
Why this should be is not yet well understood .
Psilocybin is thought to work by mimicking serotonin .
This is one of the messenger molecules that carry signals between nerve cells in the brain , and it is known to influence mood .
But there has been little research of late .
Clinical studies using psilocybin and other hallucinogens were halted when recreational use of the drugs took off .
They have only just resumed after a four - decade hiatus .
Dr Griffiths and his colleagues argue that the mood - lifting effects of hallucinogens might be used to treat drug and alcohol addiction .
Psilocybin itself is not addictive , although they recommend that its availability should continue to be limited .
Psychedelic drugs could even be used to probe the basis of consciousness , according to Solomon Snyder , one of Dr Griffith 's colleagues .
Dr Snyder believes that investigation of such drugs could help scientists understand the molecular changes in the brain that underlie religious experiences .
Back in the 1950s , Gordon Wasson spent years gaining the trust of Amerindians who had continued the religious traditions of their pre-Columbian ancestors .
Eventually he was allowed to partake of the mushroom .
His experience , from which he said he emerged awestruck , started a short period of study that ended prematurely because of the mushroom 's widespread recreational use .
By showing it is possible to conduct such research responsibly , Dr Griffiths has opened the door for further work to be done on the properties of psychedelic drugs .

In response to a House of Commons question about her leadership ambitions , she said that she could not possibly become Prime Minister because , if she did , then the nation ’s airports would be filled with men trying to flee the country .
The joke caused bewildered looks rather than laughs , partly because of her lack of comic timing , but more importantly because there is nothing funny about her aggressively feminist agenda , which treats men as either second - class citizens or a menace to society .
Harman may try to raise a titter by playing on her reputation as a hardline women ’s rights campaigner .
But , in reality , men would be right to shudder if she were to seize the reins of power .
Throughout her political career , Ms Harman has promoted the extreme feminist cause .
She recently introduced an outrageously misnamed ‘ Equality Bill ’ , which actually proposed to give legal sanction to overt discrimination against men in job recruitment .
The scheme was dressed up as an attempt to combat prejudice against women in the workplace , but in reality made anti-male bias acceptable .
Now comes an even more sinister move .
Yesterday , Ms Harman — who , worryingly , is acting Prime Minister during Gordon Brown ’s summer holiday — set out new proposals that may lead to a change in the law in cases of murder involving domestic violence .
As she revealed , she has embarked on a consultation process to decide whether victims of domestic violence who kill their partners should be allowed to plead provocation where they claim to be living in fear of future attacks .
At present , the defence of provocation can be used only when an individual kills during a sudden loss of self - control — during a fight , for example .
Under Ms Harman ’s scheme , however , cold - blooded murder could be tolerated under British law for the first time , as long as the killer can convince a court she felt in long - term danger from her partner .
Now , I have been a supporter of women ’s rights all my life .
In 1971 , I founded the first women ’s refuge in the country , which led to the creation of a nationwide network offering shelter for victims of domestic violence .
And through that experience , as well as my own upbringing at the hands of abusive parents , I know what a terrifying problem domestic violence can be .
But it is precisely because of my desire to protect the vulnerable that I am so opposed to Ms Harman ’s absurd new plan , which is not only an affront to the basic morality of our society , but also a ridiculously one - sided , misogynistic , simplistic and dangerous response to the issue .
Indeed , as with so many of her other forays into policy - making , it is driven more by feminist ideology than compassion .
Effectively , what Harman and the ultra - feminist lobby want is a licence for women to kill .
For thousands of years , one of the pillars of Judaeo - Christian civilisation has been the ethical injunction , ‘ Thou shalt not kill ’ .
But now , radical female modernisers think that this moral edifice can be pulled down and replaced with a perverse new moral code which holds that women can murder as long as their sense of victimhood is sufficiently powerful .
If this plan is enacted , we will no longer have absolute justice in this country .
Instead , our courts will have to use a carefully calibrated measure of female grievance against which to judge the darkest of all crimes .
Only in the warped mindset of feminist radicals should we protect the vulnerable by downgrading our moral abhorrence of murder .
Rather than reducing violence , Harriet Harman ’s proposals could become a charter for domestic chaos , as vengeful women believe they can butcher partners they come to loathe , inventing incidents of abuse or exaggerating fears of assault .
' It is an outrage that thanks to Ms Harman , feminists such as Bindel can influence public policy '
That this grotesque proposal is even being considered by the Government only shows how far the once honourable women ’s liberation movement has been hijacked by extreme feminists , who are interested in oppressing men rather than real equality .
It is telling that one of the driving forces behind these proposals is Julie Bindel , of the Left - wing pressure group Justice for Women .
Ms Bindel displayed her lack of balance in a recent article in the Guardian newspaper , entitled ‘ Why I hate men ’ .
One of her sentences read : ‘ I will say loud and proud , yes , today I hate men , and will tomorrow and the day after . ’
No doubt in her misogynistic world , killing men is a form of justifiable homicide .
But it is an outrage that thanks to Ms Harman , feminists such as Bindel can influence public policy .
The absurdity of the Harman position is the pretence that women in a violent relationship have no alternative but to kill their partners .
It might have been true half a century ago , when there were no refuges and neither the courts nor the police treated domestic violence seriously .
But it is not the case today , not least thanks to the efforts of women ’s campaigners like myself who have fought to change things .
Domestic violence is now taken seriously by all state institutions , and every police force has its own domestic violence team .
A woman fearing abuse does not have to suffer alone .
She can pick up the phone , and the police and social services will respond .
The proposals have also been prompted by the feminist belief that men often escape justice for their violence simply by claiming they were bullied by their partners , or that they were provoked because their partner was having any affair .
This is a myth .
Home Office research shows 5 per cent of men are acquitted in domestic violence cases .
Meanwhile , 22 per cent of women get off .
Another myth is that domestic violence is almost exclusively perpetrated by men against women .
Again , this is nonsense .
Certain crime studies show that while one in four women has suffered from abuse , one in six men has also done so .
I will never forget one woman , who was staying in my refuge , telling me , in chilling tones , ‘ knives are a great leveller ’ .
That is the reality of domestic violence .
It is far less clear - cut than the ideologues like to pretend , with their neat division between female victims and male oppressors .
The truth is that much of the violence takes place in squalid , tortured relationships , often involving drink and drugs , where both partners are guilty of verbal and physical assault .
In the refuge I opened in 1971 , for example , of the first 100 women through the door , 62 admitted that they had also perpetrated violence against their partners .
Harman ’s law , if enacted , will be a recipe for injustice , not a means of protecting women ’s rights .
It is vital that we should uphold the law as it stands and never allow our legal system to be dragged down by amoral feminist dogma .
SAN FRANCISCO 
A legal dispute involving model railroad hobbyists has resulted in a major courtroom victory for the free software movement also known as open - source software .
In a ruling Wednesday , the federal appeals court in Washington said that just because a software programmer gave his work away did not mean it could not be protected .
The decision legitimizes the use of commercial contracts for the distribution of computer software and digital artistic works for the public good .
The court ruling also bolsters the open - source movement by easing the concerns of large organizations about relying on free software from hobbyists and hackers who have freely contributed time and energy without pay .
It also has implications for the Creative Commons license , a framework for modifying and sharing creative works that was developed in 2002 by Larry Lessig , a law professor at Stanford .

Former Hillary Clinton advisor and current Fox News analyst Howard Wolfson continued his war of words with MSNBC , Chris Mathews , and Keith Olbermann by accusing them of being bad Democrats for being critical of the Clintons over the past two years .
This whole thing flared up again yesterday when Matthews and Olbermann were talking about the Republicans new found support of Hillary Clinton .
Chris Matthews said , “ Fox News , for example , seems to enjoy it .
It ’s no accident , for example , that they hired Howard Wolfson .
They use him as some sort of , oh , little toy soldier waiting on the shelf . ”
Keith Olbermann added , “ Tokyo Rose was the thought that came to my mind . ”
On Fox News today Wolfson fired back , “ I ’m not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good Democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking Bill and Hillary Clinton every day .
“ I think it ’s unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like NBC has been taken over by those kind of antics . ”
It should be noted that Wolfson is one of those senior Clinton advisors who is blaming MSNBC for her loss to Barack Obama in the Democratic primary .

Here is the video of Wolfson on Fox News :
Setting aside the never ending MSNBC / Fox feud for a moment , Wolfson ’s point about MSNBC is ridiculous , especially when one looks at CNN which became the Clinton News Network , as almost all of its senior analysts had worked for the Clintons .
Fox News was shamelessly in the bag for Rudy Giuliani , and then he flamed out , so they shifted to Mitt Romney , but he crashed and burned , so they finally got behind McCain .
The sad aspect of this story is outside of PBS , no network offered objective coverage of either primary .
Because of this , the real loser is the American people .
If a person only wants straight facts , none of the news networks are the places to go .
I watch two newscasts , the News Hour on PBS , BBC ’s World News America .
I do n’t consider any of the other shows newscasts .
They are infotainment .
That does n’t mean that they are n’t fun to watch , just that the news is presented as means to entertain , like The Daily Show .
For the billionth time , MSNBC , or any other network , did not cost Hillary Clinton the Democratic nomination .
The biggest reason why she lost was the terrible strategy that was designed by people like Howard Wolfson , who demonstrated how to lose a campaign that you should win .
If Wolfson wants to blame someone for Clinton ’s defeat , he needs to take a long look in the mirror .
Devout Muslim sues
Tesco for making him carry alcohol
Mohammed Ahmed : Quit his job with Tesco after complaining about having to handle alcohol
A Muslim who claims he did not know Tesco sold alcohol is suing the store for religious discrimination after having to carry crates of drink as part of his job .
Forklift truck driver Mohammed Ahmed , 32 , worked in a distribution depot for eight months before quitting ' in protest ' , an employment tribunal heard .
He claims he was forced to leave because handling beer , spirits and wine is against his strict Islamic beliefs and that he was victimised when he asked the company to give him another role .
Mr Ahmed , who was raised in Saudi Arabia , told the tribunal he had no idea his job entailed handling alcohol when he started work last September at the depot in Lichfield , Staffordshire .
When he realised it did , he asked to be found different work but alleges that one of his supervisors told him : ' You do the job or go home . '
Mr Ahmed also claimed his line manager was ' aggressive ' towards him and another supervisor angrily told him : ' Do not take the p***.'
The problem allegedly worsened in November and December when extra alcohol arrived at the warehouse in readiness for Christmas , the tribunal in Birmingham heard .
Mr Ahmed claimed he eventually lodged an official grievance with the company in February and was ' victimised and harassed ' as a result .
Ahmed complained that he was made to carry crates of beer at the Tesco store .
The tribunal heard that Tesco has now ensured its induction process makes clear that handling alcohol is part of the job .
But Laura Canham , the company 's solicitor , said it was still unrealistic for Mr Ahmed to say he had no idea what his duties would be .
Mr Ahmed claimed he had never visited a Tesco store and was not aware the company sold alcohol .
He admitted , however , having shopped in Sainsbury 's , Lidl and Asda , and noticing alcohol was on sale there .
Miss Canham said : ' He was advised at the outset what the job would entail .
At no stage did he raise the fact he could not handle alcohol . '
The tribunal was told Mr Ahmed also gave out ' mixed messages ' , at one stage suggesting he was allowed to handle Budweiser beer .
Miss Canham denied the company discriminated against him and said : ' It would be reasonable to expect him to be aware of what Tesco did . '
Mr Ahmed , of Derby , who is suing the firm for racial discrimination , victimisation and harassment , should learn the outcome of the case later this week .
Saudi Arabia 's enforcement of strict Sharia law regarding alcohol is among the harshest in the world .
Sentences include several months ' imprisonment for simply drinking beer , and it is not unknown for offenders to be given lashes as well .
A spokesman for Tesco , whose £ 63 million Lichfield depot has around 1,000 workers , said : ' Managers are trained to be culturally sensitive and have an open - door policy to staff for issues like this , as everyone is welcome to work at Tesco . '
Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones dies of brain hemhorrage Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008
Print This Email This EAST CLEVELAND , Ohio ( AP )  A Cleveland Clinic official says Democratic U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio has died .
Clinic spokeswoman Eileen Sheil says Tubbs Jones died at 6:12 p.m.
Wednesday after suffering a brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst and left her with limited brain function .
The 58 - year - old Tubbs Jones was the first black woman to represent Ohio in Congress and a strong critic of the Iraq war .
She suffered the hemorrhage while driving her car in her east side district Tuesday evening .
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE .
Check back soon for further information .
AP 's earlier story is below .
EAST CLEVELAND , Ohio ( AP )  Democratic U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones , the first black woman to represent Ohio in Congress , had a brain hemorrhage and was in critical condition with limited brain function , a doctor said Wednesday .
Tubbs Jones , 58 , suffered the hemorrhage while driving her car in Cleveland Heights on Tuesday , said Dr. Gus Kious , president of Huron Hospital in East Cleveland .
The congresswoman had been driving erratically and her vehicle crossed lanes of traffic before coming to a stop , police said .
Tubbs Jones " collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain , " Kious said during a news conference .
A team of doctors who evaluated her determined she has limited brain function .
A brain aneurysm is a bulge in an artery in the brain .
It can leak or rupture , causing bleeding in the brain .
Family friend Joe Hewitt asked people to pray for the congresswoman .
Family members including Tubbs Jones ' son , Mervyn Jones II , attended the news conference but left without commenting .
East Cleveland Mayor Eric Brewer , a longtime friend of Tubbs Jones , said it would n't be appropriate to consider the political vacuum in Ohio if she cannot serve .
" As far as we 're concerned , she 's still here until further notice and until the Lord says it 's her time to go , " Brewer said at the hospital following the news conference .
" Right now , She 's our congresswoman . "
Tubbs Jones , elected in 1998 , was one of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton 's biggest boosters during the primaries and is to be a superdelegate at next week 's Democratic National Convention in Denver .
Although she backed Barack Obama in June , Tubbs Jones has said Obama can't win unless Clinton 's supporters rally behind him .
" She is a passionate and tireless advocate for the people of Cleveland and a devoted public servant for all Americans , " Obama said in a statement .
" We send our heartfelt prayers to Stephanie and her family at this very difficult time . "
Tubbs Jones represents the heavily Democratic 11th District and chairs the ethics committee in the House .
She 's the first black woman to serve on the powerful Ways and Means Committee , where she opposed President Bush 's tax cuts and his efforts to create personal accounts within Social Security .
Several news organizations , including The Associated Press , had earlier reported that Tubbs Jones had died .
The AP cited a Democratic official .
The reports prompted Sen. John Kerry to issue a statement mourning her passing .
Associated Press Writer Andrew Taylor in Washington contributed to this report .
Shame on Layton , Duceppe & Harper : May should be in the debates
Earlier today the capitalist television networks announced that Elizabeth May , leader of the federal Green Party , would be barred from attending the leaders ’ debates .
Contrary to some of the analysis I have read in the blogs and elsewhere , in the strict letter of the regulations , the networks did not do anything inconsistent in refusing to grant Elizabeth May a seat at the leaders ’ debates for the 2008 election .
In 1993 , the relatively new Reform and Bloc Québecois Parties had each elected their first MPs ( Deborah Grey and Gilles Duceppe respectively ) rather than obtaining their first MPs as a result of floor - crossing as is the case this year with the Green Party .
Thus , while I strongly disagree with the entire convention of allowing only parties that elect one MP into the debates , the blame for today ’s patently anti-democratic decision cannot be laid entirely or even primarily at the doorstep of the capitalist networks ( regardless of how much every Marxist bone in my body would like to do so ) .
The blame , it is clear , rests primarily on the shoulders of the NDP ’s Jack Layton , the Bloc ’s Gilles Duceppe and the Conservatives ’ Stephen Harper .
For being the sole party leader of the 4 main parties to advocate for May ’s presence , the Liberals ’ Stéphane Dion rightly deserves praise today from democrats of all stripes ranging from radical Marxist like myself to the bluest Tory .
The sort of reactionary , petty , anti-democratic inclinations exemplified by the pressure from the NDP , Bloc and Tory leaders to close off access to the debates is simply shameful .
I expect this sort of behaviour from the Tory leader who has regularly demonstrated his contempt for democracy in his draconian attitude towards the press and public ethics committees .
However , this an exemplar of hypocrisy on the part of the Bloc and the New Democrats .
Both parties claim to be social democrat , even though both parties have sadly long since forgotten that ‘ socialism ’ , throughout its long and rich history from the Diggers of the English Revolution onwards , has always entailed radical democracy and the radical expansion of the democratic franchise .
This is an especially bitter irony for the New Democrats since they still proudly consider themselves to be the party of Tommy Douglas , a genuine and honourable democratic socialist who never forgot what that term entailed .
Without realizing it , time and time again , the NDP continues to demonstrate with their current pathetically - weak policies and their bourgeois behaviour , that if Tommy Douglas could see what his party had become , he would be spinning in his grave .
Now , let me be clear :
This should not be taken as an endorsement of May .
May and her predecessor ’s policies which deliberately dragged the Greens to the right and away from the parts of the proud Green tradition that I most respect , is for me simply unforgivable .
However , one ’s personal opinions of the Greens are immaterial here .
This is an attack on democracy just as much as is the silencing of other party leaders such as Miguel Figueroa of the Communist Party of Canada , Dennis Young of the Libertarian Party of Canada , Connie Fogal of the Canadian Action Party and Sinclair Stevens of the Progressive Canadian Party to name only a few .
And as this is an attack on democracy , it must be the duty of every democrat to stand in solidarity with Elizabeth May and the Greens on this issue and pressure whomever they ’re supporting in this election to allow May into the debates .

edit ] Membership
edit ] Origins
The Shanghai Five grouping was originally created April 26 , 1996 with the signing of the Treaty on Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions in Shanghai by the heads of states of Kazakhstan , the People 's Republic of China , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Tajikistan .
April 24 , 1997 the same countries signed the Treaty on Reduction of Military Forces in Border Regions in a meeting in Moscow .
Subsequent annual summits of the Shanghai Five group occurred in Almaty ( Kazakhstan ) in 1998 , in Bishkek ( Kyrgyzstan ) in 1999 , and in Dushanbe ( Tajikistan ) in 2000 .
In 2001 , the annual summit returned to Shanghai , China .
There the five member nations first admitted Uzbekistan in the Shanghai Five mechanism ( thus transforming it into the Shanghai Six ) .
Then all six heads of state signed on June 15 , 2001 , the Declaration of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , praising the role played thus far by the Shanghai Five mechanism and aiming to transform it to a higher level of cooperation .
In July 2001 , Russia and the PRC , the organisation 's two leading nations , signed the Treaty of Good - Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation .
In June 2002 , the heads of the SCO member states met in Saint Petersburg , Russia .
There they signed the SCO Charter which expounded on the organisation 's purposes , principles , structures and form of operation , and established it officially from the point of view of international law .
edit ] Structure
Structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
The Council of Heads of State is the top decision - making body in the SCO .
This council meets at the SCO summits , which are held each year in one of the member states ' capital cities .
The current Council of Heads of State consists of :
The Council of Heads of Government is the second - highest council in the organization .
This council also holds annual summits , at which time members discuss issues of multilateral cooperation .
The council also approves the organization 's budget .
The council of Foreign Ministers also hold regular meetings , where they discuss the current international situation and the SCO 's interaction with other international organizations . [ 1 ]
As the name suggests , the Council of National Coordinators coordinates the multilateral cooperation of member states within the framework of the SCO 's charter .
The Secretariat of the SCO is the primary executive body of the organization .
It serves to implement organizational decisions and decrees , drafts proposed documents ( such as declarations and agendas ) , function as a document depository for the organization , arranges specific activities within the SCO framework , and promotes and disseminates information about the SCO .
It is located in Beijing .
The current SCO Secretary - General is Bolat Nurgaliyev of Kazakhstan . [ 2 ]
The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure ( RATS ) , headquartered in Tashkent , Uzbekistan , is a permanent organ of the SCO which serves to promote cooperation of member states against the three evils of terrorism , separatism and extremism .
The Head of RATS is elected to a three - year term .
Each member state also sends a permanent representative to RATS . [ 3 ]
edit ] Activities
edit ] Cooperation on security
The SCO is primarily centered around its member nations ' Central Asian security - related concerns , often describing the main threats it confronts as being terrorism , separatism and extremism .
However evidence is growing that its activities in the area of social development of its member states is increasing fast .[ citation needed ]
At the June 16 - 17 2004 SCO summit , held in Tashkent , Uzbekistan , the Regional Antiterrorism Structure ( RATS ) was established .
On 21 April 2006 , the SCO announced plans to fight cross - border drug crimes under the counter - terrorism rubric . [ 4 ]
Grigory Logninov claimed in April 2006 that the SCO has no plans to become a military bloc ; nonetheless he argued that the increased threats of " terrorism , extremism and separatism " make necessary a full - scale involvement of armed forces . [ 5 ]
There have been a number of SCO joint military exercises .
The first of these was held in 2003 , with the first phase taking place in Kazakhstan and the second in China . [ 6 ]
On a larger scale , but outside the SCO framework , the first ever joint military exercise between the PRC and Russia , called Peace Mission 2005 started on August 19 , 2005 .
Following their successful completion , Russian officials have begun speaking of India joining such exercises in the future and the SCO taking on a military role .
The joint military exercises in 2007 took place in Chelyabinsk Russia , near the Ural Mountains and close to Central Asia , as was agreed upon on April 2006 at a meeting of SCO Defense Ministers .
More than 4,000 soldiers participated from China .
Air forces and precision - guided weapons were have likely to be used .
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the exercises will be transparent and open to media and the public . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
In October 2007 , the SCO signed an agreement with the Collective Security Treaty Organisation ( CSTO ) , in the Tajik capital Dushanbe , to broaden cooperation on issues such as security , crime , and drug trafficking . [ 8 ]
Joint action plans between the two organizations are planned to be signed by early 2008 in Beijing . [ 9 ]
edit ] Economic cooperation
A Framework Agreement to enhance economic cooperation was signed by the SCO member states on 23 September 2003 .
At the same meeting the PRC's Premier , Wen Jiabao , proposed a long - term objective to establish a free trade area in the SCO , while other more immediate measures would be taken to improve the flow of goods in the region .
A follow up plan with 100 specific actions was signed one year later , on September 23 , 2004 . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
On 26 October 2005 , the Moscow Summit of the SCO , the Secretary General of the Organisation said that the SCO will prioritise joint energy projects ; such will include the oil and gas sector , the exploration of new hydrocarbon reserves , and joint use of water resources .
The creation of an Inter - bank SCO Council was also agreed upon at that summit in order to fund future joint projects .
The first meeting of the SCO Interbank Association was held in Beijing on 21 - 22 February 2006 . [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
On 30 November 2006 , at The SCO : Results and Perspectives , an international conference held in Almaty , the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Russia is developing plans for an SCO " Energy Club " . [ 14 ] .
The need for this " club " was reiterated by Moscow at an SCO summit in November 2007 .
Other SCO members , however , have not committed themselves to the idea . [ 15 ]
edit ] Cultural cooperation
Cultural cooperation also occurs in the SCO framework .
Culture ministers of the SCO met for the first time in Beijing on 12 April 2002 , signing a joint statement for continued cooperation .
The third meeting of the Culture Ministers took place in Tashkent , Uzbekistan , on 27 - 28 April 2006 . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
An SCO Arts Festival and Exhibition was held for the first time during the Astana Summit in 2005 .
Kazakhstan has also suggested an SCO folk dance festival to take place in 2008 , in Astana . [ 18 ]
edit ] Summits
According to the Charter of the SCO , summits of the Council of Heads of State shall be held annually at alternating venues .
The locations of these summits follow the alphabetical order of the member state 's name in Russian . [ 19 ]
The charter also dictates that the Council of Heads of Government ( that is , the Prime Ministers ) shall meet annually in a place previously decided upon by the council members .
The Council of Foreign Ministers is supposed to hold a summit one month before the annual summit of Heads of State .
Extraordinary meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers can be called by any two member states . [ 19 ]

Future membership possibilities
Currently , the Shanghai Cooperation Organization does not have an official mechanism for admitting new members . [ 21 ]
Several states , however , participate as observers , some of whom have expressed interest in becoming full members in the future .
edit ] Current observers
India currently has observer status in the SCO .
Members of the SCO have encouraged India to join the organization as a full - time member .
With the world 's third largest standing army , fourth largest ( PPP ) and second fastest growing major economy , and an increasing political and economic clout , India is seen by SCO members as a crucial future strategic partner . [ 22 ]
India also has a major military presence in Central Asia . [ 23 ] [ 24 ]
India has close military ties with several Central Asian countries especially Tajikistan and Russia and also has a deep interest in the region 's energy resources , so it has expressed its interest in joining the SCO . [ 25 ] [ 26 ]
Iran currently has observer status in the organisation , and applied for full membership on March 24 , 2008 . [ 27 ]
Mongolia became the first country to receive observer status at the 2004 Tashkent Summit .
Pakistan , India and Iran received observer status at the 2005 SCO summit in Astana , Kazakhstan on July 5 , 2005 .
Pakistan currently has observer status in the SCO .
Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf argued in favour of Pakistan 's qualification to join the organisation as a full member during a joint summit with China in 2006 .
China said that it would convey Pakistan ’s desire to all SCO member states .
In turn , Musharraf was formally invited to the sixth summit of the SCO to take place in Shanghai in June .
Sino - Pak relations go back decades when Pakistan helped China enter the United Nations and China helped Pakistan get a veto aganist the Kashmir issue later on .
China is Pakistan 's biggest arms and technology supplier and the third biggest trading partner as well as the basis for Western China 's economic growth as it would need the Ports of Pakistan .
The linkages between China and Pakistan are also strengthed through the almost unhindered economic trade between the Northern Areas of Pakistan with the muslim majority , semi-autonomous , Xinjiang Province of China , throug the Karakorum Highway .
Pakistan and Iran have been lobbying for full membership , while India and Mongolia have not shown strong interest in becoming official members . [ 28 ]
Russia 's permanent representative in the SCO Secretariat Grigory Longinov has claimed that the enlargement of the SCO is impeded by " an immature mechanism of admission of new members " , while Secretary General Zhang Deguang argued that an over - expansion might hinder the intensification of the cooperation . [ 29 ]
edit ]
Other countries
Afghanistan , while not an observer , is currently part of the SCO - Afghanistan Contact Group .
The contact group was established in November 2005 , and serves as a mechanism for SCO member states to jointly contribute to reconstruction and stability in Afghanistan . [ 30 ]
Belarus has applied for observer status in the organisation and has been promised Kazakhstan 's support towards that goal .

However , Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov voiced doubt on the probability of Belarus ' membership , saying that Belarus was a purely European country . [ 31 ]

Power balance in a " multi- polar world "
The SCO , NATO , and other international organizations
SCO countries ( full members and observers ) comprise a hefty 25 % of Earth 's land area .
Although the declaration on the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation contained a statement that it " is not an alliance directed against other states and regions and it adheres to the principle of openness " , many observers believe that one of the original purposes of the SCO was to serve as a counterbalance to NATO and the United States and in particular to avoid conflicts that would allow the United States to intervene in areas near both Russia and China . [ 32 ]
The United States applied for observer status in the SCO , but was rejected in 2005 . [ 33 ]
At the Astana summit in July 2005 , with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq foreshadowing an indefinite presence of U.S. forces in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan , the SCO urged the U.S. to set a timetable for withdrawing its troops from SCO member states .
Shortly afterwards , Uzbekistan asked the U.S. to leave the K - 2 air base . [ 34 ]
Recently the SCO has made no direct comments against the U.S. or its military presence in the region .
However , several indirect statements at the past summits , including the 2007 summit in Bishkek , have been viewed as " thinly veiled swipes at Washington " . [ 35 ]

The key components of Aurora include : natural interaction , continuity , multi-user applications , and context awareness .
Mozilla put out the call via its blog to " industry , higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the Web . "
The Foundation has already introduced a number of concepts , including Aurora , a new method for organizing bookmarks , and suggestions for Firefox Mobile .
The mobile prototype , dubbed Fennec , is being designed for a touch screen , according to Aza Raskin , head of user experience at Mozilla Labs .
" Switching between input methods is time - consuming and annoying , so the user should n't have to switch to a stylus or other secondary form of input , " Raskin wrote .
Raskin also said Fennec would have an interface that 's large enough for those of us with fat fingers , a minimal number of keystrokes , and as much content on the screen as possible .
Mozilla is working on a more structured way to let users contribute concepts .
In the meantime , it 's asking users to just get the ideas out there .
" If it 's a mockup , put it on Flickr .
If it 's a prototype , host it on your Web site .
Tag it with ' mozconcept ' and then let us know about it by posting to the Concept Series discussion forum , " Mozilla wrote on the blog .

An acclaimed government scientist who assisted the federal investigation of the 2001 anthrax mailings said Tuesday that he erred seven years ago when he told top Bush administration officials that material he examined probably had been altered to make it more deadly .
The scientist , Peter B. Jahrling , had observed anthrax spores with the aid of an electron microscope at the government ’s biological warfare research facility at Ft. Detrick , Md .
On Oct. 24 , 2001 , Jahrling was summoned to the White House after reporting to his superiors what he believed to be signs that silicon had been added to anthrax recovered from a letter addressed to then - Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) .
The presence of silicon was viewed with alarm because the material , if artificially added to the anthrax , would make it more buoyant in air and more capable of penetrating deeply into the lungs .

“ I believe I made an honest mistake , ” Jahrling said in response to questions e-mailed to him for this article , adding that he had been “ overly impressed ” by what he thought he saw under the microscope .
“ I should never have ventured into this area , ” said Jahrling , who is a virologist , referring to his analysis of the anthrax , which is a bacterium .
Jahrling ’s initial analysis -- and his briefing of officials at the White House -- was first detailed in a 2002 book by bestselling author Richard Preston .
Although Jahrling was careful in 2001 not to implicate Iraq or any other regime in the mailings , others used his analysis to allege that the silicon perhaps linked the letters to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
Inhaled anthrax can kill at a rate of 80 % to 90 % unless patients are treated quickly with an antibiotic .

Jahrling ’s comments Tuesday came soon after a congressional hearing at which FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III announced that he was arranging for an outside review of scientific findings that helped the bureau conclude that another scientist at Ft. Detrick , Bruce E. Ivins , perpetrated the deadly mailings .
The review is to be overseen by the National Academy of Sciences , Mueller said .
FBI scientists and outside experts hired by the bureau to analyze the anthrax recovered from the mailings announced Aug. 18 that although they had found silicon , it occurred within the spores naturally and was not added .
In challenging those experts , one journalist reminded them that Jahrling , among other scientists , had concluded otherwise .
Some critics of the FBI investigation have asserted that Ivins lacked the skills to have “ weaponized ” the anthrax with any additive that enhanced its virulence .

At Tuesday ’s hearing , a member of the House Judiciary Committee , Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) , pressed Mueller anew about how the silicon got into the spores .
After being informed of the events at the hearing , Jahrling renounced his earlier analysis .
“ In retrospect , ” Jahrling said , “ I believe I was mistaken and defer to the experts . ”
Ivins , 62 , a civilian bacteriologist for the Army , died July 29 after ingesting a massive dose of prescription Tylenol 3 .

Attorneys Ivins had hired to defend him against criminal charges being prepared by the Justice Department have said that they would have won his acquittal if the case had gone to trial .
In 2001 , Jahrling briefed a roomful of officials at the White House , including Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft , Mueller and Tom Ridge , President Bush ’s secretary of Homeland Security .
The next day , the Washington Post published a front - page article headlined “ Additive Made Spores Deadlier ” that reported :
“ The presence of the high - grade additive was confirmed for the first time yesterday by a government source familiar with the ongoing studies , which are being conducted by scientists ” at Ft. Detrick .
Advertisement
The article said that the United States , the former Soviet Union and Iraq were “ the only three nations known to have developed the kind of additives that enable anthrax spores to remain suspended in the air , making them more easily inhaled ” and more deadly .
At the time , Jahrling was employed as the senior civilian scientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , within Ft. Detrick .
Jahrling is a past winner of the Secretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award .
Michael P. Kortan , a spokesman for Mueller , said after the congressional hearing that the FBI was seeking the outside review while maintaining “ full confidence in our scientific approach . ”

“ Consideration of an outside review began before any public disclosure of the scientific aspects of the investigation , ” Kortan said .

Steve Benen has already covered how the right has picked up their new symbol to mock Barack Obama 's energy policy , as if the entirety of Obama 's program is to have people keep their tires inflated .
Jon
Perr points out this is n't a new tactic for them .
However , Keith Olbermann goes further , and points out that this strategy ( at least amongst the critical thinking in the electorate ) may backfire when this advice has been endorsed by GOP Veep shortlister Charlie Crist , California Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger , NASCAR and even President Bush 's Highway Traffic Safety Department , none of whom could credibly be called in Obama 's corner .
Anti-science as the GOP likes to be , I 'm sure these facts will go right over their heads :
The study indicates that substantial benefits would accrue if car care facilities systematically offered complimentary tire pressure checks with oil changes including : ( i ) increased safety by decreasing all crashes and saving more than 100 lives per year , ( ii ) reduced petroleum consumption by over a billion gallons / year , which would ( iia ) provide over $ 4 billion in economic savings for US consumers that could in part be recouped in retail / auto - care facilities , ( iib ) reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 13.5 million tons and automobile pollution and ( iic ) enhance national security .
As Obama says , " it 's like these guys take pride in being ignorant . "
Oh , snap !
Full transcripts below the fold
OLBERMANN : The Republican presidential candidate has devoted his nightly embittered mocking quota to ridiculing a gas - savings suggestion advocated by his Democratic rival , a gas - saving suggestion advocated five weeks ago by a governor John McCain is considering as his running mate , a gas - saving suggestion advocated two years ago by those liberal lunatics at NASCAR , the stock car racing circuit , a gas saving suggestion which President Bush ‘s own highway department suggests could save more barrels of oil in one year than new offshore drilling could produce in four .
Keep your engine tuned and your tires properly inflated .
This as Senator Obama is declaring in Michigan today that we must end the age of oil in our time .
In a new ad , the Obama campaign stating that four more years of an administration tied to big oil would be the wrong choice .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP , OBAMA CAMPAIGN AD )
NARRATOR : Every time you fill your tank , the oil companies fill their pockets .
Now big oil is filling John McCain ‘s campaign with $ 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers , McCain wants to give them another $ 4 billion in tax breaks .
After one president in the pocket of big oil , we can‘t afford another .
Barack Obama - a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families $ 1,000 rebate .
A president who‘ll stand up for you .
SEN .
BARACK OBAMA , ( D - IL ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : I ‘m Barack Obama and I approve this message .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
OLBERMANN : The McCain campaign responding , quote , " Barack Obama ‘s latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy . "
Back in Michigan , the presumptive Democratic nominee is pointing out an end to the age of oil in our time will not be accomplished through offshore drilling .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
OBAMA : We can‘t simply pretend as Senator McCain does , that we can drill our way out of this problem .
We need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions .
We have to make a serious , nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy , and we have to do it right away - right now .
( APPLAUSE )
OBAMA : We can not wait .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
OLBERMANN : The rebuttal move from the McCain campaign today , handing out tire gauges to the traveling media corps which read , " Obama ‘s energy plan , a stunt meant to mock the Obama suggestion last week that Americans improve their gas mileage by keeping all tires properly fully - inflated , " as if that were the only part of Obama ‘s energy plan .
Cue , Senator McCain in Pennsylvania today .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
MCCAIN : Unfortunately , Senator Obama continues to oppose offshore drilling .
He continues to oppose the use of nuclear power .
These misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to American families and businesses and increased dependence on foreign oil .
We ‘re not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
OLBERMANN : Please stop yelling at me , sir .
The McCain campaign is also e-mailing a fundraising pitch offering the tire gauges for a low , low $ 25 donation .
They are available at amazon.com for 89 cents .
Problem number one , checking tire pressure is not the only aspect to Obama ‘s energy plan which also includes in no particular order , dipping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , putting at least 1 million plug - in hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015 , and a major commitment to helping the auto industry build new factories or renovate existing ones to retool for the production of those new generation vehicles .
Problem number two , Obama is not the only one to have advised Americans that properly maintained tires increase fuel efficiency .
California Governor Schwarzenegger - and let ‘s see McCain try to mock him about this - having said in June in a joint appearance with Florida Republican Governor Charlie Crist who campaigned with McCain last Friday , that average citizens should keep engines tuned and tires properly inflated as well as driving slower , buying hybrids , and lowering overall consumption .
Governor Schwarzenegger having added that at the end of June , quote , " energy prices are not going back to the good old days . "
Now , who else believes that tire pressure affects the fuel efficiency of the car ?
NASCAR does .
It has advice on its website for two years and counting , that tires be checked " at least once a month and before every road trip , " quoting further , " With escalating fuel prices the time is now for drivers to focus on simple things like proper tire pressure to maximize tire performance and increased fuel economy .
Perhaps Cindy McCain might have picked that up when she toured a garage at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania and got into a NASCAR racer with the president of NASCAR over the weekend .
The Bush administration is also promoting proper tire inflation as a way to save money and cut gasoline use .
Quoting from Department of Energy guidelines , " Keep tires properly inflated and aligned to improve your gasoline mileage by around 3.3 percent . "
" We had to induce our participants to think about the details of the social painful event in order to get them to feel pain at the present .
Merely saying , 'oh yeah , my boyfriend cheated on me once ...' is insufficient to cause current pain .
They have to steep themselves in the memory , and that 's something we do n't ordinarily do . "
On August 10 , Karl Rove went on " Face The Nation " to argue that Senator Obama would make an " intensely political choice " for Vice President without regard for the " responsibilities of president . "
At the time , Rove believed Obama would choose Tim Kaine , and argued against him by saying this :
Download Download
With all due respect again to Governor Kaine , he 's been a governor for three years , he 's been able but undistinguished .
I do n't think people could really name a big , important thing that he 's done .
He was mayor of the 105th largest city in America .
And again , with all due respect to Richmond , Virginia , it 's smaller than Chula Vista , California ; Aurora , Colorado ; Mesa or Gilbert , Arizona ; north Las Vegas or Henderson , Nevada .
It 's not a big town .
So if he were to pick Governor Kaine , it would be an intensely political choice where he said , ` You know what ?
I 'm really not , first and foremost , concerned with , is this person capable of being president of the United States ?
As we now know , Barack Obama chose Joe Biden as his VP , probably the least political choice he could have made , and probably the best governing choice he could have made .
John McCain , on the other hand , is the one who made the " intensely political choice " by choosing Sara Palin -- a political newcomer and self - described " hockey mom " who has less than two years of governing experience and ZERO foreign policy experience -- all because the political winds dictated that " change " was going to trump " experience " this election .
Rove argues that Kaine 's mayorship of Richmond ( pop. 200,000 + ) is insignificant and that his 3 years as Governor of Virginia ( pop. 7,712,091 , GDP $ 383 million ) has been " indistinguisahable . "
If Rove was intellectually consistent , would n't that mean Palin 's mayorship of Wasilla ( pop. 8,000 + ) and 20 months as Alaska governor ( pop. 683,478 , GDP $ 44.5 million ) makes her even less qualified than Kaine ?
Barack Obama chose Joe Biden because he knows his way around Washington and knows how to get stuff done .
His selection mollifies virtually no voting block or constituency .
McCain , on the other hand , chose someone eminently unqualified for the job ( seriously , can you see Sara Palin sitting down with Maliki or Karzai or any other world leader ? ) for the sole reason of appeasing the right - wing lunatic fringe and hoping to pick off a few die - hard Hillary holdouts , as well as assuaging voters ' concerns about his septuagenarianism .
So , Karl , who made the " intensely political choice " ?
What can we take away from this episode ?
When Karl Rove suggests something -- in this case , Obama would make an " intensely political decision " -- always assume the opposite will happen .
Remember , Rove predicted , according to " the math , " that the GOP would pick up seats in 2006 .
They of course were swept out of power in an historic landslide .
Remind me again why the punditocracy heralds this guys as some sort of political genius ?

Storm Troopers at the RNC
Ten days ago , as the nation focused attention on the hurricane nearing the Mississippi delta , another storm was brewing far upstream in St. Paul , Minnesota — a storm far more dangerous , it turned out , but one by and large overlooked by the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) .

When I flew into St. Paul on the evening of Aug. 30 , I encountered a din in local media about “ preemptive strikes ” on those already congregating there to demonstrate against the Iraq war and injustice against the poor in our country .
St. Paul ’s Pioneer Press expressed surprise that “ despite preemptive police searches ” and arrests , a group calling itself “ the RNC Welcoming Committee ” was still intent on “ disrupting the convention . ”
A headline screamed , “ Preemptive Arrests of Protesters in Twin Cities . ”
But it was the article ’s lead that hit home : “ Borrowing from the Bush administration ’s ‘ preemptive war ’ playbook , police agencies in the Twin Cities have made ‘ preemptive strikes ’ against organizations planning to protest at the Republican National Convention . ”
In the following days I was to see , up close and personal , a massive and totally unnecessary display of ruthlessness .
What struck a bell was that this domestic application of the doctrine of “ preemption ” was totally predictable — indeed , predicted by those courageous enough to speak out before the U.S. “ preemptive ” attack on Iraq .
Ironically , it was FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley , living in the St. Paul area , who served warning of precisely that in her hard - hitting Feb. 26 , 2003 , letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller , three weeks before the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
[ NYT , March 6 , 2003 ]
Confronting Mueller on a number of key issues ( like “ What is the FBI ’s evidence with respect to the claimed connection between al - Qaeda and Iraq ? ” ) , Rowley warned of the trickle - down effect of “ the administration ’s new policy of ‘ preemptive strikes ’ ” : “ I believe it would be prudent to be on guard against the possibility that the looser ‘ preemptive strike ’ rationale being applied to situations abroad could migrate back home , fostering a more permissive attitude on the part of law enforcement officers in this country .
” Rowley called Mueller ’s attention to the abuses of civil rights that had already occurred since 9/11 , and pointedly warned “ particular vigilance may be required to head off undue pressure ( including subtle encouragement ) to detain or ‘ round up ’ suspects . ”
Transforming the Police While in St. Paul , I got in touch with Rowley , who has been politically active in the Twin City area , and asked for her reaction to St. Paul ’s version of preemption .
This was hardly her first chance to say I - told - you - so , but she called no attention to her right - on prophesy five - and - a - half years ago .
Shaking her head , Rowley simply bemoaned how easily the artificial stoking of fear had succeeded in causing the “ otherwise wonderful community police officers of St. Paul to turn on their own peaceful citizens ( the surreal insanity we witnessed during the RNC ) . ”
She added that , once the Feds , the so - called fusion centers , the contractors get into the act , “ all the rules go up in smoke . ”
The “ preemption ” began on Friday , Aug. 29 , well before the RNC began on Monday , Sept.
1 . An academic doing research on social movement organizations , who for several months has been observing the main protesters — the RNC Welcoming Committee , the Coalition to March on the RNC and End the War , and the Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign — provided this account : “ On Friday evening the space in St. Paul that was being rented by the Welcoming Committee was raided by riot police , who knocked in the door with automatic weapons drawn , forced the 60 - 70 activists inside onto the floor , handcuffed them , then proceeded to confiscate all the banner - making supplies and movement literature .
“ Over the course of several hours the cops interrogated , photographed , ran warrant checks , and eventually , released everyone one by one .
Then they closed down the space for a code violation .
The next morning a city code inspector arrived and found no basis for closing the space .
“ Saturday morning was one of escalation and terror .
The Ramsey County Sheriff Department , together with the St. Paul police , Homeland Security , and the FBI raided four private houses .
At 8:00 AM , dozens of cops in SWAT gear broke down the door of one house where about a dozen activists were staying .
They were awakened with rifle barrels in their faces and forced to lie face down for more than an hour .
“ The cops stole all the computers and other electronic devices in the house , and core members of the Welcoming Committee sleeping there were arrested .
It being a holiday weekend , those arrested for alleged crimes could not arrive in court until Wednesday , at the earliest .
Thus , those trying to organize demonstrations will be in jail for the entire time the RNC is going on .
Four other houses were raided and dozens of activists were detained . ”
The academic who wrote the report appealed to those concerned over “ this enormous police over - kill ” to contact the Twin Cities ’ mayors and demand an end to the “ witch hunt . ”
He added , “ The people who were arrested were some of the gentlest , most dedicated activists I ’ve ever met . ”
A far cry from the “ criminal enterprise ” described by notorious Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher .
Nanette Echols , a resident of St. Paul who had been extending hospitality to the visiting protesters , insisted they had done nothing wrong .
“ In the place they raided on Friday night they were showing documentary movies to twenty - somethings in a clean , alcohol - free zone after dinner , ” she said .
Caving
In to the Feds The St. Paul City Council ?
Only one member had the courage to speak out — Councilman Dave Thune , who was particularly enraged that Sheriff Fletcher took action within St. Paul city limits : “ This is not the way to start things off … I ’m really ticked off … the city is perfectly capable of taking care of such things …
This is all about free speech .
It ’s what my father fought for in the war .
To me this smacks of preemptive strike against free speech . ”
Thune objected in particular to Fletcher ’s deputies using battering rams to knock down doors , then entering with guns drawn , and forcing people to the ground , as they did on Friday night .
This was the unsettling backdrop as I flew into St. Paul on Saturday evening , to speak at the Masses at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church on Sunday morning .
On Monday , I joined some 10,000 on a peaceful march from the Capitol to the Berlin wall of fences and to what the old Soviet Union would have called the “ organs of public safety ” arrayed before the RNC convention hall .
On the fringes there was some property damage and further arrests .
What violence there was bore the earmarks of provocation by the likes of Sheriff Fletcher and his Homeland Security , FBI , and , according to one well - sourced report , Blackwater buddies .
That ’s right .
Agent provocateurs .
Primary targets of the repression were the alternative media , including any and all those who might have a camera to record the brutality — as was successfully done at the RNC in New York four years ago .
The manner in which Amy Goodman and the two producers of “ Democracy Now ! ” were deliberately mistreated was clearly to serve as a warning that the rules had gone up in smoke — the First Amendment be damned .
Tuesday evening , after speaking at the “ Free Speech Zone , ” a fenced - off area surrounded by the organs of public safety , I joined the Poor People ’s march up to the fences before the RNC .
I observed no violence at all ; yet , the police / FBI / national guard / and who - knows - who - else decided they needed to clear the streets .
My friends and I narrowly escaped being tear - gassed , pepper - sprayed , or worse .
It was an overwhelming show of force — not to protect , but to intimidate .
Palin Significance
After speaking at a conference at Concordia University in St. Paul on Wednesday , I was more eager to watch the Republican vice - presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , deliver her acceptance speech than to risk the tear gas and pepper spray .
The way she dissed community organizers was hard to take .
But those things pale in significance , so to speak , compared to the way the governor of Alaska proceeded to ridicule the notion of reading people their rights .
I had thought that despite the distance between Alaska and Washington , the reach of the U.S. Constitution and statutes extended that far .
Friends tell me I should not have been surprised .
But , really !
After the widespread kidnapping , torture , indefinite imprisonment , and our cowardly Congress ’ empowerment of the president to imprison sine die anyone he might designate an “ enemy combatant ” — after all that ... well , it seems to me that reading a person his / her rights takes on more , not less , importance .
Not to mention the massive repression then under way right outside the convention hall .
It was , it is , a scary juxtaposition .
The following day Col .
Ann Wright and I went to the jail to offer support to the young people who had been brutalized and then released .
They had not been read their rights .
Many were camped out on the sidewalk , refusing to leave until their friends still inside were also released .
Out of the jail came Jason , a well - built young man of about 20 years , who needed help in walking .
We talked to Jason a while , and he showed us the seven , yes seven , taser wounds on his body .
One , on his left buttock , had released considerable blood , creating a large stain on his pants .
Resourcefulness
The young protesters had some success in exposing infiltrators in their ranks .
During confrontations , members of the Welcoming Committee , in particular , took copious photos of law enforcement officers and then memorized the faces .
This tactic worked like a charm in one of the St. Paul parks , when a man who looked like a protester — dark clothes , backpack , a bit disheveled — walked by .
One of the protesters recognized the man ’s face and searched through her camera until she found a photo of the man actually performing the raid on the Welcoming Committee ’s headquarters on Friday night .
The young protesters asked the man , and two associates , to leave the park , at which point the three hustled into a nearby unmarked sedan .
The license plate , observed by a Pioneer Press reporter , traced back to the detective unit of the Hennepin County sheriff ’s office , according to the county ’s Central Mobile Equipment Division .
Protesters later picked two other men out of the day ’s planned march — one because he was wearing brand - new tennis shoes .
The two left without indicating whether they were with the organs of public safety .
So there is hope .
Young people are smarter than old ones .
It is a safe bet that in the coming weeks lots of unwelcome photos will be exposing various agents provocateurs , including over - the - hill flat - feet in unmarked cars , as well as young Republicans with unmarked tennis shoes .
If those are the kind of “ sources ” upon which the police , FBI , etc. have been relying … well , that would be like having Shia reporting on Sunni , or vice versa .
The organs of public safety are probably not quite so dumb as to be unaware that one cannot expect valid “ intelligence ” from such amateurish antics .
More likely , the attitude is that any kind of “ intelligence ” will do for the purposes of local law enforcement and timid public officials cowed by the Feds .

Female Soldiers More Likely to Be Raped than Killed in Action , Says Rep. DOD official set to testify today at hearing , despite not showing up in July .
September 10 , 2008  -- A
House subcommittee is set to shed new light on the problem of sexual assault in the military today , when it will hear testimony on sexual assault numbers , prevention and response as part of its ongoing investigation into the issue .
" A woman who signs up to protect her country is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire , " said Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , who introduced a bill this summer to increase and encourage the investigation of prosecution of sexual assault and rape cases in the military and is attending today 's hearing .
It will be the second such hearing this summer but is highly anticipated because Dr. Kaye Whitley , the director of the defense department 's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office , will testify .
Whitley was a no - show at the session July 31 , even though the committee had subpoenaed her to attend .
Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Michael Dominguez prohibited
Whitley from attending that hearing , saying that his decision was based upon consultation with the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs and the general counsel of the DOD .
" It is inappropriate to question Dr. Whitley about the program when Mr. Dominguez , the decision maker responsible for the program and for the program 's results , is available to answer those questions , " said Cynthia O. Smith , a DOD spokeswoman , adding that while Whitley is responsible for implementing policy , Dominguez has " full accountability and responsibility . "
The decision outraged the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 's Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , who sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates Aug. 12 demanding the department 's staff cooperate with the investigation into sexual assault in the armed forces .
He said Whitley 's testimony was vital because the office she leads " serves as the single point of accountability for the Department of Defense sexual assault policy . "
At the hearing , Waxman questioned what the DOD was " trying to cover up " and said it has " a history of covering up sexual offense problems . "
He announced Aug. 13 that the DOD had agreed to cooperate and that Whitley would be made available .
The DOD announced last month that it will implement a new strategy in Oct. 2009 to help troops protect their fellow servicemembers from sexual assault , but Rep.
Harman says it 's not addressing the problem now .
" We do n't have 13 months to wait , " Harman said .
She also said " bright red lines " need to be drawn about personal behavior in the military and that the prosecution of these crimes needs to increase to combat the " epidemic . "
" There are a lot of questions I want answered , " said retired Colonel Ann Wright , a 29 - year veteran of the Army and Army Reserves who is advocating for an investigation into sexual assault and " suspicious " suicides in the military .
" The warnings to women should begin above the doors of the military recruiting stations , as that is where assaults on women in the military begins – before they are even recruited , " Wright wrote recently on her website .
A recent Government Accountability
Office report found that the DOD does not adequately provide guidance on implementing sexual assault policies and programs in deployment areas , that not all commanders support such programs , that prevention and response training is not consistently effective , and that a shortage of mental health care providers affects victims ' access to mental health services .
" Left unchecked , these challenges can discourage or prevent some servicemembers from using the programs when needed , " the GAO said .
It based its findings on surveys conducted with 3,750 servicemembers at domestic and deployed units and a 2006 DOD survey .
103 servicemembers reported being sexually assaulted within the previous year , and 52 did not report the assault .
The GAO identified additional factors in non-reporting , including : " the belief that nothing would be done ; fear of ostracism , harassment , or ridicule ; and concern that peers would gossip . "
The Associated Press reported in July that of all the women who have visited a VA facility after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan , 15 percent of them screened positive for military sexual trauma .
" That means they indicated that while on active duty they were sexually assaulted , raped , or were sexually harassed , receiving repeated unsolicited verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature , " the report said .

Wow .

I ’m a little bit speechless after reading Domhnall Macauley ’s article , Olympic Games will bring health gains to the non-sporting public , says Princess Anne .
To make a short article even shorter , let me summarize :
* Exercise is good for you .
* Doctor claims that obesity may partially be a reflection of the operations of our current society .
* Exercise can help “ cure ” depression .
* Enjoying a particular exercise makes it more likely that you will stick with the exercise .
Now I ’m not undermining the importance of any of the above statements mentioned by various professionals at a British Medical Association exercise and health conference .
It ’s just that … well , come on , is n’t this all old news ?
In 2012 the Olympic Games will be held in London and Princess Anne sees this event as
… a great opportunity to promote physical activity and to create a culture of activity among young people .
I do n’t mean to rain on your parade Princess
Anne but do you really think that the Olympics will have that big of an impact ?
After all , you ’d have to be absolutely out - of - touch with reality not to know some “ basics ” of exercise , like the ones listed above .
I do n’t believe that too many people doubt the necessity of this activity ; I just think they do n’t want to do it .
Now , I speak from where I ’ve been .
You see , after many years as an athlete and just all - around active person , I ’ve been somewhat idle for the last decade , give or take a few years .
Now I do chase a toddler , carry him around all day , and go for a few daily strolls around the neighborhood , all which I feel give me some justification in not engaging in more formal activities .
( After all , he ’s 22 lbs… that ’s like carrying around a medicine ball at least ! )
I know that engaging in exercise is important , not just for my health but as a positive example for my son .
But still , as much as I love watching a good tennis match or basketball game , I do n’t break out the shorts and tug my hair into a ponytail so I can get out there and sweat it up .
So I ’m not quite sure that the Olympics , an event that has surely lost some of it ’s magical connotations , is going to rouse the sedentary to do … well , anything at all actually .
If we want to ensure a healthier society , I think that the best approach is something that Ken Fox , a professor at Bristol University , mentioned .
He noted that our society has simply changed ; it is ridiculously easy for someone to go all day without even doing a few minutes of brisk activity .
We drive to work .
We sit at a desk .
We eat fast food for lunch .
We drive home .
We sit in front of the television .
We drive to a friend ’s house for dinner .
We drive home .
We sleep .
We are creatures of habit and we are in the habit of being static .
We are in a collective mindset of doing and going without having to exert physical energy to do so .
A perfect illustration ?
The other evening my husband played basketball with a few guys in the neighborhood .
After the game he started to walk the 3 blocks to our house .
The other guys who all lived within a few blocks of the course as well wanted to know if he needed a ride .
I guess they were confused about why he would walk home when it would be easier to drive .

Tight Economy Creates Less Trash
The latest economic indicator might be that pile of garbage at the curb .
Aug. 31 2008 , 2008 -- Trash is Kevin Kiernan 's business , and he has a theory about why there has been a recent decline in the amount being collected .
It 's the economy , says Kiernan , director of the King County Division of Solid Waste in the state of Washington .
Waste tonnage declines of 3 % to 12 % have been reported over time frames ranging from the past several months to the past year by solid waste managers across the USA .
" Garbage typically has n't been called an economic indicator , but we firmly believe it is , " Kiernan said .
Trash tonnage in King County dropped by 7 % in the fourth quarter of 2007 , " and continues to stay about 7 % behind , " he said .
Bucknell University economist Thomas Kinnaman , editor of The Economics of Residential Solid Waste Management , agrees .
" Solid waste production goes up and down with the economy , " he said .
Kinnaman added that much of the decline is a result of the slowdown in the housing market .
" We see our own garbage , and we think that 's what fills up landfills , " Kinnaman says .
" But a big chunk of landfills is construction debris .
It 's not so much that we 're buying fewer 2 - liter soda bottles .
It 's less construction going on . "
Recycling is also part of the reduction , waste disposal managers say .
But according to Ron Mills , executive director for the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio , the current slowdown is too widespread and has happened too recently for that to be a big part of the equation .
Recycling efforts " do n't represent that big of a piece to account for the kinds of fluctuations we 're seeing in the amounts going into the landfills , " Mills said .
" When there 's less disposable income , less is disposed of , " he said .
Lori Scozzafava , deputy executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America , says similar waste - tonnage reductions have happened before .
" We have seen in the past that with downturns in the economy , disposal tonnage reduces , " she said .
Construction and demolition - related waste " has taken a substantial dip in the past two or three years , " said William Merry , general manager for the Monterey ( Calif . ) Regional Waste Management District .
" People just are n't as active in construction and demolition , " he said .
Anecdotal evidence supports the theory that tough economic times are meaning less waste :
• Lancaster County , Pa . " For the first six months ( of 2008 ) we 've seen a 3 % decline , year - over - year , " said Jim Warner , county Solid Waste Management Authority executive director .
• Columbus , Ohio .
" Last year , we took in 871,000 tons .
This year we 're on track to take in closer to 820,000 tons , " said Mills of the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio .
• Cape Coral , Fla .
" We have seen a slowdown in what has been set out at the curb , " said Larry Berg , the district 's manager for Waste Management .
" When you see that from our perspective , people are n't buying as much or buying the large - ticket items , " he said .
• Winston - Salem / Forsyth County , N.C. The 19 % decline in construction debris in 2008 is " more likely related to economic factors " said Jan McHargue , solid waste administrator .
• Los Angeles County , Calif .
" Most pronounced is a decline in construction and demolition waste , as real estate construction slows along with the economy , " said Grace Chan , solid waste management director .
Less waste is good news for the environment and for managers looking to squeeze longer lives out of landfills .
It can also be a budget - buster for systems that rely on fees charged per ton .
" We rely on people to throw things away , to make money .
Cash flow has been a problem for the past two years , because of ( declining ) quantities , " said John Hadfield , who retired Aug. 1 as executive director for Southeastern Public Service Authority in Chesapeake , Va .

Insiders just figured it out ; the grassroots already knew
For much of the year , Republican Rep. Ric Keller of Florida ’s 8th Congressional District appeared headed for a relatively painless re-election campaign .
But the four - term incumbent ’s surprisingly close win in his Aug. 26 primary election signaled that his general election contest also might be more competitive than expected -- which in turn heightened the interest of national Democratic Party strategists in Alan Grayson , a lawyer who easily won the party ’s crowded primary the same day .
Republicans will likely brand Grayson as a liberal in an effort to sway moderate and swing voters to stay with Keller .
... Keller retains advantages as the district ’s incumbent and reported $ 870,000 on hand through Aug. 6 , according to his pre-primary report filed with the Federal Election Commission .
... But working against Keller is an ever - evolving district population , including a surging Hispanic constituency , that has made the district increasingly competitive between the two major parties .
Democratic registration has grown significantly since 2002 , Jewett noted , with a surge in Democratic voters evident within the past year .
As of July 28 , Republicans held a registration advantage equal to less than one - half a percentage point over Democrats in the district .
By comparison , Republicans were up by 3.6 percent as recently as December .
Consider the following chronology , which is based on multiple interviews , public records , and previously published accounts :
November 2000 : Ric Keller , 36 , won the House seat in the 8th district of Florida , which includes his hometown of Orlando .
As an ardent proponent of family values , Keller used his wife –Cathy Schott , whom he married in 1992 – as a frequent prop for his campaign .
According to the Orlando Sentinel , Cathy , two years Ric ’s junior , “ was mentioned in his press releases .
She was featured in his very first TV ad , where Keller told voters : ‘ I believe we should send people to Washington with sound moral character . ’”
January 3 , 2001 : Ric Keller was inaugurated as a member of the House freshman class .
Beginning work for Keller that day was Danielle “ Dee Dee ” Michel , who held the title of staff assistant and received a starting salary of about $ 2,000 per month .
Michel turned 23 the day she started work in the front office answering phones and greeting visitors .
Keller , who I ’m told liked to ruminate about his conservative political positions while dining at Hooter ’s , hired a number of strikingly beautiful young female staffers .
These included Jacyln Norris , who later married Kevin Madden , now spokesman for Mitt Romney ’s campaign , and Jessica Ferguson .
Hill staffers joked about the “ Keller girls . ”
Fall 2001 : A number of Hill staffers and lobbyists became aware that Keller and Michel seemed unusually close , and talk about their relationship began circulating in political circles .
Michel was transferred down to Keller ’s Orlando office and given the job of campaign finance director .
This represented a significant leap from her original position .
She also remained on the office payroll , making her one of six Keller employees who were getting two checks -- one from the campaign and one for her staff work .
( That was a situation that at least one watchdog group found most unusual . )
June -2002 : Keller was a frequent companion of Michel ’s when he returned to Orlando from Washington .
In late June , the pair attended a Fort Lauderdale - area campaign event sponsored by marine industry interests .
( That years Keller strongly supported a bill that exempted the “ recreational marine ” industry from certain labor rules . )
Keller and Michel met with crewmembers aboard the Wehr Nuts , a 124 - foot mega - yacht .
The congressman overnighted in South Florida .
November 2002 : According to House disclosure records , Keller and Michel traveled together on the 12th and 16th of the month .
On the 18th , campaign disclosure records show that Michel received an early year - end bonus of $ 1,000 .
Disclosure filings showed no other Keller staffer received a bonus during the election cycle .
Keller and his wife separated later in November .
December 2002 : Michel departed from Keller ’s staff .
From January of 2001 , when she started to work for Keller , and her departure date , she received a combined total of roughly $ 68,000 – $ 17,000 for her work on his campaign and $ 51,000 for her work on his staff .
January 2003 : According to the Orlando Weekly , “ Keller is n’t answering questions ” about the separation , but sources “ close to the congressman ” told the newspaper that he had “ been unhappy with his marriage for two years . ”
( His unhappiness , thus , could be traced to January of 2001 . )
The sources suggest to the Weekly that the root problem was that “ he [ Keller ] is outgoing while Cathy is quiet and reserved . ”
Those sources do n’t mention that this “ family values ” congressman left his wife as she was battling Retinitis Pigmentosa , a degenerative disease that impacts both sight and hearing .
Early - 2003 ( estimated ) : Michel began to work for Hammond & Associates , Keller ’s political fundraising firm .
The firm is based in Alexandria , Virginia , just outside Washington , D.C. Between 2001 and 2006 , Keller ’s campaign paid Hammond more than $ 211,000 .
In 2006 , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington issued a report listing Keller as one of 72 members of Congress who used campaign funds to pay relatives or their relatives ’ employers during the prior six years .
Among the firms that employed lawmakers ’ relatives , Hammond ranked eighth highest in payments received .
March 5 , 2003 : Divorce finalized for Ric and Cathy Keller .
June 2004 : According to the Orlando Sentinel , the National Republican Congressional Committee ’s website “ listed [ Michel ] as a contact for a Keller campaign fund - raiser where political action committees were asked to pay $ 2,500 to attend a weekend of festivities in Orlando , which included a ‘ reception , theme park and golf for up to four people . ’ ”
March 19 , 2005 : Keller wed Michel .
His chief of staff , Bryan Malenius , told the Orlando Sentinel that he is “ positive ” that his boss “ would not want to answer questions about when the two began dating . ”
Asked about that same question , ex- wife Cathy Keller said , “ I do n’t think , for the sake of the children , I can say anything about that . ”
( Cathy Keller declined to comment for this story . )
May 3 , 2007 : Keller filed his most recent financial disclosure statement with the House .
Michel is still identified as an employee of Hammond & Associates–yet Hammond & Associates never seems to have listed Michel as an employee on its website .
Did she work there or not ?
Was she an independent contractor ?
If so , did she raise money for Keller ?
Did she get a salary or a percentage of what she brought in ?
There ’s no way of knowing for sure , since neither Hammond & Associates nor Keller replied to a request for comment .
( As of early this year , Keller has primarily relied on a firm called Bellwether Consulting Group for fundraising help . )
Today , the one - time “ Citizen Legislator ” sits atop a campaign war chest of almost half a million dollars , much of it , according to the Orlando Sentinel , donated “ from interests affected by legislation that comes before Keller ’s two committees : judiciary and education . ”
Some outsider .
Life in Congress has been good to Keller , who by all accounts enjoys the status , star power , and personal attention it brings him .
It ’s easy to see why he has reconsidered his ideas over both term limits and the sanctity of family values .
Inside the Beltway there 's a buzz starting ; it 's a buzz Blue America has seen turn into a roar since we first met Alan Grayson last January and endorsed him as our very first candidate of 2008 .
Blue America buzz and Inside the Beltway buzz do n't usually get going for the same reasons .
They 're buzzing because Alan looks like a winner .
The latest polling shows him up over Republican rubber stamp Ric Keller by 4 % .
We 're roaring because he not only looks like a winner but because he looks like a solid progressive leader and a genuine game changer who will spend every single day in Washington fighting for America and American families .
This morning , a lagging indicator of what 's going on in congressional races , changed its rating for FL - 08 and has woken up to the fact that if Ric Keller is still in DC next January , he 'll be working for the fast food restaurant lobby on K Street , a lobby he has served better than any other member of the House .
The Beltway perspective :
If some of the Beltway insiders had been paying attention to the Blue America blogs they would have known that Orlando 's registration base has changed in a way that makes it unlikely that rubber stamp Republicans will win elections there .
And they would have known that Alan Grayson had built a formidable presence with a powerfully and unapologetically progressive message .
On the eve of the primary , all the Insiders -- from the Florida Democratic Party and the DCCC to Senator Bob Graham and Ric Keller himself -- said conservative Establishment hack Charlie Stuart would walk away with the Democratic nomination .
What they failed to understand was what Alan had built in the district and that Orlando is n't looking for more of the same from the bowels of the Republican wing of the Democratic Party .
Stuart took 27 % of the vote .
When a shocked DCCC operative asked me how that happened , I asked him if he had seen any of Alan 's ads .
He had n't !
Strange this one was n't just extremely effective on Orlando TV , it has had over 36,000 views on YouTube with thousands of views on Huffington Post , Crooks & Liars , Firedoglake , Democratic Underground and ThingsYoungerThanJohn McCain
No wonder they 're surprised -- and no wonder it took until last week for the DCCC to finally put Alan on their Red to Blue list .
If only they had watched the 60 Minutes war profiteer expose or the BBC program that featured Alan or just read the powerful Vanity Fair story on the work he 's been doing !
Meanwhile , clueless as ever , Keller was one of the 189 rubber stamp , bribed -- he 's taken $ 58,325 in " donations " from Big Oil -- Republicans who voted against the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection
Act last night .
That 's a losing proposition in FL - 08 , whether Keller knows it or not .
And how will he defend himself and his miserable record ?
The same way he always has : smear and distortion .
Come November , both Obama and Grayson are going to win Orlando -- and Keller will be cashing in on services rendered for the fast food industry when he made sure they could continue feeding Americans garbage that causes cancer , heart disease and diabetes .
Many in Orlando still resent the way he treated his family when , after campaigning as a James Dobson - backed Family Values Republican , he started cheating on his wife with a number of young staffers , then dumped the wife , showered the young woman with taxpayer money and married her .
And he 's never had to face an effective opponent before .

Physically tired is one thing .
I 've noticed everyone around me is horribly mentally tired .
They are feeling an emptiness , a monotony that does n't feel normal anymore , like they are WAITING and the suspense just gets bigger and bigger , like something 's about to happen ( most people are pessimistic about it ...
I guess you can't blame them for being so ) , and reality just seems weaker than it used to .
I know I especially have been living in a mental fog for the past two or three years ... not that my memory is bad , but just like I do n't seem as attached to my perception as I used to ... and that alone makes me tired because it means I have to try extra hard to even care about trivial things like money , job , finishing community college , getting my own place , finding a mate to settle with ...
All I really wanna do is play music constantly , and even THAT is strained because it seems like everyone is so flaky lately .
Me and my bassist have been looking for a drummer for about a year and a half now .
Four guys have flaked on us .
We 're good musicians .
I 'll give you an example if you 'd like .
We 're damn good at what we do , and we just can't understand why everybody is pulling away .
Yeah , on top of the tiredness of people ... everyone except for a couple of close friends seems to be experiencing like hyperactive ignorance , selfishness , and just unabated super heightened apathy ... like all the sudden this year , it 's gone from 5 to 11 ( this one goes to eleven , okay ? ) .
I rarely see anyone I hung out with a year ago anymore .
Everyone is quite literally running away .... but from what ???
They can't escape themselves .
What kind of insanity is this ?
Oh Stephen Colbert , is there anything you can't do ?
TV personality , actor , author , presidential candidate , and of course , 80's rock icon , or at least Harmonix seems to think so .
They 've just released a new free song for Rock Band , featuring a flashback to Stephen 's earlier years when he was the front man for Stephen and the Colberts .
The band's hit single " Charlene ( I'm Right Behind You ) " is an epic ballad of unrequited love , more unrequited love , and what a man must do in the face of so much unrequited love , and it is now available for free via Xbox Live .
Did n't have time to check the PlayStation 3 , but I 'm sure it'll make it up there as well if it had n't already .
While you wait to try and mimic Stephen 's dulcet tones , we present you with the music video for the song , which we 've placed after the jump in order to minimize screaming and swooning .

This is yet another example of why we should let all of these bastards rot on the vine and go penniless , without any direct or indirect help .
Not until the taxpayers get their profit from stepping up to save Wall Street .
I do n’t care if $ 2.5 BILLION is a fraction of what they would have received had the miracle of miracles ( their pyramid scheme worked ) succeeded .
Again , there is no reason why we should trust Wall Street insider and former Goldman Sachs executive Hank Paulson .
No reason at all .
What this latest story does is show us that no , bailouts somehow always end up reinforcing bad behavior .
As Noriel Roubini says , it ’s a matter of “ privatizing profits and socializing losses . ”
Wall Street invested hundreds of millions over years , lobbying Republicans and Washington for a supposed “ free market ” economy .
They got what they wanted , so let them live with the goddamn results of it .
None of them ought to profit one penny – not one – from this mess .
If anyone deserves to profit , it ought to be the American public , who is getting shafted here .
Before one more damned penny is given out to Wall Street , let the US get it ’s money and then some .
Let them all live on government wages for a while before they start shopping at Tiffany again .
They ’ve already been paid more than enough .
Fareed Zakaria is a preeminent foreign affairs analyst
He spoke to CNN about the status of U.S. and Mideast relations with Iran and interviews Iran 's foreign minister on " Fareed Zakaria : GPS " Sunday at 1 pm ET
Fareed Zakaria say it 's going to be hard for the U.S. and Europe to pressure Iran to suspend uranium enrichment .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Amid allegations of Iranian aid to Iraqi insurgents , Iran 's effort to build a nuclear bomb and a report on an increase in U.S. covert operations in Iran , analyst Fareed Zakaria takes a look at possible changes in the country 's leadership and assesses the threat Iran could pose to Mideast stability .
CNN : Is the situation with regard to Iran getting more serious ?
Zakaria :
Well , the efforts of the United States and Europe to put Iran in a box , because of its refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment , are facing two problems .
First , it will be very difficult to get a new round of even stiffer sanctions through the United Nations .
Second , with oil at $ 140 a barrel , the Iranian regime is likely to be impervious to economic pressure .
CNN : Is there any sign of a shift in Iran ?
Zakaria :
One can read tea leaves .
It is interesting Iran has n't rejected the new offers from the United States and Europe .
It is also interesting to see the return and rise of Ali Larijani .
He is the senior Iranian political figure who was sacked by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as national security adviser .
He has returned and was elected speaker of the Parliament with a huge majority .
There is speculation that he might run for president against Ahmadinejad .
But this is all just reading tea leaves .
CNN : If he were to gain power , would that be good for the United States ?
Zakaria : Larijani is not a warm , cuddly pro-Western Iranian who wants to give up the country 's nuclear program .
He is somebody who is an integral part of Iran 's theocracy .
He comes from a distinguished clerical family himself .
But compared with Ahmadinejad , he is clearly a moderate and a pragmatist .
The crucial question with Iran going forward :
Is it a regime we can deal with , bargain with and deter in a rational manner ?
CNN : What do you make of Israel 's recent military maneuvers ?
Zakaria : I think we have to broaden our horizons and look at this carefully .
Israel has opened negotiations in various ways with Egypt , Syria and more quietly with Jordan .
Then it flew 100 of its F - 16s and F - 15s more than 900 miles , roughly the distance between Israel and Iran 's main Natanz nuclear - enrichment facility .
It is conceivable that Israel is making diplomatic overtures to its Arab neighbors while preparing for a military strike against Iran .
Watch CNN 's Fareed Zakaria interview Iran 's foreign minister »
CNN : What would be the effects of that ?
Zakaria :
It 's difficult to say in advance .
Many Arab states would be secretly pleased ( remember Shia , Persian Iran has always been seen as a rival to the Arab Sunni states in the region ) but would publicly condemn it .
But the great danger is that such an attack would only delay the Iranian program by a few years but not destroy it .
Also , an Israeli attack would serve to rally the whole Iranian nation around the regime and give it a new lease on life .

Mr Rousson failed to make the 34 - mile ( 55 km ) journey in June A French amateur pilot 's attempt to be the first to cross the channel on a pedal - propelled airship has failed .
Stephane Rousson , 39 , from Nice , took off from Hythe on the Kent coast at about 0800 BST and was half - way to the French coast by 1300 BST .
But he was hampered by a change in the wind direction and called off the trip 11 miles from Wissant in France .
Mr Rousson said : " I 'm not disappointed .
I feel happy because it had nothing to do with any technical failure . "
During the challenge , Mr Rousson was suspended underneath the balloon envelope in a carbon fibre gondola , powering the two propellers with his feet using a bicycle - like contraption .
To have set off is a victory in itself
Spokeswoman for Mr Rousson
He had been waiting for more than a week for winds of less than 5 mph before he could set off .
Speaking from France , Rousson said : " We were about three - quarters of the way across but the wind was flowing in the wrong direction for me to make it across .
" Unfortunately there was nothing to suggest from the weather forecasts that there was going to be this change in the direction of the wind . "
A spokeswoman for Mr Rousson said : " To have set off is a victory in itself .
He had to wait for just the right weather conditions but they came at the right time . "
Mr Rousson also failed to make the 34 - mile ( 55 km ) journey in airship Zeppy in June , despite waiting two weeks for the ideal weather conditions .
The venture had been inspired by the Steven Spielberg film ET , he said .
" Ever since I was a kid I have dreamed of flying , " he added .

A new poll has found Australians ' attitudes towards the United States are improving , but they are becoming more concerned about China 's growing influence .
The Lowy Institute surveyed 1,000 Australians about their views on foreign policy issues .
More than three - quarters said Australia 's alliance with the United States was fairly important or very important , the highest level of support since the annual survey began in 2005 .
But Australians are less happy about the rise of China , with a majority saying Australia should join with other countries in limiting China 's influence .
Last year , respondents were evenly divided over whether Australia should continue its military involvement in Afghanistan , but 56 per cent are now opposed .
The poll also found Australians are overwhelmingly in favour of Barack Obama over John McCain as the next US president , by a margin of almost 5:1 .

Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich spoke at the Democratic National Convention today and there is little doubt his was the most enthusiastic and hard hitting speech thus far .
Dennis always comes armed with truth and facts , and today was no exception .
From illegal wiretapping , Iraq and high gas prices to playing the fear card , he blazed through the laundry list of Bush hackery and crimes and pounded the message home -- Americans to wake up and vote for Barack Obama .
" ... Wake up America !
The insurance companies took over health care .
Wake up America !
The pharmaceutical companies took over drug pricing .
Wake up America !
The speculators took over Wall Street .
Wake up America , they want your Social Security .
Wake up America , multi-national corporations took over our trade policies , factories are closing , good paying jobs are being lost , wake up America ! "
Now that 's the spirit !
We need to hear more of this during the convention .
The American electorate needs a good dose of reality .
If this speech does n't get you fired up , nothing will .

Scientists from Georgia
Tech have invented a new way of battling cancer .
Their new technology involves nanoparticles that attach themselves to cancer cells and guide them out of the body .
With further development , this invention may help detect ovarian cancer and even prevent metastasis .
Professor Z. John Zhang –
the research advisor
( Credit : Georgia Institute
of Technology )
The scientists from Georgia Tech realized that magnetic nanoparticles could catch free floating cancer cells by attaching to molecules on their surface and flush them out of the body .
This technology might have a special importance in ovarian cancer , as it ’s characterized by free floating cancerous cells in the abdominal cavity .
If these cells can be caught by the nanoparticles , the metastasis may be prevented .
The particles used in the following experiment have cobalt - spiked magnetite at their core and are just about 10 nanometers in diameter .
Their surface holds a peptide ( small protein like molecule ) which was designed for getting attached to a marker that is found on most ovarian cancer cells .
They are normally without any magnetic properties , but when a magnet is present , it attracts them .
The scientists tested the technology on mice .
They first injected cancer cells into the mice ’s abdominal cavities and then added the magnetic nanoparticles .
They tagged the cancer cells with a green fluorescent marker and the nanoparticles with a red one .
When a magnet was brought near the mice ’s bellies , a concentrated area of green and red glow surfaced under the skin , which indicted to the researchers that the nanoparticles and cancer cells were attached to one another and the magnet dragged them both to the surface .

Although the experiment proved that an attachment between cancer cells and nanoparticles occurred , it did not show what proportion of cancer cells was caught by the nanoparticles .
Some critics of this experiment think that this technology is more suitable for diagnosing but not treating metastasis .
It is not clear whether the nanoparticles could significantly filter out the cancerous cells .
However , the authors are optimistic .
Though the nanoparticles were tested inside the bodies of mice , they think it will be possible to use an external device that would remove a patient ’s abdominal fluid , magnetically filter out the cancer cells , and then return the fluid to the body .
This way , dangers of toxicity will be eliminated .
First a patient would undergo surgery to remove the primary tumor and then proceed to the filtering treatment .
Such a filter is currently in development and the scientists are already testing it on abdominal fluid from human cancer patients .
TFOT has recently covered the use of a magnet controlled camera for esophagus imaging which could detect early cancer growths , developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering in Sankt Ingbert , Germany .
Another related topic recently covered by TFOT deals with nanoworms that can be used as a non-invasive cancer treatment currently under development by a team from the University of California , San Diego .
The Sept. 11 memorial bells chimed with beautiful clarity Thursday , from Shanksville , Pa. , to ground zero and beyond , a reminder of tragedy and our nation ’s real enemies .
What a welcome respite , that serene sound , after days of presidential politics that roared and sputtered with a cacophony of distortion , innuendo and outright lies .
It got so bad the day before the anniversary of the terrorist attacks that FactCheck.org -- one of the nonpartisan journalism websites heroically trying to strain truth amid all the sound and fury -- had to put out an extraordinary news release .
It chastised John McCain ’s campaign for -- now get this -- distorting FactCheck ’s debunking of distortions .
News organizations and these admirable truth - squadding outfits , including PolitiFact.com , do not collaborate .
But in independent news reports and commentaries this week , they seemed to reach a consensus to say “ enough ” to the McCain camp ’s efforts to demonize Barack Obama .
I ’m not saying that Obama has n’t told a few whoppers -- like suggesting McCain ’s proposed corporate tax breaks are tailored specifically for oil companies or that his opponent seriously believes anyone making under $ 5 million is middle - class .
But it ’s McCain and his foot soldiers who have really fouled the election airwaves in recent days , provoking the first flickerings of a backlash from the media .
Give credit to PolitiFact.com -- an online endeavor operated by Florida ’s St. Petersburg Times along with Congressional Quarterly -- for unequivocally knocking down one of the McCainites ’ biggest fabrications in recent days .
You know , the one where Obama supposedly called Republican V.P. nominee Sarah Palin a pig .
For the half - dozen of you who have n’t heard about this kerfuffle :
It began this week when Obama belittled McCain ’s suggestion that McCain would bring change to Washington .
“ That ’s not change , ” Obama told a responsive audience .
“ That ’s just calling something -- the same thing -- something different .
But you know , you can put lipstick on a pig ; it ’s still a pig . ”
McCain operatives puffed themselves up with outrage about Obama ’s “ sexism . ”
Then they released a Web advertisement , disingenuously flashing text on the screen -- “ Barack Obama on : Sarah Palin ” -- while cutting to Obama ’s “ lipstick on a pig ” remark .
As noted on PolitiFact , the ad gives no context for Obama ’s remark -- context that made it clear the Democrat was belittling McCain ’s claim that he is an agent of change .
PolitiFact rated the McCain ad “ Pants on Fire ” ( as in “ liar , liar ” ) on its Truth - O - Meter .
“ If anyone ’s doing any smearing , ” the site concluded , “ it ’s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts . ”
Outrageous , but just a warmup for the smarmy untruth the McCain camp uncorked next -- that Obama voted in his home state of Illinois to foist detailed sex education on kindergartners .
Often in the past , journalists who were confronted with such a lie opted for on - the - one - hand / on - the - other - hand reporting .
That allows one politician to launch a fabrication , while another tries , often in vain , to swat it down .
McClatchy Co. newspapers ( publisher of the Sacramento Bee and other papers ) and reporter Margaret Talev admirably cast aside the wishy - washy approach .
Looking at Obama and the Illinois sex-ed legislation , Talev concluded that McCain ’s charge was “ deliberately misleading . ”
“ As a state senator in Illinois , Obama did vote for , but was not a sponsor of , legislation dealing with sex ed for grades K - 12 , ” the reporter explained .
“ But the legislation allowed local school boards to teach ‘ age - appropriate ’ sex education , not comprehensive lessons to kindergartners . ”
That probably would have meant , at most , classes to help the youngest children fend off sexual predators .
Talev flagged the McCain ad for “ unsportsmanlike conduct . ”
The truth - tellers in this campaign have not throttled McCain alone .
PolitiFact , for example , has slapped Obama more than once , including for his false claim that McCain promised to continue the war in Iraq for 100 years .
( McCain said the United States might need to keep military bases there for that long . )
It was the McCain team , however , that plumbed new depths this week by distorting a fact - checking outfit that had come to its aid .
It happened when FactCheck ( a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center ) shot down rumors flying around the Internet about Alaska Gov. Palin .
FactCheck rejected claims that Palin cut special education in Alaska , endorsed Pat Buchanan for president and joined the secessionist - leaning Alaskan Independence Party .
( Her husband , Todd , was an AIP member . )
The McCainites tried to attribute anonymous Internet falsehoods to one individual : Surprise !
Barack Obama .
Superimposing FactCheck ’s “ completely false , or misleading ” finding over a photo of Obama , the Republicans suggested the Democrat had trumped up the charges .
FactCheck , however , found “ no evidence ” tying Obama to the anonymous Internet attacks .
The muckrakers announced Wednesday that McCain & Co. had been “ less than honest . ”
Obama blew off the lies with a shrug and a smile when he visited David Letterman this week .
But I suspect that many Americans ’ reaction comes closer to sadness .
Or anger .

Days out in Iraq really gets me in the dump until I actually take one .
Yes , he spelled that as “ reinlistment ” papers .
Days out in Iraq really gets me in the dump until I actually take one .
It ’s always nice to see a little motivation as I walk in the porter shitter to read all the wonderful shit Marines , soldiers , sailors , and the airmen must let us know about .
You read such things as who ’s the harderst ( gayest ) branch of service , who ’s got the sluttiest chicks , how much they hate their own branch of service , how well they can draw certain parts of the human anatomy , and overall reassure everyone who bothers to read any of it that the recruiters of this country get the best and brightest to sign up .
In all seriousness , these guys make the people who write anonymous internet comments off of THIS site look like Rhodes Scholars .

If you 're sick of your laptop and mobile running out of power , fret no more .
Researchers have invented a system of " wireless electricity " that powers up your devices without having to plug them in .
Yesterday the CTO of Intel , Justin Rattner , wowed a crowd of journalists with the prototype for this wireless electricity system .
Using an emitter device , Rattner beamed power to a lamp on stage , powering up the bulb from a distance .
Sounds convenient , but many questions remain .
Is it safe to wander through an environment bathed in electricity that 's powering up your devices ?
Rattner reassured the audience that it would be perfectly safe .
According to Yahoo !
News :
" It turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields ; it is affected by electric fields .
So what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field . "
Examples of potential applications include airports , offices or other buildings that could be rigged to supply power to laptops , mobile telephones or other devices toted into them . . .
" Initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together , " analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of Intel 's wireless power system .
" That is potentially a world changing event .
This is the closest we 've had to something being commercially available in this class . "
Previous wireless power systems consisted basically of firing lightning bolts from sending to receiving units .

Wait , what ?
OK first of all , I totally want my lightning bold sender / receiver .
But how does this shit really work ?
Thankfully , John Markoff of the New York Times has the story :
The research project , which is being led by Joshua R. Smith , an Intel researcher at a company laboratory in Seattle , builds on the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Marin Soljacic , who pioneered the idea of wirelessly transmitting power using resonant magnetic fields .
The MIT group refers to the idea as WiTricity , a play on wireless and electricity .
Both the M.I.T. group and the Intel researchers are exploring a phenomenon known as " resonant induction , " making it possible to transmit power several feet without wires .
Induction is already used to recharge electric toothbrushes , but that approach is limited by the need for the toothbrush to be placed in the base station .

Currently , Intel can transmit 60 watts for 2 - 3 feet .
I still think the lightning option might be better .
Especially when it 's being used to charge up my brain implant .

While out for my monthly moms ’ night out last week , I was disturbed by my own request for more salad dressing .
With 1/3 of my lettuce remaining , I could have easily gone without .
Before I thought better of it though , my extra dollop arrived in a plastic ramekin on a side plate with a paper doily for pretty presentation .
Instead of enjoying the rest of my salad , I felt guilty knowing what Mother Earth had gone through to satisfy my need for a mere ounce of strawberry vinaigrette .
Being green is more difficult when you ’re on the go , is n’t it ?
As my mom used to say , one of the hardest things in life is learning to just say no .
Here are some of my new no ’s for on the go :
Say no to receipts for things I would never take back
I use debit for almost everything and my purchases show up on my electronic bank statement .
I ’m not going to take back gas , or my daughter ’s haircut , or the new crown on my dead tooth , so why do I need a receipt ?
Say no to plastic bags for produce
I need five apples , four pears , and a bunch of bananas .
Do I need three plastic bags as well ?
No .
The clerk may get annoyed , and she will have to touch my fruit , but so did the teenager who stocked it and I ’m planning on washing it well .
Say no to paper bags for baked goods
How far does that cookie have to go ?
I think I can manage to hold it in my hands for that second or two before my little monster eats it .
Yesterday when I did this , the store manager gave me two free coffees .
Admittedly , coffee on the go is one of my most wasteful habits .
To do my part I now look for sweetener pumps and say no to stir sticks and cozies .
Say no to bags for clothes
If I ’m taking my new jeans and T - shirt right to the car ( actually I ’m probably on foot and have a storage basket in the stroller ) surely I can manage without a bag .
I know people are n’t refusing bags often enough , because the clerk looked at me as if I was a thief the other day when I stuffed my new bikini into my small purse .
Say no to fast food toys
Gasp .
We do take the kids out for fast food about once a month , mostly for the indoor playground .
They are young enough that they do n’t yet expect a toy with their junk meal .
What I ’ve learned about saying no to fake plastic toys is that you have to be stern with the clerk , because he or she will push the toy and make you look mean in front of your kids for not taking one .
We do n’t need a cute paper bag for each child ’s meal either , thanks .
Say no to library slips
We reserve , renew , and check upcoming due dates online , yet I still come home with an arm length of paper every two weeks to remind me which library books I have out .
Before our librarian presses the button on her computer I need to remember to say , “ I do n’t need a receipt .
I use the online service . ”
Sometimes writing things down helps me keep green habits going .
How do you stay green on the go ?

The New York Times is reporting Congressional Leaders Stunned by Warnings
It was a room full of pople who rarely hold their tongues .
But as the Fed chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , laid out the potentially devastating ramifications of the financial crisis before congressional leaders on Thursday night , there was a stunned silence at first .
Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had made an urgent and unusual evening visit to Capitol Hill , and they were gathered around a conference table in the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ When you listened to him describe it you gulped , " said Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York .
As Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , put it Friday morning on the ABC program “ Good Morning America , ” the congressional leaders were told “ that we ’re literally maybe days away from a complete meltdown of our financial system , with all the implications here at home and globally . ”
Mr. Schumer added , “ History was sort of hanging over it , like this was a moment . ”
When Mr. Schumer described the meeting as “ somber , ” Mr. Dodd cut in .
“ Somber does n’t begin to justify the words , ” he said .
“ We have never heard language like this . ”

Microsoft to Pull Seinfeld TV Commercials

Microsoft is expected to announce Thursday that it will be suspending its ad campaign featuring Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and veteran comedy superstar Jerry Seinfeld .
Valleywag broke the news Wednesday , and Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw told the LA Times that the move was planned , despite the appearance that the company is reacting to negative reaction to the ads .
According to Mr. Shaw , the Seinfeld portion of the campaign , for which he was reportedly paid some US $ 10 million , was always intended to be just an introduction for the overall campaign -- a two commercial introduction for $ 10 million .
" All along we said we were having a teaser campaign , " he told the LA Times .
" We 're getting ready to start the second phase .
This was the plan all along . "
The ads , which featured Mssrs.
Seinfeld and Gates in ordinary situations discussing how Microsoft needs to get back in touch with its customers , have largely been panned ( this reporter said they were great in the most recent Apple Weekly Report # 132 podcast ) , with many people saying they did n't make sense .
Jerry Seinfeld helps Bill Gates try on shoes in the first ad featuring the commedian
Pundits and critics suggested the ads were an attempt by the company to counter Apple 's successful " I'm a Mac " commercials starring Justin Long as the personification of the cool and hip " Mac " and John Hodgman as the stodgy " PC . "
Microsoft said in the second commercial that it was trying to reconnect with customers , from whom the company , as personified by Mssrs. Gates and Seinfeld , had become distant .
To most , the ads were just as distant as Microsoft itself .
Be that as it may , Big Redmond has planned on spending some $ 300 million on the broader campaign , which will presumably be taking a new different direction .
As of this writing , the ads are still featured on Microsoft 's Windows Web page .
World 's First Carbon Capture Pilot Launching Next Week
September 5th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology will get a chance to prove itself next week at the 1,600 MW Schwarze Pumpe coal - fired power plant in Germany .
The CCS demonstration will capture up to 100,000 tons of CO2 each year and bury it 3,000 m under a nearby gas field .
The scheme uses oxyfuel technology , which relies on burning coal in pure oxygen and CO2 instead of normal air .
This results in a byproduct of almost pure CO2 that is bottled and pumped underground .
The Schwarze Pump has an output of 12 MW of electricity and 300 MW of thermal power — enough for over 1,000 homes .
While the pilot pump will only run for three years , the company behind the Schwarze Pump plan is commissioning a similar project in France next year .
I am cautiously optimistic about the upcoming CCS projects , but we will be waiting a long time to see widespread commercial use of the technology — probably until 2020 .
And questions about the long - term safety of CCS linger .
For example , what happens to a CO2 burial site in the event of an earthquake ?
But such questions are not stopping companies from investing time and money in CCS , so we can expect many more test projects like Schwarze Pump in the near future .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
It ’s July in Austin , Texas .
I ’m wear­ing an elec­tric pink cape screech­ing to a milling audi­ence of sev­er­al hun­dred who await the appear­ance of House Speak­er Nan­cy Pelosi ( D‑Calif . ) .
It ’s uncom­fort­able for many rea­sons , but I ’m a reporter embed­ded in the anti­war move­ment .
This is my job .
At a November press conference at the Heritage Foundation , President Bush singled out Code Pink -- along with what he called " MoveOn.org bloggers " -- for setting a dangerous , radical agenda for U.S. politics .
A team of sev­en rose - hued women sur­rounds me , all of us yelling in uni­son .
Most of the women are bet­ter dressed , at least as far as the occa­sion calls for – hook­er boots , glit­tery logos , las­sos , tights and masks – and sport hero­ic monikers like ​ “ The Ham­mer of Com­mon Sense , ” ​ “ Jus­ti­cia ” and ​ “ Voice of the People . ”
The lone male with us wears com­i­cal­ly short prison grays , over­sized plas­tic shack­les and a giant paper - mache head meant to resem­ble the nog­gin ’ of the pres­i­dent of the Unit­ed States .
“ Impeach Bush , ” his fly­ers proclaim .
We ’re at Net­roots Nation , where Pelosi has been invit­ed to respond to audi­ence queries .
Ten­sions had been high since the appear­ance was announced .
Pro­gres­sives balked online about her refusal to call con­gres­sion­al hear­ings to impeach Bush , a posi­tion she ’s dogged­ly held since the 2006 mid-term elections .
Pos­si­bly to quell Pelosi ’s dis­com­fort , event orga­niz­ers took most ques­tions in advance ( none of that pesky democ­ra­cy here ! ) , and demand­ed the crowd lim­it ​ “ inter­rup­tions . ”
In oth­er words – as some blog­gers posit­ed in real time at the event – they want­ed Code Pink to keep quiet .
But inter­rup­tions came from else­where , not from the Austin chap­ter of Code Pink ​ “ Sheroes , ” whose mem­bers kept qui­et for the most part .
They formed a silent line across the back of the room in front of the row of video cam­eras , direct­ly in Pelosi ’s line of sight .
‘ Sil­ly and girly ’
Code Pink has come to be viewed as a gag­gle of smart but sil­ly women , an unkempt list­serv , and a mis­matched array of girly accou­trements , housed on Capi­tol Hill , in a space known sim­ply as the D.C. House .
In 2002 , Medea Ben­jamin , Jodie Evans , Starhawk and Diane Wil­son found­ed the orga­ni­za­tion , begin­ning with a four - month White House vig­il and joined by 100 ded­i­cat­ed , bright­ly clad adher­ents .
The group has become a light­ning rod for crit­i­cism of the anti­war move­ment – and of con­tem­po­rary activism .
At a Novem­ber press con­fer­ence at the Her­itage Foun­da­tion , Pres­i­dent Bush sin­gled out Code Pink – along with what he called ​ “ MoveOn​.org blog­gers ” – for set­ting a dan­ger­ous , rad­i­cal agen­da for U.S. pol­i­tics .
This atti­tude is also echoed in our sup­pos­ed­ly left - lean­ing media .
“ The Dai­ly Show ” reg­u­lar­ly stages par­o­dies of Code Pink ’s tac­tics of strate­gic irri­ta­tion , sat­i­riz­ing inter­rup­tions at con­gres­sion­al debates , and open­ly mock­ing pro­test­ers at mil­i­tary recruit­ing stations .
Salon​.com writer Cin­tra Wil­son calls the group ​ “ an eye­sore , ” not unlike ​ “ an irri­tat­ing children ’s birth­day party . ”
Many activists have pri­vate­ly expressed sim­i­lar wish­es that Code Pink would just go away .
As one well - dressed lefty con­fid­ed to me in Austin after I ’d stowed my cape : ​“ Crap . Code Pink . ”
Griev­ances
The crit­i­cisms slung at Code Pink hint toward sex , class , race and age bias­es still har­bored in the polit­i­cal left .
The mid­dle - aged , upper - mid­dle class white ladies who have tra­di­tion­al­ly made up the group ’s core might seem bet­ter placed at the heads of kinder­garten class­rooms or behind the desks of libraries .
The under­ly­ing sen­ti­ment : ​‘ What could they pos­si­bly have to com­plain about ?
They are white !
They are comfortable !’
For starters , they have much to opine about : a tank­ing econ­o­my , an ille­gal war , and a strip­ping of our con­sti­tu­tion­al rights .
In fact , these mid­dle - aged ladies are using their posi­tions of com­fort for the pub­lic good , agi­tat­ing not for bet­ter cof­fee at PTA meet­ings , but for an oust­ing of mil­i­tary recruit­ment facil­i­ties from school campuses .
“ These ​‘mid­dle - aged ladies ’ are my dai­ly inspi­ra­tion , ” Code Pink Cam­paign Man­ag­er Dana Bal­ic­ki explains .
And she ’s in her 20s .
​ “ I ’ve wit­nessed women go from total dis­com­fort with e‑mailing to orga­niz­ing local protests using Face­book and cre­at­ing their own action blogs , leav­ing pho­tos and YouTube videos in their wake . ”
Code Pink’s D.C. House mama , Desiree Fairooz , joined the group two years ago because of ​ “ the cre­ativ­i­ty , the ​‘in - your - face ’ tac­tics , and the per­sis­tence , ” she says .
You might have seen pho­tos of Fairooz in the media – images of her with her hands cov­ered in blood , con­fronting Sec­re­tary of State Con­doleez­za Rice about war crimes .
Since last spring , Fairooz led a Code Pink team to Capi­tol Hill every day for a year to call for votes against a $ 165 bil­lion Iraq War bud­get increase , which Con­gress passed in May .
It ’s a defeat that still stings .
“ This is only the most recent , and per­haps most egre­gious betray­al , ” says Medea Ben­jamin .
​ “ It was so obvi­ous­ly a polit­i­cal ploy to avoid anoth­er vote on war fund­ing before the Novem­ber elections . ”
Even Sen. Barack Obama ’s recent­ly pro­posed time­line to pull out of Iraq has n’t slowed Code Pink .
Because of his pledge to shift focus onto the war in Afghanistan , the group has a new , secret cam­paign that will kick off after the election .
Code Pink often has in place five or six cam­paigns – aimed at avoid­ing war with Iran , shift­ing Oba­ma to the left or decreas­ing depen­den­cy on fos­sil fuels .
Three or four cam­paigns dom­i­nate week­ly staff con­fer­ence calls .
Anoth­er three or four sit on the back­burn­er , occa­sion­al­ly recon­sid­ered – or ​ “ pinked up ” – for pub­lic view .
On June 13 , when a Berke­ley , Calif. , counter - recruit­ment cam­paign became heat­ed , some Code Pink pro­test­ers respond­ed to the ris­ing temps by , well , tak­ing off their shirts .
​ “ Breasts not bombs , ” they explained to passers­by and to the police who arrest­ed them .
( A lat­er protest suc­cess­ful­ly shut down the station . )
But it ’s moments like this when the group becomes known as an emp­ty brand instead of a change - mak­ing movement .
Ben­jamin is quick to acknowl­edge fail­ures : ​ “ The war is still rag­ing in Iraq and Afghanistan , there are mil­lions of Iraqis who are refugees and dis­placed – we have not been suc­cess­ful in get­ting more funds to help them – Guan­tá­namo has not been closed , FISA was passed , and on and on . ”
The Bush administration ’s sway over media must cause us to ques­tion the depic­tions of the anti­war move­ment .
The media did , after all , send us to war with­out due dili­gence – and told sto­ries based pri­mar­i­ly on the accounts of embed­ded reporters .
By con­trast , lit­tle media sur­round­ed Code Pink ’s speak­ing tour of Iraqi women last year .
The group vis­it­ed more than 100 U.S. cities , call­ing for the mil­i­tary to leave Iraq .
Fam­i­lies with enlist­ed sons and daugh­ters called to lend support .
Oth­er suc­cess­es are just as per­son­al .
D.C. House vol­un­teers tell sto­ries of con­gres­sion­al secu­ri­ty guards who whis­per appre­ci­a­tion that the group con­tin­ues to make its pres­ence – and demands – felt on the Hill .
Ben­jamin points to larg­er vic­to­ries : ​“ The Democ­rats tak­ing con­trol of Con­gress in 2006 due to the anti­war sen­ti­ment ; Oba­ma win­ning over Hillary because of his stance against the war [ and ] the new grow­ing con­sen­sus on the need for a time­line for with­draw­al .
…
And so far , the fact that the U.S. mil­i­tary has not invad­ed Iran . ”
Still , what gets atten­tion – even among our lib­er­al media – is the girly color .
“ Code Pink is about reclaim­ing the rich­ness of fem­i­nin­i­ty and pow­er , ” Bal­ic­ki says , ​ “ which is har­nessed in our gen­er­al dis­taste of the col­or that , for many , rep­re­sent­ed all things typ­i­cal , sub­dued , appro­pri­ate , pre­dictable , sim­ple and rea­son­able – val­ues most of us strug­gled to leave aside . ”
She adds : ​ “ Once you march with 10,000 women in pink around the White House , the col­or nev­er looks the same .
Nei­ther do you . ”
The Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday said it was expanding its probe into potential market manipulation and was turning its attention to the largely unregulated , obscure area of credit - default swaps .
The SEC said it will require hedge - fund managers to submit , under oath , their trading activity in financial - company shares and related instruments such as credit - default swaps as part of its continuing examination of rumors and stock bets .

Analyzing the Stages
Points 1 , 2 , and 3 I believe are largely true .
Point 4 is false unless some large caveats are added ( A person who took out a sub - prime loan because they wanted to own a home bears less responsibility than the broker who lied to them about the terms of the loan , or the insurer who guaranteed the loan knowing that they did n't have the resources to pay up if there were large scale defaults , or the free - market ideologue who continually pressed for deregulation because the invisible hand of the market never errs ( these are the people who believe that capitalism is not only better than socialism , but that it 's better than democracy too -- such people are , theoretical anarchists rejecting government in all forms in favor of a system based entirely on short range , unregulated economic interests , unless of course they can manipulate government to their own short - range benefit , at which moments they are simply hypocrites , liars and crooks )
Point 5 and ( point 4 ) are right wing talking points meant to use " patriotism " or " maturity " as a cover to avoid assigning blame where it is due .
Somebody shot our dog , but lets not point fingers at John McCain and the rest of the pro-dog - shooting right - wing ideologues who have been advocating the deregulation of dog- shooting for years now as the solution to all problems .
Instead let 's all pitch in , bury the body as quickly as possible , and move on .
Unfortunately , we are faced with another crisis far more serious than the current banking and financial crisis , but which has in common with it all of the points made above , only on a scale orders of magnitude greater .
I 'm talking about Climaticide , the climate crisis , global warming etc. , whatever you choose to call it .
The climate crisis is occurring all around us at this very moment : the temperature of the planet is rising dramatically , in some places , such as the Arctic , by 8 or 9 degree 's Celsius , Hurricanes are growing more intense , droughts are longer and covering a broader range of territory , floods are more common and more intense , agricultural areas are being decimated by changes in drought and rainfall patterns which are hitting some of the world 's most vulnerable peoples , as temperature zones change , plants and animals that cannot move as fast as the shifting ecosystem go extinct ( polar bears , picas , innumerable species of insects , frogs and birds ) , while disease vectors change as creatures such as mosquitoes move into newly hospitable ecosystems .
Sea level rise leads to salt water infiltration into coastal fresh water aquifers while very low lying islands disappear destroying ancient cultures and forcing the evacuation of entire peoples .
I can write all that and still be no farther than points 1 and 2 on the original list of how collapse occurs .
Many people knew the truth of what I 've written above , but found it too inconvenient to to do anything about it .
" What are you saying , Bear Stearns looks bad ? "
" Hey , I 'm still making money . " " Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in trouble ? "
" No , problem , the Feds have it under control ? "
" They 're taking the necessary steps . "
" Lehman Brothers looking bad . "
" Aw , who needs them anyway ? " " AIG is going under ? "
" Now , wait a minute ; that 's important . "
And now you say the entire banking structure needs a massive bailout ? "
" Holy Shit !
The ships going down !
What do we do ? "
" Do n't panic .
We 'll throw out all our deregulation slogans for a while , and get the taxpayers to give us a massive bailout , even if they might be a bit short after all those tax cuts for the rich and the cost of the Iraq War .
It 'll be tough but we 'll muddle through . "
So what does step 3 look like for the climate crisis , at that point when we can no longer bullshit ourselves that the problem can be put off for another day ?
Well it 's a lot uglier than this current financial crisis , because the consequences are so much more severe and so much more implacable .
One can imagine numerous scenarios , but I 'll just provide one that might get our attention :
The Climate Crisis of 2030 .
It 's 2030 and the world has basically continued with business as usual , emitting more CO2 and CH4 from coal - fired power plants , industrial smokestacks , the tail pipes of a tripled number of motor vehicles , increased deforestation in the Amazon and Indonesia as well as in temperate forests .
As CO2 has rise , Arctic sea ice has melted away completely in summer ( no one has seen a polar bear in the wild for 5 years ) , providing a albedo and methane feedback that further increase global surface temperature .
The Greenland Ice Sheet has melted enough to raise global sea-level by a meter creating 10's of millions of refugees in Bangladesh and China who have no place to flee to .
Parts of Florida are underwater .
Increased movement of the West Antarctic ice shelf is adding a few inches more to the sea - level rise .
Sub -Saharan Africa and Australia endure almost continual drought .
Lima ,
Peru announces that the entire city of 6 million will have to be evacuated because the mountain - fed glaciers that fed the streams supplying the city with water are gone .
Southern Spain now looks like the Sahara .
Areas of traditional heavy rainfall endure even worse storms .
Once - in - a - 100 - years storms now occur every 10 years .
The Center for Disease Control reports the first outbreaks of malaria in Minnesota .
A huge chunk of the border - fence between the US and Mexico has been brought down by a crowd estimated by Mexican and US authorities at nearly half a million people .
Casualties in the clashes that ensued left over 5,000 dead and perhaps another 16,000 wounded .
Phoenix set a new temperature record of 125F .
Meanwhile , providing the coups de grace , 2 huge hurricanes are making landfall today , one a category 5 has hit Miami dead center .
Casualties are relatively small , only a couple of thousand people because of the success of the evacuations , but the downtown area is as flat as Nebraska .
The second is a category 6 ( more intense hurricanes resulting from higher sea- surface temperatures have led to the creation of this new category ) packs winds of 180 mph and makes landfall where New Orleans used to be before being destroyed beyond all possibility of reconstruction by Hurricane Faisal in 2015 .
Experts say that it 's path will carry it far up the Mississippi River with minimal loss of intensity and flooding beyond anything ever witnessed in the area during historical times .
Memphis is not expected to survive .
This time by the time we get to Stage 3 , it 's going to be too late .
Do you think that might be enough to get us to stage 3 , where the problem can no longer be avoided ?
I think so .
The problem is that by this point there is n't a lot that we can do to undo what has already happened .
We will have now passed so many tipping points and set off so many feedbacks that the system is now effectively beyond our control .
If we adopt crash programs , far more draconian and far more expensive than they would have been in 2008 , we may be able slow down the melting of the ice and the concomitant sea level rise , but then again we may not .
It may be that the best we can do is adapt , withdrawing from areas too harsh for human civilization , losing most of our ties to other cultures , as each of the earth 's peoples struggles to survive on its own or in loose and rapidly shifting alliances .
It will be a miserable , stunted existence , a new Dark Age , likely to last much longer than the first one .
I do n't think there will be too much hesitancy to assign responsibility in this Terrible New World .
Quite the contrary , I should imagine .
People will be quick to point their fingers at us , and ask in outrage " What were you thinking ? "
Most of us will , I suspect , have no answer to make .
As to bipartisanship , that will be the ultimate understatement .
In this future world those who do not hang together will hang separately , and perhaps literally .

Video : Georgian TV reporter shot by Russian sniper during live broadcast carries on with her report with bleeding arm
This is the dramatic moment a TV reporter was shot by a sniper as she reported live from war - torn Georgia .
Tamara Urushadze took a bullet to her left arm in the flashpoint town of Gori as Russian forces continued their illegal occupation .
Bravely , or foolishly , the 32 - year - old brunette continued her report after a few moments as other journalists and aid workers dashed for cover .
Siege - town Gori has become a deadly ' sniper 's alley ' with citizens at the mercy of rampaging militiamen - believed to be from the breakaway republic South Ossetia - looting and firing guns , some drunkenly .
On Sunday video footage caught reporters from two Turkish stations ducking and saying their last prayers as they were fired upon by Russian snipers .
One of the journalists was hit in the eye but his injuries are reportedly not thought to be life - threatening .
' Friends , I got hit on the head , ' the journalist , Levent Ozturk shouts in the video .
' I am OK now , but in a few minutes ... .'
The four journalists begin reciting a Muslim last prayer .
Then they wave through the shattered sunroof of their truck and shout ' Press ! Press ! ' in English .
All the journalists , from Turkish networks NTV and Kanal Turk , were safely back in Turkey by yesterday .
The Kremlin stands accused of turning a blind eye to renegades bent on ' ethnic cleansing ' in revenge for Georgia 's ill - conceived invasion of South Ossetia last Friday .
But in turn Moscow blames the Georgians for abandoning their own people .
Miss Urushadze , who reports for Georgia 's equivalent of the BBC , was talking live to a TV camera about humanitarian aid arriving in Gori yesterday afternoon when the sniper struck .
In the footage , she gasps as the first bullet grazes her left arm , and instinctively jumps sideways as four more whizz past .
In shock , she slumps to the ground as the cameraman rushes to her side .
A still of Tamara Urushadze reporting live on Georgian TV shortly before she was shot by a sniper in Gori
A studio presenter 's voice is heard saying : ' You can see that something has happened during live coverage .
Unfortunately we do n't know what .'
Then Miss Urushadze is on air again , sitting in a van a few yards away and showing the camera her grazed arm .
She tells viewers : ' I have been hit by a bullet .
You can see I am scratched here .
Most likely it was a sniper .
' It has most likely been a light weapon as it's a minor wound .
There is no one to be seen here and I have no idea who shot me . '
She was later taken to hospital .
Meanwhile , Russia taunted the United States by blowing up its ally 's military bases and boasting Georgia will never get back the rebel enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
The Kremlin 's troops sabotaged airfields and depots in Georgia to cripple the battered state 's U.S. - trained military .
The Turkish journalists are attacked .
Bulletholes can clearly be seen in the windowscreens before they are detained by the Russian army
And the former Red Army humiliated their beaten foes by one minute withdrawing from Georgian territory and then re-entering it , just to prove that they still could .
At least five explosions rocked Gori as Russian troops went about disabling Georgia 's ability to fight a future conflict .
Again it was the innocents who suffered most as the few remaining citizens in the abandoned city were targeted .
A steady , dejected trickle of Georgian refugees fled the front line in overloaded cars , trucks and tractor - pulled wagons , heading to the capital Tbilisi .
One Soviet - era car carried eight people , including a mother and a baby in the front seat .
The open back door of a small blue van revealed at least a dozen people crowded inside .
There was also a tense stand - off between frustrated Georgian special forces , desperate to hit back , and battle - hardened Russian troops from Chechnya at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the city .
Around midday , Russian tanks sped towards the checkpoint and Georgian police quickly retreated behind their own forces .
Outside the town , hundreds of Georgian tanks , artillery and armoured personnel carriers massed on the main east - west highway .
Soldiers dozed in the sunshine by their vehicles awaiting the order to advance .
But in a throwback to darker Cold War times , Moscow seems intent on taking its time to withdraw its vastly superior forces , in a deliberate snub to President Bush 's decision to raise the stakes by ordering U.S. forces to the region .
He sent American military aircraft loaded with humanitarian aid .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice issued another urgent call on Russia to honour the ceasefire as she headed to Tbilisi to have a final version of the truce agreement signed by the Georgian president .
But even as she spoke , Russian troops were making themselves at home in the country , including the Black Sea port city of Poti which hosts an oil terminal key to supplying fuel to Western Europe .
The Russian troops in Gori told us they would stay put ' until Mr Putin says so ' , adding they were in no hurry and mockingly praising the ' beautiful scenery ' around them .
Moscow made it clear that the Black Sea state can wave goodbye to ever seeing its two breakaway provinces , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , becoming part of Georgia .
Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov rammed home the point by declaring that the world ' can forget about any talk about Georgia 's territorial integrity ' .
President Dmitry Medvedev vowed to act as ' protector ' to the two pro-Russian regions and met their leaders in the Kremlin , telling them : ' You have defended your territory .
The truth was on your side .
That is why you have been victorious .
' The people of South Ossetia suffered genocide and it will take years , maybe decades , for these wounds to be healed . '
The incendiary talk a week after the war began dashed both Georgian and Western hopes that the region could return to the status quo before the bloodshed which has left hundreds dead and thousands of refugees on both sides .
A pair of alleged scammers who made millions from unsuspecting Internet users have been outed , resulting in the disappearance of all their scam sites .
Matt and Jake Dylewski infamously ran fullreleases.com , which sold monthly subscriptions in exchange for standard search results from popular torrent sites like Mininova and The Pirate Bay .
That 's not all that " customers " of fullreleases.com were duped into , though .
In addition to search results that were otherwise freely available to anyone on the Internet , the credit cards being used for subscription payments were often subject to other , mysterious charges .
Canceling subscriptions was also near impossible , and the site generated numerous complaints across the web .
Fullreleases.com was n't the only site the Dylewski brothers supposedly ran in order to scam users out of their hard - earned cash , either .
According to fileclub.info , which currently hosts all of the information you could ever want on the Dylewskis , they also ran a handful of other sites , such as adultcreator.net , babeindexer.com , mp3reactor.org , sexler.net , and torrentlog.com .
As it turns out , these two appear to have been in the scamming business for some time , getting their start in the Dark Ages by asking users to mail them money — yes , as in snail mail — in exchange for warez .
Who would n't trust these two ?
Who would n't trust these two ?
According to fileclub.info , the Dylewskis had turned scamming and defrauding into a fulltime business after having amassed " millions of dollars " over the years and evading taxes in Canada ( where Jake resides ) , Malta ( where Matt resides ) , and Poland ( their home country ) .
In addition to their personal contact info , the site has posted the official " office " address in Malta , numerous photos of both Jake and Matt , photos and addresses of their girlfriends , and Jake 's car in Canada ( complete with license plate ) .
As a result , it seems as if the Dylewski brothers have taken off — scam sites and all .
As pointed out by TorrentFreak , all of their sites , including fullreleases.com , have been taken offline and replaced with parked pages .
As for where the brothers ( and their girlfriends ? ) have disappeared to , nobody seems to know .
But one thing 's for sure : anger enough people on the Internet and they will apparently fight back .
COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - Pioneering science fiction writer and visionary Arthur C. Clarke , best known for his work on the movie “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey ” , has died in his adopted home of Sri Lanka at the age of 90 .
He died of respiratory complications and heart failure doctors linked to the post - polio syndrome that had kept him wheelchair - bound for years .
Marking his “ 90th orbit of the sun ” in December , the prolific British - born author and theorist made three birthday wishes : For E.T. to call , for man to kick his oil habit and for peace in Sri Lanka .
Clarke was born in England on December 16 , 1917 , and served as a radar specialist in the Royal Air Force during World War Two .
He was one of the first to suggest the use of satellites orbiting the earth for communications , and in the 1940s forecast that man would reach the Moon by the year 2000 -- an idea experts at first dismissed .
When Neil Armstrong landed in 1969 , the United States said Clarke “ provided the essential intellectual drive that led us to the Moon ” .
Clarke first came to the Indian Ocean island in the 1950s for scuba , later founding a diving school , and said he became a resident after he “ fell in love with the place ” .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa paid tribute to Sri Lanka ’s most famous foreign resident and “ prophet ” .
“ We were all proud to have this celebrated author , visionary and promoter of space exploration , prophet of satellite communications , great humanist and lover of animals in our midst , ” Rajapaksa said in a statement .
Clarke wrote around 100 books and hundreds of short stories and articles , and wanted to be remembered foremost as a writer .
Trained as a scientist , he was renowned for basing his work on scientific fact and theory rather than pure fiction and for keeping humanity at the heart of his technological visions .
In 1964 , he started to work with the film maker Stanley Kubrick on the script of a groundbreaking film that was to win audiences and accolades far wider than those of most previous science fiction -- “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey ” .
Based loosely on a short story he had written in 1948 , it dealt poetically with themes of human evolution , technology and consciousness and came to be regarded by many as one of the greatest films ever made .

BIG THREE
Clarke , one of the most prolific authors of his genre , was the last surviving member of a group of science - fiction writers known as the “ Big Three ” .
The two others were the Russian - born Isaac Asimov , who died in 1992 , and Robert A. Heinlein , a Missouri native who died in 1988 .

“ The thing about Clarke is he had this footprint lasting 60 years with a constant stream of publications , ” said Russell Galen , his New York - based literary agent for more than 30 years .
“ So he has a kind of stature from his long influence that puts him in a unique , elite group . ”
Clarke finished reviewing the final manuscript of his latest novel “ The Last Theorem ” just days ago .
He had also been working on the idea of a “ space elevator ” .
“ The golden age of space is only just beginning , ” Clarke forecast .
“ Over the next 50 years , thousands of people will travel to earth orbit and then to the Moon and beyond .
Space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet . ”
Clarke ’s brother was traveling to Sri Lanka for his burial , due in Colombo ’s general cemetery later this week .
Clarke left written instructions that his funeral be private and secular .
“ Absolutely no religious rites of any kind , relating to any religious faith , should be associated with my funeral , ” he wrote .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's husband wo n't comply with a subpoena issued by state lawmakers investigating her firing of Alaska 's public safety commissioner , the McCain - Palin campaign said Thursday .
Gov. Sarah Palin has refused to cooperate with an inquiry into the firing of her public safety commissioner .
A state Senate committee is scheduled to meet Friday to take statements from the 12 people they subpoenaed last week , including Todd Palin .
But McCain - Palin spokeswoman Maria Comella said Todd Palin would not face a " fair hearing " before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The campaign has stepped up its attacks on the Legislature 's investigation of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan 's firing in the past week , saying the governor wo n't cooperate with an inquiry that it says is " tainted " by partisan politics .
In a new twist , Comella said Alaska state law bars ethics investigations of people running for elected office .
" That law was passed to insulate legislative investigations from exactly the kind of political maneuvering we are seeing in this inquiry , " she said .
One Judiciary Committee member said lawmakers would have little recourse if witnesses refused to comply with the subpoenas .
Only the full Senate , which does not reconvene until January , can vote to hold them in contempt , state Sen.
Bill Wielechowski said .
" It appears that the McCain campaign is now very heavily involved in this , and they 're attempting to stonewall the investigation , " Wielechowski , a Democrat , said just before Thursday 's announcement .
The law campaign officials cited appears to apply to candidates for state office , while Sarah Palin is seeking a federal job .
But another campaign spokesman , Taylor Griffin , said the subpoenas violate " the spirit of the law , if not the letter . "
In addition , state Attorney General Talis Colberg told lawmakers Tuesday that state employees would n't comply with subpoenas because the governor " has declined to participate " in the inquiry .
Colberg said Sarah Palin 's refusal puts them in the position " of having to choose where their loyalties lie . "
Watch how the trooper probe has become political »
The governor originally pledged to cooperate with the state Legislature 's investigation of her July dismissal of Monegan .
Since his firing , Monegan has accused Palin of trying to pressure him into firing her former brother - in - law , a state trooper who had been involved in an acrimonious divorce from the governor 's sister .
Palin has said Monegan was dismissed over budget disagreements and denies any wrongdoing .
Since becoming Sen. John McCain 's running mate , she has argued that the investigation belongs before the state Personnel Board , whose members are appointed by the governor , though its current three members were appointed by her predecessor .
The resistance was fueled by remarks made in early September by Judiciary Committee Chairman Hollis French , a Democrat .
In an interview with ABC News , French said the investigation -- which had been scheduled to wrap up at the end of October -- could present an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket .
Palin initially denied that anyone in her administration or family had pressed for action against her former brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , whom she has branded a " rogue trooper . "
But in August , just two weeks before her nomination , she acknowledged that members of her staff had contacted Monegan 's office nearly two dozen times about the trooper and suspended one aide whose February call to a state police lieutenant on the matter was tape - recorded .
And Todd Palin was a " principal critic " of Wooten and had " many contacts " with Department of Public Safety officials about his status , Stephen Branchflower , the former prosecutor hired by the state Legislature to investigate the firing , told lawmakers last week .
The controversy has led to more scrutiny of Todd Palin 's role in his wife 's administration .
Documents released during the Monegan inquiry suggest that the oil - rig worker and champion snowmobile racer , nicknamed the " first dude , " has been copied in on e-mails on numerous issues ranging from public criticism of the governor to meetings with corporate leaders .
But Palin spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Todd Palin's role in the administration " has not been inappropriate . "
" His role is that he has been in and out of meetings that were appropriate , " Stapleton said .

Blizzard Entertainment is indisputably making money hand - over - fist with its massively popular online RPG , World of Warcraft .
But surely maintaining a game with some 10 million active subscribers worldwide takes a serious bite out of profits ?
Not so , according to Blizzard on its Analyst Day conference call on Tuesday .
The game maker said it has spent only $ 200 m ( ~ £ 110.24 m ) on upkeep since the game launched in 2004 .
That $ 200 m figure apparently includes payroll for the entire staff , hardware support , and customer service .
The news comes care of gaming blog Kotaku
While Blizzard does n't say exactly how much it makes off WoW , let 's try to put that into some perspective .
Blizzard estimates the game has over 10 million subscribers worldwide .
Rates depend on the region , and things like free guest passes and discounts make things tricky .
But let 's use a conservative three quarters of that figure to play around with - 7,500,000 users paying month - to - month - and let 's say their monthly subscription rate is $ 15 ( the US rate ) .
That would mean the company is pulling in a total $ 112.5 m every month .
That 's $ 1.35 bn ( ~ £ 743.5 m ) per year in revenue from subscription fees alone .
Not bad for a four - year investment of only $ 200m .
And of course , that $ 1.35 bn number may rise to new heights with the release of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion pack in November .
Sure there 's plenty of other revenues - and expenses - that factor into the equation , but the point is that Blizzard has hatched itself a golden egg .
Or [ Azerothian Diamond ] perhaps ( no wait , those are pretty much vendor trash nowadays . )
Let 's beat this dead horse .
Consider
The9 , owner of six of China 's fastest privately - owned computers and regional publisher and server host of WoW in that country .
In August , the company said it earned $ 66.3 m in its second quarter .
About 90 per cent of those earnings were from running WoW .
Basically , you 're in the wrong racket .
Quit your day job and make the world 's most popular online game instead . ®
From the outside , the store in Bacup , Lancashire , is unremarkable .
Posters in the window announce a two - for - one offer on roast ham and baby wipes .
Photocopying is available at 7 p per sheet .
To step inside , however , is to confront a story that divides a community and reverberates around the world .
There are four checkout desks at the store .
One is regularly operated by Christine Herbert , whose teenage son was a ringleader in a brutal attack on 11 August 2007 in which a 20 - year - old local woman died and her boyfriend was so badly injured that , a year later , he has still not made a full recovery .
Christine 's queue is often the shortest .
Many shoppers refuse to be served by her .
Others , when they do , pull up their sleeves to display a black wristband as they hand over money .
The bands are embossed with the word ' Sophie . '
Sophie Lancaster and Robert Maltby , 21 , were set upon by a gang of teenagers in a nearby park .
Robert was attacked first and as Sophie went to his aid , pleading for mercy , they turned on her .
The couple were kicked , stamped on and left unconscious , covered in blood .
A recording was played in court of a 15 - year - old telling the emergency services : ' This mosher 's just been banged because he 's a mosher ... his bird's on the floor as well . '
Another witness said they ' looked like dummies ' .
When he sentenced the gang , the judge , Anthony Russell QC , said : ' This was a hate crime against completely harmless people who were targeted because their appearance was different . '
Sophie Lancaster did not die because of her race , religion or sexuality .
She died because she was a goth .
In truth , Sophie did n't like to be so easily stereotyped .
She had about 20 piercings and wore dreadlocks , often dyed red .
She was slender , barely five feet tall and a size eight .
Both she and Robert dressed in black and were fans of bands such as Korn , Slipknot and My Chemical Romance .
Their favourite film was The Crow , with its storyline similar to Sophie 's own .
While rock stars have been routinely fêted as icons after death , Sophie Lancaster may be the first fan to reach this status .
Only in the town where she was killed are there dissenting voices .
And fear .
After she died , Sophie 's MySpace site was swamped by people offering condolence and relating their own stories of being attacked for how they looked .
' I realised that prejudice and intolerance was the new racism and my hope was that what happened to Sophie would lead to a greater understanding and acceptance of all people , ' says her mother , Sylvia , 52 .
Along with family and close friends , she has set up a campaign in her daughter 's name - Stamp Out Prejudice , Hatred and Intolerance Everywhere ( S.O.P.H.I.E ) .
In life , Sophie had been camera - shy but her name was soon everywhere : in newspapers and magazines , on websites , CDs and posters .
Backstreet , the rock merchandising company , produced a range of S.O.P.H.I.E products to raise funds - T - shirts , tank tops , tote bags and hooded tops .
Some people have had the campaign logo tattooed on their body ; one woman videoed it being done and posted it on YouTube .
Others have compiled news footage of Sophie and set it to music or uploaded artwork and poems .
Dozens of groups have written songs about her .
' At first people wanted to turn her into a martyr but we did n't want that , ' says Kate Conboy - Greenwood , campaign manager .
' Martyrs choose what they do but Sophie had no choice in the horrible way she died .
She would n't have wanted to see her face on T - shirts . '
The MySpace site boasts 9,000 ' friends ' .
Concerts and festivals have been held in the UK , United States and Australia .
Branches of the campaign are being set up in Mexico and South Africa .
The main motif has been a black wristband of which 12,000 have been sold .
Wearing one in Bacup , however , has greater significance than showing empathy for a bereaved family or making a plea for tolerance .
It is also an act of defiance , even bravery .
Kate Conboy - Greenwood , whose three sons were friends of Sophie , was amazed to hear people making remarks on local radio phone - ins such as , ' This has split the town , you know . '
She says : ' So many people know [ the gang 's ] families or know of them and they 're scared .
They also do n't want bad publicity for Bacup . '
Isolated from major towns and cities , Bacup sits in a steep - sided valley .
Much of its infrastructure is derelict despite government regeneration funding .
Several shops are empty and others tatty or downmarket .
The houses along the main roads are terraced but behind them , on the hillsides , are several notorious estates .
' It 's a shit - hole , basically , ' says Paul Mannion , one of Sophie 's friends and a fellow goth ; '... one of those places that needs to be wiped off the face of the earth .
There might be some OK people but they 're not in the majority . '
On a walk through the town it is noticeable that there are few non-whites .
I mention this to a local , drinking alone in a town centre pub .
He smiles .
' They get fired - bombed out of their houses and given a whack with a baseball bat to make sure they get the message , ' he says .
The ringleaders in the park attack were Brendan Harris , 15 , and Ryan Herbert , 16 .
Harris denied murder but was found guilty and given a life sentence with an order to serve a minimum of 18 years in prison .
Herbert admitted murder and was given the mandatory life sentence with a 16 - year tariff .
Three other youths - brothers Joseph , 16 , and Danny Hulme , 15 , and Daniel Mallett , 17 - received sentences for grievous bodily harm ranging from four to nearly six years .
All five have lodged appeals against their sentences .
The five teenagers are thought to be members of a gang called the Bacup Terror Group ; its BTG ' tag ' CHANGE is often sprayed on walls .
On members ' Bebo pages ( now removed ) the background had yellow crime - scene tape and listed their interests as ' GBH ' .
Ryan Herbert had posted a video on YouTube of him rapping with three others on a track called ' Where U From ( Bacup ) ' on which he walks towards the camera brandishing a wooden stick .
Dressed in a black hooded top , he is also filmed swaggering through the town , posing at local landmarks , joining in the chorus of ' The Bacup Crew ' .
The song and video were part of a youth project and contained the line : ' Enough men die in this town / You mess with GBH , you go down . '
It was removed from the site after the murder .
Herbert , who is known as Peanut or Razzy , never knew his father .
He lived with his mother , Christine , and sister .
Christine , along with parents of the other defendants , has refused to speak to the media .
Locals say she is in denial about her son's behaviour .
The mother of Brendan Harris , Martine Harris ( also known as Martine McGuinn ) , is thought to have left the area ; the curtains of her back - to - back terraced house in Stacksteads , near Bacup , have been drawn for weeks .
The Hulme brothers lived in nearby Shawforth on a travellers ' site .
Joseph Hulme was bailed last year on a witness intimidation charge but the case was never brought to court .
Daniel Mallett was the only defendant said in court to come from a ' good home ' .
He lived with his mother , Tracy , in Bacup .
During police interviews Harris admitted starting the attack , claiming he did it because he was ' drunk and showing off ' .
Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell , Senior Investigating Officer , says Harris was laughing and joking with his mother during the first interview .
' The officer had to speak to Harris 's solicitor to make sure they knew the gravity of the situation . '
On the night of the attack Robert and Sophie had been at the house of a friend , Jonathan Smethurst .
At about 11.40 pm they set off to walk the two miles across town to a flat they had just begun renting .
They stopped at a petrol station for cigarettes and spoke to some teenagers who were intrigued by their appearance ; one girl took photographs .
Robert , an art student , has a pierced lip , backcombs his hair and routinely wears make - up .
Drifting into nearby Stubbylee Park , they began talking to a group of youths at the skate area .
At first they chatted amiably , even sharing their cigarettes .
Then the mood changed and Robert was ' volleyed ' in the head by Harris before the onslaught began .
Jonathan Smethurst was the first in their circle to know something was awry .
His phone sounded at 1.30 am .
Robert Maltby 's name came up .
Nothing could be heard , so Jonathan texted back to check his friend was OK .
The next time it rang , 40 minutes later , a young male said : ' Have you got two friends down in Bacup Park ? '
The voice added : ' There 's two moshers here and they look like they 're dead . '
The 20 - year - old raced to the park to find it swarming with police .
At 3.30 am he was taken to Rochdale Infirmary to identify Robert .
' I recognised him but they would n't let me see Sophie .
I just saw her dreadlocks and knew it was her , ' he said .
Robert recovered but now suffers health problems including a lack of co-ordination and depression .
' I just wish that Sophie had legged it and got out of there and left me to die , ' he said later .
' All I could think was , " This is n't right , why is this happening ? "
I could n't see how I had possibly offended the world , the powers , to have this happen . '
Catherine Smyth , news editor of the Rossendale Free Press , believes one of the motives was jealousy .
' I think they walked into the park and were intelligent and funny and the lads could n't stand it .
They did n't like that they were suddenly getting all the attention and wanted to do something about it . '
She was told that children as young as 11 were there at the time .
After the attack , Sylvia Lancaster released a photograph of her daughter 's battered face , taken while she was in intensive care - knowing it would draw intense media interest .
' I did n't want Sophie to be silenced .
I felt I had to do something , I had to become her voice , ' she says .
Before long , Sylvia , who had never before appeared in a newspaper , was interviewed by a host of publications , from the Daily Mail to Kerrang !
' I feel like I am living this mad life that I would n't have chosen , ' she says now .
' I hate looking at myself - I think people will be sick of hearing about me .
Sometimes it is a bit scary but I do n't think about it too much ; I just get on with it .
It 's all about the campaign and that has taken on a life of its own .
If Sophie could see what is happening she would n't believe it . '
The campaign is run from a couple of terraced houses in nearby Haslingden , the work done in downtime .
' People think we have a team of professionals , but it 's just a few of us doing what we can , ' says Kate Conboy - Greenwood .
Before offering to help , Kate had established a local branch of Amnesty .
' I have always been passionate about human rights and then this happens , right here .
And to someone I know . '
Sylvia had recognised before the attack that young people adopting an alternative lifestyle were often subject to hostility .
' I was out with Rob and Sophie at KFC in Accrington and this little lad said , " There 's some goths . "
Everyone was staring and saying , " Look at the state of them . "
I found it offensive and was stewing on it . '
Sylvia , who works with young people advising them how to prepare for employment , planned to ask Sophie whether she and her friends would visit youth clubs .
' I thought she'd be able to show them that she was just a normal girl and there was nothing intimidating about her . '
In truth , Sophie was far from a normal girl .
At the age of six she announced that she was to become a vegetarian , which she remained all her life .
Three years later she was sermonising to the family on the scourge of world poverty .
Sylvia , at this time , had started a sociology degree as a mature student after working in the mills and shoe factories dotted through the Rossendale valley .
She remembers college friends visiting and discussing the course and Sophie ' taking it all in ' .
Sophie was a voracious reader , sometimes finishing a book in a day .
Through her friendship with a schoolmate whose family , according to Sylvia , was ' gothy ' , Sophie , in her young teens , began to change her appearance .
' She developed her own style , ' says Sylvia .
' She wore a full - length black leather coat and dyed her hair black .
It was just what she was .
She 'd always been different , a bit of an outsider .
I thought she looked lovely . '
At Haslingden High School , she was outstanding in English , coming second in her academic year in the exams .
' I did n't know how good she was until I read something she 'd written in a school magazine .
I thought : " Bloody hell , Sophie ! "
The use of language was brilliant and quite powerful .
It really rocked me to realise she was so talented , ' says Sylvia .
Until moving in with Robert , Sophie lived at home in Haslingden with Sylvia , her father John and brother Adam , 23 .
Her parents separated two years ago .
John and Adam are involved in the campaign in background roles ; friends say family members are dealing with the bereavement in different ways .
John has had an image of Sophie tattooed on his chest .
' I wanted to have a permanent picture of Sophie put there , ' he says .
' It will help me to remember her lovely smile . '
Sophie and Robert had been together for almost three years .
She had three A - levels and was on a gap - year , planning to study English at college .
Robert was working for the summer at a local kitchen and bedroom - manufacturing firm .
Paul Mannion believes the goth sub-culture matched their personalities .
' It 's about having an open mind and not denigrating anyone because of how they look or if they 're gay or whatever they might be .
It is how you perceive life and other people . '
He has been subject to violence himself .
On a night out he was threatened with a meat cleaver and robbed of his wallet ; his friends have been spat at and punched .
Kate Conboy - Greenwood says that about 70 per cent of people contacting her have been attacked .
Mannion is hopeful the streets will now become safer : ' It 's taken the death of this innocent girl for people to realise what 's happening .
If it makes the police change their attitude , and I think it will , that 's a good thing .
They have to see us as people with the same rights as everyone else . '
Talk to people in Bacup - all of whom refuse to give their name for fear of reprisal - and it soon emerges that , similar to many places in the UK , it is home to a clan of about a dozen families some of whom have been involved in crime for many years , sometimes across three generations .
At the murder trial , the judge awarded £ 250 each to the four young witnesses who gave evidence .
There have been a series of serious gang assaults in the town since Sophie died .
The Sophie campaign this week outlined its three main aims : to provide a forum for discussion ; to work with youths to raise awareness of subcultures and an acceptance of people 's right to be different ; and to help professionals in the field .
Meanwhile , Sylvia Lancaster is rebuilding a life without Sophie .
' It feels strange at times .
When people are saying " we " this and " we " that I 've sometimes had to say , " Hold on here , this is about my Sophie . "
I 've found it hard to do normal things like taxing the car and carrying on at work .
It gives you an odd feeling to think how it has touched so many people .
If we can save just one kid from being set upon merely because they look different , it will have been worth our while , ' she says .
Sophie has been buried in the nearby town of Whitworth , where she used to walk and liked the countryside .
The grave has become a place of pilgrimage .
A recent visitor left a clutch of half - empty beer bottles and half - smoked cigarettes .
' It did n't dawn on me at first , ' said Sylvia .
' Then I realised that whoever had been there had left the rest for Sophie . '
Sometime over the next few weeks a gravestone will be installed - a year since Sophie died .
Within the family there has been discussion about the wording to put on it , how best to sum up Sophie .
They 've decided , finally , on a line from a song by one of her favourite groups , Rasputina :
' I 'm smarter , daintier and better dressed . '

In an interview here after Sunday ’s broadcast , Mr. Brokaw said that over the summer he had “ advocated ” within the executive suite of NBC News to modify the anchor duties of the MSNBC hosts Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews on election night and on nights when there were presidential debates .
Their expressions of strong political opinions from the MSNBC anchor desk has run counter to the more traditional role Mr. Brokaw played on “ NBC Nightly News ” for more than two decades .
NBC said earlier this month that the two hosts would mostly relinquish their anchor duties to Mr. Gregory , while being present as analysts .
“ Keith is an articulate guy who writes well and does n’t make his arguments in a ‘ So ’s your old mother ’ kind of way , ” Mr. Brokaw said .
“ The mistake was to think he could fill both roles .
The other mistake was to think he would n’t be tempted to use the anchor position to engage in commentary .
That ’s who he is . ”
Mr. Brokaw said he had also conducted some shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks between NBC and the McCain campaign .
His mission , he said , was to assure the candidate ’s aides that  despite some negative on - air commentary by Mr. Olbermann in particular 
Mr. McCain could still get a fair shake from NBC News .
Mr. Brokaw said he had been told by a senior McCain aide , whom he did not name , that the campaign had been reluctant to accept an NBC representative as one of the moderators of the three presidential debates  until his name was invoked .
“ One of the things I was told by this person was that they were so irritated , they said , ‘ If it ’s an NBC moderator , for any of these debates , we wo n’t go , ’ ” Mr. Brokaw said .
“ My name came up , and they said , ‘ Oh , hell , we have to do it , because it ’s going to be Brokaw . ’ ”
Mr. Brokaw will moderate the second debate , on Oct. 7 , in Nashville .
Last week during the Clinton Global Initiative in New York , Mr. Brokaw said , he spoke briefly with Mr. McCain , who has not appeared on “ Meet the Press ” since Mr. Russert ’s death .
While Mr. Brokaw said he and the Republican nominee are not personal friends , he did say they are “ friendly ” and “ always had a great relationship . ”

Time magazine recently took a break from advocating the nationalization of health care , a massive enlargement of the welfare state , and swooning over Barack Obama ( who ’s been on the cover seven times to date this year ) to compile a list of America ’s worst vice presidents .
It ’s mostly politically - correct baloney with just enough facts to make it appear legitimate to the uneducated reader .
One entry in particular — the one for John C. Calhoun as the third - worst vice president ( Aaron Burr was the worst , followed by Elbridge Gerry ) — caught my eye because almost every single sentence in it is untrue .
The Calhoun entry was written by one Tiffany Sharples .
I wondered what kind of background Tiffany has that would have led a Time editor to give her the assignment of educating Americans on their vice presidential history .
A Google search revealed that she ’s a " political and health " reporter for the Medill News Service out of Chicago .
There ’s a listing of many of her articles on the Web , the most interesting of which ( to me , anyway ) is " Drink Pink !
Forget Cosmos and Appletinis , Watermelon is This Season ’s Hot Cocktail of Choice . "
The first falsehood in Tiffany ’s Calhoun entry is her statement that President John Quincy Adams , under whom Calhoun served as vice president , was " a Northern abolitionist . "
Not true .
All of John Quincy Adams ’s biographers write that he was never an abolitionist per se , even though he made anti-slavery statements .
Anti-slavery rhetoric alone did not make one an abolitionist in the nineteenth century .
Robert E. Lee called slavery " a moral and political evil , " but no Time magazine writer would conclude that he was therefore a closet abolitionist .
Adams himself explained why he was not an abolitionist :
He felt " bonded " by the Constitution , and its implicit protection of slavery .
( Yes , that ’s right , slavery existed and was protected by the U.S. flag more than twenty times longer ( about 90 years ) than it was by the Confederate flag ) .
As a diplomat John Quincy Adams supported slave - owners who sought to capture their runaway slaves in foreign countries .
He also opposed allowing the British Navy to board American ships suspected of violating the prohibition of the international slave trade ( the law of the land in the U.S. as of 1808 ) .
An even bigger falsehood in Time ’s entry for John C. Calhoun is one in which he is denounced for being an " arch Nullifier . "
Tiffany and her Time editors claim that the principle of nullification was " rejected by Northerners and Southerners alike . "
First of all , the principle of nullification is associated with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and the Virginia and Kentucky Resolves of 1798 , which were designed to allow states to refuse to assist in the enforcement of the totalitarian Sedition Act , which made criticism of the government illegal .
At the time the Act was being enforced by John Quincy Adams ’s father , President John Adams .
Calhoun did not invent the idea of nullification in order to defend slavery , as Time ( and the entire Lincoln Cult , for that matter ) falsely contends .
As Jefferson wrote on November 10 , 1798 : " Resolved , that the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government ; but that by compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States and of amendments thereto , they constituted a General Government for special purposes , delegated to that Government certain definite powers , reserving each State to itself , the residuary mass of right to their own self Government ; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force . . . " ( See William J. Watkins , Reclaiming the American Revolution : The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and Their Legacy ) .
When Calhoun advanced this principle to assist South Carolinians in nullifying the 1828 " Tariff of Abominations " he was merely carrying on the Jeffersonian tradition .
And of course the nullification of the tariff had nothing whatsoever to do with slavery .
It was an effort to defend against an early scheme by Northern Yankees to use the powers of the state to financially plunder their fellow citizens in the Southern states .
Moreover , there was no federal law during Calhoun ’s time ( he died in 1850 ) that was threatening slavery , and was therefore in need of nullifying by slave - owners .
The silly , comic book implication of this claim is that heroic champions of morality and racial equality in the Northern states ( where slavery existed in some places until the late 1850s ) were threatening to end Southern slavery by legislation .
This never happened , despite the fact that this lie has been repeated by Lincoln cultists like Harry Jaffa for decades .
Indeed , as I write in my book , Lincoln Unmasked , the famous Massachusetts abolitionist Lysander Spooner excoriated the Lincoln administration , especially Secretary of State William Seward , for failing to seek legal and constitutional means to end slavery , as all the other nations of the earth where slavery existed had done during the nineteenth century .
( Spooner had written a roadmap for the peaceful abolition of slavery in his book , The Unconstitutionality of Slavery ) .
It is also untrue that nullification was rejected by Northerners and Southerners alike , as Time claims .
Up until 1861 many Northern states utilized this important principle as a means of restraining the tyrannical impulses of the central state .
In the 1830s , for instance , the Ohio legislature assisted President Andrew Jackson in opposing the first central Bank , the Bank of the United States , by imposing enormous taxes on the branches of the Bank ( $ 50,000 per year on each branch ) that had opened up in the state , and issuing a resolution that " the States have an equal right to interpret the Constitution for themselves , " and declared the Bank to be unconstitutional .
Connecticut , New York and New Hampshire did the same thing , literally quoting Jefferson ’s Kentucky Resolve of 1798 .
Some Northern states also nullified the federal Fugitive Slave Act which forced Northerners to hunt down runaway slaves and return them to their owners .
The statements that Time magazine makes about nullification in particular , and about John C. Calhoun in general , are pure hokum .

Enlarge By H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY Maryland State Police Cpl. Christopher Corea pulls an e-citation for speeding out of a printer in his patrol car .
Police agencies and troopers in several states are tossing out handwritten tickets in favor of electronic citations as a way to improve accuracy and save time .
With the quick swipe or scan of a driver 's license , officers are able to enter the location , type of violation and print the ticket all from a handheld device , said Chief Deputy Derrick Cunningham of the Montgomery County ( Ala . )
Sheriff 's Office .
The sheriff 's office has ordered 25 of the e-citation systems to be in place by mid-July , and is already looking at expanding the system to all 40 of its cruisers , Cunningham said .
" What we 're trying to do is go paperless as much as possible , " he said .
To cover the cost of the e-citation devices , the sheriff 's office received a $ 27,000 state grant for the first 25 machines and another grant for an additional 15 , Cunningham said .
All of Alabama 's 350 state troopers are equipped with the e-citation machines , which save time for the officers , Sgt. Tracy Nelson said .
In addition to saving time , Cunningham suspects the e-citations will cut down on two complaints his office often receives : poor handwriting and ticket fixing .
" No more can people call and say , ' I just got a speeding ticket , can you do something about it ? ' " he said , because the ticket is electronically transferred directly to court .
Elsewhere : • In California , the San Jose Police Department has 222 e-citation devices .
The program began in 2007 and the department wants to add 500 to 600 more units to equip its entire fleet , Lt. Ruben Chavez said .
Chavez said the system improves the efficiency of the ticketing process by reducing officer errors .
" Some of the officers write like they should have gone to medical school and they 'll leave boxes empty , " he said .
" Typed in — it 's a lot easier to read . "
• In Maryland , 75 state police cruisers are using e-citation software , called e-tix , that the agency created from scratch , said Sgt. Doug Baralo .
The state police are partnering with local agencies to provide the software free - of - charge , he said .
By next year , 1,500 officers throughout Maryland , including state and local police , could have the software installed .
The cost for hardware runs about $ 1,000 per cruiser , all of which is covered through grants from numerous agencies , Baralo said .
Time spent on a routine traffic stop goes from eight to three minutes using e-citations and allows officers to quickly identify stolen vehicles or wanted persons by scanning driver 's licenses to match up information in the database , Baralo said .
• In Florida , the Miami - Dade County Police have 35 of the devices and hope to eventually install 3,500 in all of their police cruisers , Lt. Tony Perez said .
The equipment , which includes a handheld unit , printer and software , costs about $ 4,500 per officer , but the department has n't secured grants for the devices , Perez said .
The machines reduce normal ticket writing time from 10 minutes to just two , Perez said .
• In Oklahoma City , 750 police vehicles will have electronic ticketing capabilites in the next year , said Kerry Wagnon , public safety program manager .
The e-citation function is part of a larger project aimed at putting more tools in the hands of the officers , Wagnon said .
" You 're able to speed up the process of getting information both from the field and to the field , " he said .
" For the police officers , information is critical . "

Rubyology : Great Interviews with Great Ruby Developers
By Peter Cooper
Rubyology is a Ruby - based podcast chaired by Chris Matthieu .
Its focus is on interviewing interesting Ruby ( and Rails ) developers - finding out about their projects , what makes them tick , and extracting their insights into the Ruby and Rails worlds .
For some reason , Rubyology has n't had a lot of love in the Ruby blogosphere , and after listening to several great interviews over the past few months , I 've decided this is a great time to recommend you check it out if you 're not already a subscriber .
Recent highlights include :
Of course , do n't forget about Geoffrey Grosenbach 's Rails Podcast either - it 's not all Rails focused these days .
The latest episode is an interview with Jim Weirich .
The Dojo Toolkit is a modular open source JavaScript library , designed to ease the rapid development of JavaScript or Ajax - based applications and web sites .
InfoQ had a Q&A with Dylan Schiemann , CEO of SitePen and co-creator of the Dojo Toolkit , about AJAX , Comet , Bayeux , RIAs and the newly released Dojo Toolbox .
InfoQ : Dylan , could you give us a small overview of how you started developing Dojo , what was your initial vision and what has Dojo grown to become ?
In early 2004 , Alex Russell began looking to hire a collaborator on DHTML ( now known as Ajax ) projects at Informatica and I became that collaborator .
During our work on these projects , many members of the community were contacted with the goal of creating a toolkit that could be used freely across companies , without reinventing the wheel for every new effort .
It was apparent that toolkits built to support Netscape 4 had too many inherent inefficiencies , so we decided to take the best ideas from a number of early projects ( netWindows , BurstLib , f( m ) , etc. ) and create a new toolkit that would make life easier when using JavaScript .
While we saw the value in what we were doing , we had no idea of the reach or impact would have on the development community .
InfoQ : Could you give us an architectural overview of the toolkit ?
What do we get by downloading Dojo version 1.1.1 ?
Dojo is structured in 4 main projects : Dojo Core , Dijit , DojoX , and Dojo Utilities .
Simply including the standard dojo.js gives you : A very fast , lean ( 26 KB gzipped ) core packed full of APIs for XHR , events , DOM , query , animations , namespacing , and other highly used convenience functions .
Optional modules for dates , colors , back button / history , currency , and more In Dojo 1.2 , we ’ve actually provided an optional facility to get your base build down to 6KB and build up from there .
The Dojo core also includes additional code that may be optionally included such as a behavior system , common regular expressions , date and currency APIs , and more .
Dijit is both a widget system and a collection of common widgets , meaning that you get a nice set of widgets to use by default , and a powerful system for creating your own .
All widgets in Dijit are fully accessible , internationalizable , and can be instantiated either through markup in an unobtrusive manner , or through a simple JavaScript instantiation .
Dijit includes common form element upgrades , a calendar , editor , tree , sliders , and more .
Everything in Dojo and Dijit are deemed production - ready and API compatibility will be one of our higher priorities as we work towards Dojo 2.0 .
DojoX , or Dojo extensions , contain features that are less widely , complex , or not yet production quality .
Examples include encryption , additional Dojo data stores , dojo.gfx for native vector graphics support , charting , offline , grids and other widgets , and much more .
Features in DojoX are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible across 1.x releases .
DojoX contains a significant code base with great new additions arriving on a regular basis , most recently an XMPP client , JSON - Schema , JSON - Referencing , and a secure Ajax module , all of which will ship with Dojo 1.2 and are available in the current nightly builds .
Dojo Utilities offers , as its name suggests , a number of useful utilities for JavaScript developers , including A highly - flexible build system for combining JavaScript files , satisfying dependencies , and merging HTML and CSS files , based on a slightly customized version of Rhino
ShrinkSafe , a compression tool that removes comments , extraneous whitespace , and more , which also makes use of Rhino
DocTool , a highly advanced system for generating API documentation from source code , that also can resolve complex mixin inheritance structures and more
DOH , the Dojo Objective Harness , a unit test tool that works both in the browser and on the command - line Dojo is organized in a very modular manner , making it easy to just get the features you need so you do n’t expend system resources for everything else in Dojo .
Dojo is also an open - source foundation , and is home to other projects including Cometd , DWR , Open Record , and the Psych Desktop .
InfoQ : Dojo seems to have had a lot of momentum this year , especially with the release of three new books by O’Reilly , Pragmatic Programmers and Addison Wesley , this summer .
Why do you think that is ?
First , I think the books were possible because we released a stable version 1.0 , and we were able to find some great authors interested in writing about Dojo .
Feature - wise , companies such as IBM , Google , Sun , Blue Coat Systems , Nexaweb , and many others , along with our great individual contributor base , made significant and focused efforts towards creating a toolkit that is fast , powerful , and feature - rich .
I think the best answer to the question is that we just have a great community that works hard and our hard work is starting to pay off after spending several months in 2007 on completely rewriting Dojo to be a faster leaner toolkit .
A lot of this also comes from how we have grown our community .
Being very open and transparent , using favorable licensing ( BSD or AFL ) , and also using a CLA process for making sure there are no intellectual property issues with using source code .
Dojo scores , by Dion Almaer ’s standards , a perfect 100 points on the how open is your project scale .
InfoQ : A few days ago SitePen released Dojo Toolbox , an AIR application for Dojo developers .
Would you like to talk to us about that ?
Adobe , in an interesting move , released a platform that is WebKit - based , supports both Open Web technologies ( HTML , JavaScript , CSS , Canvas , SVG , etc. ) and its proprietary Flash / Flex stack .
This gives developers some of the benefits of desktop applications including local file system access , better caching , and a single - deployment environment .
They ’ve achieved a great way for web developers to create installable web apps .
Adobe approached SitePen first about refining Dojo ’s support for AIR prior to the release of AIR , and then with the proposal to co-sponsor development of an application , which led to Dojo Toolbox .
Dojo has such a large feature - set that creating a printable PDF of the API documentation or an easy - to - view structure is always a challenge , so we decided to bring the 18 MB of Dojo documentation offline .
We also knew that providing an easy way to create optimized versions of a Dojo build would be handy and AIR was a great solution .
All of this was done under the BSD license .
In the few short weeks this has been released , we ’ve received a number of great feature requests and plan to increase the app ’s functionality as a result .
We ’ve also created something that is modular enough that people can create their own customized toolbox builds or contribute their own modules back to the toolbox for consideration in the official release .
InfoQ : Another popular way in the Java world for developing web application besides pure JavaScript libraries like Dojo , is GWT .
The way it works is fundamentally different since it acts as a code generator that tries to keep developers away from checking all the different browser quirks .
How do you think these two measure up ?
I think too often there ’s a tendency to say that you have to choose X over Y , rather than giving developers the flexibility to choose combinations of what they like or what works best .
We like giving people choices , and in fact , people are currently working on a project to bring Dojo to GWT .
There ’s a talk Alex Russell gave at this year ’s Google I/O event titled “ Can We Get There From Here ” .
One of his points was while GWT is open , the more it does , the harder it is to deconstruct .
On the complexity scale , with HTML / CSS being the most transparent , Dojo is a little more complex than plain HTML or simple JavaScript with features such as namespaces , while Silverlight , GWT , and Flex are much more difficult to decompile .
With Dojo , we ’ve made an explicit decision that a compile step is purely optional .
GWT does have a reload button , but that requires using an IDE .
Their code optimizer gives it an additional performance boost that we hope to replicate with our JS Linker utility , but we decided that source code would remain extremely easy to comprehend for JavaScript developers .
I urge people to experiment and determine the most productive choice for them , taking into account factors that matter to their business .
InfoQ :
There are several other JavaScript frameworks / toolkits out there that have had varying degree of success and adoption in the enterprise .
What do you think differentiates Dojo from the rest ?
Dojo receives wide , practical , “ we need this feature now ” improvement from the likes of IBM , Sun , AOL , and many other companies including the clients of SitePen .
Our open licensing , attention to the details important to enterprise , from IP issues to accessibility and internationalization support , makes us a great open source solution for companies looking to optimize their development power .
Financial institutions , militaries , governments , and many other large organizations use Dojo throughout their web development models .
Much of this work is Ajax “ Dark Matter ” , used behind the firewall .
InfoQ :
This year the organization responsible for the new ECMAScript , version 4 ( AKA JavaScript 2 ) published a revised version of the language overview , that spawned much controversy and debate .
How do you feel about the proposed changes to the language and their effects to JavaScript frameworks like Dojo ?
Kris Zyp of SitePen currently participates in the ECMAScript working group .
To date , it has had little impact on the Dojo Toolkit itself because we ’re pragmatic and wait until something is ready before we use it .
In general , we ’ve tried to be a voice of reason that is impartial to politics and focus on what JavaScript developers need most from a language .
We ’re pushing for features that we believe matter and recommending against changes that we think make development more difficult .
InfoQ :
When creating web UIs that heavily utilize JavaScript , there are many pitfalls that are not always apparent to the more inexperienced .
Usability , search engines , “ back button ” behavior , browser performance etc .
Which are the most common mistakes you see Dojo developers doing ?
A single browser page , or any web or software application for that matter , has access to a finite amount of system resources .
In addition to the issues you ’ve mentioned , a common trap is for new developers to not understand the implications of their work , e.g. implementing 100 dynamic charts in a page with a sub- second XHR polling implementation .
With Dojo 1.0 and beyond , we ’ve tried to be less “ magical ” so developers can better understand that each and every feature comes at some price , that the fastest toolkit is 0KB , and that most things that are difficult require challenging decisions and trade - offs .
Another common mistake developers make is assuming that browsers are consistent and rational .
Long - held opinions on the best way to do something are often incorrect and surprising .
Simply “ looking at the data ” with tools like Firebug reveal performance bottlenecks and tell us more about the true performance behavior of browsers ..
InfoQ :
It has been suggested that the creation of elaborate JavaScript frameworks is a sign that the traditional " Web Platform " has reached its maximum potential and should be replace by something more modern .
What do you think about that ?
I think this is simply a case of the rapid rate of invention over the past four years drastically outpacing the capacity of browser vendors to create better deployment environments .
Browser vendors are often slammed for trying a non-standards - based approach , which is unfair because something can’t become a standard if there ’s no room for experimentation and innovation .
Flex and Silverlight have done a decent job with providing a good development experience , but do n’t count out the Open Web yet .
We believe that an evolutionary approach to constantly improving what we have today is a viable option .
Take WebKit for example , and its success as a great environment for apps in the browser , inside Adobe AIR , on many mobile devices obviously including the iPhone , or Opera on the desktop , mobile devices , and the Nintendo Wii. JavaScript toolkits have done a great job of updating the web faster than browser vendors can , as have things like Google Gears .
As browser vendors add new features and new capabilities , toolkits like Dojo defer to the native implementation , and then look for the next thing that needs to be improved across the web .
InfoQ : How do you think pure - JavaScript frameworks measure up against plugin - based RIA solutions like Flex , OpenLaszlo or Curl ?
I think they hold up quite well .
OpenLaszlo is in many ways more about being a compiler like GWT that can deploy to Flash or the Open Web .
What ’s interesting is that we ’ve started to take things in another direction .
For native vector graphics , dojox.gfx has supported SVG , Canvas , and VML for a while .
Recently , we added support for Silverlight as a renderer because VML is terribly broken in the IE alpha builds , and we ’ve been experimenting with Flash and Flex for rendering vector graphics and charts as well .
We also support Flash ’s local storage facility in browsers that do n’t have native local storage .
Again , I mention that it ’s about choice and also pragmatism .
InfoQ :
It is commonly believed that there are certain things that you cannot do with JavaScript and have to turn to Flex / Flash .
Some of those things are very pervasive , like charting .
With the latest activity on charting and other areas it seems that Dojo is limiting the reasons to use other technologies .
Do you think that as JavaScript libraries become more sophisticated and the support from browsers improves , the need for page components implemented from within plugins will be minimized ?
With Dojo , we believe that anything that cannot be done natively can still be done using Dojo , if so desired .
Our native vector graphics and charting support is competitive with non-native options , but we give users choice rather than trying to lock developers into one solution over another .
The future is hard to predict , but the role of the plug - in is generally to accomplish something that cannot be accomplished using native options and JavaScript .
With native vector graphics support in all modern browsers , and dojox.gfx to hide the differences in implementations across browser , the need to use a plug - in for this feature is now just an option rather than a necessity .
This is all part of the natural evolution of the Open Web .
InfoQ :
It has been said that IE 7 was a gift to designers since it had a better support for CSS , while IE 8 will be a gift to JavaScript developers .
With all the publicity and the details that have been made available how do you feel about the upcoming version of IE ?
Is it a significant step forwards ?
How do you think it will affect JavaScript frameworks like Dojo ?
I think it is too soon to tell .
The first release felt like two steps forward ( 6 connections instead of 2 , secure cross - domain requests ) , one step back ( severe bugs with VML ) , so we ’re cautiously optimistic for the next release .
InfoQ : After 2005 when AJAX became widely known , the latest buzzword is Comet .
There are still people debating on terminology so I would like to ask you to give us your own definition .
Comet is a collection of techniques , transports , protocols , servers , and clients to deliver low - latency data transit between the server and the client .
The XHR is the least common denominator of Comet , and everything else is an attempt to improve upon the XHR to deliver faster , real - time applications .
My definition intentionally avoids some points of the debate , as I prefer to be inclusive and broad , much as Ajax has come to represent everything dynamic in a browser to most people .
InfoQ :
An important components for enabling Comet applications seems to be the Bayeux protocol which facilitates routing JSON encoded events between clients and servers in a publish subscribe model .
Would you like to elaborate on that ?
It seems that Bayeux is gaining de facto industry acceptance since it is unique , but do you feel it will be heading for a more formal standardization , e.g. through W3C ?
To date , I think the informal nature has been highly useful , though if there ’s interest , I ’m sure a standards - body will eventually pick it up .
Bayeux is the standard protocol for servers and clients that are part of the Cometd project .
XMPP is of course another popular protocol .
I ’m also quite interested in the recent draft WebSocket addition to the HTML5 efforts , and the API abstraction of this already implemented within the Orbited project .
InfoQ :
In the Java realm there are several ways to develop Comet applications at this moment .
With the emergence of the Servlets version 3 spec ( JSR 315 ) which defines a standard way of doing Comet , how do you think this genre of application will grow ?
In the Java space , a variety of open - source Comet server options such as Jetty , DWR , and Glass Fish , as well as free versions of Lightstreamer and Caplin Liberator are available .
The new servlets specification has already experimental support in Jetty and Glass Fish , and I ’m sure when the final specification is ready , everyone will make use of this .
One interesting thing to emerge is the distinction between on - board and off - board Comet by Joe Walker at JavaOne .
The language that your Comet server of choice is written in is less important than making sure you have client access ( client being a web - based client , or a web server based client communicating with your Comet server ) in your language of choice
InfoQ :
It has been suggested that since web applications target clients that understand JavaScript ( browsers ) it would make sense to have end - to - end JavaScript solution .
What do you think about that ?
Do you see server - side JavaScript becoming mainstream ?
The emergence of Jaxer ( by Aptana ) , Persevere ( SitePen ) , AxiomStack ( Axiom ) , Phobos ( Sun ) , and others have shown that is becoming common .
JavaScript is now the world ’s most ubiquitous programming language , available just about everywhere .
I think that for anyone that started out on the client - side , it ’s a great way to get into the server - side without learning the syntax of PHP , Python , Java , or other languages ( though most users of Dojo currently come to Dojo in the more traditional direction ) .
I do n’t know what the future holds , but I think it ’s a great opportunity to use the same JavaScript code base everywhere .
InfoQ : Although you can often find developers handling large Java code bases , it is not the same with JavaScript .
Its dynamic nature and the fact that frameworks like Dojo target a varying set of clients ( browsers ) must impose unique restrictions and difficulties in the development process .
Besides using Trac for issue tracking what are the tools and procedures that you have found particularly effective for this specific genre of software ?
I think you ’d be surprised at the size of some JavaScript code bases !
At SitePen , we recently switched from Trac to Redmine as it has kept the simplicity of Trac while adding the features we ’ve missed for a long time ( dependencies , projections , multiple projects ) .
We still use Subversion as it has great support across a variety of tools .
At SitePen , we use pretty much every text editor or IDE there is depending on which developer you ask .
We use the Dojo DocTool and the utilities found in Dojo .
Some of the less common development tools we use include : Windmill , Tito Web Studio , Charles , and Versions .
I ca n’t say we have a standard across the board , here ’s the best way to maintain and refactor a large codebase tool like you would have for Java , but I ’m not sure the need is as great either .
InfoQ : People have speculated that when Steve Yegge talks about what will be the next big language ( if any ) he refers to JavaScript .
The fact that he has ported a significant part of the Rails framework from Ruby to JavaScript makes this speculation more solid .
Having worked with this language do you see this kind of potential ?
Absolutely and I think this ties back to the question about JavaScript on the server .
Persevere is another example of this type of approach .
In short , Persevere is an open source set of tools for persistence and distributed computing using intuitive standards - based JSON interfaces of HTTP REST , JSON - RPC , JSONQuery , and HTTP Channels .
InfoQ : How do you see Dojo evolving ?
What are your next steps and what can we expect in the following months ?
In the short term , we ’ll continue to improve performance , widgets such as the grid , charting , tree and editor , the overall look and feel of Dijit , form and data validation , the stability of our Comet client , our validation system , and much more .
We ’re also starting to look towards Dojo 2.0 , probably in 2010 .
It ’s really about keeping Dojo useful , promising and efficient for developers who are interested in coding impressive web apps and providing excellent experiences for their users .

― It has been a long time coming , but finally English - speaking anime fans are getting the chance to legally watch the unadulterated versions of some of the titles in the sprawling Pretty Cure franchise ....
" This web design company should try and be a little more careful with their screenshots , " writes Jeremy , " especially when advertising such quality icons like their Divine Mother icon . "
" I was heading home from a friend 's house , " Travis wrote , " and saw I this marquee .
Glad I had the A/C on . "
Sean J.A. was n't quite sure why they were congratulating him ...
Edward Emanuel wrote , " I came across this helpful description while checking a running processes on my computer . "
" Phew ! " John wrote , " I was worried there for a minute . "
" I got this while working in Microsoft Expression Web , " Stephen noted , " since I have a new baby daughter in the house , it is a little disconcerting . "
And there ’s a serious argument here .
In the current Weekly Standard , Steven Hayward argues that the nation ’s founders wanted uncertified citizens to hold the highest offices in the land .
They did not believe in a separate class of professional executives .
They wanted rough and rooted people like Palin .
I would have more sympathy for this view if I had n’t just lived through the last eight years .
For if the Bush administration was anything , it was the anti-establishment attitude put into executive practice .
And the problem with this attitude is that , especially in his first term , it made Bush inept at governance .
It turns out that governance , the creation and execution of policy , is hard .
It requires acquired skills .
Most of all , it requires prudence .
What is prudence ?
It is the ability to grasp the unique pattern of a specific situation .
It is the ability to absorb the vast flow of information and still discern the essential current of events  the things that go together and the things that will never go together .
It is the ability to engage in complex deliberations and feel which arguments have the most weight .
How is prudence acquired ?
Through experience .
The prudent leader possesses a repertoire of events , through personal involvement or the study of history , and can apply those models to current circumstances to judge what is important and what is not , who can be persuaded and who can ’t , what has worked and what has n’t .
Experienced leaders can certainly blunder if their minds have rigidified ( see : Rumsfeld , Donald ) , but the records of leaders without long experience and prudence is not good .
As George Will pointed out , the founders used the word “ experience ” 91 times in the Federalist Papers .
Democracy is not average people selecting average leaders .
It is average people with the wisdom to select the best prepared .
Sarah Palin has many virtues .
If you wanted someone to destroy a corrupt establishment , she ’d be your woman .
But the constructive act of governance is another matter .
She has not been engaged in national issues , does not have a repertoire of historic patterns and , like President Bush , she seems to compensate for her lack of experience with brashness and excessive decisiveness .
The idea that “ the people ” will take on and destroy “ the establishment ” is a utopian fantasy that corrupted the left before it corrupted the right .
Surely the response to the current crisis of authority is not to throw away standards of experience and prudence , but to select leaders who have those qualities but not the smug condescension that has so marked the reaction to the Palin nomination in the first place .
Google HQ ( TGW ) – Google has filed a patent for a system of floating data centers powered by the waves beneath it .
All though the patent was filed over a year ago , the patent was only recently found .
According to the patent , Google wanted to move data centers closer to users , but power generation would be too expensive to make that feasible .
To solve that problem , Google came up with this idea : floating data centers holding standard shipping containers housing computers powered by wave - power generators and wind turbines .
Google engineers calculated generators spread over about half of a square mile could produce 30 megawatts of electricity , enough to operate a single system .
A crew and operating staff would live aboard in living quarters , with a helipad for transportation .

Private contractors account for more than one - quarter of the core workforce at U.S. intelligence agencies , according to newly released government figures that underscore how much of the nation ’s spying work has been outsourced since the Sept. 11 attacks .
The CIA and other spy agencies employ about 36,000 contractors in espionage - related jobs , in addition to approximately 100,000 full - time government workers , said Ronald Sanders , head of personnel for the U.S. intelligence community .
Contractors carry out missions including collecting intelligence in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as operating classified computer networks for the 16 spy agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community .
Sanders said the number of contractors remained steady over the last year , after surging in the years following the Sept. 11 attacks .

“ As you may know , we ’ve been hiring a great deal since Sept. 11 , 2001 , ” Sanders said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday , discussing the results of a survey .
The growing reliance on contractors has been a source of controversy for the spy agencies , in part because of concerns that temporary employees might not be as trustworthy as career workers in handling some of the most sensitive national security work .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) has criticized the CIA for using contractors in interrogations of terrorism suspects , and many lawmakers favor barring the agency from doing so .
The total budget for the nation ’s spy agencies is roughly $ 43 billion .
The use of contractors has been criticized for driving up costs , with senior U.S. intelligence officials acknowledging that talented employees have been lured away to take higher - paying positions with private companies .
Advertisement
Sanders said the spy agencies spend about $ 125,000 a year for a government employee , compared with about $ 207,000 for a contract worker .
The numbers reflect salaries , retirement benefits and other costs .
But officials have said that contractors also help agencies control costs by enabling spy services to hire workers for short - term assignments .
Sanders said 27 % of contractors were involved in intelligence collection and operations , 19 % work in analysis jobs , and 22 % manage computer networks or perform other information technology functions .
He said those figures did not include workers at companies that build spy satellites and computer equipment , cafeteria staffers or security guards .

If such “ non-core ” functions are counted , Sanders said , contractors would account for about 70 % of the U.S. intelligence workforce .

Madness : [ pic : BBC One 's Traffic Cops ]
The footage shown on the BBC One programme Traffic Cops : Dicing with Death ( Thursday 25 Sept ) is simply staggering .
And just when you think it could n't get any worse , it does .
Andy ( right ) struggles with the woman One Saturday afternoon in May 2008 , Highways Agency officials alerted police after spotting two women - twin sisters from Sweden - walking down the central reservation of the M6 motorway near Stoke - on - Trent .
Then , as officers challenged the women on the hard shoulder , one of them broke free and deliberately ran onto the carriageway and into the path of the oncoming traffic .
Then her sister inexplicably did the same .
“ It was completely crazy .
It was like watching a live TV show or something . "
That was the reaction of Andy Fairclough , 33 , from Reddish who , at that moment , was driving up from Devon in his Stockport Removals & Storage Ltd. truck .
CCTV : cameras spot the women “ I ’ll never forget it , " he said .
" When I got there , the artic [ articulated lorry ] had just hit the first girl – I just remember seeing it jump up as it ran over her .
" And then I looked left and I saw the other girl run out in front of the silver Polo .
She just hit the windscreen and flew into the air . "
' Booted '
That was shocking enough .
What happened next would be simply unbelievable if it had n’t all been captured on camera .
Aftermath : panic on the motorway
With one of the sisters critical , and the other unconscious after an accident that would kill most people , police called for help while desperately trying to stop the oncoming traffic .
But as the unconscious sister came round , she punched a woman police officer and then ran into the southbound carriageway , before fighting off attempts to restrain her .
It took six grown men – including Andy Fairclough – to wrestle her to the ground .
“ The strength of the girl was amazing , ” he said .
“ I got booted in the chest for my trouble before I managed to get a good hold of her legs . ”
Gobsmacked
Andy says the TV programme has left his workmates speechless .
" They were absolutely gobsmacked , ” he said .
Andy 's truck with the silver Polo " I ’d told them at the time but , to be honest , I do n't think they realised it was that serious .
Now they ’ve seen it , they 're just ca n’t believe it . "
It was a major incident closing the M6 motorway for several hours and involved dozens of police and the air ambulance .
One of the Swedish sisters has since been convicted of assault and spent one day in prison .
Her sister has recovered after seven weeks in hospital .
Said Andy : " I ’ve been a truck driver for ten years , and I ’ve never seen anything like it . "

Base - jumper Hans Lange managed to avoid serious injury after jumping from the side of a mountain in Norway .
He escaped with just a broken leg after his parachute failed to release properly , and he landed in a tree .
Flying down a mountainside in a specially designed suit is now popular among base - jumpers .
BBC News Channel presenters Jon Sopel and Sophie Long describe how the dramatic jump unfolded .
Our previous list dealt with the ancient olympics – this one deals with events you wo n’t see at any olympics .
It is well known that there are some events now included in the summer olympics that seem to be odd sports , but none are as odd as these .
10 Pigeon Racing
Pigeon racing is a sport involving the release of specially trained racing pigeons , which then return to their homes over a carefully measured distance .
The time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and the animals ’ rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest rate of speed .
9 Barefoot Water Skiing
Barefoot water skiing originated in Cypress Gardens , Florida .
Dick Pope Jr. , on March 6 , 1947 , was the first recorded person to ever barefoot , though some believe the first person to do it was A. G. Hancock .
By 1950 , the first barefoot competition was held in Cypress Gardens .
Throughout the 1950s , many other start techniques were invented including the two - ski jump out , the beach start and the deep water start .
By 1961 , a whole new aspect of the sport , backwards bare - footing , was added by Randy Rabe by stepping off a trick ski backwards
8 Underwater Hockey
Underwater hockey ( now officially called Aquachallenge ) is a non-contact sport in which two teams compete to maneuver a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into goals .
Players wear a diving mask , fins and a snorkel for play .
Safety gear includes a water polo style cap , a mouthguard , and a glove for the playing hand ( to protect against pool - bottom abrasion and , in some designs , knuckle protection against puck impact ) .
Because current rules permit a player to switch the stick between hands mid-play , players may choose to wear a protective glove on both hands .
7 Freestyle Skydiving
Freestyle skydiving is a competitive skydiving discipline where one member of a two - person team performs acrobatic maneuvers in free fall while the other one films the performance from a close distance using a helmet mounted camera .
Freestyle was first performed by Deanna Kent and others for her husband Norman Kent ’s 1989 film “ From Wings Came Flight ” .
It became a competitive skydiving discipline in the early 1990 ’s and became an official FAI sport in 1996 .
6 Skysurfing
Skysurfing is a type of skydiving in which the skydiver wears a board attached to his or her feet and performs surfing - style aerobatics during free - fall .
The boards used are generally smaller than actual surfboards , and look more like snowboards or large skateboards .
The attachment to the feet is normally made removable , so that if the skydiver loses control or has difficulty opening their parachute , the board can be jettisoned .
Skysurfing is a distinct skill requiring considerable practice .
The simplest skysurfing technique is to stand upright on the board during free fall , and tilt the nose of the board down to generate forward movement .
However even this basic technique is a balancing act which experienced skydivers find tricky to learn .
5 Speedcubing
Speedcubing ( also known as speedsolving , speed cubing or speed - cubing ) is the activity of solving a Rubik ’s Cube or related puzzle as quickly as possible .
Here , solving is defined as performing a series of moves that transforms an incomplete cube into a state where each of the cube ’s six faces is one single , solid color .
Regular cubes are sold commercially in variations of 2x2x2 , 3x3x3 , 4x4x4 , and 5x5x5 .
Variations of the puzzle have been designed with as many as 11 layers , but the largest denomination cube that has been physically produced is a 7x7x7 .
The current world record for a single solve of the 3x3x3 stands at 7.08 seconds , set by Erik Akkersdijk at the Czech Open on July 12 - 13 , 2008 .
4 Competitive Eating
Competitive eating is an event wherein participants consume large quantities of food in a short time period , typically 15 minutes or less , and the eater of the most food receives a prize .
The type of food varies , although contests are primarily focused on fast foods or desserts .
Items are almost always a single type of food , such as hot dogs , pie , or mayonnaise , among many others .
Competitive eating is most popular in the USA and Japan .
Competitive eaters are sometimes known as “ gurgitators . ”
3 Lawn Mower Racing
Lawn mower racing is a form of motorsport in which competitors race modified lawn mowers , usually of the ride - on or self - propelled variety .
Original mower engines are retained , but blades are removed for safety .
The sport attracts all ages , and is usually entered into in a spirit of fun rather than extreme competitiveness , though many do take it quite seriously .
2 Belt Sander Racing
Belt sanders were one of the first power tools used in the growing field of power tool drag racing wherein a pair of stock or modified belt sanders are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long extension cords .
Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them , causing the sanders to race towards the end of the track spitting wood dust along the way .
Stock sanders race down a 50 ′ long track , while modified sanders race on a 75 ′ long track .
1 Dwarf Tossing
Dwarf tossing is a bar attraction in which dwarfs wearing special padded clothing or Velcro costumes are thrown onto mattresses or at Velcro - coated walls .
Participants compete to throw the dwarf the farthest .
The term “ dwarf throwing ” is sometimes used .
This “ sport ” has been banned in numerous places .

The week in the life of the Canadian DMCA continues ( day one here ) with Rona , Jim and Josee 's ten year old daughter .
Rona is a huge American Idol fan , faithfully watching each episode and buying CDs released by former contestants with her savings .
Last January , Jim set the family 's PVR to tape and retain each episode to allow Rona to watch how the contestants progressed .
That night , Rona records an Internet - only broadcast of American Idol highlights on her personal computer .
She also asks her brother Stephen to transfer songs from her newest CD to her computer .
The CD is copy - protected , but Stephen uses a circumvention program to transfer the music files .
If Industry Minister Jim Prentice ’s Bill C - 61 becomes law , all of these copying activities arguably violate the law .
Bill C - 61 gives Canadians the right to record television shows with their PVR .
However , the recordings may only be kept long enough to allow for the program to be viewed at a more convenient time .
By retaining copies of earlier programs , Rona ( or Jim ) is likely violating the law .
( Section 29.23 ( 1 ) ( d ) ) .
Rona ’s recording of an Internet broadcast also violates the law .
Bill C - 61 explicitly prohibits recording Internet - only broadcasts ( Section 29.23 ( 3 ) ) .
The copying of the music files also violates the law .
The act of circumventing the copy - controls on the CD violate Bill C - 61 ( Section 41.1 ) .
Moreover , the much - promoted provision to allow users to transfer their music onto their device of choice does n't apply either , since one of the conditions is that users cannot circumvent a digital lock as part of the music transfer process ( Section 20.22 ( 1 ) ( c ) .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A protester who wanted his message to stick managed to superglue himself to the British prime minister Tuesday evening .
Dan Glass , right , takes hold of the British PM 's right arm just before he was about to receive his award .
Dan Glass was at 10 Downing Street to receive a charity 's award for his work on transportation issues when he staged the unusual protest .
Just before Prime Minister Gordon Brown presented him with the award , Glass squirted superglue in the palm of his left hand .
He shook Brown 's right hand and then grabbed the prime minister 's sleeve .
" I 've just superglued myself to your arm , " Glass said he told Brown .
" Do n't panic .
This is a non-violent protest . "
Glass is affiliated with the group Plane Stupid , which campaigns against airport expansion and climate change .
He said he acted to protest Brown's " hypocrisy " on the issues .

Do n't Miss Web site : Plane Stupid
" I just wanted a few more minutes of his time to get the message across , because he's not listening to communities affected by airport expansion , " Glass told CNN on Wednesday .
The prime minister managed to free himself in about 30 seconds , Glass said .
" He can shake off my arm , but he can not shake away climate change , " he added .
Glass also claimed that some people in the room actually applauded when they realized what has happening .
" I think he [ Brown ] knew he was outnumbered on this issue , " Glass said .
A Brown spokesman called the incident " minor " and " very lighthearted . "
Glass said he was allowed to remain at the prime minister 's residence for about 40 minutes after the event .
" I think Brown would have been humiliated further if an actual award winner had been ejected from the ceremony , " he said .
Police filed no charges .
According to their website , the Plane Stupid group formed in 2005 inspired by the anti-roads protests in Britain during the mid-1990s .
The group -- which describes itself as non-partisan -- is funded primarily by donations from individuals and organizations .

Linuxカーネルは柔軟性が高く、sysctlコマンドを利用すれば、カーネルパラメータを動的に変更してその場で動作を変えることさえ可能だ。sysctlのインタフェースでは、LinuxまたはBSDの何百というカーネルパラメータを参照したり変更したりできる。変更はただちに反映されるが、リブート後まで変更を保留する手段もある。うまくsysctlを使えば、カーネルを再コンパイル（翻訳記事）しなくてもマシンの最適化が可能であり、しかもその効果をすぐに確認できる。
とりあえずsysctlでどんな変更ができるのかを知るには、「 sysctl -a 」を実行して扱えるパラメータをすべて表示するといい。そのリストは非常に長いもので、私のマシンでは712もの設定可能な項目が表示される。
$ sysctl - a kernel.panic = 0 kernel.core_uses_pid = 0 kernel.core_pattern = core kernel.
tainted = 129 ...（以下略）...
ある変数の値だけを確認したければ、 「 sysctl vm.swappiness 」のようにすればよい。また、 「 sysctl vm 」とすれば「vm」で始まるすべての変数が表示される。「 -n 」オプションを追加すると、変数の名前は表示されずに値だけが出力される。反対に、「
- N 」オプションでは、変数の値は出さずに名前だけが出力される。
変数の値を変更するには、 「 - w 」 オプションを用いた 「 sysctl - w <変数>=<値> 」という構文を使う。たとえば、 「 sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 」とすれば、指定した変数が「true」になり（0は「no」または「false」を、1は「yes」または「true」を意味する）、IPv6転送が有効になる。なお、仕様改訂のためか「 -w 」オプションは必要ない場合もある。あとは各自で実際に変更を試してもらいたい。
詳細については、 「 man sysctl 」を実行して、標準のドキュメントを参照してほしい。
systlと 「/ proc」ディレクトリ 「/ proc/sys」（翻訳記事）という仮想ディレクトリにも、sysctlパラメータの参照と変更が可能なインタフェースがある。たとえば、「/proc/sys/vm/swappiness」ファイルは、「sysctl.conf」ファイルの「vm.swappiness」パラメータと同じものを指す。つまり、先頭の「/proc/sys/」を外してドット（.）をスラッシュ（/）で置き換えれば、対応するsysctlパラメータになるわけだ
（ちなみに、実はドットによるスラッシュの置き換えは不要で、スラッシュの使用も認められているが、一般的にはドット表記が用いられる）。そのため、「 echo 10 >/proc/sys/vm/swappiness 」は、 「 sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10 」を実行するのと同じことになる。ただし、当然のことながら、該当する「/proc/sys」ファイルが読み取り専用になっている場合、そのパラメータはsysctlコマンドを使っても変更できない。
sysctlパラメータの値は、ブート時に「/etc/sysctl.conf」ファイルから読み込まれる。このファイルには、空白行やコメント（“#”またはセミコロンで始まる行）が含まれていてもよいが、それ以外は「<変数>=<値>」形式の行でなければならない。参考までに、私の「sysctl.conf」ファイルは次のようになっている。この設定は、いつでも「 sysctl -p 」コマンドによって適用できる。
# Disable response to broadcasts .
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1 # enable route verification on all interfaces net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1 # enable ip V6 forwarding net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1 # increase the number of possible inotify ( 7 ) watches fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 65536
効果的な利用 法
これほど多くのチューニング可能なパラメータをどのように扱えばいいのだろうか。実は、そこがsysctlの泣きどころだ。Linuxカーネルに関する重要事項のほとんどは、多数のソースファイルに記されており、容易には参照できない。また、そうした記述は一般のユーザには理解しがたい場合もある。「/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysctl」ディレクトリを探せば何か見つかるかもしれないが、そこにある（すべてではないが）大部分のファイルはカーネル2.2について記されたもので、もう何年も更新されていないようだ。
また、このテーマを取り上げた書籍をあたっても、十分な情報が得られるとはいえない。『Linux Server Hacks , Volume 2』（2005 年O’ Reilly刊）のHack #71にsysctlの解説があるが、やはり物足りない。ほかの何冊かの書籍にもsysctlが出てくるが、具体的なパラメータやヒントについては自分で調べるしかない。
試しに、仮想メモリの管理をチューニングできるswappinessパラメータの情報を探してみよう。「/usr/src/Linux/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt」ファイルには、このパラメータの名前さえなかった。おそらく、カーネルのバージョン2.6あたりで追加されたものだからだろう。「/usr/src/linux」ディレクトリ全体に対して検索をかけたところ、「swappiness」という記述を含むファイルが5つ見つかった。うち3つは「include/linux」ディレクトリ内のヘッダファイルをインクルードするものだった。残りは「kernel/sysctl.c」と「mm/vmscan.c」で、後者には次のような情報が含まれていた。
* From 0 .. 100 .
Higher means more swappy .
*/ int vm_swappiness = 60 ;
これだ！これこそ探し求めていた情報だ。デフォルト値（60）とパラメータの意味に関する最低限の説明が記されている。これでどうにかvm_swappinessが使えそうだ。
私としては、 「 sysctl -a 」を使って利用可能なパラメータを把握したうえで、Googleで追加情報を探すことをお勧めしたい。たとえば、共有メモリの割り当てを変更して動画再生の問題を解決する例やvm.swappinessの説明、あるいはIPv4ネットワークのトラフィック最適化のヒントが見つかるはずだ。
sysctlには、Linuxシステムの柔軟性の高さを示すもう1つの側面がある。ドキュメントは十分に揃ってはいないが、その機能を自分で調べることはマシンのパフォーマンスのさらなる向上につながる。これこそ、最もレベルの高いシステム管理といえよう（いや、システム的にはむしろ低レベルと呼ぶべきか）。

Vice President Dick Cheney ’s Incredible and Deadly Lie : By Deceiving a Congressional Leader , Cheney Sent Us to War on False Pretenses And Violated the Separation of Powers – as Well as the Criminal Law
By JOHN W. DEAN
Friday , Sept. 19 , 2008
Copyright Â© 2008 FindLaw , a Thomson Reuters business .
All rights reserved .
This week , I agreed to deliver a “ Constitution Day ” talk on a college campus .
My talk was not partisan .
Yet the subject matter I selected was prompted by the most incredible – not to mention the most deadly – lie Dick Cheney has yet told , which was reported earlier this week .
Last year , Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman and Jo Baker , now of the New York Times , did an extensive series for the Post on Cheney .
Now , Gellman has done some more digging , and published the result in a book he released this week : Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency .
The book reveals a lie told to a high - ranking fellow Republican , and the difference that lie made .
In this column , I ’ll explain how Cheney defied the separation of powers , and go back to the founding history to show why actions like his matter so profoundly .
Cheney ’s Bold Face Lie To Congress
According to Gellman ( and to paraphrase from the Post story on his finding ) , in the run-up to the war in Iraq , the White House was worried about the stance of Republican Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas , who had deep concerns about going to war with Saddam Hussein .
According to the Post , Armey met with Cheney for a highly classified , one - on - on briefing , in Room H - 208 , Cheney ’s luxurious hideaway office on the House side of the Capitol .
During this meeting , the Post reports , Cheney turned Armey around on the war issue .
Cheney did so by telling the House Majority Leader that he was giving him information that the Administration could not tell the public – namely ( according to Armey ) , that Iraq had the “ ‘ ability to miniaturize weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear , ’ which had been ‘ substantially refined since the first Gulf War , ’ and would soon result in ‘ packages that could be moved even by ground personnel . ’
In addition , Cheney linked that threat to Saddam ’s alleged personal ties to al Qaeda , explaining that ‘ we now know they have the ability to develop these weapons in a very portable fashion , and they have a delivery system in their relationship with organizations such as al Qaeda . ' ”
The Post story continues , “ Armey has asked : “ Did Dick Cheney … purposely tell me things he knew to be untrue ? ”
His answer : “ I seriously feel that may be the case …
Had I known or believed then what I believe now , I would have publicly opposed [ the war ] resolution right to the bitter end , and I believe I might have stopped it from happening . ”
In short , it was this lie that sealed the nation ’s fate , and sent us to war in Iraq .
By lying to such an influential figure in Congress , Cheney not only may have changed the course of history , but also corrupted the separation of powers with their inherent checks and balances .
Cheney ’s monumental dishonesty , the news of which has been buried under the current meltdown of the nation ’s economy , did not strike me as a topic for a Constitution Day speech .
But a realistic discussion of the working of the separations of powers did seem a fitting topic , for college students need to understand the basics of our system .
After we remind ourselves of those basics , Cheney ’s great lie can be viewed not only as a great immorality and violation of the criminal code , but also and more fundamentally as the significant breach of his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution that it is .
Our Constitutional Separation of Powers
Historians , not to mention contemporary historical documents , establish that no issue was more important to the founders of our national government than that of what its structure should be .
Accordingly , in anticipation of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787 , James Madison of Virginia plowed through historical accounts of governments and concluded that there are three basic forms of government : monarchy ( the one ) , oligarchy ( an elite few ) and democracy ( the many ) .
Each form , however , had serious drawbacks .
As a result , Madison sought to take the best of each to create a “ republic ” – as had been done in varying degrees with many of the American colonies .
Republics , of course , had been around a long time , for they were the forms employed by the Greeks and Romans .
Thus , the republic was a form of government those who were meeting in Philadelphia well understood , in which sovereignty resides with the people who elect agents to represent them in the political decision - making process .
Madison ’s republic combined elements of each type of government , in a mixing of forms .
It featured an executive who incorporated the strength of monarchy without the evils of a King ; a Senate that embodied the wisdom of an oligarchy ; and a House that balanced the self - interest of such elites with a throng of representatives who spoke for the people of the nation .
Many delegates at the founding convention were mistrustful of a pure democracy since none had worked well in the past ; moreover , the country was too large and diverse to directly involve everyone .
Later , Madison nicely explained the differences in Federalist No. 14 : “ [ I ] n a democracy , the people meet and exercise the government in person ; in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents .
A democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot .
A republic may be extended over a large region . ”
Most importantly , Madison ’s structure had three separate branches of the government – legislative , executive and judicial – and each branch was empowered to check and balance the others , and thereby diffuse power .
Madison ’s system , however , has not worked as designed even in the best of times , not to mention when there is an all - powerful Vice President hell - bent on gaming the system .
The Reality of Separation of Powers
An article in the June 2006 Harvard Law Journal – Daryl J. Levinson and Richard H. Pildes , “ Separation of Parties , Not Powers , ” Harvard Law Journal ( Jun. 2006 ) 2311 – provides one of the better analyses out there of the real - world workings of the separation of powers , and their accompanying checks and balances .
Professors Levinson and Pildes argue that Madison ’s vision of separation of powers has , in fact , been trumped in America by political parties .
Their point is well taken , but as I see it their conclusion is far more applicable to the Republicans than the Democrats .
“ The success of American democracy overwhelmed the Madisonian conception of separation of powers almost from the outset , preempting the political dynamics that were supposed to provide each branch with a ‘ will of its own ’ that would propel departmental ‘ [ a ] mbition ” ¦ to counteract ambition ’ , ” Levinson and Pildes explain .
This , in turn , they argue , made the underlying theory of the government – separation of powers – largely “ anachronistic . ”
When they looked at government , however , they found that when different political parties control the different branches – creating a divided government – then the parties working through those branches still do operate as Madison had hoped .
Why ?
By sifting through the work of noted political scientists , Levinson and Pildes have concluded that it is not on behalf of protecting the institutional powers that the checking and balancing occurs ; rather , it is through the influence of party politics operating through that divided branch .
I believe , based on the record ( and as someone who worked on the Hill when Democrats controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue ) that Levinson and Pildes have it half right .
Democrats under unified government ( i.e. , when Democrats control both Congress and the White House ) have been remarkably institutionally - minded , and the separation of powers has remained viable .
On the other hand , conservative Republicans – as I have explained in my book Broken Government ( just out in paperback too ) – easily place party loyalty before the responsibilities of the governmental institution in which they serve .
The first six years of the Bush / Cheney Administration , for example , were a travesty in Republican denial of institutional responsibilities .
In contrast , there is a long list of Democratic House and Senate Chairmen who have a on - going history of refusing to be the rubber - stamps of Democratic Presidents .
For instance , unlike in the situation where Cheney lied to former Majority Leader Armey , when both the Democratic House and Senate suspected that President Lyndon Johnson had lied to them about the incident (s ) in the Gulf of Tonkin that provoked Congress to authorize the war in Viet Nam , they took action .
In contrast , Republicans have not acted on Cheney ’s lie to Armey – and surely Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman is not the first person to learn about this lie .
Why Cheney Is Not Likely To Be Held Accountable
Those of us who follow these matters have long known – and I have written before – that it is Dick Cheney who is molding his hapless and naive president to his will , by effecting endless expansions of Presidential powers , and acting upon Cheney ’s total disregard of the separation of powers .
Cheney does not seem to believe the Constitution applies to “ real leaders , ” who do whatever they believe they must do .
Nor does he believe in the separation of powers .
Indeed , Cheney absurdly claims he is himself part of the Legislative Branch because he is the presiding officer of the Senate – though , in practice , that position exists only to break tie votes .
It has long been clear that Cheney has been corruptly bridging the constitutional separation of powers throughout the Bush / Cheney presidency .
If Armey is right , Dick Cheney has not only behaved improperly , but also criminally :
In addition , when lying to Armey , Cheney clearly committed a “ high crime or misdemeanor ” in his blocking the Constitution ’s checks and balances from stopping our march into Iraq .
During the debates that took place during the Constitution ’s ratification conventions , it was specifically stated that lying to Congress about matters of war would be an impeachable offense .
Congress has also made it a crime .
Nonetheless , nothing is likely to happen to Cheney , for Congress is too busy dealing with the disastrous economy that he and Bush are leaving behind as they head for the door .
No one seems inclined to hold Cheney responsible , and he appears totally unconcerned about the wrath of history .
Yet in lying even to those in his own party , about reasons to go to war , he has sunk to a low level few have reached , and it is no hyperbole to call his actions treasonous to the structure and spirit of the Republic .

Create a Legacy through the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Long - Term Investment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties
There are many ways you can make a significant gift to EFF that will provide you with tax savings and other benefits .
Depending upon your unique financial planning objectives , you can be a major supporter of EFF using any or all of the giving methods described below .
It is important , regardless of the size of your estate , to have a properly executed plan to ensure that you , not the courts , determine who will receive your property upon your death .
When you create a will or living trust with a qualified advisor , attorney , accountant and / or financial planner , you ensure that your intentions are carried out .
You are also ensuring that the needs of the people and organizations you care about will be met .
The Development Office is prepared to work closely with you and your financial advisors to explain the benefits of each gift category .
We encourage you to consult with your tax advisor for specific information about your own estate and financial planning goals .
Bequests
The amount of a bequest gift is fully deductible for estate tax purposes .
Gifts of securities , real property , and business interests may be made as bequests .
Some sample language you can use to include EFF in your estate plan : " I bequeath to the Electronic Frontier Foundation , 815 Eddy Street , San Francisco , California 94109 , the sum of ______________ ( $ ) dollars for its general purposes . "
Gifts of Life Insurance
By naming EFF the owner and beneficiary of an existing policy , you receive a tax deduction for the cash surrender value .
You may also decide to make EFF the beneficiary of a life insurance policy .
If you make gifts to EFF in the amount of the policy 's premiums , you can take a charitable income tax deduction ( provided EFF is not obligated to use the payments to cover the policy 's premium ) .
Retirement Plans
You can name EFF as a beneficiary of an Individual Retirement Account ( IRA ) , 401 ( k ) Plan , 403 ( b ) Plan , Qualified Pension Plan , or Qualified Profit - Sharing Plan .
Transferring these assets to a family member at the death of the plan participant may trigger two potential federal taxes : estate tax and income tax .
When a beneficiary is someone other than a spouse , the combination of these taxes could consume most of the assets intended for transfer .
Since EFF is a tax - exempt organization , we do not have to pay taxes on the income from the plan .
Your plan administrator can provide you with a beneficiary form .
Financial Accounts
By including EFF as a beneficiary of a bank account , brokerage account , mutual fund account , or an asset such as a certificate of deposit ( CD ) , you can provide a legacy gift to support our work .
Your estate would receive a charitable deduction equal to the amount of the gift .
Simply fill out a beneficiary designation form obtained from the institution holding your account .

I can't believe I found Quentin Tarantino backing me up on this .
Tarantino 's theory takes the idea all the way down to the core intent of the film .
I always knew that Top Gun had homo - erotic tendencies but I never considered that it was the whole idea behind the film .
This is not really the problem here .
The problem is the packaging just like Quentin says .
They are trying to deceive the audience and that irritates the shit out of me .
At a quick glance , it 's a movie about manly military fighter pilots going after the evil Russians .
Classic man movie material .
Take away the few minutes of dogfights , the beer , and Tom Skerritt it reveals itself to be half chick flick and half about a man coming to terms with his homosexuality .

That represents 2.8 % of all outstanding loans , up from 1.4 % of all loans during the same period a year ago , according to a report released Friday by the Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA ) .
And 490,000 of the 45 million home mortgages serviced by MBA members began new foreclosure proceedings .
That 's up 9 % from the 448,000 starts recorded in the previous quarter , and marked the seventh straight quarter that foreclosure starts increased .
The delinquency rate , which measures mortgages that are n't in foreclosure but have missed least one payment , also hit a record high .
During the three months ended June 30 , 2.9 million homeowners , or 6.4 % , were behind on their payments , up more than 25 % from last year .
The MBA has been tracking foreclosure and delinquency data since 1979 .
" The national foreclosure numbers continue to be driven by the hardest hit states that are continuing to get much worse , " said Jay Brinkmann , MBA 's Chief Economist .
" The increases in foreclosures in California and Florida overwhelmed improvements in states like Texas , Massachusetts and Maryland . "
California and Florida accounted for 39 % of all foreclosures started during the quarter .
Those two states as well as six others - Nevada , Arizona , Michigan , Rhode Island , Indiana , and Ohio - all had foreclosure start rates higher than the national average .
Subprime still sinking
Once again , subprime adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) weighed heavily on the down side .
Subprime ARMs , which represent only 6 % of all loans outstanding , accounted for 36 % of all foreclosures started during the quarter .
In other words , 6.6 % of all subprime ARMs went into foreclosure during the period - nearly 20 times the rate for fixed rate prime mortgages .
While the percentage of all subprime ARMs past due fell slightly to 21 % from 22.1 % , the proportion of these loans that are 90 or more past due rose to 26.8 % from 24 % , indicating that many of these borrowers are falling deeper into trouble .
" The big problem , " said Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with Weiss Research , " is this mortgage crisis long since stopped being just about subprime . "
Indeed , the prime delinquency rate rose to 3.9 % from 3.7 % in the first quarter of 2008 , and 2.7 % a year earlier .
" This is the highest reading yet . "
" Even if subprime stabilizes , " said Larson , " I would anticipate that prime loans would start to play catch - up .
We 're not just confronting a credit crisis any more , we 're dealing with broad economic problems that are contributing to delinquency rates . "
On the bright side , Larson says the deterioration in home prices has slowed in the last couple of months , which could help delinquencies level off as well .
" They 'll continue to worsen , " he said , " but not at the pace of the last year . "
What 's next
Nevertheless , Jay Brinkmann warned that it would be fruitless to try and call a bottom in this market any time soon .
" Real estate markets are local and some markets are already improving , " he said in a statement .
" For example , even Michigan , one of the worst hit markets in the country , has now gone three quarters with little to no increase in its rate of foreclosures .
Likewise , Massachusetts showed a very large drop in foreclosure starts , perhaps signaling a bottom . "
" Because of the sheer size of California and Florida , an improvement in the national numbers , whether delinquencies , home prices or any other measure , is unlikely until we see some turnaround in those two states . "
Much of what 's ahead depends on home prices , according to Brinkmann .
" Home price declines have a bigger impact on foreclosure rates than foreclosures have on home prices . "
Home price declines drive foreclosure rates higher by stripping value from homes and putting mortgage borrowers underwater , owing more than their homes are worth .
" So many of the loans are going from delinquency to foreclosure because they are so deeply underwater , " said Patrick Newport , a real estate analyst with Global Insight .
Foreclosure prevention efforts could help stem this tide , said Faith Schwartz , Director of Hope Now , the coalition of lenders , servicers , mortgage investors and community groups .
" The more people who get their mortgage loans stabilized , the more home prices will stabilize , " she said .
But whether delinquencies worsen over the next few months is largely dependent on how the economy shakes out , according to Brinkmann , and right now , things do n't look good .
The unemployment rate jumped to 6.1 % , the government reported on Friday , a five - year high .
As we saw last month [ 1 ] , lock - free coding is hard even for experts .
There , I dissected a published lock - free queue implementation [ 2 ] and examined why the code was quite broken .
This month , let 's see how to do it right .
Lock - Free Fundamentals
When writing lock - free code , always keep these essentials well in mind :
Key concepts .
Think in transactions .
Know who owns what data .
Key tool .
The ordered atomic variable .
When writing a lock - free data structure , " to think in transactions " means to make sure that each operation on the data structure is atomic , all - or - nothing with respect to other concurrent operations on that same data .
The typical coding pattern to use is to do work off to the side , then " publish " each change to the shared data with a single atomic write or compare - and - swap . [ 3 ]
Be sure that concurrent writers do n't interfere with each other or with concurrent readers , and pay special attention to any operations that delete or remove data that a concurrent operation might still be using .
Be highly aware of who owns what data at any given time ; mistakes mean races where two threads think they can proceed with conflicting work .
You know who owns a given piece of shared data right now by looking at the value of the ordered atomic variable that says who it is .
To hand off ownership of some data to another thread , do it at the end of a transaction with a single atomic operation that means " now it 's your's . "
An ordered atomic variable is a " lock - free - safe " variable with the following properties that make it safe to read and write across threads without any explicit locking :
Atomicity .
Each individual read and write is guaranteed to be atomic with respect to all other reads and writes of that variable .
The variables typically fit into the machine 's native word size , and so are usually pointers ( C++ ) , object references ( Java , . NET ) , or integers .
Order .
Each read and write is guaranteed to be executed in source code order .
Compilers , CPUs , and caches will respect it and not try to optimize these operations the way they routinely distort reads and writes of ordinary variables .
Compare - and - swap ( CAS ) [ 4 ] .
There is a special operation you can call using a syntax like variable.compare_exchange( expectedValue , newValue ) that does the following as an atomic operation :
If variable currently has the value expectedValue , it sets the value to newValue and returns true ; else returns false .
A common use is if ( variable.compare_exchange(x , y ) ) , which you should get in the habit of reading as , " if I 'm the one who gets to change variable from x to y . "
Ordered atomic variables are spelled in different ways on popular platforms and environments .
For example :
volatile in C#/.NET , as in volatile int .
volatile or * Atomic* in Java , as in volatile int , AtomicInteger . atomic <T > in C++0x , the forthcoming ISO C++ Standard , as in atomic < int > .
In the code that follows , I 'm going to highlight the key reads and writes of such a variable ; these variables should leap out of the screen at you , and you should get used to being very aware of every time you touch one .

How a Tennis Ball Is Made
The U.S. Open kicks off next Monday , so we took an inside look at the most important part of the game .
Microsoft and Nikon have signed a cross-licensing deal that gives each company access to the other 's patents .
The deal is one of a growing list from Microsoft , which has been seeking to establish the heft and significance of its intellectual property effort .
Detailed terms of the Nikon deal were n't disclosed , but the companies said Nikon is compensating Microsoft through the alliance .
" The companies believe that this patent cross-licensing agreement will substantially benefit customers of consumer products including digital cameras , " the companies said in a statement Wednesday .
" Both parties will be able to innovate openly with each others ' technologies , enabling new features and products to come to market . "
Nikon and Microsoft did n't indicate what new products and features would be enabled through the patent agreement , but they did point to existing cooperative efforts involving wireless cameras and raw image formats .
Raw images are taken directly from a camera 's image sensor with little or no in - camera processing ; the formats more detailed and flexible than JPEG , but they 're also proprietary and specific to each camera model , and they require processing with software to become useful to most consumers .
Windows Vista has the ability to display raw images as long as a camera maker supplies the necessary encoding and decoding software plug - in , called a codec .
Teeth are visible along the edge of this temnospondyl fossil , and also can be seen spaced out across the palate roof about one - third of the way up in the photograph .
A prehistoric predator that looked like a big crocodile paddled around the Antarctic region 240 million years ago , sporting sizable fangs not only along the edge of its mouth but also halfway down the roof of its mouth .
The newly described freshwater species , Kryostega collinsoni , is a temnospondyl , a once - diverse but extinct group of amphibians that lived during the Triassic period , when dinosaurs first showed up .
Temnospondyls are extinct cousins of modern salamanders and frogs .
This one was probably about 15 feet in length with a long and wide skull even flatter than a crocodile's .
Its side teeth were more than an inch tall , and its tallest " palatal " fang on the roof of its mouth was even scarier at an inch and a half high .
" Its teeth , compared to other amphibians , were just enormous .
It leads us to believe this animal was a predator taking down large prey , " said Christian Sidor , a University of Washington associate professor of biology and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture .
" We think Kryostega was an aquatic animal , so it probably ate mostly fish and other amphibians living in the river alongside it , " he said .
" However , like modern crocodiles , if land - living animals strayed too close to the river 's edge , I expect that it would have been able to drag them in .
Sidor headed up a study of the new species detailed in the September issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
His colleagues on the work included Ross Damiani of Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart in Germany and William Hammer of Augustana College in Rock Island , Ill .
The work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation .
Surprising size
The finding sheds additional light on what kinds of animals lived on what is now Antarctica , Sidor told LiveScience .
" Also surprising is the gigantic size of Kryostega , " he said .
" Finally , it reminds us that the world has not always been like it is today — at times is has been warmer , at times colder . "
Antarctica was substantially warmer in the Middle Triassic than it is today , Sidor said , but it was n't exactly tropical or balmy .
Computer climate simulations suggest that it was seasonally very harsh , with periods of complete darkness .
The scientists worked from a fossilized piece of the snout of K. collinsoni , analyzing structures present in more complete skulls for other temnospondyl species that had similar size characteristics .
" The anatomy of the snout tells us what major group of amphibian this fossil belonged to , " Sidor said .
Teeth at the edge of the mouth , as well as on the palate roof , were clearly visible , and the presence of structures similar to those that allow fish and amphibians to sense changes in water pressure led the researchers to conclude that the species was aquatic .
The fossilized piece of snout also contains a nostril , which aided the scientists in judging proportions of the head when comparing it to other fossils .
They estimated the skull was about 2.75 feet long and perhaps 2 feet across at its widest point .
" Kryostega was the largest animal in Antarctica during the Triassic , " Sidor said .
The word kryostega translates to " frozen " and " roof , " which refer to the top of the skull .
The scientists named the species for James Collinson , a professor emeritus of Earth sciences at Ohio State University who made important contributions to the study of Antarctic geology .
Hammer collected the fossil in 1986 from an Antarctic geological layer called the Fremouw Formation .
He has studied a number of other Antarctic fossils , including dinosaurs , collected at about the same time , and so the temnospondyl fossil was not closely examined until the last couple of years .
Different back then
At the time that K. collinsoni lived , all the world 's land was massed into a giant continent called Pangea .
The area of Antarctica where the fossil was found was near what is now the Karoo Basin of South Africa , one of the richest fossil depositories on Earth .
Sidor noted that in the early Triassic period , from about 245 million to 251 million years ago , just before the period that produced the K. collinsoni fossil , Antarctica and southern Africa were likely populated by largely the same types of plants and animals .
While Antarctica was still colder than much of the world , it was substantially warmer than it is today , though it still spent significant periods in complete darkness .
Then , by the middle of the Triassic period , perhaps only half the species were the same in southern Africa and Antarctica , he said , and in the early Jurassic period , around 190 million years ago , unique early dinosaur species were appearing in Antarctica .
" It could be that these animals were adjusting to their local environment by then , and we are seeing the results of speciation occurring at high latitude , " Sidor said .
" Here we have really good evidence that Antarctic climate was n't always the way it is today .
During the Triassic , it was warmer than it is today — it was warmer globally , not just in Antarctica . "
Here ’s a question that hits close to home for me .
My current job is in New York City … where I can’t afford to actually live .
That means I spend about 3 hours commuting each day to and from work .
My alarm wakes me at 6:00 , I ’m at work by 8:30 , I leave the office at 5:30 , and my train does n’t pull into the station until 7:10 .
That leaves time for a quick workout , dinner , and a shower before I have to start thinking about getting ready for bed !
If I ’m not asleep by 10:30 PM at the latest , I ’m a zombie the next day and the commute / work day is even more unbearable .
So , no , I do not even have close to the amount of leisure time I ’d like .
On the weekends I ’m usually so exhausted that I ca n’t stay out very late at night , plus I have to spend some time during the day to do chores that I do n’t have time to do during the week .
My weekends are mainly a rest and relaxation period rather than a time for new experiences and adventures .
This is n’t entirely my job ’s fault – I do make a lot of excuses when I have free time .
Usually , laziness kicks in and I ’d rather relax for a bit than force myself to go out and get active .
That ’s something I ’m trying to overcome , but it ’s a bit overwhelming when you ’re faced with the prospect of cramming an entire week ’s worth of enjoyment into 48 hours .
I think this question is one of the most important ones you can ask yourself .
If you do n’t have the time to do the things you want to do , you ’ve become a slave to the momentum of unimportant things in your life .
For most of us , the reason we do n’t have enough time is because we think that “ we have to work ” in order to pay the bills and support a family .
This is true , yes , but that does n’t mean there is n’t room for compromise .
If you value freedom and leisure time , and actually want to pursue the things that are meaningful to you , take action in the present moment to create the future you are committed to .
If this means you have to consume less , just do it !
If you have to move to a location that has a lower cost of living so you can work less , do it !
Are your material possessions and other pursuits worth selling the majority of your time , to the point where you do n’t even have any left over to enjoy the things you ’ve bought ?
Obviously not .
My advice would be to take an inventory of your time .
See how much time you ’re spending on basic things each day and each week .
Next , make a list of all the things you want to do , but do n’t have enough time for .
Be reasonable , and only include the things you are positively dedicated to .
Next , take a look at your time survey and see where some wasteful periods could be cut down or cut out entirely .
Or , find new uses for time periods you previously wasted .
For example , on the hour train ride into New York City each morning , I usually try to sleep .
Even on days when I ’m successful , the quality of sleep is poor .
So instead of forcing myself to try and catch some half - assed z’s , I ’ve re-dedicated this wasted period of time to meditation .
Now I get an extra 60 minutes of practice every day , which quadruples the amount of time I was putting into the cultivation of the habit beforehand .
Determine what you ’re willing to sacrifice in order to gain more time for yourself .
If you ’re willing to move , to stop eating out , or to abandon your fetishes for new technology and gadgets , you may find that you do n’t have to work as much .
Or you might be willing to sacrifice some of your limited free time to developing a new source of income that will increase your chances of having more free time in the future .
My goal is to reach a balanced point of consumption where I can work from home ( or any location connected to the internet ) , on my own time .
What ’s yours ?
Do you have enough time to do all the things you want to ?
Mr. Bush , Enough !!
Mr. Bush , Enough !!
So you have the colossal audacity , Mr. Bush , to “ warn ” Russia to pull back ?
As the wanton , perverse war criminal under whose watch the world saw the crime known as “ shock and awe ” committed , I ’d say you were well out of your mind to suggest that Russia should pull back .
What ’s a little shock and awe among inferior people we want to rob and destroy , eh ?
What do human beings need an infrastructure for ?
Why do they need clean water ?
Why do they need electricity ?
What ’s a little torture ?
What ’s a little regime change ?
Do n’t recall when that was a goal of yours ?
What ’s a little deviant , perverted sexual experimentation and humiliation ?
What ’s a few secret detention camps ?
What ’s wrong with destroying an environment for 4 billion years and generations after generations of people ?
After all , they ’re just rag heads , are n’t they Mr. Bush ?
Perhaps when Russia even begins to match your tremendous feats of glory can you speak about pulling back you fool of the worst kind .
You can also tell your number two man to shut up .
Cheney said " Russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States . "
So how do you plan to answer this erroneously termed “ aggression ” ?
He says this will “ worsen ” relations with the United States ?
Buddy , relations with the United States could hardly be any worse than they are now .
The United States shows no respect for Russia .
The United States shows no respect for any other country weaker than itself , much less a rival as you perceive Russia to be .
How about your NATO ?
Today the west , tomorrow the world , eh? America uber alles !
How about your missile shield breathing down the neck of the Russian nation ?
There to protect Europe from Iran ?
The most totally absurd thing that only a moron would believe .
How about your deliberate breaking of your agreements regarding Serbian Kosovo ?
UN Resolution 1244 which your country agreed to , is the ink dry … you deliberately went against it and recognized Kosovo in total disregard and in violation of that agreement .
And you expect your words to be heeded or even listened to ?
You are joking !
It is said when Caligula went mad he heard laughing .
Do you hear people laughing at you Mr. Bush ?
Listening to you , your Vice President , Condi Rice and US and western officials complain about " regime change , " " invasion , " " bloodshed " and " suffering civilians " ( in the light of their crimes across the world ) have become nothing but laughable at best and highly infuriating and enraging at worst .
You are an idiot !
We seem to recall that when your Israeli friends were absolutely devastating the people of Lebanon , wantonly killing civilians , destroying their country ’s infrastructure and destroying their environment also … .
the flapping jaw of your representative , Condoleezza Rice and your entire administration were saying no ceasefire , no nothing , just keep on going , keep on committing acts of state terrorism on innocent people , keep on committing your war crimes , you have them covered .
Well , Mr. Bush , this is it .
Moscow better get this one right :
No limited engagement nonsense .
Moscow has the moral and legal right to carry out full scale military operations within Ossetia , Abkhazia and Georgia to ensure the safety of its citizens , to ensure the protection of Abkhazians and Ossetians and to finally destroy NATO plans for the Caucasus region .
No sane , informed , honest , rational person can blame Russia for reacting to a genocide against their own citizens in Georgia .
But then you are NONE of those things .
The problem is not what Russia is doing , but how the US is reacting to it .
If you were sane , if you were informed , if you were honest , if you were rational , if you were even marginally fair , you should be happy to see Russian forces put an end to the killing of Russian citizens by the Georgian military .
But no , your government is advised by lunatics who belong in psychiatric wards instead of the Pentagon and White House .
And you , Mr. Bush , belong in an international criminal court to be judged for your crimes against peace and your crimes against humanity .

WASHINGTON --
The federal government is working on a sweeping series of programs that would represent perhaps the biggest intervention in financial markets since the 1930s , embracing the need for a comprehensive approach to the financial crisis after a series of ad hoc rescues .
At the center of the potential plan is a mechanism that would take bad assets off the balance sheets of financial companies , said people familiar with the matter , a device that echoes similar moves taken in past financial crises .

Unable to earn her card through sponsor exemptions , Michelle Wie has entered the LPGA
Tour qualifying school and will play the first stage next week on the California course where she first rose to fame at age 13 .

Her father , B.J. Wie , had said at the U.S. Women 's Open that Wie had " no other options " but Q - school if she did n't make enough money to finish the equivalent of 80th on the LPGA Tour money list .
" Nothing has changed since then , " he said Tuesday morning from Palm Desert , Calif .
" She will go to Q - school . "
The first stage will be at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage , Calif. , site of the Kraft Nabisco Championship , where Wie played in the final group of the LPGA 's first major when she was in the eighth grade .
The top 30 will advance to the final qualifier in Daytona Beach , Fla. , in December , where the top 20 and ties will earn LPGA Tour cards .
If Wie falls short in California , she can go to the Florida qualifier to try to get to the finals .
Wie turned pro in 2005 and , a year later , had at least a share of the lead on the back nine of three majors .
Her career went into a tailspin shortly after that , when she tried to play through wrist injuries , withdrew from the Ginn Tribute when she was on the verge of shooting 88 and facing suspension , and continued to play an occasional event on men 's tours .
She has not won any tournament since the U.S. Women 's Amateur Public Links in 2003 at age 13 .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
The third tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season , Cristobal , gained strength just off the U.S. East Coast on Saturday and gale - force winds and heavy rains were expected to lash the Carolinas as the storm grazed the shoreline on a northeasterly path .
Hurricane Bertha , meanwhile , defied cool Atlantic waters and remained a hurricane while a strong tropical wave south of Jamaica was expected to develop into a depression -- the precursor to a storm -- as it headed toward Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula and the oil rigs of the Gulf of Mexico beyond .
Cristobal strengthened despite being over only marginally warm waters but was not seen becoming a hurricane , which requires winds of at least 74 miles per hour ( 119 km per hour ) , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said .
It was about 125 miles east of Charleston , South Carolina , by 5 p.m. EDT and moving to the northeast parallel to the coastline at 7 mph with 45 mph winds , the Miami - based hurricane center said .
A tropical storm warning was in effect from South Santee River in South Carolina to the North Carolina / Virginia border and rainfall of up to 5 inches could be expected in coastal areas , the center said .
Bertha , far to the east in the open Atlantic , continued to display an ominous resilience as it raced over chilly waters in the direction of distant Iceland .
The first hurricane of the season -- now on its way to becoming one of the longest - lived Atlantic storms on record -- Bertha formed on July 3 near the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa , signaling an early start to what might turn out to be an active six - month hurricane season .
GETTING INTO GEAR
The season begins on June 1 but rarely gets into gear before August .
By 5 p.m. , Hurricane Bertha was located about 490 miles east - southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland , the hurricane center said .
It was speeding toward the northeast at 25 mph .
The tropical Atlantic on Saturday looked more like what it ought to be in September than in July .
“ The level of tropical activity this past week has been quite remarkable , ” Jeff Masters , co-founder of meteorological Web site The Weather Underground , wrote in a blog .
“ It ’s a very good thing that sea surface temperatures are more than 1 degree Celsius ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) cooler than during the record - breaking hurricane season of 2005 . ”
Tropical storms and hurricanes need water temperatures of at least 79 degrees Fahrenheit ( 26 Celsius ) to sustain themselves .
Particularly warm waters in 2005 allowed 28 storms to form during the season , including Katrina , the hurricane that swamped New Orleans and killed 1,500 people on the U.S. Gulf Coast .
In addition to Bertha and Cristobal , the hurricane center was watching an area of thunderstorms in the Caribbean that appeared likely to become a tropical depression as it moved westward toward the Yucatan Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico .
Oil markets watch Atlantic storms very carefully because of their potential to affect oil and gas production in the Gulf , where the United States produces a third of its crude .
A series of devastating hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 pushed oil prices to then record highs after toppling oil rigs and severing undersea pipelines .
A court has ruled that a site providing links to P2P downloads is operating legally .
The Provincial Court of Madrid ruled that Sharemula.com , a site offering eDonkey links to movies , music , software and games does not break the law .
The court 's decision is final and cannot be appealed .
Following a Federación Antipiratería ( Anti-piracy Federation ) investigation in 2006 , 15 people were arrested in Spain in connection with the operation of Sharemula.com , an eDonkey ( eD2k ) indexing site .
eD2 k links are similar to URLs or . torrent files , in that they contain no copyright material themselves , but may point to such works .
Spain ’s Brigade of Technological Investigations claimed that the site was illegal and should be closed .
Just under a year ago the case was heard , but sadly for the entertainment industry , the court ruled that the case against Sharemula should be dismissed .
It said that neither the site nor administrators had operated illegally by offering links to copyright works , since they had not done so for profit or commercial gain .
However , the entertainment industry – including but not limited to Columbia , Disney Company Iberia , Twentieth Century Fox , Warner , Universal , Paramount , Sony and MGM , did not accept the ruling and appealed the decision .
Yesterday , the Provincial Court of Madrid ruled that the entertainment industry has no case against Sharemula , and since it has broken no laws , the case should be dismissed .
This dismissal is final and cannot be appealed .
The court rejected all allegations that were made by the entertainment industry and concluded that indexing eD2 k links ( or torrent files ) can not be seen as copyright infringement ( pdf in Spanish ) .
Sharemula ’s main purpose is to index links , and they are not responsible for where these links go according to the court decision .
Whether or not Sharemula makes profit is irrelevant .
“ The hearing confirms the position of the defense that linking to P2P networks does not constitute a criminal offense , ” wrote David Bravo , a lawyer in the case , noting that Sharemula did not store any copyrighted material .
The site simply links to files that are hosted elsewhere , on computers of P2P users .
It is on this same premise that The Pirate Bay claims to operate legally .
With upcoming cases against The Pirate Bay and Mininova in Europe , this decision is very welcome for p2p- site administrators .
The shuttle Atlantis ( foreground ) sits on Launch Pad A and Endeavour on Launch Pad B at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
For the first time since July 2001 , two shuttles are on the pads at the same time .
Endeavour will stand by in the unlikely event that a rescue mission is necessary during Atlantis ' upcoming mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope , targeted to launch Oct. 10 , 2008 .
NASA has delayed the last shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope until early 2009 inorder to repair a broken device that is blocking the orbital observatory fromsending its iconic images of the cosmos back to Earth , agency officials saidlate Monday .
Sevenastronauts were training to launch toward Hubble aboard the shuttle Atlantis onOct. 14 on mission to extend the space telescope ?s life through at least 2013 , but the unexpectedfailure of a vital data relay system on Saturday will add months of delayto their spaceflight .
? I think it ? svery obvious that Oct. 14 is off the table , ?
NASA ?s space shuttle program managerJohn Shannon told reporters .
NASA announcedMonday that a device known as the Side A Science Data Formatter failed , apparently for good , late Saturday , leaving the otherwise healthy Hubble withno means of relaying data and observations to scientists back on Earth .
The electronicsbox failed after 18 years in service since Hubble launched in April 1990 .
There is abackup for the unit , Side B , and flight controllers on Earth are working tomake the complicated switch to revive Hubble ?s science relay capabilities .
Butthe move will leave the telescope without the redundancy to withstand anotherfailure should one occur , making a repair for the Side A string vital , missionmanagers said .
? We do notreally understand the precise location of the failure inside of the ScienceData Formatter , ? said Preston Burch , NASA ?s Hubble program manager at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. ?
And we won?t until we bring itdown to the ground .?
Spare inhand
NASA doeshave a spare unit at Goddard , but will have to put it through a series of teststo ensure it is in good health .
Burch saidthat there is high confidence that the spare box , which is relatively brand newdespite being 18 years old , is viable for the Hubble repair .
But the testsrequired to prove its spaceworthiness will take months .
? I think we ? dbe hard - pressed to be ready any earlier than , say , January , ?
Burch said , addingthat even mid-January could be a bit of a stretch .
?
It ?s looking more like a mid-Februarytimeframe is the right time for us .?
Replacingthe 136 - pound ( 62 - kg ) data formatter box should be relatively straightforward forAtlantis ?s crew , requiring about two hours during one of the mission ?s fiveback - to - back spacewalks to perform , Burch said .
One cable connector and 10 bolts need to be freed to remove the box from its mount , he added .
Commandedby veteran spaceflyer Scott Altman , Atlantis astronauts plan to install a newcamera , replace gyroscopes and batteries , upgrade Hubble ?s guidance equipmentand add a docking ring during their 11 - day mission .
Tricky repairs toinstruments never designed to be fixed in space are also on tap .
The missionwill mark NASA ?s fifth and finalshuttle flight to Hubble .
Theastronauts were in the middle of an intense simulation on Monday when news ofthe delay broke , Shannon said .
NASA hasnot formally set a new launch target , though the agency has called off aplanned flight readiness review that would have done so at the end of thisweek .
In the off chance that the spare data formatter fails to pass muster , Atlantis could be primed to launch toward Hubble as early as late November .
Shannonsaid that by the end of next week , shuttle mission managers should have abetter sense of what Atlantis ?
launch target will be .
A luckyfailure
For everymonth NASA delays Atlantis ?
flight to Hubble , it adds an extra $ 10 million tothe space telescope program ?s cost .
But , mission managers said , the cost couldhave been much higher .
? Thinkabout if this failure had occurred two weeks after the servicing mission .
We ? djust put to brand new instruments in and thought we ?d extended the life fromfive to 10 years and this thing failed after thelast shuttle mission to Hubble , ? said Ed Weiler , NASA ?s associate administratorfor science missions .
?
We could have lost the mission in six , 12 , 18 months .
? So in somesense , if this had to happen it could n?t have happened at a better time , ? headded .
Atlantis ? planned
October flight was slated to mark NASA ?s fourth of up to five shuttlemissions planned for this year .
The mission was initially slated to launch inearly October , but slipped several days due to a series of setbacks caused byHurricane Ike and payload delivery issues .
The agencylaunched three shuttle flights earlier this year to continue construction ofthe International Space Station , with the Endeavour orbiter slated to continue thatwork with a planned Nov. 16 liftoff .
Shannon said that if Atlantis ?
missionslips into 2009 for sure , NASA will prepare Endeavour for its ownSTS - 126 mission to deliver new life support and other equipment that willallow the station to double its current three - astronaut crew size .
Meanwhile , NASA engineers at Goddard and their shuttle mission counterparts will work togetherto determine the best repair plan for Hubble .
It was a similar effort , missionmanagers said , that allowed astronauts to fix Hubble ?s blurry vision in spaceafter a mirror defect nearly doomed the space telescope in the early 1990s .
? Hubble hasa habit of coming back from adversity , ? said Weiler , adding that the Hubble andspace shuttle team ? works miracles .?
? I ? m not too concerned about this , we ? llfind a way to get this fixed .
Luckily , we have a spare .?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Army is establishing a suicide prevention board to examine the mental health of its recruiters around the country after the fourth suicide in three years by Houston , Texas - based recruiters , according to Army officials .
The Army Recruiting Command is examining recruiters all over the country for job - related and combat - related stress .
The board will look at how to handle the high - stress climate facing recruiters who may be both under pressure from their job and victims of post - combat deployment stress , according to Douglas Smith , a spokesman from the U.S. Army Recruiting command .
" The United States Army Recruiting Command is deeply concerned by the instances of suicide within the Houston Recruiting Battalion , " said a statement released by the Recruiting Command .
" The board 's objective will be to prevent future suicides , increase suicide awareness , analyze trends and highlight additional tools and resources to combat suicide within the Recruiting Command . "
The Army 's examination comes after a sergeant first class , a member of the Houston Recruiting Battalion and an Iraq combat veteran , killed himself at his home earlier this month .
CNN has chosen not to name any of the recruiters .
The sergeant 's was the second suicide within the ranks of the battalion within weeks , Army officials said .
In August , a staff sergeant , a combat veteran in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , also killed himself .
Another Houston recruiter killed himself in 2007 and a yet another in 2005 , Army records show .
The Army Recruiting Command is sending a team -- including a chaplain and a psychologist -- to assist the Houston recruiters .
The team was scheduled to show up in mid-September , but because of the severe hurricane damage the arrival was delayed until October , officials said .
A chaplain from Army Recruiting Command in Fort Knox , Kentucky , was sent to be with the battalion shortly after the latest victim 's death , Smith said .
He said recruiters receive annual suicide prevention training , and commanders have additional tools to help their soldiers cope .
The members of the Houston battalion received their last training in December 2007 , according to an Army statement .
The Army Recruiting Command is examining recruiters all over the country for both job - related and combat - related stress problems , but is giving special attention to the Houston battalion at the moment , according to Smith .
" We do not have any other circumstances with our recruiters around the country like we do with the Houston unit , " he said .
The deaths of the two recruiters this year also caught the eye of U.S. Sen .
John Cornyn from Texas .
Cornyn wrote a letter to Army Secretary Pete Geren this month about the suicide rate in the battalion .
" Due to the recurring deployments that have proven necessary to sustain operations in the Middle East , it is likely that a large majority of our recruiters are also veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " he wrote .
" Many of our military recruiters work in recruiting offices and facilities remote from the military installations at which their fellow soldiers serve .
As such , many of them lack the same access to peer support networks and important services for dealing with stress , anxiety , PTSD and other conditions that may directly result from their prior combat service , " he said .
A veteran 's advocacy group says Houston has one of the top recruiting operations in the United States but there is a good deal of stress in bringing in new recruits when the Army is stretched .
" The suicides in the Houston battalion are a very loud , very bright alarm that Army officials and politicians can't afford to ignore , " said Paul Sullivan , executive director of Veterans for Common Sense .
While recruiting among all of the services has been on target for more than a year , the stress levels on recruiters to bring in new service members can be crushing with extended hours and , many times , six - or seven - day work weeks .
Army officials said Cornyn was correct in saying one of the problems for recruiters is they work in locations often far from bases where they can get the mental health help that is readily available to other troops .
With the United States at war for the past seven years , the vast majority of recruiters have combat experience , Smith said .
The recruiter suicides come at a time when the total number of suicides in the Army 's ranks has been growing , Army officials said .
Through August there had been 93 active duty suicides in the Army .
Last year there were 115 active duty suicides , the highest for the Army since the Vietnam War , according to Army statistics .

ONE OF Osama bin Laden 's many half - brothers , Tarek bin Laden , this week signed a deal with tiny Djibouti which may — or may not — mark the start of one of the world 's boldest engineering projects .
Djibouti's president , Ismael Omar Guelleh , promised Mr bin Laden 500 sq km ( 193 sq miles ) of land to start building Noor City , the first of a hundred “ Cities of Light ” the vast Saudi Binladen Group plans around the world .
“ A hope for all humanity , the first environmental city of the 21st century , ” gushed the promotional video at the signing .
The audience , mostly American military contractors near retirement age , clapped enthusiastically .
Engineers elsewhere say the scheme is a fantasy .
Mr bin Laden , his sons , and their front man , Muhammad Ahmed al - Ahmed , a Saudi former shipping executive , say they have already invested “ hundreds of millions of dollars ” in a plan to build cities on either side of the Bab al - Mandib ( Gate of Tears ) strait at the foot of the Red Sea .
Construction is supposed to begin next year , after the terms of sovereignty for the tax - free metropolises have been agreed .
By 2025 , says Mr Ahmed , Djibouti's Noor City will have 2.5 m people and its Yemeni twin 4.5 m .
Several million jobs will be created .
An airport serving both cities will , he says , attract 100 m passengers a year .
A 29 km bridge across the strait will connect Arabia and Africa by road , rail and pipelines , its towers among the tallest on earth .
The cost ?
A mere $ 200 billion or so .
Yet oddly , aside from Djibouti's , no African government officials were to be seen , no architect , no technical adviser to explain how the cities could run on renewable energy , and barely an engineer .
None of the Noor City delegation noted that blazing hot Djibouti , with 800,000 people , is already acutely short of water and imports nearly all its food , that 150,000 of its people are “ facing imminent starvation ” , according to the UN's World Food Programme , and that millions more are famished in next - door Ethiopia .
Mr Ahmed also brushed aside any worry about instability in Yemen , where an al - Qaeda suicide bombing on July 26th targeted the country 's police .
Yet at the last moment Yemen 's government refused visas to journalists travelling with Mr bin Laden .
Mr Ahmed has worked for DynCorp , an American military contractor .
So had one of the project 's main managers , Michel Vachon , before moving to L3 Communications , a contractor often employed by the American government .
Another manager , Dean Kershaw , spent 29 years in America 's forces ; some others had served in the Bush administration .
Armed American special - forces veterans now apparently employed as security guards by L3 chaperoned journalists .
All part of an American plan to help secure the Suez shipping lane or to strengthen the hand of friendly forces in Yemen ?
“ Absolutely not , ” said Mr Kershaw .
“ The [ American ] government has vetted us , but they 're not behind us . ”
Whatever the reality , the presence of arms manufacturers in the consortium , including Allied Defense Systems and Lockheed Martin , will fuel conspiracy theories among Arabs .
Mr Ahmed says investors in Djibouti's Noor City have the chance to “ be part of modern humanity ” by creating the “ financial , educational , and medical hub of Africa ” .
Africans may wonder why the hub is not being built in a bit of Africa where more Africans live and which has food and water .
Unlike the Gulf States , which financed most of their development from oil revenue , Djibouti and Yemen are too poor to provide more than scrubland .
Mr Ahmed says his firm will finance a new railway through Yemen to connect the new cities with Dubai .
He is vaguer about Africa , where a motorway and railway would have to be built to Addis Ababa , Ethiopia 's capital , and on to Kenya 's Nairobi and Sudan 's Khartoum , if it is really to help perk up the continent 's economy .
A huge ancient lake once dammed up by the vast ice sheets of the last Ice Age has been found by geologists in Russia .
Large glacial lakes were known to cover parts of Russia and North America during the Ice Age .
One of the most well - known is Lake Agassiz , which covered portions of Canada and northern Minnesota more than 10,000 years ago .
At the time it was the largest freshwater lake on the planet , with an area larger than all of the present - day Great Lakes combined , larger even than California .
Last year , geologists found the remnants of a lake near a Russian village called UstNem .
Now , the same lake has been found to extend 435 to 497 miles ( 700 to 800 kilometers ) to the west , near another village called Kotlas .
By comparison , Lake Superior , the largest of the Great Lakes , is 350 miles ( 560 km ) long at its greatest length .
The ancient lake — no longer a lake — is just a few tens of kilometers away from the Ural Mountains .
Geologists are taking samples of sediments to shed light on the history of this and other glacial lakes that formed in the region .
" We 're trying to find out just what these lakes have looked like , " said Eiliv Larsen , a geologist with the Geological Survey of Norway .
" Where did the sediments come from and how did the lakes influence the environment and the climate in the region ? "
Lake Agassiz is thought to have possibly influenced the North Atlantic climate when it suddenly drained into what is now Hudson Bay , potentially raising sea levels and altering the ocean circulation .
The Russian lake could have had similar consequences when the ice hemming it in finally melted and the lake 's freshwater potentially poured into the Arctic Ocean .
Geologists studying the area as part of the International Polar Year effort have found evidence of the surrounding ice .
" We 're finding traces of the snout of a glacier that calved into the lake from the north , " Larsen said .
" This probably took place around 20,000 years ago and this was the youngest lake in the region . "
Larsen and his colleagues are also finding traces of older glacial lakes .
" Lakes have probably been situated here in two periods during the last Ice Age , " he said .
" We 've found river delta deposits which suggest that the oldest lake formed some 65,000 years ago . "
These lakes can also leave an imprint on the surrounding land : Lake Agassiz left remnant lakes behind , and the land it once covered is still rebounding from the lost weight of the water pressing down .

HOUSTON 
In a case that has drawn international attention , Texas executed José E. Medellín on Tuesday night in defiance of an international court ruling and despite pleas from the Bush administration for a new hearing .
The execution came just before 10 p.m. Central time , shortly after the United States Supreme Court denied a last request for a reprieve .
Protesters for and against the death penalty clamored in the rain outside the Huntsville Unit , about 70 miles north of Houston , where Mr. Medellín was executed by lethal injection .
“ I ’m sorry my actions caused you pain , ” he said to the witnesses present .
“ I hope this brings you the closure that you seek .
Never harbor hate . ”
Gov. Rick Perry , a Republican , rejected calls from Mexico and Washington to delay the execution , citing the torture , rape and strangulation of two teenage girls in Houston 15 years ago as just cause for the death penalty .

The federal budget deficit is reaching record levels , according to estimates .
Here , copies of fiscal 2009 federal budget are seen at the Government Printing Office bookstore in Washington on Feb .
4 . WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The federal government will run a near - record deficit of $ 407 billion this year , according to the latest Capitol Hill estimates .
The Congressional Budget Office released figures Tuesday that indicate the red ink will spill over into next year , when the deficit would reach a record $ 438 billion — and could go even higher as the government takes over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The worsening deficit is largely due to continuing weakness in the economy , high energy and food prices , and the slump in the housing and financial markets , the CBO said .
And the economy could still slide into a recession , according to the forecast .
" The economy is likely to experience at least several more months of very slow growth , " the new report said .
" Whether this period will ultimately be designated a recession or not is still uncertain , but the increase in the unemployment rate and the pace of economic growth are similar to conditions during previous periods of mild recession . "

The CBO predicts that the economy will grow 1.5 % this year in real terms and slip to just 1.1 % growth in 2009 .
The nonpartisan agency , which makes economic and budget estimates for Congress , also sees unemployment averaging 6.2 % next year .
The CBO figures for this fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 , are slightly worse than the White House predictions released in July .
The White House foresees a $ 389 billion deficit for 2008 , growing to $ 482 billion in 2009 .
If Congress fixes the alternative minimum tax , or AMT , next year 's deficit could rise another $ 60 billion or so .
And Democratic efforts to pass a second economic stimulus bill to follow the tax rebate checks sent out earlier this year would add another $ 50 billion or so to next year 's deficit .
The White House and congressional Republicans are resisting the move and instead want Congress to pass other pieces of legislation , such as free trade agreements with Panama , Colombia and South Korea , to help the economy .
" We 're not talking about a stimulus package , " White House Press Secretary Dana Perino told reporters .
The new $ 400 billion - plus deficit numbers represent about 3 % of the economy , which is the deficit measure seen as most relevant by economists .
That 's considerably smaller than the deficits of the 1980s and early 1990s , when Congress and earlier administrations cobbled together politically painful deficit - reduction packages .
In dollar terms , the record is the $ 413 billion deficit recorded in 2004 .
Still , the new dollar figures are so eye - popping that they may restrain the appetite of the next president , who takes office Jan. 20 , from adding expensive spending programs or new tax cuts .
Pressure may build to allow some tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 to expire as scheduled at the end of 2010 , with Congress also feeling pressure to curb spending growth .
The deficit for 2007 totaled $ 161.5 billion , the lowest number since an imbalance of $ 159 billion in 2002 .
The 2002 performance marked the first budget deficit after four consecutive years of budget surpluses .
" Today 's estimates provide the latest evidence of the fiscal legacy of Republican policies : record deficits and a weak economy , " said House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt Jr. , D - S.C .
" It 's another reminder of the dismal economy and budget that Republicans are leaving others to sort out . "
Under the promises of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and Republican nominee John McCain — who both say they want to extend most of the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 at the urging of President Bush — the deficit is likely to remain high .
Even if all the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire at the end of 2010 , the budget would still run a considerable deficit of $ 325 billion in the following year , CBO says .
The cost of extending the Bush tax cuts and other expiring pieces of the tax code , along with making sure the AMT does n't trap more and more middle class families , would reach more than $ 400 billion a year by 2012 , CBO says .
Budget deficits tend to bounce around , and the CBO 's long term projections likely inflate the cost of ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The agency follows its rules to assume current war costs —
Congress approved $ 186 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan for this budget year — continue indefinitely .
The agency 's latest estimate of total appropriations since 2001 to fight terrorism and for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is $ 858 billion .

I 've been playing with RabbitMQ over the last couple of days .
I 've found that the reports of AMQP being a pain in the ass to get started with a right on the mark .
py - amqplib was quite good , although when I useand a callback , it seems to use a lot of CPU and I can only handle about 170 msgs / sec ( which remains fairly constant as I add processes - i.e. two processes can do ~ 85 msgs / sec each ) .
Withit never gets far above 20 msgs / sec but does n't use much CPU - I guess it spends most of its time waiting for data .
I gave the QPid Python library a go after that and could n't getto work , butwas all right .
Forking off 20 worker processes and getting them to poll with basic_get , it would handle about 300 msgs / sec easily ( with the generator and RabbitMQ , on the same machine , each using 20 - 30 % CPU ) .
Each worker sat at around 3 % CPU .
Trying again with py - amqplib , the worker processes used about 9 % CPU each ( with the same throughput ) .
So if you 're looking for higher performance but do n't mind battling through the complete lack of documentation , QPid appears to be the way to go .
Here 's some working receiver code : That said , 300 messages per second is not very fast ; I think I 've read somewhere that RabbitMQ performance for a non-durable queue ( with client and server in C ) should be somewhere in the tens of thousands of messages per second per CPU ( ~400 k per second on a 16 - core box ) .
I assume I 'm doing something wrong somewhere ...
Ben Hood contacted me and pointed to RabbitMQ's SimplePerformanceTests page , which apparently have typical performance several orders of magnitude higher than my results here .
I 'll give these a go and hopefully see what 's wrong with my own attempt .

Senator Barack Obama is in Iraq for consultations with American military commanders and Iraqi leaders .
Despite all the talk about Iraq being “ calm , ” I ’d like to point out that the month just before the last visit Barack Obama made to Iraq ( he went in January , 2006 ) , there were 537 civilian and ISF Iraqi casualties .
In June of this year , 2008 , there were 554 according to AP .
These are official statistics gathered passively that probably only capture about 10 percent of the true toll .
That is , the Iraqi death toll is actually still worse now than the last time Obama was in Iraq !
( See the bombings and shootings listed below for Sunday ) .
The hype around last year ’s troop escalation obscures a simple fact : that Obama formed his views about the need for the US to leave Iraq at a time when its security situation was very similar to what it is now !
Why a return to the bad situation in late 05 and early 06 should be greeted by the GOP as the veritable coming of the Messiah is beyond me .
You have people like Joe Lieberman saying silly things like if it were n’t for the troop escalation , Obama would n’t be able to visit Iraq .
Uh , he visited it before the troop escalation , just fine .
The troop escalation , which actually allowed the ethnic cleansing of the Sunnis of Baghdad and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis from the country , has largely been pushed as propaganda by the White House and the AEI .
Here ’s an example of how their propaganda works .
As is usual with news it does not like , the Bush administration attempted to muddy the waters this weekend regarding the interview of PM Nuri al - Maliki with Der Spiegel in which he expressed approval of Barack Obama ’s plan to get US troops out of Iraq within 16 months of next January .
Al - Maliki told Der Spiegel in response to a question about how long US troops would be in his country ,
‘ Maliki :
As soon as possible , as far as we ’re concerned .
U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes .
SPIEGEL : Is this an endorsement for the US presidential election in November ?
Does Obama , who has no military background , ultimately have a better understanding of Iraq than war hero John McCain ?
Maliki :
Those who operate on the premise of short time periods in Iraq today are being more realistic .
Artificially prolonging the tenure of US troops in Iraq would cause problems .
Of course , this is by no means an election endorsement .
Who they choose as their president is the Americans ’ business .
But it ’s the business of Iraqis to say what they want . ‘
Ali al - Dabbagh , who is usually described as al - Maliki ’s spokesman but actually seems to work for the CENTCOM or Pentagon Middle East command , was trotted out to make vague statements about Der Spiegel ’s having mistranslated or misinterpreted what al - Maliki said .
This denial was issued through CENTCOM !
When the original demand came from al - Maliki for a timetable for US withdrawal , it was al - Dabbagh who reinterpreted it as a ‘ time horizon . ’
Al - Dabbagh was contradicted by National Security Counsellor Muwaffaq al - Rubaie , who seems actually closer in this thinking to al - Maliki .
My guess is that al - Dabbagh has been recruited by some agency in Washington , DC , to explain away al - Maliki ’s statements whenever they contradict Bush’s .
Der Spiegel stood by its story .
The text of Der Spiegel ’s statement is here .
It turns out that the translator involved works for al - Maliki , not for Der Spiegel , and so presumably knew what the prime minister ’s words meant in Arabic .
And for the piece de resistance , it turns out that Der Spiegel has an audiotape of the Arabic of the interview , which they leaked to The New York Times .
Sabrina Tavernise and Jeff Zeleny write :
‘ But the interpreter for the interview works for Mr. Maliki ’s office , not the magazine .
. .
The following is a direct translation from the Arabic of Mr. Maliki ’s comments by The Times : “ Obama ’s remarks that — if he takes office — in 16 months he would withdraw the forces , we think that this period could increase or decrease a little , but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in Iraq . ”
He continued : “ Who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in Iraq . ” ‘
But you see , it does not matter that al - Maliki actually said what he said .
It does not matter that Der Spiegel can prove it .
All that matters is that the Goebbelses around Bush and Cheney have managed to muddy the waters and produce doubt , taking the hard edge off the interview .
Even AFP , the usually skeptical French wire service , asserted that al - Maliki had “ denied ” the accuracy of the Der Spiegel interview !
Of course , al - Maliki has done no such thing .
CENTCOM ventriloquising al - Dabbagh engaged in the denial , and a very vague one at that .
That is the way propaganda works , to obscure the truth and ensure it can be denied .
Some wingnut even tried to pressure me to retract the little sentence I had written on the affair yesterday , on the grounds of “ al - Dabbagh ’s ” mendacious and ridiculous assertions .
Our information system is so corrupt and easily manipulated that even a clumsy ploy can obscure the truth and bully the journalists .
Aljazeera International reports on the conflict between Obama and McCain on a timetable for US troop withdrawals from Iraq .
Over the weekend , the Sunni fundamentalist Iraqi Accord Front rejoined the al - Maliki government .
It had left last summer over accusations that al - Maliki ignored Sunni sensitivities , refused to speak to his vice president , Tariq al - Hashimi , coddled Shiite militias that ethnically cleansed Sunnis , and kept tens of thousands of Sunnis in prison without charges or due process .
As Xinhua notes , al - Hashimi ’s Iraqi Islamic Party , one of three components of the Iraqi Accord Front coalition of Sunni parties , will face great competition in the provincial elections from the US - created Awakening Councils , which are paid and armed by the US military .
Speaking of this fall ’s provincial elections , the country ’s elections commission announced Sunday that they might have to be postponed , given that Parliament has still not passed the enabling legislation .
The election law is mired in debates over the mixed province of Kirkuk in the north , and whether it should hold provincial elections along with the other provinces .
The province is claimed by the Kurdistan Regional Government , which wants to annex it , even though the Turkmen and Arab populations do not want to join semi-autonomous Kurdistan ( where the state schools are no longer Arabophone ) .
Al - Zaman writing in Arabic says that the new date has been set as December 22 .
It is official :
The provincial elections in Iraq will not occur in time to affect the US presidential race .
E.g. , if the Sadrists sweep to power in many Shiite provinces , that could have been a factor in the US polls .
Not going to happen .
A new airport , funded in important part by Iran has opened at the Shiite holy city of Najaf .
It will likely bring millions of pilgrims from Iran , Pakistan , India and elsewhere to the shrine of Imam Ali , the son - in - law and cousin of the Prophet Muhammad .
American authorities worried about Iranians in Iraq may as well just lay back ; with millions going in and out , tracking them is going to be rather difficult .

McClatchy reports political violence in Iraq on Sunday :
Cambodian shoppers search through rodent meat at a market northwest of Phnom Penh in a file photo .
REUTERS / Chor Sokunthea
PHNOM PENH ( Reuters ) -
The price of rat meat has quadrupled in Cambodia this year as inflation has put other meat beyond the reach of poor people , officials said on Wednesday .
With consumer price inflation at 37 percent according to the latest central bank estimate , demand has pushed a kilogram of rat meat up to around 5,000 riel ( $ 1.28 ) from 1,200 riel last year .
Spicy field rat dishes with garlic thrown in have become particularly popular at a time when beef costs 20,000 riel a kg .
Officials said rats were fleeing to higher ground from flooded areas of the lower Mekong Delta , making it easier for villagers to catch them .
“ Many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets , but they keep some for their family , ” Ly Marong , an agriculture official , said by telephone from the Koh Thom district on the border with Vietnam .
“ Not only are our poor eating it , but there is also demand from Vietnamese living on the border with us . ”
He estimated that Cambodia supplied more than a tonne of live rats a day to Vietnam .
Rats are also eaten widely in Thailand , while a state government in eastern India this month encouraged its people to eat rats in an effort to battle soaring food prices and save grain stocks .
( $ 1 = 3,900 riel )
N.F.L. Salaries : Believe in the Blind Side
I just recently got around to reading Michael Lewis ‘s immensely entertaining book The Blind Side , even though it has been out for a few years now .
The book highlights how N.F.L. teams only slowly became aware of the immensely important role that offensive left tackles play in protecting the quarterback from blind - side hits .
Although there is brief mention in the book that left tackle is the second highest - paid position after quarterback , it is a popular book and thus light on formal statistics .
Curious about the numbers , I put one of my loyal assistants Trevor Gallen on the problem , and here is what he reports back after crunching the numbers for every player in the starting lineup for the first game of the 2007 - 8 season :
1 ) As Michael Lewis argued , starting left tackles are indeed paid more on average than any other position on the field except for quarterbacks .
The average starting quarterback makes about $ 5 million a year .
The average starting left tackle gets $ 4 million .
Defensive linemen and wide receivers also do pretty well .
2 ) There are n’t enough left - handed quarterbacks to do a rigorous analysis , but the blind - side theory is supported by the sparse data that exist on lefty quarterbacks .
On those teams , right tackles tend to get paid much more than left tackles .
Overall , the median blind - side tackles get paid over twice as much as the median non -blind - side tackles .
3 ) Punters and kickers make the least money — then safeties .
4 ) Perhaps the biggest surprise to me is how little running backs make .
They are down toward the bottom of the list ; I would guess that the wear and tear they face tends to shorten their careers , so they have fewer years over which to earn .
( Note : there are various ways to tally up N.F.L. salaries ;
Trevor used as the salary how much a player counts against the salary cap . )
HONG KONG  Many Chinese have been expecting a post -Olympics economic slowdown , but it has already started and the Games have not even begun .
Chinese factories reported a plunge in new orders last month .
Exports are barely growing .
The real estate market is weakening , with apartment prices sinking in southeastern China , the region hardest hit by economic troubles .
The trends , which actually have little to do with the Olympics ( the Games themselves , which open Friday , are small compared with the size of the economy ) , are being felt worldwide .
China ’s slowing growth is one reason that gasoline prices have fallen in the United States , for example .
Similarly , world prices for metals like copper , tin , zinc and aluminum have tumbled in the last several weeks , as voracious Chinese factories have closed , or cut back their consumption .

Wow , Pelosi is such a scum bag .
I understand that it would be innapropriate to try to impeach Bush and his Junta while the 're still in office .
Pardons for all !
OK , wait until they are out of office .
Then they all are delivered to The Hague .
Pelosi states - " I preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism , " Pelosi said .
Prior to her appearance in West Los Angeles Monday evening , CNN ’s Larry King interviewed Pelosi .
She told King she was willing to drop her staunch opposition to offshore drilling and would likely allow the House to vote on the issue .
Is that not a Democratic scum bag ?
But Pelosi ’s comments appeared disingenuous to many , since she was largely responsible for crafting an appropriations bill in backroom discussions with House Democratic leaders , passed in June , and then worked secretly with the White House budget director offering up concessions on Iraq war benchmarks if Bush would agree to the domestic spending attached to the final bill with little debate preceding a vote on the measure .
In fact , since the electoral victories in November 2006 , the Democratic - controlled Congress has approved more than $ 300 billion in emergency spending bills for Iraq and Afghanistan without the benchmarks or withdrawal timetables that Pelosi and other leaders said they would demand .
So .
As Pelosi was campaigning she stated she would cut off funding for the war .
What did she really do ?
In fact , since the electoral victories in November 2006 , the Democratic - controlled Congress has approved more than $ 300 billion in emergency spending bills for Iraq and Afghanistan without the benchmarks or withdrawal timetables that Pelosi and other leaders said they would demand .
She 's a liar .
" I take an oath of office to uphold the constitution of the United States and do n't tell me that I do n't do that , ” Pelosi said , using hand gestures to emphasize her disdain over the impeachment demands .
" Why do n't you go picket the Republicans in Congress that will not allow us to have a vote on the war .
This is not very effective .
Not very effective . "
Yet she does n't uphold The Constitution .
Again she 's a liar !
" As Speaker of the house , the third highest office , first is the president , then vice president , and then Speaker , I take my responsibilities deadly seriously , ” Pelosi said .
“ I try to promote bipartisanship but that 's not what the other side wants . "
I must state that it does n't matter what office you hold in the US Government if you 're going to use that office to lie to the American people you 're still a piece of shit !

Forget sending money to Obama .. Send money to Cindy Sheehan ... no matter where you live .
Besides financially supporting election integrity and independent media , financially supporting the removal of Pelosi and as many Democratic traitors as possible from office are important steps we must take in order to send a clear message we intend to take our country back .
Since Cindy 's election is in California , we have a better chance of avoiding election fraud .
The money I might have sent Obama before his FISA vote .. will go to Cindy .
She 's earned it !!

We do need more of this type of heat put on Pelosi and other republican democrats .
But we also need to support Cindy in her challenge to defeat these Pelosi .
Democrat leaders like Pelosi are taking the core voters of their party for granted and expect them to put up with their corruption and arrogants .
Pelosi's lies are becoming more often and more arrogant as time goes by .
What is really arrogant is the lies she states like she has not seen a crime yet and expect us to swallow it ..
We need Pelsoi , the Blue Dogs , Schumer , Dianne Feinstein and other non democratic leader voted out of office in the democratic primary elections .

She caves on everything .

I 'm a 45 year old progressive Independent and I think that the state of the nation is as much a result of Democrats as Republicans .
Nancy Pelosi is , without doubt , the worst Speaker of the House in my lifetime .
I did not necessarily like some of her predeccesors , like Newt Gingrich , but THEY were leaders .
She lacks integrity .
She is shrill AND she is a Bush / Cheney enabler .
The absolute worst and I shudder at the thought of her being 3rd in line to the presidency .

i am SO dissapointed with ms pelosi .
i remember how much work ( and money ) i expended to help get democrats elected in '06 and i remember the sense of triumph when she was made speaker of the house .
to see how far removed from the reality of the situation she is is heartbreaking to me .
the poll numbers are low becasue pelosi and some of the remaining dlc'ers are STILL pushing this neocon - lite gop rove - style crap which we begged to be away from .
its a sad day for this country .
for the first time , i really do believe that ms pelosi needs to be thrown out of office , along with the rest of them .
did cindy sheehan ever get on the ballot ?
after bush is gone , i will make it my life 's work to rid our government of these criminals and their enablers .
these turncoat democrats who think they 're going to get away with more business as usual .
if the current crop of republican criminals ( bush , cheney , rove , etc ) are allowed to go free with NO repurcussions , there will be HELL to pay .
i hope somebody is able to communicate this to ms pelosi and her cohorts .

It is almost certain that there will be solid , perhaps veto proof , Democratic majorities in the House and Senate .
That ought to be more than sufficient to accomplish everything .
But , what have we just witnessed with Obama , Pelosi , Hoyer , Reid , Dean , Brazile , et al . ?
Cowardice , duplicity , treason , ... --- from taking impeachment off the table , to forsaking promises on important issues , to undermining The Constitution in ways more severe than all of Bushit 's signing statements .
A sharp stick in the eye is the only thing this Democratic Party will understand .
Too bad it had to come to this .

I do n't understand why Pelosi ( and the other coconspirators , but particularly Pelosi ) has n't gotten more heat from Americans .
Did n't she show up at the Kos convention or some other lefty confab to a warm welcome ?
On The View , she gets hit with one hard question by Joy Behar and is allowed to skate away with a BS answer .
No reaction from the audience .
In her home district there 's been no campaign to recall her that I 've heard about .
Obviously there 's a lot of us who are infuriated , but how small a minority are we ?
I 'd like to know so I know how many of us there are to retake our government .

We gave the Democrats a fucking chance in 2006 .
They showed us , with the exception of Kucinich and a few others , that they are just as worthless as the Republicans .
The Bush administration is now a bulletproof crime syndicate .
They own all the Republicans except for Paul and most of the Democrats including Schumer and Feinstein .
They own Mukasey the Department of Justice .
They own the Supreme Court .
They own the State Department .
They own the media .
They own the ISPs .
They own the telecoms .
They own the military .
They own it all .
If you think Obama is going to be able to change this bullshit , you are kidding yourselves .
They already own him .
He flopped on FISA and retroactive telecom immunity .
He flopped on faith based bullshit initiatives .
He has Zbignew Brzezinski , Mr. CFR , as his foreign policy advisor .
Obama may look better and talk the talk , but he has shown what he is all about .
You see , you do n't get to be president unless you fellate the power elite .
This country needs to wake up and realize that the solution does not lie in elections .
They are all rigged .
Unless people get fed up enough to take some risks , there will never be any significant changes .
Fuck this bullshit .
And wake the fuck up about 911 too .
It was clearly a false flag psyop perpetrated by the Cheney Bush Crime Cabal .

" I preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism , " Pelosi said .
*****
Then why are there so many representatives under investigation , indicted , or convicted for corruption ?
Nancy , you do n't get out much do you .
I 'll put up my colleagues at the Biophysical Society over your Congress any day .
Why are over $ 5 million per year spent by lobbyists on each representative ?
Corporations do n't spend that amount of money unless the return is phenomenal .
It is well known that there is no better " investment " than lobbying .
The collective amount of money donated to the campaigns of each rep by ordinary people do n't come close to $ 5 mil .
My point .
The three most important things to accomplish to turn this political nightmare around are
(1) Fair elections - as advocated here .
( How have we allowed corporations to count our vote ? )
(2) Clean Money election campaigns - the people must pay for and " own " their representatives .
(3) The outlawing of any " gifts " to representatives .
In other words , we must go back to the time when it was illegal for corporations to involve themselves directly in the political process .

The Democrats need their own " October Surprise " --- a progressive counterpart this election year .
I say make it putting impeachment on the table !
What a surprise it would be to start impeachment hearings even that late --- letting the world know that Americans recognize that the Bush Crimes are serious and unacceptable !
Excuse me .
I must have fallen asleep and dreamed that notion in the preceding paragraphs .
Nancy Pelosi started out with such promise , surrounded at the podium by children and all .
And then something happened and she forgot the kids and continued to give Bush money --- so much money --- it seems impossible it went for anything having to do with our troops ( who are still responsible for many of their own necessities ( " send me some more socks and underwear PLEASE , and a flashlight " ) ) , not to mention that the so - called reconstruction of Iraq has bypassed water , electric grid , and sewer system repair and has succeeded only in putting up concrete slab walls to create ghettos in Baghdad .
For this Nancy has allowed the Bush War Profiteering Appropriations to put the future of American children in hock .
What happened to Nancy Pelosi ?
What made her forget the children ?
I recall she had a White House lunch alone with Bush and Cheney after assuming the Speakership ; did they slip a mickey to her ?
Was she chipped unawares ?
Her behavior is bizarre .
And unacceptable .
Good luck to Cindy Sheehan !
P.S. Thank you for the excellent coverage of this event .

Petition to Remove Nancy Pelosi from the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives Whereas Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , having failed to fulfill her oath of office as a United States Representative from the State of California , to “ protect and defend the Constitution of the United States ” by abusing the power of her office as Speaker of the House to prevent the consideration of Articles of Impeachment – impeachment being the Constitutionally mandated process to hold the Executive accountable for violations of the Constitution , the laws passed by Congress , and international treaties having the force of law under the Constitution , and Whereas Nancy Pelosi , as Minority Leader , prior to the mid-term elections of 2006 , publicly stated that “ Impeachment is off the table ” , a politically partisan strategy designed to avoid activating Republican fears that might have disadvantaged her party ’s candidates in the election , and Whereas Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi continues to obstruct the Constitutionally mandated process of impeachment in furtherance of a politically partisan strategy designed , as she has repeatedly stated - to pass the Democratic Party ’s legislative agenda in preference to fulfilling her Oath of Office to “ protect and defend the Constitution of the United States ” , and Whereas Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi ’s continued use of the power of her office to compel other Democrats - Members of the House of Representatives - to withhold their support for impeachment , in violation of their oaths of office , corrupts the most basic functions of the separation of powers designed by the framers and set down in our Constitution , Therefore : we , the undersigned concerned citizens urge the Democratic Party to take action to the end that Nancy Pelosi be removed from the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives and sanctioned for her obstruction of the Constitutionally mandated investigations and impeachment proceedings occasioned by the many credible and well documented allegations against George W. Bush and Richard “ Dick ” Cheney .
Further : we pledge to withhold financial support for any candidate , office holder , or organization such as the DSCC , DCCC , or DNC seen to be failing in their responsibility to the Constitution in calling for immediate investigations into the actions of George W. Bush and Richard Cheney leading to the possible filing of articles of impeachment .
Madam Speaker !!
The Constitution , Your Oath of Office , Principle , The Rule of Law - All trump “ party loyalty ” and “ bi-partisan Agendas ” .
Here are the Bush crimes : FISA
Act violations , Torture Code violations , fraudulent case for Iraq War ( Title 18 US Code § 371 ) .
Answer Joy Behar ’s question .
It is our question as well !

Actually , I find BRADBLOG to be one of the more cogent blogs on the 'net .
SOCRATES may or may not have something to say , but since Brad seems to toe the Progressive line fairly well , I think it 's as unfair to complain about HIS friends , ( even if true ) , as it is to fail to complain about Nancy 's fascist friend Felix Rohatyn , and McCain and Lieberman 's friends in Organized Crime .
Google works well for ALL sides of the argument ; if you do n't believe it , just Google McCain +
Organized Crime , or Rohatyn + Pinochet .
ANYONE who votes for McCain is voting AGAINST any decent future for the Nation .
If you simply cannot think of voting for a black , then vote for Bob Barr .
Remember , he was the stalwart defender of the Constitution who thought any lie was an impeachable offense , even one concerning consensual illicit sex , which is a LOT more reprehensible than lying a Nation into war ( ? ) actually not - BARR ( A Republican ! ) would like to see Bush impeached .
I have my own remedy - true , it has done no good , but every time I get a begging letter from the Democrats , ( I " ve been one for seventy years ! )
I write them , using THEIR postage - paid envelope , " WHEN articles of impeachment against Dick Cheney are published , ask me again .
I am not contributing to a Party that does not support the Constitution . "
Of course , it does no good , but at least I do n't waste my money , and someone may even undersstand , someday .

Pelosi is a Traitor To Her Oath Of Office And To Our Constitution .
All Incumbent Democratic Congressmen who refuse to even hold impeachment hearings are traitors to their oath .
It is time that all all voters and activists used their Power To Force Impeach Hearings .
" As John Dean points out , Bush / Cheney have broken the same laws Nixon did , only Nixon 's actions did not cost the lives of over 4000 brave American men and women " ( and over 30,000 GIs wounded , one Million Iraqis Killed ) .
Bush and Cheney are the most impeachable US executives in American history .
If the Incumbent House Democrats do not hold impeachment hearings soon it will be plain to all that they are Traitors to their Oath Of Office and to Our Constitution .
The failure of the House Democrats to hold Bush and Cheney accountable for the WMD Lies is unforgiveable .
The Democrats lied to us about Stopping The Iraq War in 2006 and then proceeded to fund it thru 2009 .
Even the Democratic Base will not support them in the November election .
No matter what Bush / Cheney Crimes evidence comes out the Incumbent House Democrats will try to ignore it .
It is time for some tough love for Incumbent House Democrats .
How can we make Impeachment Hearings Happen ?
Arrayed against impeachment literally , is nearly the entire Democratic Party establishment as well as most Republican Congressmen .
But the Democrats control Congress and can start Impeachment Hearings with a simple majority vote .
They have the votes .
We just have to make them do it .
Most rank and file Democratic voters want Impeachment but are being ignored by the Democratic Congress .
In addition , many of the so called progressive organizations are also in cahoots with the House Democrat and Pelosi ( such as : MoveOn , ACLU & UFPJ ) and are against impeachment .
It will take a very hard fight to over come this and some real courage on the part of Democratic voters .
MoveOn could cause Impeachment Hearings all by itself but refuses .
UFPJ once said it was for impeachment but refuses to take its 1,400 local activist groups to the street to support impeachment hearings .
Is it lying ?
ACLU ( do n't get me going ) was the primary leader in causing impeachment hearings for President Nixon , but today refuses to do so .
If the hundreds of violations of Our Constitution by Bush and Cheney are so much worse than Nixon ...
Why in Hell is n't ACLU supporting it ?
What underhanded deal have they made with the Incumbent House Democrats and Pelosi ?
In Colorado we have actually been doing negative campaigning against all incumbent Democratic Congressmen who reject impeachment .
We have a Congressman Udall who is running to be a Senator from Colorado .
He supposedly has a liberal background but is moving right as fast as he can .
He avoids all protesters who want to stop the Iraq War funding and who support impeachment .
The difficult aspect is that the Colorado Democratic Party , the Denver Media , and most Colorado Progressive organizations are helping him avoid us , However , we have had contacts from strong Udall supporters and bloggers asking us to back off .
We know we are having an effect on Udall 's Campaign .
The race for the US Senate from Colorado is statistically " too close to call " , so we have a real chance to make a difference here .
We believe that since the race is " so close " that we actually can stop Udall from winning and going to the Senate .
The way we are doing this is by doing " Negative Protesting " at our weekly impeachment events , at all of Udalls public events .
We only have to sway the vote of a very small percentage of voters to keep Udall out of the Senate .
This is doable .
Up until about two weeks ago , the honking at our weekly events had quadrupled since January .
Then we used much " tougher " anti-Udall language on our signs and the honking doubled again .
So much so that the Denver Police came and threatened arrest if we continued to use " honk to impeach " signs and also threatened us with citations for " disturbing the peace " .
A strong indication that we are getting to the Democratic establishment and that the public is with us .
Given that impeachment advocates have worked hard to lobby Congress to hold hearings and have done so for many years with no results , we think it is time for all impeachment advocates to try a different tactic , to get tough with Incumbent House Democrats .
The House Democrats have ignored us for years .
Unless we threaten to un-elect them with negative campaigning they will continue to ignore us .
The only thing they care about is getting re-elected .
Unless Angry Liberal Democrats , Independents , Republicans , Greens and the rest of you get off the couch and carry signs in front of all Incumbent House Democratic Congressmen 's offices with harsh language such as
" UDALL is a Traitor to Our Constitution because he Refuses To impeach " ...
There Will Be No Impeachment and No Accountability .
It is up to you .

Lol Socrates , such a weak attempt at derailing this blog .
Brad 's site has been running for roughly 10 years , most of which I have perused frequently .
Brad is about as anti-conspiratorial as you can get while investigating election integrity issues .
He NEVER claims something without verifying the truth of it and showing to the reader the evidence .
In fact , that 's the entire problem with today 's electronic elections now is n't it ?
Nobody ever can verify the truth of it , because the evidence can be so easily tampered with or simply erased .
Catch a clue , quit being a retard , and unless you 're Karl Rove himself , think about what you have to lose when american citizens lose our constitutional rights because the people who get elected are by - and - large criminals who could n't care one iota about upholding the US Constitution .

It 's not Pelosi 's fault that Republicans prevent the 60 - votes ?
Uhmmm .... what ?!?!
If there was an actual 60 vote rule , as Pelosi claims , then why is it whenever the President wants something , it ALWAYS passes without the 60 votes supposedly needed .
Why is it only when Dems CLAIM to stand for something , but then do n't all vote for it , and then cave and give the PResident 100 % of what he wants , that there is some 60 vote rule ?
Presidents unqualified crony appointments ?
No 60 vote rule .
Presidents warmongering ?
No 60 vote rule .
But somehow , standing up and holding the President accountable requires a 60 vote rule ?
WTF ???
Here is a plan for Pelosi .
Maybe if you want something to get done , you should n't be putting yourself in a position to lose from day one .
Like with telecom immunity , it was the Dems who ignored an excellent bill from their own party in order to pass one written by Dick Cheney .
They claimed to be against " telecom immunity " and yet they ignore a proper bill to pass a bad bill , knowing full well they would never get the 60 voted that are supposedly required to STRIP telecom immunity from the bill .
This is blatant enabling and complacency .
And speaking of telecom immunity and Democratic failure , maybe Pelosi would also like to respond to why it is when Republicans put anonymous holds on important Dem bills , those holds are treated as sacred and unquestionable .
But when a democrat puts a hold on a bill ( ie. telecom immunity ) those holds are completely ignored .
Thanks to so - called " leaders " like Pelosi and Reid , the Democratic party has become nothing but Republican enablers .
And as long as they continue doing what they are doing , Bush Co. and the Republicans will continue damaging the country because they know there will be ZERO repercussions and they know the Dems will go out of their way to light the match they burn the constitution with .

INFORMATION FOR ROSENKRANZ
You wondered why the Democrats refuse to support Democratic ( or Progressive ) causes .
The fact is that there are a lot of Congresscritters who wear the Democrat label , but are NOT Democrats !
First of all , there is the " Democratic Leadership Council , " which , as is well known , is Republican lite .
Then there are the Blue Dogs , who are really Libertarians ( Definition : A Libertarian is a person who dislikes " Governmental Interference " so much that he will vote to shut down the Fire Department when his own house is on fire .
Then there are the " False Flag " Democrats , who are ACTUALLY REPUBLICANS , but who ran as Democrats when they realized that people were FED UP with Republican corruption .
What we need is a new politics in this country - but I fear it is too late .

Agreed 100 % with TEDEGER .
That said , I have two words for all progressives / liberals / Democrats considering voting for McSame and / or 3rd parties ... Supreme Court .
After 2000 , when I voted for Gore as " the lesser of two evils " ( my opinion ) and after he let Bush win ( I take Michael Moore with a grain of salt but agree Gore should have fought harder ) I said " no more " of voting for the least bad choice ( I wanted to vote Nader in 2000 but voted Gore as a vote against Bush ) .
But reality has struck .
I 'm an Obama supporter by default ( Kucinich then Edwards then Obama ) and will vote for him gladly but would have voted Clinton just as gladly , although I can't stand her policies , because of the Supreme Court .
There will be at least two vacancies and probably more in the next four years and regardless of how bad I think Clinton would have been for the country , she would have picked eminently better choices for the SC and other lifetime judgeships .
I am as pissed off as anyone about the lack of spine in our Congressional Democrats but I refuse to vote for anyone but the Democratic nominee because I refuse to let McCain wiin and appoint more far - right activist judges .
This is bigger than my offense at the Democrats , think of your children , grand children .
Think of your neices and nephews .
Do you really want them to grow up in Nazi America ?
Is Obama ideal , no .
Is he head and shoulders above McSame , a resounding YES !!!

Jerry Voorhis , whom Nixon defeated in our local congressional race , on review of the call for Nixon ’s impeachment said that Watergate was just “ the tip of the iceberg ” and that Nixon should have been impeached when he announced that he would ignore the so - called “ Mansfield Amendment . ”
To wit : ” Unless Congress has the statesmanship , the courage and the respect for its prerogatives to impeach Richard Nixon , the consequences for the future of constitutional government , as well as honest government , will be bleak indeed .
It will furthermore be almost as serious a mistake for the Congress to impeach Mr. Nixon for technical reasons only as for it not to impeach him at all . ”
And further that the most important basis for impeachment was the : “ usurpation by Mr. Nixon of legislative powers that belong exclusively to the Congress under the Constitution . ”
My report as it comes from Nixon ’s old congressional district and as God is my Fuhrer believe that :
We are in a state of constitutional crisis .
For Rumsfeld to lobby on intelligence reform and now have military acts off the books means that the “ linchpin ” of the constitution , the taxing and spending powers of Congress , of raising standing armies , has now been violated .

All this anguish about the leader of the Democratic Party refusing to follow the Constitution does nothing to change things .
What WILL change things is for you to vote for the only true defender of the Constitution for the last 35 years , the one man who walks the talk , who does n't flip - flop , who votes and acts on principal .
If you REALLY want change , you wo n't vote for Obama .
You will vote for a man whom you can count on to vote his conscience and base his decisions on the Constitution .
That man is Ron Paul .
That vote is yours .
What will you do with it ?
Four years from now will you say " I voted for Obama and now I wish I had n't " ?
Or will you say : " For the first time in my life I voted my conscience .
I voted FOR the candidate I wanted .
I voted for Ron Paul and I am proud of my decision to vote on principal . "
Never mind what those corrupt politicians are doing .

Dear Cecil :
We 've all seen it in a movie : A small group of people are swimming in the sea .
Someone gets hurt , blood touches water , and instantly sharks appear who then devour the party in a ruthless and very painful way .
But how fast does the odor or taste of blood go in water ?
Am I right to believe that it takes a while for a shark a mile away to taste it ?
David , Belgium
Cecil replies :
I ’ll confess I have n’t seen a lot of Belgian shark movies , David , but virtually any Hollywood studio exec would see a major problem with the treatment you ’ve outlined above .
If the shark shows up the second the hemoglobin hits the water , where ’s the unbearable tension ?
What we ’re missing is that excruciating interval of stillness between the close - up of slowly seeping blood and the moment the here - comes - the - shark music kicks in .
You ’re right , though , to suspect that this interval does tend to run a little shorter on the big screen than in real life .
As you probably know already , sharks are pretty well suited to this whole predation thing .
They have excellent hearing in the low frequencies and can pick out the sound of something thrashing around in the water well over 1,000 feet away .
They ’re also outfitted with sensory cavities called the ampullae of Lorenzini , which register the faint electrical fields generated by living bodies .
And then there ’s the shark ’s sense of smell , which though not quite as phenomenal as was once believed ( you used to see a stat claiming that 70 percent of a shark ’s brain was devoted to olfaction , which seems to have been a real overstatement ) is still plenty acute : sharks can detect some chemicals at concentrations of around one part per 25 million , and experts claim they ’ve seen sharks go nuts over a single drop of blood in a 2,000 - gallon tank .
( Catfish , for the record , can detect chemical concentrations measured in parts per billion , making it a good thing they ’re not prone to bite your leg off . )
A chemical ( and for our purposes , blood ) disperses in water via diffusion and mixing .
Diffusion is a random and relatively slow process by which a concentrated group of molecules drifts apart , and in still water that ’s the main way an odor would spread .
But the ocean is n’t still , and so the primary determinants for how scents travel through seawater are the churning of waves and the flow of currents .
For this reason , a shark ’s standard response upon smelling something yummy is to swim into the prevailing current , as this will likely lead to the source ; often it ’ll home in by swimming in a series of decreasing spirals .
The upshot is that while a shark would likely have to catch some breaks dispersalwise to identify the scent of blood a mile away from ground zero , at a distance of a quarter mile it ’s got a decent shot at picking up some dinner .
OK , so :
You and your pals are out in the ocean , bleeding away ; the prevailing tidal current is somewhere around one meter per second , or 2.24 miles per hour .
If a shark is upcurrent from you , it might take a while for the pertinent molecules to drift into its range .
But if the shark happens to be fortuitously positioned a quarter mile downcurrent , the scent of blood could find its nostrils in a little under seven minutes .
Midsize sharks have been clocked swimming at 24.5 mph , so conceivably if our specimen got a particularly good read it might take only a minute or so to locate you , giving us roughly an eight - minute gap between blood entering the water and shark cruising up with a bib on .
It ’d take an admirable commitment to the principles of cinema verite to spend that kind of screen time waiting for the shark to happen along .
Let ’s say , though , just for fun , that you and the shark happened to be hanging around the Skookumchuck Narrows on the coast of British Columbia , where tidal currents can reach 16 mph .
( We ’ll ignore the fact that the raging waters themselves would have a fine chance of doing you in . )
Here a shark situated a quarter mile downcurrent might catch a whiff a mere minute after you started bleeding ; if it kept the spiraling business to a minimum and swam on something like a beeline back to the source ( fighting the current all the way , remember ) it might arrive on the scene in under two minutes , for a turnaround time of less than three minutes total .
While that ’s not quite lightning fast by shark - movie standards , ( a ) it ’s getting close , and ( b ) I ’ll hazard a guess that three minutes goes by pretty quickly when you ’re bleeding and you suspect a shark might be on its way .

( CNN ) --
This summer I found myself wishing someone would give voters useful and unbiased information about which candidate has the best plans for the economy .
Then I realized that I am someone , which is both inconvenient and expensive .
So for once I asked not what my country could do for me .
At considerable personal expense , I commissioned a survey of over 500 economists , drawn from a subset of the members of the American Economic Association , a nonpolitical group , some of whose members had agreed in advance to be surveyed on economic questions .
The results do not represent the economic association 's position .
The survey was managed by The OSR Group , a respected national public opinion and marketing research company .
I should pause here and confess my personal biases , since the messenger is part of the story .
On social issues , I lean Libertarian , minus the crazy stuff .
Moneywise , I can't support a candidate who promises to tax the bejeezus out of my bracket , give the windfall to a bunch of clowns with a 14 percent approval rating ( Congress ) , and hope they spend it wisely .
Unfortunately , the alternative to the guy who promises to pillage my wallet is a lukewarm cadaver .
I 'm in trouble either way .
I just hope whoever gets elected notices that the economists in my survey do n't think that raising my taxes is a priority .
See some of Dilbert 's economy - themed comic strips »
Nationally , most economists are male , and I 'm told that most are registered as either Democrats or independents .
Our sample reflects that imbalance :
48 percent -- Democrats
17 percent -- Republicans
27 percent -- Independents
3 percent -- Libertarian
5 percent --
Other or not registered
Eighty - six percent of our economists are male , and 65 percent work in the field of academia or education .
The rest are spread across various industries or not working .
We asked the economists which candidate for president would be best for the economy in the long run .
Not surprisingly , 88 percent of Democratic economists think Democratic Sen. Barack Obama would be best , while 80 percent of Republican economists pick Republican Sen. John McCain .
Independent economists , who in our sample are largely from the academic world , lean toward Obama by 46 percent compared to 39 percent for McCain .
Overall , 59 percent of our economists say Obama would be best for the economy long term , with 31 percent picking McCain , and 8 percent saying there would be no difference .
We can't know the degree of bias in our survey group .
But we have some clues .
On the issue of international trade , only 42 percent of our Democratic economists support Obama 's plans , with 34 percent favoring McCain .
Independents favored McCain on this question by 63 percent to 16 percent , while favoring Obama overall .
Another indicator of objectivity is that the income levels of the economists have little impact on their opinions .
The economists with lower incomes are no more likely to favor taxing the rich than the rich economists favor taxing themselves .
Likewise , economists in the academic world were largely on the same page as the nonacademic types in predicting which candidate would be best for the long term .
Here are the economic priorities according to the economists .
The percentages indicate how many rated each issue eight or higher on a scale of 1 - 10 .
71 percent -- Education
67 percent -- Health care
62 percent -- International trade
60 percent -- Energy
58 percent -- Encouraging technology and innovation
58 percent -- Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and homeland security
52 percent -- Mortgage and housing crisis
49 percent -- Social Security
45 percent -- Environmental policy
39 percent -- Reducing the deficit
37 percent -- Immigration
29 percent --
Increasing the proportion of taxes paid by the wealthy
28 percent -- Reducing waste in government
16 percent --
Tax relief for the middle class
15 percent -- Reducing capital gains tax
14 percent -- Extending unemployment insurance
13 percent -- Extending and strengthening the unemployment insurance system
13 percent -- Raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation
11 percent -- Reforming bankruptcy laws
9 percent -- Eliminating the estate tax
Moving along , we asked the economists which candidate they thought would do the best job on the most important issues .
For me , the surprise is how many economists say there would be no difference .
The economists in our survey favor Obama on 11 of the top 13 issues .
But keep in mind that 48 percent are Democrats and only 17 percent are Republicans .
Among independents , things are less clear , with 54 percent thinking that in the long run there would either be no difference between the candidates or McCain would do better .
Many of you will wonder how reliable economists are .
In my view , if an economist uses a complicated model to predict just about anything , you can ignore it .
By analogy , a doctor can't tell you the exact date of your death in 50 years .
But if a doctor tells you to eat less and exercise more , that 's good advice even if you later get hit by a bus .

Wiring Car Subwoofers & Car Speakers
Ohm's Law
It seems like one of the most common questions we receive is :
What are Ohm�s ?
And how do it relate to a car audio system ?
The most basic definition of Ohm�s law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference ( i.e. voltage drop or voltage ) across the two points , and inversely proportional to the resistance between them .
Well �
�What exactly does all that mean ? �
I find that the easiest way to understand Ohm�s law is by a visual image .
So let �s say the diagram below represents a circuit .
First you would look at potential voltage which is represented as a body of water in the diagram .
The voltage will always be the same in a car audio application .
Twelve volts would be your potential for any circuit in a standard car audio system .
Next the two different pipes represent resistance , notice they are different sizes .
The resistance can greatly vary and that will determine how much current ( amperage ) can flow though any given circuit .
Resistance is measured in Ohm�s .
A very high resistance allows a small amount of current to flow .
A very low resistance allows a large amount of current to flow .
The larger pipe represents a lower Ohm load than the smaller pipe .
Next you can see the water flowing though the pipes .
That represents current ( amperage ) .
The larger pipe is able to carry more amperage than the smaller pipe since it is rated at a lower resistance .
As pictured you can see much more water coming out of the larger pipe .
That is representing power which is measures in watts .
These are only the basics but for most car audio applications it is enough to understand how and why you should wire an amplifier or sub in a certain configuration � In a car audio application you should always run your equipment at the lowest possible Ohm load that an amplifier , head unit or speaker can safely handle .
All amplifiers will feature a rating which will usually look something like this .
500 Watts x 1 @ 4 Ohm
1000 Watts x 1 @ 2 Ohm
Now this is really important when purchasing equipment .
To get the maximum output out of the amplifier rating listed above you want to make sure it is wired at a 2
Ohm load , running the same amplifier at a 4
Ohm load will result in a 50 % loss in potential power .
The same applies the other way around .
You would not want to run this amplifier lower than a 2
Ohm load otherwise you can potentially burn it up since it would be running at twice the recommended power rating and capabilities .
Most amplifiers have a thermal protection circuit however , it is still possible to damage the amplifier .
Now if you look at my diagram above you can really see how it works .
The larger pipe above would represent a 2 Ohm load whereas the smaller pipe would be 4 Ohm .
Every time an Ohm load is divided by 2 the current will double in amperage .
Every time an Ohm load is multiplied by 2 the current will be cut by half .
Next we will look at subwoofers and how to wire them properly to the amplifier .
Using the same amplifier ratings from above we now know that we want to wire the amp at a 2 Ohm load .
So how do we do that ?
This is where things tend to get a little trickier however it is not as hard as it may seem .
There are two terms that you will need to know when wiring subs or speakers , Parallel and Series .
Lets look at each example before we figure out exactly how to wire our amplifier example from above .�
Just remember wiring in series it is used to INCREASE the Ohm load and parallel is used to DECREASE the Ohm load .
So an example of a series circuit can be viewed below .
When wiring in series you are increasing the Ohm load by hopping from one voice coil to the next .
So as you can see pictured the positive hops to negative on the opposite voice coil .
To add this up you take the 4 Ohm load of each coil and add them together .
So if you are wiring two Single 4
Ohm subs together you would add the two voice coils together sp 4 Ohm + 4
Ohm equals an end result of 8 Ohm .
Moving on an example of a parallel circuit can be seen below :
When wiring in parallel you are decreasing the Ohm load and wiring the voice coils together .�
So you would run a lead from the positive voice coil on each sub to the opposite voice coil .
In essence all the positives are connected on a single wire ( conductor ) and the same for the negatives .
So if wiring two Single 4
Ohm subs you would take 4 Ohm and divide it by the number of voice coils .
So 4
Ohm divided by two voice coils will equal a 2 Ohm load .
Okay now as you saw above the single 4
Ohm subs wired in a parallel resulted in a 2
Ohm load , just what we needed for the amplifier example from above .
But the dual 2
Ohm subwoofers came to a 1 ohm load that 's too low , what do we do ?
You will normally have to use a combination of series and parallel to achieve the correct Ohm load .
Let �s say you are running the amplifier I mentioned above .
That amplifier will need to run at a 2 Ohm load to achieve maximum power .
So if you decide you wanted to run two subwoofers on that amplifier you would need to run either two single 4
Ohm subwoofers or two dual 2 Ohm subwoofers .
The two single 4
Ohm subs are easy to wire and you can see that in the diagram above .
However , the dual 2
Ohm subs will use a combination : first we wire each subwoofer in a series and then wire them together in parallel at the amplifier .
How do we do that ?
Lets go over this in a diagram .
Think of it as a two step process this will make it easier to figure out .
So first you would take the subs and wire them in series like below .
Ok so that is first step .
So now you have two Dual 2 Ohm subs wired in series .
This increases the Ohm load to 4 Ohm at each sub .
Now we need to wire them in parallel at the amplifier .
Check out the diagram below .
As you can see we now used a combination of first wiring each sub in series , and then we wired the subwoofers in parallel at the amplifier .
This would be a typical installation and can be found in many installs .
These are just a few examples but once you have the basics down you can figure out much more complex systems using the same methods .
Still can't figure out what you need ?

Eleven people were recently indicted on multiple charges of fraud and identity theft after stealing more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers , according to Associated Press .
The 11 who stole the credit and debt information by hacking into the wireless networks of some of the nation ’s largest retailers .
It is believed to be the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice .
The charges include conspiracy , computer intrusion , fraud and identity theft .
“ While technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities , ” U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan said in a statement .
“ This case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results . ”
They used sophisticated computer hacking techniques , that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data , which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves , and in total , they caused widespread loses by banks , retailers , and consumers .
After the credit card information was stolen it was either sold or encrypted onto credit cards and used to make purchases and withdraw money from ATMs .
READ
Of those charged , three were Americans and one was a U.S. Secret Service informant .
While the reports do n’t reveal how consumers can know if they were affected , there are ways you can find out .
Start by checking your credit card and checking account billing statements , especially if you shopped in any of the stored mentioned .
If notice charges you did n’t make dispute them with your creditor .
Since the theft involved stolen credit and debt card numbers , it ’s unlikely that your identity was abused , but it does n’t hurt to check .
Free credit reports are available through annualcreditreport.com .
10 Ways to Prevent , Detect , and Fight Identity
Theft lists other ways you can find out if your identity has been stolen and tells you what steps to take if you ’ve been a victim .
If you see fraudulent charges on any of your accounts , you need to report them within two days .
Do that and your liability is only $ 50 , wait two months and your liability is unlimited .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The rate of suicides among - active duty soldiers is on pace to surpass both last year 's numbers and the rate of suicide in the general U.S. population for the first time since the Vietnam war , according to U.S. Army officials .
Officials attribute the rise in suicides to anxiety and stress from increased operations and more deployments .
As of August , 62 Army soldiers have committed suicide , and 31 cases of possible suicide remain under investigation , according to Army statistics .
Last year , the Army recorded 115 suicides among its ranks , which was also higher than the previous year .
Army officials said that if the trend continues this year , it will pass the nation 's suicide rate of 19.5 people per 100,000 , a 2005 figure considered the most recent by the government .
The rise can be attributed to the increased pace of combat operations , the number of deployments and financial and family troubles connected with deployments , Army officials said .
" Army leaders are fully aware that repeated deployments have led to increased distress and anxiety for both soldiers and their families , " Secretary of the Army Pete Geren said .
" This stress on the force is validated by recent studies of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans reporting symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder or major depression . "
The statistics were released Tuesday at a news conference announcing the completion of a study by mental health experts who the Veterans Administration asked to review its suicide prevention work and track numbers .
On Tuesday , the VA also announced findings from a study showing that suicides hit an all - time high in 2006 among younger U.S. military veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The numbers show record levels for men , but the statistics are lower for women .
According to the VA , about 46 of 100,000 males between the ages of 18 and 29 utilizing VA services committed suicide in 2006 , compared with about 27 the year before .
For female veterans in the same age group , about three in 100,000 killed themselves in 2006 , compared with about eight per 100,000 in 2005 .
The suicide rate for males is also higher than for the general United States population in 2005 .
The number for the general population is about 20 people per 100,000 , according to the VA numbers .
Numbers were not available for the 2006 general male population suicides .
Veterans Secretary James
Peake said the department would try to reduce the number of suicides by using recommendations by the mental health expert panel .
" The report of this blue - ribbon panel , and other efforts under way , will ensure VA mobilizes its full resources to care for our most vulnerable veterans , " Peake said in a statement .
Among veterans who left the military in 2001 , 141 killed themselves between 2002 and 2005 , according to VA statistics in the report .
In 2006 , 113 more veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars committed suicide .
The Veterans Administration has said the rise in suicides can be directly connected to the increase in veterans coming from both wars since 2001 .
Representatives from the Department of Defense , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health made the following recommendations :
• Design a study that will identify suicide risk among veterans of different conflicts , ages , genders , military branches and other factors .
• Improve the VA 's screening for suicide among veterans with depression or post - traumatic stress disorder .
• Foster a better understanding of suitable medications for depression , PTSD and suicidal behavior .

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has made an impassioned defence of Russia 's military intervention in Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Mr Putin accused the Western press of an " immoral and dishonest account of what happened " .
He said Russia had had no choice but to intervene following what he alleged was Georgian aggression .
And he went on to dismiss out of hand European criticism of Russian force as " disproportionate " .
" What did you want us to do ?
Wave our penknives in the air and wipe the bloody snot off our noses ? " he asked , adding : " When an aggressor comes into your territory , you need to punch him in the face - an aggressor needs to punished . "
He added that Russian tanks had , after all , only been 15 km from Tbilisi and could easily have taken the Georgian capital and ousted President Mikhail Saakashvilli if they had wanted to .
Mr Putin also accused the US of behaving like the Roman Empire by believing it could pursue its own interests and extending its influence to the Caucasus without regard for Russia 's point of view .
" God forbid that we should tread on US toes in its backyard , " he said , expressing frustration that the United States seemed to think it was all right to arm Georgia on Russia 's border - a move which he repeatedly argued had provoked Georgia to take up military action .
' Anti-Russian hysteria '
On wider relations with the West , he insisted that current tensions did not amount to the start of a new Cold War , and dismissed arguments that Russia might suffer diplomatic or economic isolation because of the crisis .
SOUTH OSSETIA & ABKHAZIA
Q&A : Conflict in Georgia
Who started the crisis ?
But he also said Russia was prepared to work with Western partners and wanted a constructive relationship with the European Union but only if what he called " realities " were taken into account .
Russia , said the prime minister , should be treated as an equal partner and all sides agree on new common rules of behaviour based on international law .
" The problem is not with us , " Mr Putin said , " it lies with political groups in the West who use old phobias to whip up anti-Russian hysteria . "
However , he warned that tensions between Russia and the EU may well worsen if , as expected , US missiles are deployed in Poland as part of the controversial missile shield .
He said he expected that to be the moment that Russia would reposition its missiles to point at European targets .
" Why have you placed missiles under our nose ? " he said , and warned it would ratchet up an extra notch the nuclear arms race in Europe .
UK relations Mr Putin also indicated that relations with Britain were unlikely to improve while Russian emigres remained in the UK despite Russia 's requests to extradite them to stand trial - an apparent reference to the Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky and the former Chechen spokesman , Ahmed Zakayev .
Many South Ossetians feel closer to Russia than Georgia " Why do you allow UK territory to be used a launching pad to fight Russia ? " he asked .
" Imagine if we gave sanctuary to armed members of the IRA - that 's why its not possible to build normal relations with Britain , " he said .
Mr Putin also threw new light on the crisis in South Ossetia .
On 8 August , when he was in Beijing for the start of the Olympic Games , he had spoken to US President George W Bush soon after hearing of the attack by Georgian troops on the South Ossetian capital - but the United States had failed to intervene .
In Beijing , he had already raised the question of Russia recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent territories with the Chinese government , and told them Russia did not expect Chinese support .
This is an interesting comment that suggests Russia was already planning to recognise the two regions from very early on in the crisis .

What are these ?
June 12 , 2008  --
The nation 's leading gun control group filed a " friend of the court " brief back in January defending the gun ban in Washington , D.C.
But with the Supreme Court poised to hand down a potentially landmark decision in the case , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence fully expects to lose .
" We 've lost the battle on what the Second Amendment means , " campaign president Paul Helmke told ABC News .
" Seventy - five percent of the public thinks it 's an individual right .
Why are we arguing a theory anymore ?
We are concerned about what we can do practically . "
While the Brady Campaign is waving the white flag in the long - running debate on whether the Second Amendment protects an individual 's right to bear arms or merely a state 's right to assemble a militia , it is hoping that losing the " legal battle " will eventually lead to gun control advocates winning the " political war . "
" We 're expecting D.C. to lose the case , " Helmke said .
" But this could be good from the standpoint of the political - legislative side . "
The D.C. ban prohibits residents from keeping handguns inside their homes and requires that lawfully registered guns , such as shotguns , be locked and unloaded when kept at home .
If the Supreme Court strikes down the D.C. gun ban , the Brady Campaign is hoping that it will reorient gun control groups around more limited measures that will be harder to cast as infringements of the Second Amendment .
" The NRA [ National Rifle Association ] wo n't have this fear factor , " Helmke said .
Brady Campaign Attorney Dennis Henigan said there are multiple gun control measures that would not run afoul of a Supreme Court decision striking down the D.C. gun ban .
" Universal background checks do n't affect the right of self - defense in the home .
Banning a super dangerous class of weapons , like assault weapons , also would not adversely affect the right of self - defense in the home , " said Henigan .
" Curbing large volume sales does n't affect self - defense in the home . "
The Brady Campaign expects pro-gun groups to use the Supreme Court 's decision in the DC case to challenge a gun ban in Chicago , the major city whose gun laws come closest to the nation 's capital .
Although the Brady Campaign expects the Chicago ordinance to be challenged , it thinks that it may survive because it does not have the restrictions on long guns like the ones found in Washington , D.C .
The Chicago law may also survive because a decision in the D.C. case will likely not resolve the issue of whether the Second Amendment applies to the states and other cities that are not federal enclaves .
Looking beyond the Supreme Court 's D.C. gun ban case to the race for the White House , the Brady Campaign views Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , as a better friend to gun control advocates than Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz .
But given that McCain stood by his support for closing " the gun- show loophole " during a recent speech to the N.R.A. , the Brady Campaign president hopes that new gun restrictions can make headway regardless of who wins in November .
" For John McCain to be the political candidate of the NRA shows how things have changed , " Helmke said .
ABC News ' John Santucci contributed to this report .
What a sweet gig .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has billed taxpayers for 312 nights spent in her own home during her first 19 months in office , charging a " per diem " allowance intended to cover meals and incidental expenses while traveling on state business .
The governor also has charged the state for travel expenses to take her children on official out - of - town missions .
And her husband , Todd , has billed the state for expenses and a daily allowance for trips he makes on official business for his wife .
At first I was wondering , " why did n't I try that at my old job , demanding travel pay when staying at my own place ? "
Then I realized why -- it would 've been a scam , and I would 've been fired .
Funny how that " accountability " thing does n't seem to operate when a politician is elected to high office .
Now to be fair , Palin only made $ 125,000 a year , or 1/3rd of a Cindy McCain dress .
That is really poor ; at least $ 4.875 million away from middle class .
And do n't forget she " chose life " , so who cares if she has the ethics of a sewer rat ?
Instead of passing judgment on Palin , we should just be thankful it was n't John McCain billing the state of Alaska to live at his home (s ) .
He would 've bankrupted the state .
Palin fired her public safety commissioner and is now under investigation .
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Governor Sarah Palin is being investigated by lawmakers in her home state of Alaska .
At issue : Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan and whether he was fired because he refused to pink slip a state trooper who divorced Palin 's sister .
But Palin is refusing to cooperate with the investigation .
Shades of President Bush .
Embarrassing investigation ?
Just refuse to cooperate and claim it 's all someone else 's fault .
Palin says the probe 's been hijacked by the Obama campaign for political gain .
But Monegan was fired and the investigation begun long before Palin was named to the Republican ticket .
The Obama campaign denies the accusation .
McCain 's people say Palin will not cooperate with the investigation because it is " tainted . "
They insist Monegan was fired because of insubordination .
Palin has not been subpoenaed , but last Friday Alaska lawmakers voted to subpoena her husband , several aides and telephone records .
This kind of stuff may also explain why Sarah Palin is reluctant to do interviews or news conferences .
Here ’s my question to you :
What does it mean that Gov. Sarah Palin is refusing to cooperate with the investigation into the firing of her public safety commissioner ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Marie from Minnesota writes :
This woman is ridiculous .
She wo n't answer questions from the media .
She wo n't answer questions from voters and she wo n't answer questions related to this investigation .
It is so obvious that this woman is not prepared at all to be V.P .
At some point the American public deserves to have their questions answered .
Eileen writes :
Well what else can it mean ?
Her handlers know she has something to hide , so let 's all blame the Democrats .
So what if the facts are that the Republicans are the majority who opened the investigation ?
Bruce from St. Paul , Minnesota writes :
For the same reason Rove , Cheney , and anyone remotely connected to them will not honor congressional subpoenas .
The same reason Nixon would not cooperate with the Watergate investigators .
The same reason Bush would not produce , and in fact destroyed his Air National Guard records .
Laws are for suckers like us .
Sasha writes :
Palin failing to cooperate with the investigation , along with the McCain campaign not letting her do any more interviews or press conferences on her own , says there are some question marks about her and her situation .
Where did the " straight talk express " go on the McCain - Palin campaign ?
Pablo from Charles from Town , WV writes :
It means they need more time to put lipstick on the pig , bulldog or whatever animal they are trying to disguise before the American people can see it for what it really is .
My guess is it is a weasel .
Debra writes :
It means she is better prepared to be vice - president than any of us thought .
Following in the footsteps of our current V.P. , she has been taught the values of " executive privilege " and is apparently a quick learner .
I ’m being asked two big questions about this thing : ( 1 ) Was it really necessary ?
( 2 ) Should n’t Dems have tossed the whole Paulson approach out the window and done something completely different ?
On ( 1 ) , the answer is yes .
It ’s true that some parts of the real economy are doing OK even in the face of financial disruption ; big companies can still sell bonds ( and have lots of cash on hand ) , qualifying home buyers can still get Fannie - Freddie mortgages , and so on .
But commercial paper , which is important to a lot of businesses , is in trouble , and I ’m hearing anecdotes about reduced credit lines causing smaller businesses to pull back .
Plus there ’s a serious chance of a run on the hedge funds , which could make things a lot worse .
With the economy already looking like it ’s headed into a serious recession by any definition , the risks of doing nothing look too high .
It ’s true that we might be able to stagger through with more case - by - case rescues — I think of this as the “ two , three , many AIGs ” strategy ; in fact , we might not be at this point if Paulson had n’t decided to make an example of Lehman .
But right now it ’s not even clear who to rescue , and the credit markets are freezing up as you read this ( 1 - month t- bill at 0.04 % , TED spread at 3.5 )
On ( 2 ) , the call is tougher .
But putting myself in Barney Frank or Nancy Pelosi ’s shoes , I ’d look at it this way : the Democrats could start over , with a bailout plan that is , say , centered on purchases of preferred stock and takeovers of failing firms — basically , a plan clearly focused on recapitalizing the financial sector , with nationalization where necessary .
That ’s what the plan should have looked like .
Maybe such a plan would have passed Congress ; and maybe , just maybe Bush would have signed on ; Paulson is certainly desperate for a deal .
But such a plan would have had next to no Republican votes — and the Republicans would have demagogued against it full tilt .
And the Democratic leadership cannot , cannot , be seen to have sole ownership of this stuff .
So that , I think , is why it had to be done this way .
I do n’t like it , and I do n’t like the plan , but I see the constraints under which Dodd , Frank , Pelosi , and Reid were operating .
What 's Keeping American Workers Safe ?
By Bryan Caplan
Fun facts from Kip Viscusi‘s article on “ Job Safety ” in David Henderson ’s encyclopedia :
Annual OSHA penalties for safety violations ( 2002 ) : $ 149,000,000
Annual Workers Compensation Premiums ( 2001 ) : $ 26,000,000,000
Estimated Annual Wage Premiums for Risky Activities ( 2004 dollars ) : $ 245,000,000,000
His point : Market incentives for worker safety dwarf legal incentives , which in turn dwarf regulatory incentives .
The level of safety we see in the workplace today is about the same as the level we ’d see if government just looked the other way .

The Hardgainer ’s Nutrition Plan
Not everyone is lucky enough to have the genetics of someone like IFBB pro Jay Cutler , who piled on an astounding 40 pounds of muscle in his first two years of training .
Truth is , many of the rest of us are hardgainers — gym regulars who , although fairly grounded in our approach to training and nutrition , fail to achieve meaningful changes in our physiques .
Perhaps you ’re like the very lean individual who carries less than 10 % bodyfat and endlessly cries , “ I just ca n’t get big ! ”
Or maybe you resemble the heavyset individual who carries more than 15 % bodyfat and out of frustration complains , “ I always get fat when I try to build mass ! ”
Either way , the solution lies in creating the ideal eating plan to allow you to pack on mass or skillfully add muscle while preventing the accumulation of bodyfat .
Eat Big to Get Big
The hardgainer ’s core tools for adding mass begin with establishing proper caloric intake .
According to Jackie Berning , PhD , RD , of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs , very lean individuals who struggle to pack on mass must concentrate on increasing calories .
“ Obviously , to put on lean body mass , you have to stimulate the body to do so through high - intensity weight training .
But training is a waste of time unless you support the addition of lean body mass with lots of fuel .
A high calorie intake is the fertilizer that supports muscle growth .
With this in mind , she recommends that men add 500 - 1,000 calories a day to their daily intake ; women can suffice with 250 - 500 extra calories a day .
Carbs & When to Eat Them
One bit of conflicting advice floating around the locker room is the best time of day to curtail your carbohydrate intake .
Some suggest that eating carbs late at night may lead to increases in bodyfat , while others believe that timing your carb intake is n’t necessary .
What ’s best for you may depend on your goals .
Hardgainers with low body - fat should eat within a couple of hours of going to bed , since their fast - moving metabolism may put them at risk of slipping into a negative calorie balance while sleeping .
Those hoping to sidestep increases in bodyfat may want to phase their caloric intake by eating more carbs earlier in the day and around their workouts , when energy demands are greatest .
Types of carbohydrates may also be a consideration .
Fast - acting carbs called high - glycemic or simple carbs , such as honey , sugar , white bread , fat - free cakes and snacks , digest into blood sugar at a faster rate than slow - acting carbohydrates called low - glycemic carbs .
Berning explains that the latter – – like yams , peaches , oatmeal , chick - peas and yogurt — work well for those trying to control calories .
“ You tend to stay fuller longer and may have less of a tendency to eat . ”
A preworkout meal comprised of low - glycemic carbs may be best for the heavier hardgainer who wants to build muscle while losing bodyfat .
Oatmeal mixed with protein powder such as Muscle Milk , for example , digests slowly , providing a steady source of immediate fuel and sparing muscle glycogen reserves .
Saturated glycogen reserves are associated with muscle growth , and depleting them may stimulate a metabolic shift in which body protein becomes a fuel source .
Choose whey protein as your preworkout protein source because it ’s abundant in branched - chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) — the three amino acids used directly for fuel by working muscles when glycogen levels fall , thereby sparing body protein ( muscle ) .
Plus , BCAAs can positively affect growth hormone and testosterone levels , two important hormones that influence bodyfat deposition . ’
The opposite holds true for super - lean hardgainers .
Besides requiring more calories and a heck of a lot more total carbs , they can get by on almost any carbohydrate choice .
Why ?
Really lean individuals tend to react somewhat differently than their heavyset counterparts in regard to carbohydrate metabolism ; they may produce less of the sugar - clearing storage hormone called insulin or their muscles may have a superior ability to “ uptake ” glucose out of the blood .
In effect , simple carbs reach the blood quickly , but insulin is likely released in a steady , controlled fashion , leaving them with plenty of blood sugar to train .
Furthermore , hardgainers who pack away another 1,000 calories a day are more likely to have greater reserves of muscle glycogen , allowing them to train hard and long .
Advertisement
Of course , there are always exceptions to the rules , and the type of carbs you consume after training should always include simple carbs , because they ’re superior at restoring muscle glycogen . -
This may be the time when hardgainers struggling to control their bodyfat can splurge on fat - free cakes or cookies or simply eat other high - glycemic carbs like mashed potatoes , rice cakes or cold breakfast cereal .
Generally , the carbs consumed in the post - training meal must be stored as glycogen before influencing the accumulation of bodyfat .
Protein by the Pound
Protein is another important component in muscle growth — dietary amino acids from complete sources of protein such as meat , fowl , fish and dairy products become part of new muscle tissue to support growth and repair .
But do n’t focus on protein to the exclusion of calories , Berning warns .
“ Sure , the body needs protein to grow , but much of that protein is often wasted if total caloric intake falls too low . ”
Indeed , one of the repeated blunders lean hardgainers commit is to gulp down 3 - 4 protein shakes daily without eating an additional 500 - 1,000 calories a day ; in this case , some of the protein may be simply burned as fuel rather than used to support muscle growth .
And if you not only fail to eat a large surplus of calories each day but eat too few total calories altogether , muscle can be broken down to be used as energy — just the opposite of what you want .
The more carbs you eat , the less likely your body will rely on protein as fuel , so the lean hardgainer who eats an assortment of energy - yielding carbs will certainly need more muscle - building protein than the sedentary person , yet less than the hardgainer with a more lethargic metabolism .
Berning suggests about 0.7 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight , but when calories are n’t excessive ( for hardgainers fighting bodyfat ) , protein requirements go up to 0.9 gram per pound of bodyweight .
Therefore , a 165 - pound super - lean trainer can get by on as few as 115 grams of protein a day as long as he or she is eating another 1,000 calories ; the 165 - pounder who ’s eating closer to maintenance will surely need 149 grams of protein daily .
Packets & Powders
Increasing your calorie intake is the foundation upon which mass - building diet plans are based .
That ’s why many hardgainers opt for the convenience of MRPs — high - protein , low - carbohydrate meal - replacement products .
MRPs may be good for the larger dieting competitive bodybuilder who needs a 50 - gram wallop of protein when severely restricting caloric intake ; very strict diets cause an added demand for protein as fuel , and a great - tasting MRP may be a preferred choice over dry chicken breasts or baked fish .
Weight - gain powders that pack at least 50 grams of carbohydrates along with 20 grams of protein per serving are more suited for the person requiring extra calories to build .
As you can see by the sample meal plans above , whether you ’re lean or carry more bodyfat , you must always eat more carbs than protein to support muscle growth .
Thus , shakes that yield twice as many carbs as protein are ideal for mass - seeking individuals .
If your metabolism is so fast that you need 500 or so grams of carbs a day , stick with weight - gain powders or create your own using a low - carb protein powder like whey protein and blending it with high - carbohydrate mixers such as fruit juice or fruit , or try blending low - fat milk , whey protein and low - fat ice cream for a high - carb , calorically dense shake
Heavyset hardgainers can also use whey protein , and will benefit by mixing it with low - glycemic mixers like skim milk , orange juice , yogurt , apples and strawberries .
The Cardio Component
The heavier hardgainer who ’s constantly keeping an eye on his or her waist , hips or thighs and carries a bodyfat of 15 % or higher must keep a tighter check on total caloric intake .
Berning suggests : “ More work , less calories .
Match your daily caloric intake to your expenditure and include some aerobic work along with your weight training to get your body to use fat as fuel . ”
Two to three 30 - 40 - minute sessions a week should do the trick .
Be careful , however , of overdoing cardio in your zeal to burn fat .
Too much aerobic work could backfire , and undercut muscle growth by expending too many calories .
If you continue to see strength increases in the gym , your cardio is n’t interfering with your muscle - building .
Yet if you begin losing strength , you may be doing too much aerobic activity .
Finally , if you ’re neither losing nor gaining strength , you ’re probably shedding fat while gaining lean body mass — and Berning advises ditching the bathroom scale in exchange for bodyfat testing via a simple set of skin calipers .
“ It ’s possible to rearrange and be losing fat while adding lean body mass , which would result in no net change on the scale , ” she notes .
“ Bodyfat measurements can pinpoint what ’s going on . ”
This will help you determine how much fat you ’re losing and how much lean mass you ’re adding .
Kim Kardashian Says Goodbye To Her Butt ( Photos )
may be known for her ample derrière but she 's no one trick pony .
She also stars in her family 's reality show on E !
Keeping up with the Kardashian's , has an exercise DVD , Work Out With Kim Kardashian , helps her family with their clothing store Smooch and Dash and will be releasing her own perfume next year .
Kim hit the media radar when former boyfriend R&B singer Ray J released a private sex tape of the two .
The tape was sold to Vivid Entertainment and she later received a $ 5 million settlement in the case .
Moving forward , Kim has been dating NFL player Reggie Bush for a little over a year and the two seem very much in love .
Kim did an interview with Radar magazine recently and talked about her body :
" I love that I am curvy , but I am on a major kick to try and lose weight , especially in my butt .
I am just over it !
When you are posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout , ' Turn Around , Turn Around ! ' - it gets a little offensive .
I have seen magazines where plastic surgeons are saying , ' If you want a butt like this then it has to be fake . '
I 'm just like ' dude have you ever seen an Armenian girl before ? "
Kim has dodged rumors throughout the years that her curvy behind was made ample with implants .
Personally I do n't think it is fake -- look atNobody is calling her butt fake .
You tell us , do you think Kim should lose her booty or stay true to her Armenian roots ?

The Bloomberg financial newswire decided to update its 17 - page Steve Jobs obituary today — and inadvertently published it in the process .
Some investors were undoubtedly rattled to see , as our tipster did late this afternoon , the Apple CEO 's obit cross the wire and then suddenly disappear .
Jobs 's battle with pancreatic cancer , and speculation over his health , jarred Wall Street earlier this year and continues to be the subject of speculation .
The Times weighed in on the matter as recently as last month , when columnist Joe Nocera spoke with the secretive tech executive .
But news organizations routinely prepare obituaries in advance , even for the healthy .
And if Bloomberg readers had seen the internal story slug , " testjobs , " their jitters might have abated .
The obit , which we 've obtained and reprinted after the jump , is a bit macabre to read but should not scare you out of your Apple shares .
( UPDATE : Bloomberg has " retracted " its obituary , and the retraction is also after the jump . )
More interesting are the accompanying notes for Bloomberg reporters !
The obituary contains nothing to indicate Bloomberg has new information on Jobs 's health , at least in our quick skim .
But the reporting notes do reveal that near the top of Bloomberg 's list of people to call in event of his death is Jobs 's ex girlfriend Heidi Roizen ( quite the Valley switchboard , apparently ) and California attorney general and ( like Jobs ) cranky aging hippie Jerry Brown .
Also , Bloomberg does n't seem to have many people 's cell phone numbers .

There was quite a struggle in Congress this week .
The Department of Defense refused to allow the senior civilian in charge of its Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office ( SAPRO ) to testify in Thursday ’s hearing on sexual assault in the military .
Rep. John Tierney , chair of the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs , angrily dismissed Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Michael Dominguez from the hearing when Dominguez said that he , the DoD chief of legislative affairs and the chief of public affairs , had ordered Dr. Kaye Whitley , chief of SAPRO , to refuse to honor the subpoena issued by the subcommittee for her appearance .
Full committee Chairman Henry Waxman called the DoD ’s decision to prevent Whitley from testifying “ ridiculous and indicating DoD is covering something up . ”
It could also place Whitley in contempt of Congress .
Rep. Christopher Shays said the DoD ’s decision was “ foolish . ”
One of the questions that would have been put to Whitley was why DoD had taken three years to name a 15 - person civilian task force to look into allegations of sexual assault of military personnel .
The panel was finally named early in 2008 but has yet to meet .
She would have also been queried on the SAPRO program ’s failure to require key information from the military in order to evaluate the effectiveness of sexual assault prevention and response programs .
I spoke with Dr. Whitley in April 2007 and had asked for an appointment to bring to her office four military women who had been sexually assaulted and wanted to tell her in what ways the DoD programs to prevent sexual assault were not working .
Whitley declined , saying she worked at the policy level , and steered me to the chief of the Army sexual assault program .
I called the Army program ’s chief , who initially said she would talk to our group .
However , when I mentioned that the mother of Army Spc. Suzanne Swift , who had been raped in Iraq , would be with us , she said she could not meet with anyone involved with an ongoing case .
I replied that Swift ’s case was closed as far as the Army was concerned .
Her rapist had not been prosecuted , and Swift ended up with a court - martial and 30 days of jail time because she had gone AWOL for her own protection when the Army would not move her out of the unit to which both she and her rapist were still assigned .
In view of the fact that the Army chief of prevention of sexual assault refused to meet with any of the four women who had suggestions on how to improve prevention and reporting of sexual assault and rape , I ’m not surprised that the DoD snubbed Congress over the same issue .
Rep. Elijah Cummings joined Rep. Waxman in speaking of cover-ups .
Cummings raised the cases of military women who had been sexually assaulted before dying in “ non-combat incidents . ”
He spoke specifically about Army Pfc. LaVena Johnson , who was found beaten and dead of a gunshot wound at Balad Air Base , Iraq , in a burning tent owned by the contractor KBR .
Her parents suspected that Johnson had been murdered and that the homicide was being covered up by the Army , which deemed the death a suicide .
Cummings also spoke of Army Pfc. Tina Priest , who was raped at Taji , Iraq , and found dead 10 days later of a gunshot wound .
After her family had measurements taken of her arms and of the angle of the bullet and found that she could not have pulled the trigger of her M - 16 with her finger , the Army said she had pulled the trigger by using her toe .
Cummings asked Lt. Gen. Michael Rochelle , chief of U.S. Army personnel , for assistance in getting all the documents the Army had on Johnson ’s death .
Additionally , four House members have asked for congressional hearings on the deaths of military personnel who have been classified as suicides , among them LaVena Johnson .
The fireworks with DoD followed the dramatic testimony of Mary Lauterbach , the mother of murdered pregnant Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach , who had been raped in May 2007 at Camp Lejeune , N.C. Accused in the case is Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean .
After the rape , several protective orders were issued to keep Laurean away from his victim .
The burned body of Lauterbach and her unborn baby were found in a shallow grave in the backyard of Laurean ’s home in January 2008 .
Laurean fled to Mexico , where he was subsequently apprehended , and he now is awaiting extradition to the United States to stand trial .
Lauterbach ’s mother explained in great detail the warning signs that Laurean was a danger to her daughter and claimed that all these signs were ignored by the Marine Corps .
Two other military women have been murdered near military bases in North Carolina in the past two months .
Red Cross employee Ingrid Torres told the subcommittee of being raped at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea by an Air Force flight doctor .
She spoke of the difficulty she had obtaining medical and emotional treatment from the facility where the doctor still worked , and later from military facilities in other parts of the world where she was assigned .
Rep . Jane Harman cited Veterans Administration statistics that one in three women in the military has been sexually assaulted .
She said the prosecution rate of those accused of raping fellow military service members is abysmally low .
Of the 2,212 reported rapes in the military in 2007 , only 8 percent of the cases ended in court - martial of the perpetrator , while the rate of prosecution in civilian courts is 40 percent .
Lt. Gen .
Rochelle , the Army chief of personnel , reported the little known statistic that 12 percent of reported rapes in the military are of male military personnel .
Rep .
Shays said he had no confidence in DoD or the military services and their policies of prevention of sexual assault , and asked how recruiting will fare when young women learn that one in three women is sexually assaulted and when young men find out that one in 10 men is raped while in the military .
Brenda Farrell , director of the Government Accountability Office , said that getting data on rape from the military services is difficult because there are no common definitions of terms for the services to use in such cases .
Farrell said the GAO believes rates of sexual assault currently used by DoD are low because many military personnel do not want to report what happened and suffer the gossip , harassment and stigma prevalent in units when confidential reporting is compromised .
In a survey of 3,757 persons on 14 military installations , 103 said they had been sexually assaulted in the past year and had reported it , while 52 others said they did not report the sexual assault .
Several Congress members spoke of lack of leadership and accountability in stopping sexual assault .
The same day as the sexual assault hearing , the Navy relieved two senior officers of the USS George Washington because of the injury to 23 sailors and $ 70 million in damage to the ship caused by a smoking violation .
Imagine if commanders in units where rape occurred were relieved of command for the harmful actions of their subordinates .
That would send a signal of zero tolerance of sexual assault , whereas in the current climate victims are intimidated and alleged perpetrators are given administrative punishment instead of court - martial .
Sexual violence against both female and male military personnel must stop .
Let Congress know of your concern about sexual assault in our military .

Barack Obama ’s fundraising extravaganza in Hollywood Tuesday night raised a whopping $ 9 million for his presidential campaign and the Democratic Party — the single highest figure ever raised by a candidate in one go , as MSNBC anchor Alex Witt points out in this clip .
Jodie Foster , Will Ferrell and Jamie Leigh Curtis were among the stars who forked up thousands of dollars to lift forks with Obama and watch Barbra Streisand perform later at the Regent Beverly Wilshire during Obama ’s second big visit to Tinseltown in recent months .
Witt and “ Access Hollywood ” reporter Tony Potts are both stumped when they try to come up with names of celebs who would publicly claim to support Republican candidate John McCain , but we have a few ideas .
MSNBC :
( CNN ) -- A new Government Accountability Office report on voting system testing finds that the Election Assistance Commission has not notified election officials across the country about electronic voting machine failures .
And a new study by Common Cause and the Century Foundation finds that 10 very vital swing states have significant voting problems that have not been addressed since the last election .
Those 10 states , according to Common Cause , are Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Michigan , Missouri , New Mexico , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Wisconsin .
In Colorado , 20,000 left polling places without voting in 2006 because of crashed computer registration machines and long lines .
And this election day , Colorado will have another new registration system .
" You know , Colorado is two years behind many states in implementing a statewide voter database .
...
This is a new system , and there 's just a lot of unknowns as to whether or not voters will be successful , " said Jenny Flanagan of Common Cause .
The problems listed in the report range from not enough voting machines to glitches with electronic registration poll books .
Read the report
" We 're seeing a lot of problems where people are being kicked off the data base rolls if their name is on as Alex as opposed to Alexander or they 've put a middle initial in there name and it's not there , " said Susan Greenhalgh of Voter Action .
" These are problems that are being created by software restrictions that are stringent or glitches in some cases where the program is incorrectly bouncing people off the rolls . "
For voters with problems in registration , provisional ballots are provided .
But Tova Wang of Common Cause said there is a " very good chance , with all of the new voters that we are going to see this year , that there will be a big demand for the use of provisional ballots . "
" And yet I see nothing , except in one of the 10 states , that the states are doing to ensure that there will be enough provisional ballots on hand so that they do n't run out of them .
Ideally , provisional ballots should be on hand for 10 percent of the voting population , " she added .
Watch more on the fight for swing states »
Common Cause said it 's not too late to fix many of these problems .
Although many states do n't have the laws on the books to require some safeguards , they can act now to make sure that there are enough back up ballots at the polls , workers are properly trained and there are enough poll workers on election day .
Denver , Colorado , for example , is going back to a paper poll book registration for this election .

“ Senator Obama is an impressive speaker , ” he said .
“ And the beauty of his words has attracted many people , especially among the young , to his campaign .
I applaud his talent and his success .
All Americans , all Americans should be proud of his accomplishment .
I know I am .
“ My concern with Senator Obama is on big issues , and small issues , what he says and what he does are often two different things .
And that he does n’t seem to understand that the policies he offers would make our problems harder , not easier to solve . ”
Mr. McCain went on to criticize Mr. Obama for seeking pork - barrel spending ( “ nearly a million dollars for every working day he ’s been in office ” ) , accused him of wanting to raise taxes , painted him as an obstructionist on energy policy , rapped him for abandoning his pledge to take public financing , and criticized his Iraq policy .
Some of his lines of attack have been accused of being misleading .
Mr. McCain , for instance , said Mr. Obama had voted in the Senate “ for tax hikes that would have impacted those making $ 32,000 a year . ”
FactCheck.org , a nonpartisan Web site , said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making $ 41,500 a year ; the $ 32,000 figure , it said , was the amount of taxable income those people had .
An advertisement criticized Mr. Obama for the high price of gas .
“ Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump ? ” an announcer intoned , as chants of “ Obama , Obama ” were heard .
Dan Schnur , who worked on Mr. McCain ’s 2000 campaign and is the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California , said the McCain campaign seemed to be drawing on lessons from watching the Democratic primary fight between Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ It was n’t until the last weeks of the primary that Clinton and her campaign really took the gloves off on Obama , and as it happens it was too little , too late , ” he said .
“ Obama is at his best when he talks from the mountaintop , and Clinton showed that the best hope for an opponent is to pull him back down to earth .
McCain ’s campaign quickly decided not to wait as long as she did . ”

" Rob Kall has certainly acquired the firsthand experiences and knowledge gained through interviews to deliver some interesting insights about the " bottom - up " information revolution .
Whereas the old ' top - down ' systems created stove - pipes and excessive secrecy that blocked information sharing and led to the ' failure to connect the dots ' before 9 - 11 , the bottom - up approach should be the main fix .
Kall 's concept would seem to interface equally well with the founding fathers ' idealism in setting forth their democratic theory of governance as with the realism that makes the multi-sourced , bottom - up Wikipedia work .
As someone who shares my support of both government and corporate whistleblowing -- which is nothing more than encouraging greater horizontal sharing of information , I commend Rob Kall 's important work on this topic . "

Remember this interview with Katie Couric ?
We were all so focused on McCain 's inability to count property that a fairly large whopper of a lie went for the most part unnoticed :
Couric :
Are you sorry about the way you answered the question about how many homes you own ?
McCain :
Well , I 'll continue to say I 'm blessed , and very proud , that Jim Hensley , a war hero , a man barely able to graduate from high school was able to pass on to his daughter a ... what he had struggled for and saved for .
That 's the ambition all of us have for our children and our grandchildren .
And if someone wants to disparage that , they 're free to do that .
Yeah , Hensley was the Great American Success Story .
Funny thing about that ... while there are some serious lowlifes on the right willing to smear Obama by association with terrorism in ads funded by nebulous shadow groups ( although it must hurt Simmons where he lives that his kid donated the max to Obama ) , I 'd say that there is more than enough ammunition in this whitewashing of Jim Hensley 's background to fill a few ads .
So Jim Hensley had dirty fingers in enough juicy pies of bootlegging , mafia , racketeering and even murder -- while being defended by future Supreme Court Chief William Rehnquist , mind you -- to even make a right wing hack like Corsi sit up and take notice ?
That 's some good stuff the media is completely ignoring .
And for the record , McCain , that 's not at all the kind of ambition I hope for my kids and grandkids .
Any foreigner who has lived in Japan , or even just visited for a few days , cannot fail to have heard “ You ’re good with chopsticks ” from their hosts .
This survey from goo Ranking into what foreigner in Japan activity surprises the Japanese ( in a good way ) looked at what other things people were impressed with .
Chopsticks did figure in the rankings !
Demographics
Between the 21st and 23th of May 2008 1,072 members of the goo Research monitor panel completed a private internet - based questionnaire .
Exactly 50 % of the sample were male , 5.7 % in their teens , 12.9 % in their twenties , 31.8 % in their thirties , 27.5 % in their forties , 11.3 % in their fifties , and 10.8 % aged sixty or older .
Note that the score in the results refers to the relative number of votes for each option , not a percentage of the total sample .
I ’d love to see number eight myself , so if any of my readers have suitable photos , please post them and I ’ll feature them on the site !
Number eleven is a Japanese habit of sticking a hand out in front to break through a crowd , often seen as someone tries to pass down a train for instance .
However , some foreigners have found that a bicycle bell works just as well .
I do n’t understand number sixteen !

Jackson Browne is suing John McCain for using the song " Running on Empty " in a campaign ad -- and the veteran rocker is also calling the candidate a great pretender when it comes to standing up for constitutional rights .
Browne , one of rock music 's most famous activists for liberal causes , is " incensed " that the presumptive Republican candidate for president has been using Browne 's signature 1977 song " Running on Empty " in campaign commercials , according to the singer - songwriter 's attorney .
Browne filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against both McCain and the Republican National Committee on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the use of the forlorn arena anthem or any other Browne compositions , as well as damages .
They may be suing the wrong people .
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers tells our colleague Seema Mehta in Colorado that the ad in question is not a McCain campaign ad but one put together by the Ohio Republican Party .
But Browne 's attorney , Lawrence Y . Iser , says they have the right defendants .
" We have sued the Ohio Republican Party as well , and we have been informed and believe that McCain and his campaign were well aware of the ad .
We are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in Ohio and Pennsylvania ....
The fact that it appears on the Internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states . "
Iser said the lawsuit " is not politically motivated .
It 's a copyright infringement lawsuit , pure and simple , but the fact that Sen.
McCain has used this song in a hit - piece on Barack Obama is anathema to Jackson . "
Iser claims the McCain campaign has a track record of using music without permission .
" They used a John Mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an ABBA song and a Frankie Valli song -- it 's ridiculous and it's setting a terrible example , " Iser said .
" It 's shocking that they do n't even attempt to get permission .
There 's no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president .
The music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights , and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well .
The copyright protections are derived from the Constitution itself . "
In the commercial in question , Barack Obama is mocked for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation .
The suit claims that use of the song violates the Lanham Act by falsely implying that Browne is associated with or endorses the McCain candidacy .
The suit also claims the commercial violates Browne 's right of publicity under California law .

It has often been said that change is the only constant in the 21st Century .
And there is little doubt that the restless tone of these times is something that the web has helped to accelerate .
But the only reason that the net and the web can cope with that punishing pace is thanks to work done four decades ago by British mathematician Donald Davies at the UK's National Physical Laboratory ( NPL ) .
On 5 August 1968 Dr Davies gave the first public presentation of work he had been doing on a method of moving data around computer networks called " packet switching " .
The idea may sound mundane but , said John Pethica , chief science advisor at the NPL , the modern world would be a lot slower without it .
The internet , mobile phone networks and fixed line phones now all use the principles Davies and his team established to cram as much data as they can down the cables and wires making up the world 's telecommunication networks .
Clogged pipes Dr Pethica said the urge to find a better way to handle data emerged when computer networks were almost unheard of .
Donald Davies found a way to help networks route data efficiently
At that time making a phone call involved creating a dedicated circuit between the handset of a caller and the person they wanted to chat to .
" A lot of people realised that point - to - point was going to be a big problem , even for telephones even before they thought about computers , " said Dr Pethica .
" The problem was how you turn it away from that . "
The problem with human speech is that most of it is made up of silence - be that the pauses between words , time taken to breathe or gaps when one person waits for another to speak .
Using most of a telephone network to transmit silence is not a very efficient use of that resource .
Far better would be to find a way to fill the blank spots with the moments from others calls when those folk were speaking .
Dr Pethica said many in the computer world in the late 60s were thinking about how to solve this problem .
" There were other ideas around , like Paul Baran at Rand , but they were nowhere near as useful as what Donald Davies did in terms of size of packets and nodes , " said Dr Pethica .
" It was Donald who had the idea of making a set of nodes that you send packets of data to that find their own way through , " said Dr Pethica .
The insight of Dr Davies and his team was to slice data , be that a chat on the phone , an e-mail or a picture , into separate pieces or packets .
These are then put on the network and rely on the intelligence of nodes in the network to help them wend their way to their destination .
Once there they are re-assembled into the right order .
Future proof Dr Pethica said Davies ' team worked out the mathematics that optimised such an approach - an idea that has proved its usefulness by still being in use today .
Davies ' team proved the concept and built prototype computer networks .
Error correction schemes included in the technology helped it cope with the poor quality of phone lines in use in the late 1960s , said Dr Pethica .
In more modern times those schemes help ensure data makes it across the busy lanes of the internet .
Davies and his colleagues went further than just establishing the concept for packet switching - they also build the first computer networks and proved their ideas could work .
" They had a whole series of early computers at NPL that they turned in to a local area network ( Lan ) , " said Dr Pethica .
He pointed out that the NPL scientists built such a network far in advance of the day when such things would become the common way to link up machines in an office .
" The important breakthrough that he and his team made was to build the Lan and make it work , " he said .
Even before Dr Davies presented his work publicly , news of it had spread through the international computer science community .
As a result he was invited to talk about it to a team from the US Advanced Research Project Agency ( Arpa ) working on the fledgling internet .
The principles he established were rolled in to the technology to make that network function .
Dr Pethica said packet switching idea was developed with an eye on the future and how a computer network might grow .
Forty years on the scalability in the Dr Davies insight is still proving its worth , he said .

Actor Woody Harrelson poses during a portrait session to promote his film " The Grand " , a comedy set in the world of professional poker , at a hotel in Hollywood , California , March 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Woody Harrelson is about to bash some brains and battle zombies .
The actor has signed on to star in the horror comedy “ Zombieland , ” which Ruben Fleischer is directing for Columbia Pictures .
Written by the team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick ( “ The Joe Schmo Show ” ) , “ Zombieland ” revolves around a mismatched pair of survivors who find friendship and redemption in a world overrun by zombies .

Both Apple 's second - generation iPod touch and fourth - generation iPod nano are expected to be widely available at Apple Retail stores today .
The folks at iFixIt have already snagged one of each , tore them down , and weighed in with some observations .
Both the touch 's 3.5 - inch LCD display as well as its Lithium -ion polymer battery are held in place with strips of double - sided tape .
The WiFi antenna and circuitry , which are located at the top of the unit , are connected to the main logic board by wide orange cable that were designed to prevent external noise from interfering with the digital signals as they travel along the device , iFix It says .
The specialty online reseller , which offers replacement parts for Macs and iPods , was particularly excited by its discovery of an unpublicized Broadcom BCM4325 Bluetooth chip within the device .
The particular chipset supports BT2.1 +EDR , and is necessary for the touch 's built - in support of Nike +
iPod technology .
It 's unclear , however , whether the chip supports A2DP , which would pave the way for Apple and third - party developers to introduce stereo headphones for the player .
i FixIt also discovered brown rectangular component centered about three quarters of the way down the touch 's logic board , which is suspected to be the device 's speaker .
Other discoveries include a 3.7 V Lithium -ion polymer battery with part number 616-0404 , NAND flash memory from Micron with part number 29F64G08TAA , and an Apple - branded Samsung - manufactured ARM processor with SDRAM that 's similar to the one employed by the iPhone .
Separately , iFixIt dissected the new iPod nano and observed that the unit 's 3.2 mm wide dock connector " looks pretty big compared to the iPod " itself , making it unlikely that Apple will be able to slim down player any further without developing a new dock connector .
A particularly surprising find was that the new nano uses a real piece of curved glass , " about .7 mm thick on the edges , and 1.7 mm thick in the middle , " to cover the LCD display .
The glass is said to be completely separate from the player 's anodized aluminum enclosure , with nothing holding it in place outside the force of the adjacent components .
The LCD itself " is actually almost exactly the same size as the 3rd Gen Nano LCD , " iFix It said , with the only difference being a resolution of 240x320 rather than 320x240 .
Among the nano 's internal components are a Apple - branded ARM processor manufactured by Samsung in July with on - board DRAM on - package , three other small Apple - branded chips of unknown origin , and an 8 GB Toshiba flash chip .
" Unfortunately , the battery is soldered to the logic board , " iFix It said .
" Replacing the Nano 's battery is n't going to be easy . "
Census report shows rising poverty in US
By Barry Grey
27 August 2008
The Census Bureau reported Tuesday that the official poverty rate in the United States rose in 2007 to 12.5 percent , compared to 12.3 percent the previous year .
According to the bureau ’s American Community Survey , last year 37.3 million Americans were living below the income level , which , according to the government , signifies poverty .
This is an increase of 800,000 , or 2 percent , over the official poverty level for 2006 .
As damning as the official figures are , the real scale of poverty in the US is much higher .
The government set the poverty cut - off point for a family of four in 2007 at $ 21,203 .
Such an income means outright destitution .
Millions more Americans live in conditions that by any objective standard amount to poverty .
The number of children living below the official poverty line increased much more sharply in 2007 , rising to 13.3 million from 12.8 million in 2006 , an increase of 3.9 percent .
According to the government ’s figures , 17.4 percent of American children were in poverty last year .
The poverty level for Latinos and foreign - born Americans also rose more sharply than the overall increase .
The official poverty rates for both adults and children are considerably higher than their low points in the 1990s .
Between 2001 ( when the official poverty rate was 11.3 percent ) and 2007 — a period of economic expansion marked by a massive accumulation of wealth at the very top of American society — the poverty rate rose by 10.6 percent .
The rate for 2007 marked the biggest jump in poverty during an economic recovery in US history .
These figures constitute an indictment of American capitalism and both of its major political parties , which have carried out a ruthless policy of tax cuts for the rich , reductions in social programs , and deregulation of big business for the purpose of redistributing the national wealth from the working class to the financial elite and facilitating an orgy of corporate speculation and profiteering .
The result of these “ free market ” policies is the current financial crisis and recession , which are having a devastating impact on working class living standards .
The Census Bureau report issued Tuesday does not take into account the collapse of the housing market and wave of home foreclosures , the sharp rise in inflation , and the jump in unemployment , all of which have gathered steam since the beginning of 2008 .
“ Things are a lot worse than these numbers show , ” said Douglas Besharov , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute .
“ If you measured poverty today , it would probably be much higher than the report said . ”
Detroit is the most impoverished large city in the United States , according to the Census Bureau report .
Approximately one in three Detroiters lives below the official poverty level .
Cleveland , Buffalo , El Paso , Memphis , Miami , Milwaukee , Newark , Philadelphia and Cincinnati round out the top 10 most impoverished cities with populations of 250,000 or more .
Income levels in Michigan give an indication of the immense growth of economic disparities , which has accelerated over the past decade .
The township of West Bloomfield , a half - hour ’s drive from Detroit , is on the list of places with populations of 65,000 to 250,000 that have the highest median household income at $ 99,000 .
The social devastation wrought by waves of auto plant closures is reflected in the median household income figure for Flint , once the center of the General Motors manufacturing empire .
It hovers near the official poverty level for a family of five at $ 26,000 .
According to the Census report , overall median household income in the US , adjusted for inflation , rose 1.3 percent in 2007 from the year before , to $ 50,233 .
However , inflation - adjusted income for working people has declined sharply since the beginning of the last economic expansion in 2001 .
“ For poverty and median income , this was the worst economic expansion on record , ” said Robert Greenstein , executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
“ The gains from the expansion that started at the end of ‘01 were concentrated among higher - income Americans . ”
According to Jared Bernstein , senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute , had workers continued to receive the income increases they obtained in the 1990s , they would have seen a jump in earnings of $ 2,600 between 2001 and 2007 .
Instead , income decreased by $ 300 .
Moreover , the real income of American workers has dropped sharply this year .
The most recent Bureau of Labor statistics report found that real average weekly earnings fell by 0.8 percent from June to July .
Over the past year , weekly earnings fell by 3.1 percent .
Thus , the average household now earns $ 1,500 less than it would if wages had kept pace with inflation over the past 12 months .
The Census report noted that the median income gap between women and men working full - time closed to its smallest level ever in 2007 .
Women averaged 78 percent of what men earned .
But the Census found that a major reason the gap is shrinking is that men ’s earnings have been flat .
On health insurance , the report showed a small decrease in the number of uninsured Americans from 2006 to 2007 .
The Census Bureau said some 45.7 million people , or 15.3 percent , had no coverage , down from 47 million , or 15.8 percent , in 2006 .
However , the number and rate of uninsured are higher today than they were at the outset of the Bush administration in 2001 .
That year , 39.8 million people , or 14.1 percent , were uninsured .
And the share of Americans with employer - based coverage fell for the seventh year in a row .
It is now down to 59.3 percent , from 62.6 percent in 2001 .
Other economic news reported this week points to a further growth of recession , promising to fuel a sharper increase in poverty .
According to the S&P / Case - Shiller index , home prices continued to fall in June , declining 0.6 percent from May .
In the second quarter of this , home prices plummeted by 15.4 percent .
In 10 major metropolitan areas , they were down 17 percent in June from the year before .
Moreover , the banking crisis that is fueling the recession is assuming ever - larger dimensions .
In its latest quarterly report on the banking industry , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Tuesday raised the number of banks on its list of “ problem ” lenders to 117 , up from 90 at the end of March .
On Friday , state and federal regulators closed another regional bank , Columbian Bank and Trust of Topeka , Kansas , the ninth bank to fail so far this year and the fifth since mid-July .
How To Tell Her You 've Cheated
Tell Her You 've Cheated
Page 1 of 2
You ’ve been a bad boy and now you have to come clean .
Whether you were caught up in a moment of passion with a stranger or carried on a long affair with a mistress behind her back , telling your girlfriend you ’ve cheated is no easy task .
Because we realize this is quite a daunting prospect , we 're going to let you in on just how to tell her you 've cheated — and you may just come away with all your limbs and extremities intact .
Be sure you want to tell her
Figure out your reasons for telling
Occasionally , telling might do more harm than good to your relationship .
If you ’ve slipped in the fidelity department , but know that it was a huge mistake and are confident that you ’ll never do it again , you may want to keep it to yourself .
It all depends on how well you can live with the guilt .
If you think that it will eat at you until you ’re forced to eventually reveal your transgression , get it over with now .
You should either tell immediately or not at all .
The middle ground in this situation is dangerous Ideally , the reason you want to tell your partner is to be honest and open about your indiscretion .
Telling her because the other woman has threatened to tell her first is not the most noble of reasons , but it is valid .
The truth should always come from you .
If she hears it from someone else , it will be that much harder on her , especially if it ’s coming from the other woman .
If you want to tell her about your fidelity faux pas because you ’re hoping it will hurt her , you either need serious therapy or a new relationship .
If you ’re hoping that hearing about your affair will make her so angry that she ’ll break up with you , try being a man and breaking it off yourself .
You obviously do n’t want to be in the relationship and although you may think revealing an affair is an easy way to get out of it , it is a cowardly route to take .
Timing is everything
Time is of the essence when it comes to revealing an affair .
The more time that passes between the event and your confession , the more trouble you ’ll have convincing her that you sincerely regret it and want to make it right .
However , you also want to try to create the best situation in which to have the dreaded conversation .
For the best possible results , do not reveal your secret to her in public , while she ’s stressed out about work or after she tells you about a fight she ’s having with her best friend .
Once you know how to tell her you 've cheated , you may be able to save the relationship ...
One of the things that I love about Python is that it has all the documentation you ever need ( all right , almost ) in the code itself .
Many moons ago , the very first framework I wrote in ActionScript ( Flash 5 ) used the same technique by placing documentation on the activation objects of functions ( and it would be cool to see that practice make a comeback in AS3 . )
In Python , to find out what properties an object has , you just ask for a listing .
The following , for example , shows you all properties and methods on the os module .
import os dir ( os )
In fact , I was doing this just today as I wanted to find out which functions are available for working with folders for the automatic restore feature I 'm building for my Google App Engine backup solution .
Of course , that brings back a lot of items .
But have no fear , because we have regular expressions .
I 've grown to loooooove regular expressions thanks to being finally forced to learn them and use them daily in Django .
I 'm probably do n't write the most concise ones but I 've gotten to the point where I use them all the time and they simplify my life to no end .
So , to see just the methods that have " dir " in them :
import re r = r'( ^.*?dir.*?$ ) ' rc = re.compile (r ) matches = map( rc.match , dir ( os ) ) [ x.groups ( ) for x in matches if not x == None ]
And Bob 's your uncle .
( Oh yeah , and list comprehensions rock too ! )
And the coolest thing is that since Python is interpreted , I 'm doing all this in the excellent IPython shell and using the language to learn the language and as a reference .
The more I use Python , the more I love it .
They really did everything right .
And that success , no doubt , is firmly planted in the unerring focus and the core values instilled in the language by Guido -- you 're a freakin ' genius , dude , and it gives me no end of confidence in Google App Engine that you 're on the project ! :)
Telco immunity is the icing , not the cake
Last month , the House of Representatives passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , Congress 's latest response to President Bush 's demands for expanded eavesdropping authority .
The Democratic leadership , seemingly intent on avoiding real debate on the proposal , scheduled the final vote just a day after the bill was introduced in the House .
Touted by Democratic leaders as a " compromise , " it was supported almost unanimously by House Republicans and opposed by a majority of Democrats .
The 114 - page bill was pushed through the House so quickly that there was no real time to debate its many complex provisions .
This may explain why the telecom immunity provision has received so much attention in the media : it is much easier to explain to readers not familiar with the intricacies of surveillance law than the other provisions .
But as important as the immunity issue is , the legislation also makes many prospective changes to surveillance law that will profoundly impact our privacy rights for years to come .
Specifically , the new legislation dramatically expands the government 's ability to wiretap without meaningful judicial oversight , by redefining " oversight " so that the feds can drag their feet on getting authorization almost indefinitely .
It also gives the feds unprecedented new latitude in selecting eavesdropping targets , latitude that could be used to collect information on non-terrorist - related activities like P2P copyright infringement and online gambling .
In short , the FISA Amendments
Act of 2008 opens up loopholes so large that the feds could drive a truck loaded down with purloined civil liberties through it .
So the telecom immunity stuff is just the smoke ; let 's take a look at the fire .
The importance of judicial scrutiny
The most fundamental question in the FISA debate is whether judicial oversight will be required when the government spies on international communications originating on American soil .
FISA has never limited spying on purely foreign communications , but under current law , the government must obtain court approval to tap a phone line or fiber optic cable in the United States , even if the other end of the communication is abroad .
An application for a FISA warrant must specify the person or organization being targeted and present evidence that the target is an " agent of a foreign power , " such as the Chinese government or Al Qaeda .
The Bush administration has chafed at these restrictions , insisting that the president has the inherent authority to eavesdrop on suspected terrorists without court oversight .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell argues that that the FISA process is so cumbersome that it impedes the intelligence community 's efforts to spy on terrorists .
Civil libertarians disagree , noting that FISA sets a lower bar for approving surveillance than the process for obtaining ordinary criminal warrants .
And in emergency cases , FISA allows the government to begin spying immediately and seek a warrant after the fact .
Most importantly , civil liberties groups emphasize that without judicial oversight , there is no way to know if the government is respecting any limits that Congress establishes .
Consider , for example , the case of National Security Letters , administrative subpoenas that the Patriot Act allows the FBI to issue without court oversight .
Last year a government audit last year found hundreds of cases in which the FBI had issued NSLs without following even the permissive rules of the Patriot Act .
Civil libertarians warn that similar corner - cutting is inevitable if the NSA is allowed to choose eavesdropping targets without judicial scrutiny .
No individual warrants for international calls
When it comes to judicial oversight of domestic - to - foreign calls , the legislation the House passed last month is an unambiguous victory for the White House and a defeat for civil libertarians .
The legislation establishes a new procedure whereby the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence can sign off on " authorizations " of surveillance programs " targeting people reasonably believed to be located outside the United States . "
The government is required to submit a " certification " to the FISA court describing the surveillance plan and the " minimization " procedures that will be used to avoid intercepting too many communications of American citizens .
However , the government is not required to " identify the specific facilities , places , premises , or property " at which the eavesdropping will occur .
The specific eavesdropping targets will be at the NSA 's discretion and unreviewed by a judge .
Moreover , the judge 's review of the government 's " certification " is much more limited than the scrutiny now given to FISA applications .
The judge is permitted only to confirm that the certification " contains all the required elements , " that the targeting procedures are " reasonably designed " to target foreigners , and that minimization procedures have been established .
Crucially , there appears to be no limit to the breadth of " authorizations " the government might issue .
So , for example , a single " authorization " might cover the interception of all international traffic passing through AT&T's San Francisco facility , with complex software algorithms deciding which communications are retained for the examination of human analysts .
Without a list of specific targets , and without a background in computer programming , a judge is unlikely to be able to evaluate whether such software is properly " targeted " at foreigners .
The House legislation also drastically extends the timeline for reviewing surveillance activities , potentially allowing the government to commence eavesdropping and then drag out judicial review for months .
Under existing law , the government must obtain judicial approval within 72 hours of the start of emergency wiretapping .
In contrast , the judicial review of " certifications " can stretch out as long as four months .
After beginning eavesdropping , the government has a week to submit its " certification " to the FISA court , which has 30 days to review the application .
If the judge finds problems with the certification , the government can continue eavesdropping for another 30 days before it is required to comply with the order .
And the government can buy still more time by filing an appeal to the FISA Court of Review .
The appeals court may take as long as 60 days to make its decision , and the government will often be allowed to continue eavesdropping throughout the process of judicial review .
This means that in many cases , the government will have completed its spying activities long before the courts reach a decision on its legality .
No " targeting " Americans
The legislation does provide modestly enhanced protections for Americans living overseas .
The " authorizations " described in the previous section are only available when they " target " those who are not American citizens or legal residents .
When the target of an eavesdropping program is an American , the government must satisfy more stringent requirements , including the traditional requirement that the target is an " agent of a foreign power . "
The surveillance also must cease within seven days if judicial approval for it is not forthcoming .
This section is a modest restriction on the government 's prior eavesdropping powers .
Traditionally , FISA did not govern purely overseas eavesdropping activities , even if they targeted American citizens .
Under the new legislation , the government will need court approval to " target " Americans overseas , even when the surveillance is conducted overseas .
However , as a practical matter , this enhancement of Americans ' privacy rights may prove extremely limited .
The government may not " target " Americans under the broad " authorizations " discussed in the previous section , and in some cases the government may discard information obtained about Americans as part of the required " minimization " procedures , but the government would retain significant latitude to decide which information it retains .
The paradoxical consequence is that broader wiretapping orders may be approved more easily than narrower ones .
For example , the government could not unilaterally " authorize " the " targeting " of a particular San Francisco resident 's international communications .
However , it could " authorize " a dragnet surveillance program that intercepted the international communications of all San Francisco residents under the pretext that it was " targeting " any foreign terrorists who might happen to communicate with San Francisco residents .
This is particularly troubling when we remember that in 2002 , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review held that FISA does not prohibit coordination between foreign intelligence gathering and domestic law enforcement .
That suggests that the FBI could ask the NSA to tailor its filters to intercept evidence of Internet gambling , copyright infringement , or other ordinary crimes .
The Americans whose communications were turned over could not be the " target " of the surveillance , but the House legislation requires only that foreign intelligence gathering be " a significant purpose " of eavesdropping programs .
If a terrorist surveillance program also catches American citizens who are gambling or infringing copyright law , that 's even better !
If there ’s one thing that movies tell us about life , it ’s that our existence is a Hobbesian gamble : Nasty , brutish , and short .
In any given U.S. film , death can come at any time , typically in violent fashion .
But the fear and anticipation that come from knowing your death is fast approaching can also engender meaningful reflections .
The following pre-death monologues are ( mostly ) given by characters who know that it ’s all about to come to an end .
Perhaps it ’s during those tense moments , before someone ’s life is extinguished , that you can truly get a window into someone ’s soul .
When faced with the ultimate loss , are they rebellious ?
Resigned ?
Relieved ?
As a consequence of this momentary window , these monologues are by turns hilarious , saddening , moving , and profound .

American Beauty : Kevin Spacey Gets Philosophical About Life
Deceased : Lester Burnham
Unfortunately , American Beauty has not aged well ; it currently shares a place on the DVD shelf with other forgotten Best Picture winners like The English Patient and Crash .
Yet despite its forgettability , it offers a really interesting window into Alan Ball ’s philosophical take on life before he delved full bore into it on Six Feet Under .
In this monologue , which represents the timeless / placeless and disembodied reflections of Lester Burnham , we ’re meant to recognize that maybe we have more to give thanks for than we think .
Text : I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die .
First of all , that one second is n’t a second at all , it stretches on forever , like an ocean of time …
For me , it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp , watching falling stars …
And yellow leaves , from the maple trees , that lined my street …
Or my grandmother ’s hands , and the way her skin seemed like paper …
And the first time I saw my cousin Tony ’s brand new Firebird … And Janie… And Janie… And… Carolyn .
I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me … but it ’s hard to stay mad , when there ’s so much beauty in the world .
Sometimes I feel like I ’m seeing it all at once , and it ’s too much , my heart fills up like a balloon that ’s about to burst …
And then I remember to relax , and stop trying to hold on to it , and then it flows through me like rain and I can’t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life …
You have no idea what I ’m talking about , I ’m sure .
But do n’t worry … you will someday .

Se7en : Kevin Spacey Gets Philosophical About Death
Deceased : John Doe
Despite the people that think of Se7en as a gimmicky movie that relies on John Doe ’s methods of death to keep the viewer interested , I still think that Andrew Kevin Walker ’s script was deeper than people gave it credit for ( though not by too much ) .
At its best , it was a commentary on our times , a No Country for Old Men–style tale , if No Country for Old Men had been made as a conventional thriller and been directed by David Fincher .
But none of that really applies to this speech at the end by Kevin Spacey .
In this monologues , Spacey reveals the gut - wrenching information of his day ’s misdeeds to baby - faced detective David Mills .
The resulting “ Will he or wo n’t he ” tension is still one of the most tense scenes of any movie , at least the first time around .

True Romance : Dennis Hopper Teaches Genealogy
Deceased : Clifford Worley
Here by popular demand :
This scene from Tarantino ’s ( written , not directed )
True Romance is Dennis Hopper at his best – and yes , that will be the only time I will ever use the phrase “ Dennis Hopper at his best . ”
Picture yourself in his shoes : Christopher Walken and some henchmen have just taken you hostage , threatening you to torture you in order that you may reveal your son ’s whereabouts .
Most people would just tell the information and wait for a quick death .
Hopper chooses to take this opportunity to make racially inflammatory remarks to the mafia , knowing that great pain probably awaits .
The results are those of cinematic legend .

Blade Runner : Rutger Hauer Breaks Your Heart
Deceased : Roy Batty
Some people find this speech lame , but I read a really interesting interpretation of this scene on the message boards at CHUD :
The whole film is about Roy Batty ’s quasi - misguided desire to extend his life .
He is bigger , stronger , and faster than most humans but his emotional maturity is like that of a teenager .
Thus , this speech is n’t overly melodramatic due to bad script - writing – it ’s that way because of his current condition and emotional state .
The allegory of the white dove flying into the night might be too much for some – to the rest of us Blade Runner fans , it ’s heart - breaking .

Good afternoon , gentlemen .
I am a HAL 9000 computer .
I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana , Illinois on the 12th of January 1992 .
My instructor was Mr. Langley , and he taught me to sing a song .
If you ’d like to hear it I can sing it for you …Daisy , Daisy , give me your answer do .
I ’m half crazy all for the love of you .
It wo n’t be a stylish marriage , I ca n’t afford a carriage .
But you ’ll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two .

After the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 and again after Hurricane Katrina , the right - wing evangelical fundamentalist establishment leaders said – both times – that each one was the result of God ’s wrath because of the acceptance of homosexuals as human beings .
Then they attacked the center and left for “ blaming America first ” for the September 11 attacks , when non-Republicans the country over said , “ whoa , whoa , whoa .
Why did they attack us ?
They say it ’s because of our foreign policy ?
hmm. maybe we should look at that … ” ( by the way , the President immediately and quietly met a handful of Al Qaida ’s demands , like , say , pulling troops out of Saudi Arabia … )
They won a presidential election doing that .
When Hurricane Katrina hit , most people realized that it could not be blamed on Democrats ( though I am sure they tried to find a way … ) , but it did n’t stop the right wing from blaming the gays and the loose morals of the left .
They lost the Senate and the House doing that .
But really , if God does control the weather ( and why would n’t he , really ?
After all , if he is omnipotent enough to answer that prayer about a winning season for the Red Sox or help you find your car keys , certainly he ’s omnipotent enough to wing a few storms around ) , I do n’t think he is voting Republican this year .
Twice this year , hurricanes have completely disrupted major McCain events , but the weather has completely favored Obama events .
Think about it .
Back in July , on Obama ’s World Tour , while he was speaking on a gorgeous day in Berlin , John McCain had to cancel his big photo op and front page grab on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico because a hurricane rolled through .
Now , after Obama held an outdoor rally in front of 84,000 people on a beautiful summer night in Denver , all the talk is about Hurricane Gustav and its potential Category 5 impact on the Louisiana coast almost three years to the day that Katrina laid bare once and for all the incompetence of the Bush Administration .
I mean , I may not be one to believe that an all - powerful being gets
His jollies punishing those
He is supposed to love and favor .
But if I did , I would certainly not find it surprising at all that the God who teaches “ love thy neighbor ” ( and built his name on forgiveness and opposes adultery and divorce and talks about “ thou shalt not kill ” and the “ meek ” inheriting the earth and all that ) would be trying to slow the run of a warmongering lifelong military man who sings ‘ bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran ’ and divorced the seriously injured wife that waited for him while he was a POW for a woman he calls a cunt .
Because as near as I can tell from the Bible , He hates those things .

Primates are amazingly varied , coming in all shapes , sizes and species ranging from one ounce to hundreds of pounds .
Many primates have amazingly complex social structures , long evolutionary histories and , unfortunately , many also have harrowing tales of near - extinction in their various microhabitats around the world – often at the hands of the most infamous and far - spread primates : humans .
Gorillas are the largest primates in the world .
They live on the floor of the forest areas of Africa .
These huge creatures can grow up to 5 feet 9 inches tall and weigh as much as 450 pounds .
And live up to about 50 years .
Their DNA is 98%- 99 % the same as that of human beings and that makes them our second closest relative after the chimpanzee .
Their main diet is leaves , fruit and shoots but they also eat insects along with this .
Lowland gorillas consume more fruit and mountain gorillas eat more roots and stems due to availability .
The Golden Snub - nosed Monkey is found mostly in the Szechuan region of China and its main diet is lichen although it can adjust to eating other vegetation depending on the season .
This monkey spends of its time in the tree tops and is not often seen on the ground .
Populations are falling steadily and the biggest threat to the golden snub - nosed monkey is habitat loss caused by encroaching human development .
Woolly Monkeys originated from the rain forests of Columbia , Ecuador , Brazil and Peru and there are four known species .
This monkey has a prehensile tail which means that it can use its tail to hold onto and hang from things .
When it comes to numbers in the wild , these beautiful creatures are on the threatened species list .
They live in groups of up to 45 individuals and subsist on seeds , fruit , nuts and leaves .
They are very vocal creatures and have a highly developed hierarchy within their groups .
Their main predator is humans who hunt them for the pet trade and for meat .
The Lar Gibbon , also called the White - handed gibbon , is native to China and the Malay Peninsula although it is now though to have disappeared totally from China .
The color of the Lar Gibbon varies from light brown to black and they have long hands but no tails .
The natural habitat of the Lar Gibbon in South East Asia is rapidly being destroyed and their numbers are falling accordingly .
They are often hunted for meat and parents are slaughtered in order to capture the young for the pet trade .
Squirrel Monkeys originate from South America .
The fur on this small monkey ranges from an olive green color around the shoulder areas through to orange and yellow on its back and arms .
They live in large groups of up to five hundred individuals feeding on everything from small insects to fruit .
These monkeys are still found in quite large numbers at the moment even though they are killed for meat and captured for medical research .
However , like other primate forest dwellers their environment is shrinking in size as human development encroaches on the forest .
( images via wikipedia and mybarina )
The White Fronted Capuchin is found in central and south America , especially in Paraguay .
The monkey gets its name from its white fronted appearance that was said to be like that of the Capuchin monks .
They all have ‘ black cap ’ on their heads and can reach a length of twenty - two inches .
Their main predators are falcons , snakes and cats but they are also killed by humans for meat and because they will eat almost anything including fish and shellfish if they get the opportunity .
In many areas they are being forced out by civilization .
All these fabulous primates are threatened by human greed for profit ( capture for the pet trade and meat ) and the ceaseless onslaught of human habitation which is destroying their natural habitats .
But more than anything else , it was a Speech to Nowhere because for all the acclaim , the great bulk of it was devoted to one thing , and that is the one thing that millions of Americans are talking about in 2008 when we talk about " change " -- to the ugliest kind of " pit bull " politics , to use Palin 's words , that tear down the other side with cheap ad hominem attacks , surrounded by a cloud of half - truths ( uh , those " Greek columns " ... did you actually even watch Obama 's speech ?
Because there were n't any ) and ridiculous innuendo about " parting the waters " which means nothing but fires up a big hockey rink full of Dittoheads .
These kind of vicious attacks -- without having the grace to acknowledge that , despite some real differences on issues with Obama , that he has already accomplished something impressive that says something positive about America and the progress we 've made -- were utterly lacking in class .
And this is what Tom Brokaw considers " winning " -- have we really sunk that low as a nation ?.
The people of America want and deserve a real debate , now trash talk from the basketball point guard who was once called " Sarah Barracuda . "

Enlarge By Czarek Sokolowski , AP Maria Lopuszanska , left , was the daughter of Polish Catholics who rescued Janina Pietrasiak , right , the daughter of Polish Jews who died during the World War II .
WARSAW ( AP ) 
They are two silver - haired ladies with a special bond forged in the Holocaust .
One is the daughter of Jews who perished under the Nazis , the other her Roman Catholic rescuer .
Today Janina Pietrasiak , 74 , and Maria Lopuszanska , 79 , live like sisters just around the corner from each other in a Warsaw neighborhood shaded by chestnut trees .
They see each other every day , tend to each other 's needs , even finish each other 's sentences .
Their story is a testament to how devotion born of deep adversity can endure for a lifetime and how the Holocaust survivors ' exhortation " never forget " can find resonance as much in acts of great generosity as in those of unspeakable depravity .
During several hours with The Associated Press , the women relived the events that merged their lives while sitting side - by - side in Maria 's tiny room in a nursing home , a five - minute walk from the modest apartment where Janina lives alone .
Maria was the teenage daughter of members of the Polish anti-Nazi underground who gave shelter in their Warsaw apartment in 1942 to Janina and her mother , Roza Feldman .
Feldman soon died of tuberculosis , her strength depleted by the cold and hunger she had endured before escaping from the Krakow Ghetto .
After that , Janina , not yet 8 when she joined the Catholic home , clung desperately to her new family and was baptized to fit in with them and increase her chances of survival under the Nazis .
After the war , she gave up the chance to live with an uncle in the United States — sealing a fate lived out for decades behind the Iron Curtain as Poland came under communist rule .
" I was very afraid to leave their family because I was happy I had a family , and I kept holding on to them all the time , trying not to lose them , " she said .
" It was the family that raised me , that rescued me .
I also did n't want to leave Poland — I thought it was the country that let me live . "
The bond deepened during the ill - fated Warsaw Uprising of 1944 , when the girls had to fend for themselves because Maria 's father was ill and her mother had taken up arms against the Nazis in the streets of the capital .
They saw bombs exploding , corpses and body parts strewn on the streets , narrowly escaping death themselves more than once .
Both recalled how the younger Janina would bury herself in the older girl 's skirt as the bombs exploded .
" She was like a mother , " Janina said , reaching over and grasping the hem of Maria 's skirt as she remembered .
" She thought I was n't scared of anything , " Maria added .
" But I was 15 years old .
I was incredibly scared of the bombs .
I was no hero . "
Janina lost the most .
Her father died in Auschwitz .
Her only sibling , Ewa , survived the war but later committed suicide by inhaling gas .
And the death of her beloved mother fills her with pain to this day .
Through the years , Janina suffered bouts of depression so severe that she was forced to retire early at age 59 from her work as a translator , and went on medication .
" I think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life .
It stays with you all the time , what you go through .
You can't throw it out of your memory , " she said .
Her marriage to a devout Roman Catholic brought a daughter , but also the fresh pain of a husband , from whom she is now separated , who taunted her with anti-Semitic remarks .
" My husband is very religious and does n't especially care for the Jews , " she said .
" Anytime he tried to say something against the Jews , I would tell him , ' you forget who I am . " '
Despite her own ordeals , including a battle with leukemia now in remission , the main focus in her life is the woman she calls her sister .
Maria lives on a pension so small that after paying her nursing home , she only has $ 145 left over — most of which the breast cancer survivor needs for medicine .
After the war she became an economist , married and had three children .
Her room is filled with photos of her grandchildren , along with crucifixes .
Her husband died in 1987 .
Janina became a regular Mass attendee and did n't seek contact with Jews until 1997 — and then it was only in an attempt to seek recognition for Maria .
She contacted the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem , which then bestowed the title of " Righteous Among the Nations " to Maria and to her parents , Henryk and Janina Jetkiewicz .
The title , reserved for non-Jews who saved Jews , has gone to people from 44 countries .
On Jan.
1 , Poles made up the largest number , 6,066 , followed by the Netherlands with 4,863 .
Thanks to her recognition as a rescuer , Maria receives $ 1,200 per year from the New York - based Jewish Foundation for the Righteous , which helps with the medicine and a few extras such as this year 's summer holiday to the Warsaw countryside .
As the afternoon wore on , the women moved to Maria 's tiny terrace ringed by peach - colored geraniums and gazed out over the nursing home 's lush and blooming garden .
Janina wiped a fleck of lint from Maria 's cheek .
Maria then reached over and tenderly straightened out her sister 's rumpled dress .

It ’s all too obvious why Sarah Palin got the VP nod .
And Saturday Night Live makes this point most brilliantly : Hillary Clinton .
Though I wish the GOP was progressive enough to have a woman on the presidential ticket .
That is , based on merit and not merely as a political pawn .
Much in the same vein , I would also love for wars to be fought with hugs and Skittles .
I really do n’t see that one happening either .
Since the announcement of Palin joining the Republican ticket , a lot of buzz has been made about the Alaskan Governor .
For example , her limp stance on Global Warming .
Then there ’s her support of the Bridge to Nowhere .
Do n’t forget the whole Troopergate fiasco .
And sometimes it ’s even hard to tell if she is with us or against us ; mostly against , by the way .
And the media - machine that gnawed away for eighteen months on the Obama–Clinton flavored primary quickly shifted to the virtual unknown .
Heck , I have done so myself !
And while I ’d like to continue waxing politically about her qualifications for the VP slot , I am stuck – somewhat reluctantly – with only one thing to say : MILF .
Thank you Saturday Night Live !
[ hulu=http://www.hulu.com/embed/wyUOSXxioQGZEeIn9cTcyw]
Yes , Palin was picked because of Clinton .
Duh !
It ’s calculated , shameless and oh so very very smart .
But why does it matter ?
Mostly because McCain is so very very old .
The GOP is no stranger to having a token VP – ahem … Dan Quayle !
But with McCain having one foot in the grave , Palin ’s political stance matters more than those prior .
It matters that the energy - expert - wanna - be does n’t think man ’s had anything to do with the climate crisis .
It matters that she backs an offshore drilling solution to our oil crisis .
But do n’t take my word for it , take hers .
In this series , I will be highlighting some of Sarah Palin ’s comments on everything from the environment to foreign policy .
Up next – The Sarah Palin Chronicles : The Environment , Part Two

The tutorial on delimited continuations was given together with Kenichi Asai ( Ochanomizu University , Japan ) in the evening before the Continuation Workshop 2011 .
The concept of continuations arises naturally in programming : a conditional branch selects a continuation from the two possible futures ; raising an exception discards a part of the continuation ; a tail - call or goto continues with the continuation .
Although continuations are implicitly manipulated in every language , manipulating them explicitly as first - class objects is rarely used because of the perceived difficulty .
This tutorial aims to give a gentle introduction to continuations and a taste of programming with first - class delimited continuations using the control operators shift and reset .
Assuming no prior knowledge on continuations , the tutorial helps participants write simple co-routines and non-deterministic searches .
The tutorial should make it easier to understand and appreciate the talks at CW 2011 .
We assume basic familiarity with functional programming languages , such as OCaml , Standard ML , Scheme , and Haskell .
No prior knowledge of continuations is needed .
Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops and program along .
Delicious and Diigo : Differ in What It Means to Be “ Social ”
August 15 , 2008 by Hutch Carpenter
Andy Brudtkuhlhas has a nice post , 6 Reasons Diigo is Better Than Delicious .
In the post , one of the reasons he cites for Diigo ’s being better is its social aspects :
Diigo has an extra level of social networking that Delicious does not provide – at least not in a usable manner .
You can connect with people that have similar interests based on what you tag .
I ’ve been playing with them a bit .
Here ’s an initial impression I have of how “ social ” works in the two bookmarking services :
Diigo uses content to find people
Delicious uses people to find content
Delicious , an original web 2.0 company , still has “ user - generated ” as its core raison d’être .
Diigo has the later - stage web 2.0 philosophy of being a “ social network ” .
Diigo : Social Is as Social Does
Diigo has been built to find people based on common bookmark and tag interests .
It has social network features throughout :
Finding people on Diigo is much easier than on Delicious Diigo generates user matches based on tag and bookmark compatibility User profiles
You can see who has visited your profile page
You can comment on the bookmarks of others
You can share bookmarks with specific users
Networking on Diigo Is Easier
A basic function – finding other users – is much easier on Diigo than on Delicious .
The graphic below shows the results of a search for my name :
On Delicious , you have to know someone ’s Delicious handle .
On Diigo , you can use a person ’s regular name .
Diigo ’s approach is more like that of today ’s various social networks :
Social networks make finding users easy .
So does Diigo .
Delicious does n’t .
Diigo Social Recommendations
Diigo attempts to match you to others based on common bookmarks and tags .
As the graphic below shows , it ’s not exactly Toluu - like in its matching .
Levels of compatibility at 2 % and 3 % do n’t quite inspire clicks for further investigation .
Social recommendations are a work - in - progress at Diigo .
Delicious does n’t do recommendations .
Diigo User Profiles
For each link , Diigo provides a user profile of everyone who bookmarked the link :
So when you check out others who bookmarked something you like , you can quickly determine if they are someone to whom you want to subscribe .
Delicious also lets you look at someone ’s activity , but you have to click on their handle to see their page .
There ’s no profile provided on the list of users who bookmarked a link .
Diigo Visitors Info , Commenting , Bookmark Sharing
I ’ll skip the screen shots for these Diigo functions .
But here ’s how they foster social networking :
Who visited my profile ?
Potential matches .
Also lets you know when your social network paid your bookmarks a visit .
Commenting .
Commenting enables discussion with others .
Socializing .
Bookmark sharing .
You can call out specific users with whom to share a bookmark .
Very social .
Delicious Has More of a Crowdsource Feel
Where Diigo is social , Delicious emphasizes the interests of all users .
What are people finding interesting .
That ’s not to say it does n’t have social network aspects .
On Delicious , you can :
Add users to your network
View your network ’s bookmarks
Become a ‘ fan ’ of someone
But Delicious pretty much stops there on the social aspects .
The rest of Delicious is centered around bringing order to the huge volume of crowdsourced bookmarks .
Delicious : Who Bookmarked That Link When ?
The new Delicious has a really cool timeline that shows who bookmarked a given link when :
That timeline is a thing of beauty .
Users , dates , tags , notes .
Where Diigo wants to get you socializing around a bookmark , Delicious wants to provide you with information about how a link fared with the public at large .
As mentioned above in the Diigo user profile section , Delicious does n’t provide user profiles in this listing .
Wrapping It Up
The new Delicious continues its mission of organizing a massive number of user - generated bookmarks and tags .
It looks cleaner , and I like the way information is presented .
Information organized by an army of user librarians .
“ Social ” in this context means your bookmarks and tags are exposed to others , and you can find related content based on what others are bookmarking and tagging .
People are the basis for discovering content .
Diigo wants people to interact via common interests in content .
It has a lot of social network hooks .
“ Social ” in this context means establishing and building relationships with others .
Content is the basis for finding people .
I ’d love to hear your thoughts on the different approaches of Delicious and Diigo .
And you can find me on both services :

You 've probably seen this movie before .
Deep - pocketed investors swarm research labs in Silicon Valley and fledgling companies in generic office parks , searching for world - changing technologies and the promise of untold profits .
Before long , the great Wall Street hype machine starts to crank into gear as a few highly buzzed stock offerings explode onto the market .
Business magazines pronounce the sector as the Next Big Thing .
And off in the distance , a few curmudgeonly killjoys start talking about a bubble eventually going bust .
Shades of the dot - com bubble - and - bust cycle are seen again on Wall Street , this time with a green tint .
Over the past few years , the media blitz about the threat of global warming , combined with a superspike in oil prices , has enabled green - technology entrepreneurs to raise billions of dollars in venture capital .
But stock investors , looking for opportunities in a down market , are pretty psyched up as well .
A quick glance at the shares of First Solar , Wall Street 's current favorite , is illustrative .
The thin - film solar cell maker made headlines as the " Google of solar " with a share price to match .
It hit $ 288 a share on July 16 , up more than 900 percent since the start of 2007 .
Energy Conversion Devices , another thin - film player , has seen its shares jump more than 100 percent this year .
Fueling the fire .
But whether companies are developing solar , wind , advanced biofuels , or any of a number of emerging clean - energy technologies , the combination of global economics , investor interest , and a forthcoming pro-green turn by Uncle Sam makes it hard to argue a long - run bear case against green stocks .
Of course , that sort of superoptimism is itself a prerequisite for a bubble .
But , hey , plenty of money can be made before a bubble goes bust .
And this one probably has a long way to go .
" We 're still in the very , very early stages of the game , " says Brian Fan , senior research director at the Cleantech Group .
" Is there a bubble ?
There is n't .
If valuations in some publicly traded sectors are out of whack , I think it 's a function of the fact there are too few opportunities for investors and there 's too much demand and appetite for exposure to these technologies . "
Just as investors in Chinese stocks like to point to market size as a compelling reason to snap up shares ( " Hey , if XYZ Co. can capture just 1 percent of the market . . . " ) , so do green investors .
Boosters tout most often the sheer magnitude of the energy market and the minimal penetration of any one green technology .
Currently , a mere 1.5 percent of American electricity generation comes from renewable sources .
Over in Silicon Valley , stalwart venture capital funds like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Khosla Ventures , headed by Sun Microsystems cofounder Vinod Khosla , are spreading huge bets around on a staggering variety of start - ups .
In the second quarter alone , some $ 2 billion in venture cash flowed into the sector , according to the Cleantech Group , an all - time record , beating out a $ 1.8 billion influx in the third quarter of 2007 .
Watch the VC funds ' spending for new investing ideas once markets improve and start - ups begin going public again in full force .
U.S. government support could soon be improving , too .
Almost everyone agrees that the next administration will be kinder to green technology than the current one .
John McCain has said he'd like to offer a $ 300 million prize to the inventor of a battery strong enough to power a car .
Barack Obama has made investing in clean energy a core element of his economic plan .
Both candidates also want to create a carbon emission cap - and - trade system , an almost seismic event for green - tech firms as companies would rush to meet new pollution regulations by adopting new technologies .
Make mine mini .
So how should investors play the bubble ?
First , they need to understand that rather than one megabubble , a more likely scenario is that a bunch of minibubbles in various subsectors would constantly percolate , bubble , and pop .
That 's certainly been the pattern so far .
Ethanol makers , for instance , saw a huge jump after a massive round of venture funding in 2005 .
In 2006 , Pacific Ethanol ( backed by Microsoft 's Bill Gates before his investment arm began selling last year ) jumped from around $ 10 a share to $ 40 for a brief moment .
It 's trading under $ 2 today .
Back in 2000 , Ballard Power Systems , a fuel cell maker that embodies the first huge run-up in venture investing in the battery sector , surged to $ 120 a share on hopes it would win the race to power the auto sector .
It trades at $ 4 today , having sold its automotive fuel cell business to Daimler and Ford earlier this year .
Others , like VeraSun , have seen their shares slump for years .
Solar companies like SunPower and Suntech Power Holdings have nosedived more than 40 percent this year on concerns about subsidy cuts and the high cost of polysilicon used to make traditional solar cells .
( First Solar 's rise happened in part because it does n't use the stuff to make its cells . )
" Advanced biofuels are starting to recover , " says Ted Sullivan , senior research analyst at Lux Research .
" Solar is on its way down .
The companies are still trading at 100 to 200 times [ earnings per share ] . "
Sullivan says the next miniboom will be in batteries and other storage technologies as demand grows for ways to hold all the energy produced using greener means .
In short , green is set to see some peaks and valleys .
Still , the industry 's big gains since 2004 mean near - term noise is n't worrying analysts who are still smitten with the sector 's long - term prospects , even with this year 's dip .
" I do n't think people appreciate how solar will be over the next few years and the role products will have worldwide in the energy infrastructure , " says Michael Carboy , an analyst with Signal Hill .
" The pullback in prices is more a reflection of a failure to understand the opportunity that the solar industry presents to the investment community over the next two years .
Step two or three years out , and people will regret not owning solar stocks . "
Wind power , the most established corner of the green sector , looks less volatile with most of the market in the hands of big players like General Electric , Siemens , and Spain 's Gamesa .
Emerging Energy Research , a consultancy , sees the wind industry growing at a 15 percent annual rate between 2007 and 2020 .
The Cleantech Index , a broad group of green stocks , swooned early this year but , unlike the rest of the market , managed to rebound .
It 's up a bit compared with a year ago .
So what could derail all this green optimism ?
First is the uncertain price of crude .
This year 's recent run to nearly $ 150 a barrel has been only a mild tail wind for green companies ' shares .
While the industry will endure even if oil prices fall back , the same can't be said for green stocks .
And remember that investing in the oil industry this year would have netted you far better gains than most green investments .
The iShares oil and gas exploration exchange - traded fund is up about 5 percent this year .
Most green ETF 's are in the red for 2008 .
As Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers shrivel into history , Barack Obama , John McCain and many other politicians are calling for more Wall Street regulation .
Perhaps campaign donations shelled out by both firms had something to do with the current state of the law .
Before being taken over by Bank of America , Merrill executives and employees had contributed almost $ 2.1 million to federal candidates and parties since the start of 2007 , according to Federal Election Commission records , gleaned from Congressional Quarterly 's Moneyline database .
Lehman employees , seeking bankruptcy protection , added $ 1.9 million .
Insurance giant AIG , a third firm reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans , kicked in $ 664,000 .
Not surprisingly , Obama and McCain took in top dollar from the three firms : $ 625,409 for Obama and $ 579,000 for McCain .
Obama ’s running mate , Joe Biden , received another $ 48,975 .
There were no contributions listed for McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , for a simple reason :
She never before sought federal office .
McCain has at least three major volunteer fundraisers who bundle donations from others on Wall Street and environs .
McCain voluntarily discloses the occupations of his bundlers .
Obama does not .
Merrill Chief Executive , John Thain , is among McCain 's bundlers and has donated $ 32,700 to various McCain - related committees .
Thain 's predecessor , Stanley O'Neal , was a $ 2,300 Obama donor .
Other major recipients in 2007 - 2008 include Sen. Hillary Clinton ( $ 516,750 ) , former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ( $ 340,550 ) , and Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd ( $ 195,300 ) .
Many Wall Street donors , such as Lehman Chief Executive Richard S. Fuld , gave to both sides , $ 2,300 to Obama and the same to McCain .
Fuld also gave $ 10,000 to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and $ 10,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
He gave most of his donations in 2007 , back when times were n’t quite so tough .
[ UPDATE ] : Obama spokesman Ben Labolt charged that McCain has taken money from political action committees representing the financial services and insurance industries , while Obama has refused such money in the presidential campaign .
" Obama has consistently called for stepped up oversight of our financial markets to prevent the crisis that we face today , " Labolt said .

Color Printing on Seven ( from Simon )
" I'm no longer able to print color documents , " a trouble ticket from a manager on floor seven read , " the first six copies came out fine , but the rest are in black and white .
I need 50 color copies . "
Printer issues were among the most common , so I walked him through the standard steps : making sure he could connect to the printer , verifying his queue was empty , checking the printer settings , etc .
Everything seemed to be on par , so I sent a quick test page to the printer on seven and headed up stairs .
Just as I was about to grab the sheet off the printer , it dawned on me : that was n't a color printer .
In fact , there were n't any color printers on seven at all .
I walked over to the manager 's office to verify that he had , in fact , sent his print jobs to the printer on floor seven .
He said that he did , and I asked if I could see the six color copies he managed to produce .
I looked at the printouts on his desk and informed him that , if he wants fifty copies in yellow , typically he has to make sure there are more than six sheets of yellow color paper loaded in the printer .

Help - less Desk ( from Paul Anderson )
At my company , there 's a bit of a wall between Application Development and Network Operations .
All " network and network - service related issues " must be reported through the porthole , a.k.a.
Helpdesk .
Quite often , this leads to interesting results .
" Helpdesk , Jerry speaking . "
" Hey Jerry , " I said , " this is Paul over in app dev .
Our TerraTrade system has a defective ForEx feed that needs to be fixed right away .
It 's causing a bit of an outage , so if possible , can we open the ticket as ' Urgent ' ? "
" Not a problem , " Jerry responded , " let me just have your name and number , and we 'll take care of it . "
I gave him a few more details and felt pretty happy that helpdesk was actually helpful .
Five minutes after I hung up , an email message came in : [ URGENT ] TICKET # 71248 HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO YOU
Not a moment later , my phone rang .
I hesitantly picked it up .
" Hello is this Paul , " the caller asked before I could even say Hello .
I affirmed that it was me .
" Paul , " he said , " this is Steve over at help desk .
We 've got an Urgent trouble ticket that just came in .
It 's for a , uh , Fortix feed defect .
We just wanted to make sure you 're on it ? "
It took me a few minutes to explain to Steve that he was , in fact , assigning me the defect I had just reported .
RIP Rocky ( from Robert V. Bolton )
Several years back , when I was working at my county government 's IT department , we upgraded Microsoft Outlook on all county computers from 2000 to 2003 .
To save on costs , only Outlook was upgraded : the rest of Microsoft Office suite was kept on 2000 .
For a while , no one seemed to notice .
Well , almost no one .
" I.T. , " I answered , " this is Robert . "
" I have a major problem , " the caller said , " Rocky is missing ? "
" I 'm sorry ... Rocky ? "
" You know , " she frantically replied , " my dog , Rocky !
He 's missing ! "
" Ummm , " I stumbled , " uhh ... maybe you should check with the dog pound to see if they cou - - " " No , " the caller scoffed , " you I.T. people do n't know anything !
Rocky ... the dog ... on my computer ! "
I still had no idea what she was talking about , but after several minutes of painful back - and - forth , it finally dawned on me .
She was referring to Microsoft 's Office Assistant : the little animated dog that would do little tricks on the screen while you were working .
Like its cousin , Clippy , Rocky also offered " helpful " tips and advice .
As it turned out , the Office Assistant DLL had a known issue when Office 2000 and Office 2003 products were used together .
Following Microsoft 's advice , we disabled this feature to prevent issues from occurring .
Try as I might , I was unable to explain that this was a problem with Microsoft Office .
" Well , well , " she huffed , " well , that 's just unacceptable !
I do n't believe you !
I can't use this stupid thing without my Rocky !!
Tell your department manager to expect my call . "
She slammed the phone down after that .
Needless to say , I never heard a word about it from my boss .
A few weeks after the incident , however , the county had us install newly - purchased copies of Office 2003 .
I 've always wondered if this was a result of the death of Rocky on that sad day .
The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday , with the full support of the Treasury Department , authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $ 85 billion to the American International Group ( AIG ) under section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
The secured loan has terms and conditions designed to protect the interests of the U.S. government and taxpayers .
The Board determined that , in current circumstances , a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs , reduced household wealth , and materially weaker economic performance .
The purpose of this liquidity facility is to assist AIG in meeting its obligations as they come due .
This loan will facilitate a process under which AIG will sell certain of its businesses in an orderly manner , with the least possible disruption to the overall economy .
The AIG facility has a 24 - month term .
Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance at a rate of three - month Libor plus 850 basis points .
AIG will be permitted to draw up to $ 85 billion under the facility .
The interests of taxpayers are protected by key terms of the loan .
The loan is collateralized by all the assets of AIG , and of its primary non-regulated subsidiaries .
These assets include the stock of substantially all of the regulated subsidiaries .
The loan is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the firm ’s assets .
The U.S. government will receive a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders .
Israel is very much behaving like a whore who urges her town ’s folks to erect a great memorial plaque to celebrate and glorify her chastity .
This week , some Zionist pundits both in Israel and North America have urged the Israeli government to boycott the Olympic Games in China to protest that country ’s dismal human rights record .
These self - righteous Zionists claimed that a country that rose from the ashes of the holocaust should n’t have normal relations with a country that systematically violates human rights and civil liberties .
There is no doubt that China is a prominent violator of human rights ( Is the US any better ) !!!
But the more important question in this context is really whether Israel , a state that has been murdering , enslaving and tormenting another people for the past sixty years , is in a position to lecture or criticize China or any other country on the subject of human rights .
One can argue with little exaggeration that Israel itself is a crime against humanity since its very creation in Palestine in 1948 entailed the extirpation and dispersion of 90 % of Palestine ’s indigenous inhabitants .
In fact , the systematic ethnic cleansing from Palestine - Israel of non-Jews , who constituted more than 80 % of the total population , is still an ongoing process .
Moreover , the nearly daily demolition of Palestinian homes in the Negev desert and the West Bank , along with the unceasing theft of Arab land , show that Israel is far worse than China with regard to observance of human rights and the rule of international law .
And while China does indulge in serious violations of human rights , especially in the Tibet region and against certain religious minorities , Israel routinely commits serious war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Palestinians and other peoples of the Middle East .
These crimes include , inter alia , deliberate and calculated murder of innocent civilians , blockading civilian population and denying it access to food and fuel and health care , bombing apartment buildings and crowded streets , vandalizing and ransacking civilian institutions such as orphanages , schools , hospitals and sports facilities and encouraging Nazi - like Jewish settlers to terrorize and murder Palestinian civilians for the purpose of driving them away from their land .
Israel also has been burying nuclear wastes in the vicinity of Arab communities , such as in the southern Hebron region , which is causing a dramatic increase in the occurrence of cancer .
Two years ago , the Israeli air force dropped millions of cluster - bomblets on Lebanon , enough to kill millions of people .
In short , it is really very difficult to imagine a crime that Israel has not committed .
True , Israel , unlike China , enjoys the benefit of world - wide hasbara ( propaganda ) machine extending from Los Angels to Sydney which celebrates Israeli “ democracy ” and “ liberty . ”
However , the truth , the naked truth , is that Israel remains a murderer , thief and liar .
Israel may very well have been successful in hiding its evil nature from the eyes of many people , especially in the West .
However , this evil will eventually corrode Israel from within and bring its demise .
The brazen depravity of Zionist thinking had another morbid expression this week .
The Israeli government reportedly protested to Turkey a planed visit to Ankara by Iranian President Ahmadinejad .
Israeli officials have called on Turkish leaders to cancel the visit to protest the Iranian nuclear program and Ahmadinejad ’s rejection of Zionism .
Again , the odor of hypocrisy is wafting all over the place .
First of all , Israel has no right to dictate to Turkey , a nation of 75 million people , which foreign statesman to invite and which not to invite .
Turkey , after all , is a sovereign state that is mature enough to decide for itself .
Turkey will not view favorably any foreign interference in its internal affairs especially if such interference comes from a state that is more sinful than sin itself .
Second , a country that possess hundreds of nuclear heads , many of them are probably directed at Muslim cities in the Middle East , have no right to protest Iran ’s nuclear program .
Indeed , if Israel , India , Pakistan , U.S. , Russia , China , France Britain and other countries have the right to develop nuclear technology and even nuclear weapons , why ca n’t Iran , a country that had a prosperous civilization thousands of years before the discovery of America .
Moreover , with such a holier - than - thou attitude , Israel is really not morally fit to protest Ahmadinejad ’s anti-Zionist remarks .
Israel today spearheads a worldwide venomous campaign of hatred and incitement against Islam and Muslims .
Israeli and Zionist leaders , officials , diplomats , writers and spokespersons routinely incite against nearly one quarter of humanity .
Six decades ago , Nazi leaders in Europe spread the message “ kill the Jews , do n’t let them take over Europe , do n’t let them destroy Christianity , do n’t let them destroy mother Germany . ” !
Today the chorus of hate from Jerusalem to New York to Sydney is spreading a similar message : “ Islam is taking over Europe ! ! , kill the Muslims , kill the terrorists , wipe Islam off from the face of earth .!! ”
Just read the hateful Zionist press such as the Jerusalem Post , the New York Post , Commentary , the New Republic , Wall Street Journal , Washington Post , the International Herald Tribune , to mention just a few example , and you will see how the “ Nazi mind ” is still very much alive and kicking 63 years after the demise of the Third Reich .
Today , Israel is waging a dirty war against Islam under the pretext of fighting Hamas and other Palestinian resistance organizations .
Israel is destroying Palestinian schools , closing down Palestinian orphanages , and , probably in collusion with the quisling - like Palestinian Authority , terrorizing Islamic institutions that predated the appearance of Hamas by many decades .
Israel is arresting and torturing young men and women for the pettiest Islamic activity .
Israel is really very much like Nazi Germany prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 .
Needless to say , such a state has no right to preach righteousness to the world .
In fact , with such a manifestly diabolical behavior , Israel is not only an abomination upon humanity , it is also a cancer upon the collective conscience of the Jewish people .

Via :: Press Release
Pioneer has announced demonstrations of Blu - Ray discs with 20 layers , capable of storing 500 GB of data on a single disc .
Commercial players and discs are currently confined to two layers .
The multilayer rush began with video DVDs .
Each DVD data layer holds only 4.7GB , making storing a complete movie at high quality impossible .
Resolving this had drives reading two layers of data from a disc , the second layer underneath the first , with reading lasers passing through the translucent first layer to reach the second .
The technology was expensive , and did not come to consumer drives for a number of years after its wide deployment in commercial movie pressing .
Multilayer CDs were never commercially released .
Blu - Ray has had dual - layer availability since its inception , but plans for adding more layers are not clear .
HD DVDs with three layers were demoed before that format 's demise , but technical problems made manufacturing expensive .
Fundamentally , each layer is an optically active interface , and accurately reading data through multiple layers is complicated by increasingly complex echo patterns or light bouncing through the layers .
This interference gets worse as the number of layers increases , and provides the main technical barrier to heavier multilayer technology .
Pioneer claims to have made a breakthrough in mitigating these issues .
They say that by using alternating layers of two different thicknesses , this " optical crosstalk " can be minimized .
This and other , proprietary , technologies allow Pioneer to read accurately from no less than twenty layers of BD data .
With BD at 25 GB per layer , this means a single disc would hold 500 GB of data .
This improves on an announcement of 16 layers holding 400 GB last month .
The usefulness of such a capacity is not immediately clear .
The format 's inherent limitations on bitrate and such prevent its use to drive ultra - high - resolution video , and portable computer storage at this level is a niche market .
If the discs with very long shelf life can be developed , they might replace tape as backup for some applications .
The biggest potential impact of this technology , though , is to allow the size of Blu - Ray discs to scale massively without fundamentally altering the technology involved .
As needs expand , new BD formats can be launched with increased sizes , relying on fundamentally the same technology .
Since Pioneer claims the new demo involves proprietary technology , it is very unlikely current BD players can read 20 - layer discs , even with new firmware .
New players and drives will have to be distributed , but if the technology pans out , BD can scale to be more and more heavily multilayer for a goodly number of years .
Longevity as a technology is desirable , because economies of scale and entrenchment will lower prices and increase quality over time .
Giving BD room to expand is a very good thing , and Pioneer seems to be leading the way .

There will be a day when you need access to your Debian box from another place than home , for example to get files from your home server with scp or if you ’re running a webserver , an irc proxy , a ftp server , a mail server …
Most likely your ISP gives you a dynamic IP address .
This problem can be solved by getting a static DNS name , so you can connect to your home even if your IP keeps changing .
First of all you have to create an account with your favourite dyndns provider .
I use dyndns.org but there are others , such as easydns.com , dslreports.com or zoneedit.com .
You can use others if you know ddclient supports its protocol .
There you can specify the hostname ( combined with a domain name ) for your computer .
You can enable mail routing if you want to setup a home mail server .
When you install ddclient you will be asked for the dyndns service provider where you created your account .
After that you must enter the complete ( or fully qualified ) domain name of your computer ( something like dpotd.gotdns.org ) and your account name ( including the password , which will be stored in plaintext in /etc/ddclient.conf ! ) .
Now you have to chose the interface that connects you to internet .
ddclient will get your IP address from there , so you should n’t be behind a NAT .
Afterwards you will be asked if you want to start ddclient when connecting with PPP and if you want ddclient to run on system startup or not ( probably you will use the first or the second choice ) .
If you choose to run ddclient on startup , you can enter a delay between address checks ( default are five minutes , so every five minutes your system will tell your current IP address to your dyndns service provider ) .
Your settings are stored in /etc/ddclient.conf and look like this :
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf # # /etc/ddclient.conf pid=/var/run/ddclient.pid protocol=dyndns2 use=if , if=eth0 server=members.dyndns.org login=dyndnsloginname password='dyndnsloginpassword ' dpotd.gotdns.org
If everything is okay , wait a couple of minutes for the DNS information to populate and then you will be able to do something like ssh dpotd.gotdns.org or w3 m dpotd.gotdns.org
ddlient is available in Debian since Sarge and in Ubuntu ( universe ) since Dapper .
Why do I say “ do n’t be fooled by the name ” ?
Because I was , for some reason I was thinking that Paan was similar to Naan bread , which I love .
But they are really nothing alike , I assure you , and here ’s why I know .
I was shopping on the weekend in my neighborhood .
I live near a part of town that many refer to as “ India Land ” which is an area that is heavily populated by East Indian restaurants and bazaars .
It ’s a great area to live near , especially if you like to make Indian food , like I do .
While walking by all the colorful fabric shops and such , I noticed a few shops that had signs outside that said things like “ Paan and Video ” or “ Paan Centre ” and this sparked my curiosity .
One store in particular had quite the line up , so I wandered in .
I was nervous at first , because I did n’t even know what I was lining up for .
So , I thought I would just ask !
The lady in front of me said “ Paan ” is considered to be a “ refresher ” snack .
Good ones are apparently supposed to melt in your mouth .
So I had to try one , actually I bought two , one for me and one for Joe .
They were just so beautiful , filled with spices , grated coconut , betel nuts , and bits of fennel candy .
And to top it off , it had a big dollop of soaked rose petals .
However , despite it ’s beauty , I cannot tell you how disturbing it was ( for me anyways ) to bite into .
It was like 10 packages of “ Thrills ” soap gum x’s 100 .
I could still taste it four hours later .
Joe of course waited for me to try it , so I tried to keep it together .
I had to be honest and told him it was n’t my favorite thing .
He said if I had one more bite , he would try it .
In the end he did try it , and his immediate reaction was this …he said , “ I would rather eat liver ” and he really hates liver .
He then immediately opened up the fridge and scanned for something .
He spotted a bottle of ketchup and said , “ I think I might have to squirt some of this into my mouth ” .
In the end he did n’t of course , but we did have to go and brush our teeth a few times .
In the end I was glad that I tried it .
I even convinced Joe ?s brother and sister - in - law ( Jim and Mia ) to try it .
Unfortunately ( for them ) , they came over during the experiment .
And now , I am not sure if they are talking to me :-)
I so wanted to like it .
It thought I had discovered something new and magical .
I guess this just goes to show you how food and people ?s taste buds can be so different , especially between cultures .
I do still love the fact that this is just down the street from me ( Indian food that is , maybe not so much the Paan ) .
Has anyone else tried these before ?
And do you like them ?
Or perhaps you have something in your neighborhood that is unique or culturally different that you might like share .
Or maybe you have a story about eating chocolate covered bugs , that you are dying to share !
p.s. Here is a great video on making Paan that was just sent to me .
Thanks Shanti .
Ciao for now , dawn

Oasis
Haha , you gotta give it to those Canadians , they really know how to crash a party .
During Oasis ‘ set on last night ’s Toronto Virgin Festival , right in the middle of “ Morning Glory , ” a dude from the crowd came from out of the nowhere and put a good shuv on Noel Gallagher , causing him to fell off the stage .
The band took some good 10 minutes to recover and then returned to complete their set .
In all seriousness now , this is one fucked up thing to do .
I mean no band , no matter how terrible or hated it may be , deserves this .
Noel could ’ve broken a leg or something , or even worse .
Still , it was funny , right ?
P.S. Here ’s a great guide , from the folks down at Cracked , on how to properly punch Noel Gallagher in the face .

Barack Obama , we are told , chose Joe Biden to be his running mate because he needed an older man , more experienced in foreign policy , to fill the gaps in his résumé and reassure American voters that the United States would be safe under an Obama presidency .
That ’s true , but it is assumed that he also chose him because Biden ’s views on foreign policy are not radically different from his own .
Since American foreign policy still affects almost everybody in the world , that makes Biden ’s views very interesting .
Joe Biden , now 65 , has been a senator since he was 30 .
For almost half that time , he has been a member of the Senate foreign relations committee , which he now heads .
He has been around long enough to leave plenty of evidence about his view and his reflexes , and it is safe to say that he qualifies as a liberal interventionist ( or , as they say on the other side of the Atlantic , a liberal imperialist ) .
He has never met an international problem that he did n’t think the U.S. should help to solve .
Unlike the neoconservatives , who are brothers under the skin to the liberal interventionists , Biden does not believe that every problem in the world can be solved by the application of U.S. military power , but he does think that many of them can .
He backed the U.S. military intervention in Bosnia , the bombing of Serbia during the Kosovo crisis , the invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11 , and the invasion of Iraq ( although he subsequently had the grace to admit he was wrong and apologize for that ) .
Indeed , the Democratic vice - presidential candidate has even called for the use of U.S. troops in Sudan — unilaterally , if necessary .
On larger issues , by contrast , Biden has usually been a voice of moderation among the chorus of Democratic hawks vying to outdo their Republican colleagues in their hostility to Russia and their enthusiasm for the “ war on terror ” .
He did support the expansion of NATO right up to Russia ’s frontiers ( and visited Georgia immediately after the recent fighting ) , but he has resisted the temptation to paint Russia as the Soviet Union in sheep ’s clothing .
And his contempt for the “ war on terror ” has been consistent and exemplary .
“ Terror is a tactic , ” Biden has said .
“ Terror is not a philosophy . ”
It is a mantra that everybody in U.S. politics should be required to chant each morning before work , even if it is slightly inaccurate .
( Terror is actually an emotion .
Terrorism , however , is a tactic — a political tool or technique , more precisely — that can be used in support of a wide variety of causes .
It is as misleading to declare war on terrorism as it would be to declare war on propaganda . )
Knowing this has enabled Biden to concentrate ( most of the time , at least ) on the need to eliminate the particular groups of terrorists that attacked the United States , which were mostly located in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
When he briefly supported the invasion of Iraq , he did not do so out of an ignorant belief that Saddam Hussein had links with those terrorists .
It was his liberal interventionism that drove his decision , combined with a naive belief that the U.S. intelligence services would not bend the evidence on Iraq ’s alleged weapons of mass destruction to serve the president ’s purposes .
So that is Joe Biden ’s take on foreign policy , and it probably is n’t vastly different from Barack Obama’s .
The difference lies mostly in the “ experience ” factor , which tells you all you needed to know about the value of experience in these matters .
It is Biden ’s long residence at the heart of the Washington political / military / intelligence machine that makes him such a conventional character .
All that stuff about Obama being “ not ready to lead ” is simply a coded warning that he might not lead in the time - honoured , conventional way .
John McCain certainly would , and so would have Hillary Clinton if she had won the Democratic nomination .
The selection of Joe Biden as his running mate is intended to allay those fears by linking Obama to someone who is deeply embedded in the conventional wisdom , but it does n’t actually prove that Obama is too .
There is still room for suspicion that Obama harbours a secret desire to move American foreign policy in a quite different direction , away from the traditional great - power realpolitik and the occasional forays into liberal interventionism .
That would probably appall Biden , and it would horrify the rest of the Washington establishment .
Vice - presidents do n’t have a veto , so the choice of Biden poses no problem there .
But the Washington establishment probably does have a veto , so whatever Obama intends , Biden wo n’t be disappointed by the outcome .
On Wednesday , the Patrick administration proposed regulations to replace police officers on many state - financed road construction projects with less - expensive civilians , the kind of workers most states use .
After a public hearing , the new rules could go into effect this fall .
The regulations are not as strong as some critics of the police details would like .
They do not , for example , apply to locally financed road projects .
But given the tenacity with which police unions have defended the details over the years  for example , swarming into the State House when Gov. William F .
Weld proposed using civilians in 1992  budget experts say Mr. Patrick ’s plan is welcome .
“ It ’s been a sore point for a long time  how come only Massachusetts has paid details to the extent that we do , ” said Samuel R. Tyler , president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau .
“ They might have a captain , a lieutenant , a sergeant and a couple of patrolmen working on one construction job .
They ’re even brazen enough that if you ’re doing some work on the street and you do n’t have a paid detail , they ’ll come by and shut you down . ”
Police officers say the regulations are a public safety mistake .
“ Any time you take police officers , who are highly trained , with the equipment that they bring , and put civilians out there who have minimal training , you are taking a risk in public safety , ” said Richard R. Brown , president of the State Police Association , a union representing officers .
Transportation Secretary Bernard Cohen said there would be “ significant ” savings on the $ 25 million annual cost of police details .
Mr. Cohen said civilians would be paid less  $ 34.85 an hour , for example , in the Boston area .
Also , he said , they would be construction workers , so they could do road work when they were not needed to direct traffic .

SAN ANTONIO , Texas – Court authorities here will be able to track students with a history of skipping school under a new program requiring them to wear ankle bracelets with Global Positioning System monitoring .
But at least one group is worried the ankle bracelets will infringe on students ’ privacy .
Linda Penn , a Bexar County justice of the peace , said she anticipates that about 50 students from four San Antonio - area school districts — likely to be mostly high schoolers — will wear the anklets during the six - month pilot program announced Friday .
She said the time the students wear the anklets will be decided on a case - by - case basis .
“ We are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate , ” Penn said , linking truancy with juvenile delinquency and later criminal activity .
“ We can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life .
I do n’t want to see the latter . ”

Most studies of autism link it to genetics .
The condition is often referred to as the " geek syndrome " because some studies have shown a high incidence of autism in areas like California 's Silicon Valley , where highly technical people are having children together .
Scientific studies have backed up the idea that autism is genetic , identifying several genes that seem implicated in the disorder .
Now a new study has revealed that many of the genes associated with autism are — luckily — ones whose functioning can be modified in early childhood .
Autism genes are associated with early learning and are essentially designed to be reprogrammed — so , given the right learning environment , children born with autism could rewire their brains and be spared the worst effects of this disorder .

A co-author of the study , Christopher Walsh , told Scientific American :
We 're showing , on the one hand , that autism seems to have a large genetic component .
But , the genes that are involved are actually those that are involved in responding to the environment and learning .

Often , autistic children have problems with the genes that help them learn by forming synapses between neurons in the brain .
Either the genes are deleted or dormant .
The Scientific American article continues :
Walsh says the team believes these deletions - which in most cases found here only remove some , but not all , of the DNA that makes up a gene - may mean that the genes can regain some of their normal function .
In fact , some of these genes may just be switched off .
" This presents the possibility that in some kids we could get the gene going again without necessarily having to put it back in the brain , " he says . . .
Walsh notes that many children diagnosed with autism tend to show vast improvement when they are placed in environments that allow them to practice learning repetitively .
He says that these activities essentially train the neurons to make up for their lost function .
" Our work reinforces the importance of early intervention and behavioral therapy , " he says .
" The more we understand about genetics the more we understand how important the environment is . "

This is one of the first studies to offer genetic evidence for the idea that children with autism can actually reformat their brains if placed in the right environment .
There has been anecdotal evidence that autistic people can benefit from specialized learning environments , but it was never clear what the genetic basis for these recoveries might be .

Mercury contamination is making its way into nearly every habitat in the United States , not just oceans , according to a report that the National Wildlife Federation will release Tuesday .
The problem with high mercury levels in certain types of fish has been well documented , resulting in 46 states issuing advisories for pregnant women and children to avoid eating certain types of fish , including tuna and swordfish .
High levels of mercury can lead to a wide range of physical ills , including kidney and neurological damage , and can cause fatigue , vision problems and tremors .
But this is the first report to expose the problem in such a wide variety of species , 40 to be exact .
The report " underscored how pervasive mercury contamination has become , " according to Felice Stadler at the National Wildlife Federation .
" Nearly every aspect of our food web has been contaminated .
It 's difficult to find an ecosystem that 's not contaminated , whether it 's ocean or forest or coastal waters or wetlands . "
Scientists found high levels of mercury in bald eagles , songbirds , polar bears and alligators , to name just a few species .
Alligator meat is very popular in the southeast , but there is no advisory against eating alligator meat .
Last year Utah issued an advisory for duck hunters , warning people to limit or avoid eating certain duck species because of high levels of mercury .
Stadler said this report " raises the question of what ecosystems are safe and immune from toxic contamination . "
Mercury is a naturally occurring element , but people release much more mercury pollution that ends up in our forests , lakes , and streams -- 100 tons in this country alone annually .
The primary sources include coal - burning power plants , wastewater treatment plants and waste incinerators .
The mercury pollution is affecting the reproduction and behavior of fish and wildlife .
The report 's findings suggest birds with high levels of mercury lay fewer eggs , and the motor skills of certain mammals have been diminished , which affects their ability to hunt and therefore survive .
The report points out " there truly is no link in the food chain untouched by mercury , " and according to Stadler , this carries broad implications for humans .
" The research shows birds that eat contaminated insects get contaminated themselves , " Stadler said .
" Turkeys and chickens , which humans eat , eat those same contaminated insects , so this is the tip of the iceberg . "
There is some good news in an otherwise glum report : Mercury poisoning is reversible .
Stadler pointed to several states that in recent years have taken steps to cut mercury emissions , including Florida , Wisconsin , New Hampshire and Massachusetts .
And in a much shorter time than expected , the mercury levels in those states ' fish and wildlife populations have dropped
Stadler , who 's been working on the issue of mercury pollution for 10 years , said she was originally told it would take 50 years before scientists would see some reversal .
" But it 's happening much faster than we ever thought , five to six years , " she said .
Stadler said she believes the key is for this country -- and the whole world for that matter -- to realize just how big a threat mercury pollution is to our ecosystems .
" We need to be as drastic at cutting mercury as we have been in cutting lead , " she said .
