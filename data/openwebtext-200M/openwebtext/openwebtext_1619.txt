The last two days I have focused on Sarah Palin ’s apparent unwillingness to do her “ homework ” .
The particular blogs related to her unwillingness to investigate a Dallas house for unwed pregnant teens , and her unwillingness , or her inability , to investigate risks associated with offshore drilling .
The obvious conclusion is that Palin lacks the education to understand or appreciate the absurdity of her comments .
It seems this is a trend .
Supporters of Palin appear to share her bliss .
It is not enough that you and I appreciate the importance of intellect and education in our leaders .
Intelligence is not a requirement for the right to vote .
Thus , those of us who recognize the importance of education in the leaders of our country must help educate others .
Sarah Palin was described by a supporter as a “ real ” person .

Since the debut of Men in Black , I have understood that some people were not “ real ” people .
Yet who would have thought that the realness of a person should be the definitive criteria for determining if the person is qualified to be our President .
We need to make sure that supporters of Palin stop to think about why they like her .
If it ’s because she is pretty , sexy , perky or has five children , then its time to re-assess .
Intelligence may be part of a person ’s DNA , but only education facilitates the expansion of the myopia with which we are born .
Obviously some do n’t have the means to acquire an education .
However most who have the means , aspire to educate themselves .
Those who have an education available to them , and do n’t take advantage of the opportunity , seem to be the ones most in need of an education .
The importance of an education is quite clear .
Education allows us to put our potential to maximum use .
A wise man identified two reasons that education is essential : 1 ) The training of a human mind is not complete without education ; and 2 ) Through the attainment of education , man is enabled to receive information from the external world ; to acquaint himself with past history and receive all necessary information regarding the present .
Without education , man is as though in a closed room and with education he finds himself in a room with all its windows open towards the outside world .

People like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh influence many people and appear to view the world through the same spectacles that Palin wears .
Thus there must be characteristics that Beck , Limbaugh and Palin share .
Consider the background of each and the views they share about people different than themselves , and the importance , or lack thereof , that education played in the lives of each :
Glenn Beck was so moved to be interviewing Sarah Palin that he became teary - eyed .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y40D1Kgb8ng
Mr. Beck has referred to Palin as “ real ” , so maybe his characterization of her was memorable to some .
To me it was an indication of the superficial way that Palin supporters view her .
In his first interview , Glenn pointed out that both he and the “ Governor ” ( she was no longer the Governor at the time of the interview ) have “ special needs ” children .
Even though Beck was attempting to tap into the charitable instincts of his viewers , he does n’t seem to share this charitable spirit regarding other disadvantaged people .
Glenn has criticized some of the families of the 9 - 11 victims , and referred to the victims of Katrina as “ scum bags ” .
It ’s no excuse that he is a borderline schizophrenic , and has a history of drug and alcohol abuse .
http://current.com/news/92187964_glenn-becks-history-of-drug-abuse-and-mental-illness-john-avlon-the-daily-beast.htm
Palin has expressed the same lack of sensitivity to people in Alaska who do n’t have health care suggesting that their extended families should help out , even though Bristol ’s baby relies upon public funded health care .
Beck seems to share Palin ’s sensitivity to the needs of those without health care .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGeZQrpZbjI
.
Beck did n’t seem to identify the importance of a college degree , so he dropped out .
Thus , Palin and Beck seem to have at least two things in common , limited education and special needs children .
Maybe Palin relates to Beck ’s drug addiction problems due to Levi ’s mother ’s arrest for possession of drugs .
Maybe the connection is that Palin ’s oldest son Track also had a drug abuse problem , but I have never seen that rumor substantiated .
Rush Limbaugh endorsed John McCain and Sarah Palin , so he must have seen something about Sarah that he liked .
http://www.zimbio.com/Sarah+Palin+for+Vice+President/articles/5/McCain+Palin+ticket+gets+boost+Rush+Limbaugh
What was it about Palin that Limbaugh finds appealing ?
Maybe it ’s that Limbaugh , like Beck and Palin seem to disrespect those who have challenges different than their own .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do0Lg4JQeos
Maybe he , like Glenn Beck , finds it a comfort that Palin does n’t seem to put a premium on education , since Limbaugh does n’t have a college degree either .
Funny that the two most well - known conservative talk show hosts do n’t have a college degree between them .
Beck , Limbaugh , and Palin have all made a fortune off of their books , so maybe they share that commonality as well .
Like Beck , Limbaugh has a history of drug abuse .
www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/A
A trend seems to be emerging .
Beck , Limbaugh , and Palin have each made a lot of money off of conservatives , they each seem to minimize the importance of education , and drugs have affected the lives of each .
It seems obvious that Palin , her supporters , and those celebrities who endorse her , seem to have very little understanding of the world around them .
Consider the educational level of the people voting for Barack Obama in 2008 .
The majority of voters for Barack Obama were women , 35,900,000 , with Barack Obama beating John McCain among women 56 % - 43 % .
http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/05/election.president/index.html
, Women currently surpass men in education , earning more Bachelors Degrees in college than men .
This is particularly interesting because McCain chose a woman as a running mate , thinking that his choice of Sarah would cause women to vote for the ticket that included a woman .
John must have failed to realize that most women are younger than he is , and more educated than he .
Maybe if he learned to use a computer he would learn what the rest of us know .
The majority of the U.S. population has completed secondary education and the number of college graduates is greater than the number of high school dropouts .
As a whole , the population of the United States is increasingly spending more years in formal educational .
College education is highly valued by American society and is one of the main determinants of class and status .
As a general rule the households and demographics featuring the highest educational attainment in the United States are also among those with the highest household income and wealth .
“ US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States , 2003 ” .
http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf.
In Sarah Palin ’s family Todd , her husband , does not have a college degree and none of her children are college graduates .
Levi , the father of Sarah ’s grandchild , never attended college .
I mention this not to disparage Levi , but to highlight the fact that Sarah ’s children seem to have internalized Sarah ’s lack of value placed upon education .
The number of days of school Sarah ’s children have missed because they were accompanying Sarah in her travels seems to bother me , but not Sarah .
For example , when the press was focused on Sarah wearing a visor to the beach in Hawaii , with John McCain ’s name marked out , I was more concerned about Piper being on the beach taking a vacation with Sarah during a school week , than about the visor .
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/12/16/2009-12-16_sarah_palin.html
Most American families plan vacations around the kids ’ school schedules , with the clear message to our kids that you do n’t just skip out of school to lay on a beach .
Sarah herself seemed to lack an appreciation for education .
Even though the high school she attended was not particularly rigorous , she often made C’s , and making a D in foreign language was not uncommon .
http://news.spreadit.org/sarah-palin-report-cardsarah-palin-high-school.
When it came to choosing colleges , Sarah made this critical decision , not by her course of study or the excellence of the professors , but based upon where her three friends could also gain admission , and where she thought the weather would be favorable .
Rebuttal to the Rogue .
Thus , dropping out of college in Hawaii when the weather was not what she had hoped was certainly a predictable result .
It took Sarah five years to attain a four - year degree in Broadcast Journalism .
Palin said …
“ In these volatile times when we are a nation at war , now more than ever is when we need a commander - in - chief , not a constitutional law professor lecturing us from a lectern . ”
http://washingtonindependent.com/80748/explaining-palins-constitutional-law-professor-jibe
Palin seems to identify education as a limitation , not an asset .
However , ignorance breeds social discord , and studies consistently show that a lack of education is one of the biggest factors contributing to the rise of terrorism and fundamentalism ( Strauss , 2008 Strauss , Daniel .
September 19 , 2008 .
Fighting Terrorism With Education .
http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=fighting_terrorism_with_education
Certainly the newspapers have recently been filled with references to violence and terrorism , which seems to have been incited by those lacking an education .
Martin Luther King Jr. said :
“ Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity . ”
Sarah Palin is Dangerous !
By By Stephanie Dearing May 18 , 2010 in Environment Toronto -
A landmark historic agreement was announced early Tuesday morning by the Forest Products Association of Canada and nine environmental groups .
" The importance of this Agreement can not be overstated , .
FPAC member companies and their ENGO counterparts have turned the old paradigm on its head .
Together we have identified a more intelligent , productive way to manage economic and environmental challenges in the Boreal that will reassure global buyers of our products ' sustainability .
It 's gratifying to see nearly a decade of industry transformation and hard work greening our operations , is culminating in a process that will set a forestry standard that will be the envy of the world . "
The agreement was largely orchestrated by Pew Environmental Group .
Steve Kallick , PEW 's International Boreal Conservation Campaign Director said " For years we have helped bring opposing parties together to conserve this global treasure , Canada 's boreal forest .
We 're thrilled that this effort has led to the largest commercial forest conservation plan in history , which could not have happened without both sides looking beyond their differences .
As important as today 's announcement is , our ultimate success will be measured by how we tackle the work ahead to put this plan into practice . "
Only last summer , " ... Unsustainable logging and political inaction are threatening the Boreal Forest , one of the largest tracts of ancient forest on the planet .
Across Canada , there are crisis zones where individual forests are at high risk of being ruined beyond repair .
One of the major threats to the forest is clearcutting for disposable paper products .
Greenpeace is working to stop this practice , which wipes out intact wilderness and trashes the habitat of threatened wildlife , such as the endangered woodland caribou . "
Under the terms of the watershed agreement , both the logging industry and conservation groups have a role to play in preserving not just tracts of important wilderness areas , but also livelihoods for hundreds of Canadians .
Conservation groups will drop their anti-forestry positions while the forestry industry will adopt " ... the highest environmental standards of forest management . "
The deal will see environmental groups supporting the forestry industry , and in return , the industry has committed to suspend " ... new logging on nearly 29 million hectares of Boreal Forest to develop conservation plans for endangered caribou , while maintaining essential fiber supplies for uninterrupted mill operations . "
In its own Greenpeace Canada , the Ivey Foundation and Pew Environmental Group worked together to broker the deal , but as Greenpeace pointed out in its press release , " The interest of the marketplace and public has been critical in this agreement . ”
The six other groups helped to bring the issues to the forefront of Candian consciousness , as well as lobbied the forestry industry for changes in forestry management .
The groups will now proceed with meeting with provincial , First Nations and municipal representatives across Canada to " ... seek their leadership and full participation in advancing the goals of the Agreement . "
As per CFPA , Forestry Companies Participating in the Agreement : AbitibiBowater , Alberta Pacific Forest Industries , AV Group , Canfor , Cariboo Pulp & Paper Company , Cascades Inc. , DMI , F.F. Soucy , Inc. , Howe Sound Pulp and Paper , Kruger Inc. , LP Canada , Mercer International , Mill & Timber Products Ltd , NewPage Port Hawkesbury Ltd , Papier Masson Ltée , SFK Pulp , Tembec Inc. , Tolko Industries , West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd , Weyerhaeuser Company Limited - all represented by the Forest Products Association of Canada .
Environmental Organizations Participating in the Agreement : Canadian Boreal Initiative , Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society , Canopy ( formerly Markets Initiative ) , the David Suzuki Foundation , ForestEthics , Greenpeace , Ivey Foundation , The Nature Conservancy , and the Pew Environment Group 's International Boreal Conservation Campaign .
The Hewlett Foundation 's support for boreal forest conservation has been critical to the collective efforts of these groups .
The deal , the first of its kind , will see Canada 's natural northern forest resources protected .
The President and CEO of Forest Products Association of Canada ( FPAC ) , representing 21 signatory forestry companies , said in a press release The agreement was largely orchestrated by Pew Environmental Group .
Steve Kallick , PEW 's International Boreal Conservation Campaign Director saidOnly last summer , Greenpeace Canada had this to say about logging in Canada 's Boreal forests :

" In its own press release , Greenpeace Canada said 72 million hectares of boreal forest will be protected under the deal .
The agreement is expected to improve the economic position of Canada 's forestry industry , the organization said .

Pope struggles to hold back tears as he meets sex abuse victims
International
ani -Staff
By Super Admin
London , April 19 ( ANI ) : Pope Benedict XVI could n't control his tears as he met victims who had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of paedophile priests in Malta .
The Pope met eight men , who had been sexually abused by four priests at an orphanage in the inland .
The 20 - minute meeting took place in private at the Papal Nuncio 's residence .
" It was a very emotional meeting .
Everyone had tears in their eyes , even the Pope and the two bishops who were there , " the Daily Express quoted victim Lawrence Grech , a father of two , as saying .
Another victim Joseph Magro said : " The Pope said he would pray for me .
It is still very difficult for me , but I 'm now at peace with the church . "
The Vatican said the Pope " expressed his shame and sorrow " at what the victims had gone through and vowed to " bring to justice " the abusers .
Four priests have accused of sexually abusing orphan children in the 1980s and 1990s .

Last year Edinburgh residents tackled Arthur Conan Doyle 's dinosaur adventure The Lost World , last month Dubliners were taking a collective look at The Picture of Dorian Gray , and Brighton 's readers are currently engrossed in Ian Fleming 's James Bond novel From Russia with Love .
Now a new project is hoping to take the " one book , one city " initiative a step further , and get the whole world reading the same novel .
The brainchild of Jeff Howe , author of Crowdsourcing and a contributing editor at Wired magazine , the One Book , One Twitter scheme launches tomorrow .
Readers have been voting for the book which they 'll be tackling for the past month , with Neil Gaiman 's fantasy novel American Gods eventually triumphing over titles including Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury , Slaughterhouse - Five by Kurt Vonnegut , Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison and The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy .
" The aim with One Book , One Twitter is – like the one city , one book programme which inspired it – to get a zillion people all reading and talking about a single book .
It is not , for instance , an attempt to gather a more selective crew of book lovers to read a series of books and meet at established times to discuss , " explained Howe at Wired.com .
" Usually such ' Big Read ' programs are organised around geography .
Seattle started the trend for collective reading in 1998 when zillions of Seattlites all read Russell Banks 's book , Sweet Hereafter .
Chicago followed suit with To Kill a Mockingbird a few years later .
This Big Read is organised around Twitter , and says to hell with physical limitations . "
Gaiman , whose novel follows the story of ex-convict Shadow , released from prison and embarking on a bizarre journey across America with the mysterious Mr Wednesday , who claims to be a former god , said he thought One Book , One Twitter was " a great idea – a sort of worldwide book club " .
He was , however , slightly concerned about the choice of American Gods , describing himself as " half - pleased and half - not " , because it 's " such a divisive book " .
" Some people love it , some sort of like it , and some people hate it ...
It 's not a book I 'd hand out to everyone , because the people who do n't know anything about what I 've written and who hate it – who might have loved Stardust , or Neverwhere , or The Graveyard Book or Sandman – probably wo n't go and look any further , " the author explained on his blog .
" But it 's happened , I 'm kind of thrilled that I get to help kick off something this new , and I 'm going to do all I can to help .
Which , today , will consist of making sure I let all the publishers around the world who have American Gods in print know about this , and , over the next few months , sending helpful or apologetic tweets to people who are stuck , offended , or very , very confused . "
On Twitter at @ 1B1T2010 – with more than 1,500 followers days after launching – and hashtag # 1b1t , the One Book , One Twitter project begins officially tomorrow .
Editor 's note : CNN 's Moni Basu followed Sean Penn in Haiti on May 4 , documenting the celebrity 's life as an aid worker , including his efforts to save a boy with diphtheria .
Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
At base camp , Sean Penn sits under a lampshade made with discarded Chef Boyardee packages and pulls closer a Bic lighter dangling from a rope .
It 's not quite 7 a.m. and Penn is smoking another Marlboro Light .
He brought Nicorettes with him to Haiti , but quickly gave up on the idea of refraining from cigarettes .
He runs his hands through disheveled hair , takes another drag .
Wrapped in an embossed white towel and barefoot , he says no hellos , makes no attempt at niceties .
He starts telling a harrowing tale from the day before .
He hunted every corner of Port - au - Prince for an antitoxin for Oriel , a 15 - year - old boy who contracted diphtheria , an acutely infectious disease spread through respiratory droplets .
The American Red Cross did n't have it .
Nor did any of the major hospitals .
Penn even had the U.S. military on the search .
The United States stockpiles the vaccine and antitoxin .
But in Haiti , it took Penn -- even with his star power -- 11 hours to get his hands on one dose .
It was at a medical warehouse and Penn wrested the head of the World Health Organization from bed to unlock the door at a late hour .
" This country is not ready for an emergency , " he says .
" Three months in and nobody in the major hospitals knew where to find the immunoglobulin .
That kinda says it all to me . "
Oriel had been brought to a clinic at the encampment of earthquake - displaced people at the Petionville Golf Club , which Penn 's newly formed aid agency J/ P Haitian Relief Organization has been helping to manage .
The boy had started feeling symptoms six days earlier .
Doctors quickly realized that he had diphtheria .
No hospital wanted to admit the boy , Penn says .
They did not have the capacity to prevent infection .
Penn hand - carried him to General Hospital , the city 's main medical care facility , where doctors finally agreed to place Oriel on life support .
Penn feels personally responsible -- for the boy , for the entire camp , for the city .
Diphtheria could spread lightning fast through the congested tents and shanties .
Haiti grapples with diphtheria and other killer diseases every year , but after the quake doctors feared the worst .
Oriel was the first case of " the worst " discovered at the golf course camp .
Early on , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had urged immediate vaccination against diphtheria and recommended having the antitoxin on hand .
Penn cannot comprehend why , with an abundance of aid agencies working in Haiti , prevention like this has to be so difficult .
He is not one to shield his anger , or mince words .
" If the boy were to die , " he says , " this would be murder . "
Celebrity in a foreign land
Penn is hardly new to heroic endeavors .
He 's flown to the eye of a hurricane , to the front lines of war .
A few years back , he traveled to Iraq and Iran and wrote about both countries for the San Francisco Chronicle .
He was in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina -- his right arm bears a tattoo that says : " NOLA , Deliver Me . "
His presence in all those places and now in Haiti draws skepticism and ire from those who think that celebrities use tragedies to burnish their public images .
Penn has been mocked and caricatured by filmmakers , writers and talk - show hosts for taking up causes .
But he brushes it all aside .
Someone , he says , has to get it done .
He landed in Haiti a week after the earthquake , he says , with a genuine concern .
He insists he will be here for the long haul , that he 's more than a celebrity goodwill ambassador who has dropped in to smile with orphaned kids for a day .
No stunts .
No gimmicks .
His staffers say the actor is simply following his heart .
The Oscar - winning star has shed his life of comfort and glamour for the unassuming role of aid worker .
For the past few weeks he has been helping manage 50,000 displaced Haitians living in the camp that sprouted on the nine - hole course at the capital 's once - exclusive golf club .
Perched atop a hill that affords a view of Port - au - Prince , the star of movies like " Dead Man Walking , " " Mystic River " and " Milk " might have been a guest here in former years , sipping a rum punch on a balmy evening .
These days , he 's sleeping in a tent along with a small proletarian staff .
They wear navy blue shirts with the J/P HRO logo loudly emblazoned -- and answer only to Penn .
Void of the bureaucracy common at the United Nations and other major humanitarian agencies , Penn says his J/P HRO , is often able to get things done faster .
The group 's work began in the weeks after the quake with the disbursal of critically needed aid .
Then Penn noticed the tremendous need at the crowded golf club camp , one of the city 's largest and completely vulnerable to rain and treacherous mudslides .
Penn called in the U.S. Army 's 82nd Airborne Division to help secure the hills with gravel and sandbags .
" Pretty soon , we were managing a camp , " he says .
" Then you find you are filling a gap and you feel responsibility to keep going . "
He negotiates the terrain in a bright red golf cart that says " SEAN PENN " in the front , though few recognized him when he first arrived .
Even now , some camp residents barely recognize the name .
" Yes , I know , " said one .
" He is Madonna 's first husband . "
Penn , who will turn 50 this year , found it liberating to move without paparazzi or fans asking for autographs .
It was the anonymity he once knew growing up in southern California , before his breakthrough role in the 1983 film " Fast Times at Ridgemont High . "
Then came his turbulent marriage to Madonna , a barrage of bad tabloid headlines and jail time for punching an extra who tried to snap his picture .
Learn more about Haiti relief efforts on " Impact Your World "
But he 's no bad boy here at the Petionville Golf Club .
" He is helping us .
He is a good man , " says camp resident Junior Vital .
Penn 's group relocated about 5,000 people to safer ground at Corail , a new temporary camp on the outskirts of the city , where flooding and mud will not threaten them in the rainy season .
In the landscape of Haiti 's tragedy , Penn 's accomplishments are small .
But things do n't happen quickly here .
In that context , aid workers here gave him kudos for his successes .
" It was a Band - Aid measure , " Penn says .
" But it meant a lot to us . "
Still , he recognizes he 's a newbie to the aid business .
And a possible diphtheria outbreak is not the kind of emergency the Hollywood actor is used to addressing .
Foul mouth can undo good intentions
Penn shaves at an outdoor sink , takes a quick shower .
J/P HRO 's medical director , Justine Crowley , takes a call from the hospital .
The teenage boy with diphtheria is not doing well .
Now that he is intubated , doctors from the International Medical Corps are concerned that infection can spread .
The walls of the hospital 's rooms do not go all the way up to the ceiling ; not everyone at General is vaccinated .
They are also miffed at Penn , whose foul mouth and abrasive manner can undermine his good intentions .
Penn decides to pay a visit to the hospital to sort out matters .
He asks staffer Stephen Duvall if he can borrow a button - down shirt .
Duvall gives him the one off his back .
" The main thing is to make sure they will keep him here and treat him , " Penn says to Crowley .
He asks the driver for a light , smokes another Marlboro Light and sings a song by the politically charged rock band The Clash .
" This is Radio Clash on private satellite . "
" That 's what we need -- a pirated radio station , " he says .
" No , no .
I do n't mean pirated . "
Penn sees a lack of communication and coordination as a big problem in aid delivery to Haiti .
He sees some aid workers as having been in the business too long .
" Dispassionate , " he calls them .
Others bask in the glory of their achievements .
He sees it as a clique -- one that has n't let him in yet .
What do they , in turn , think of him ?
Several aid workers who were asked about Penn 's contributions in Haiti did not want to be quoted .
Most said the actor was doing more good than harm .
" He has money and an organization , " says Mark Turner , spokesman for the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) .
" He 's done a very credible job . "
If nothing else , aid workers say , Penn 's celebrity helps keep the spotlight on Haiti .
At the hospital , Penn meets rankled doctors .
They discuss the boy and the fact that he had been going to school , which means other students might have been infected .
After settling on a game plan , Penn rushes out to a morning meeting of camp managers at the U.N. logistical base .
A German missionary accosts him on the street .
" You are Sean Penn ? " says Kolja Witt .
" I think you are doing good work . "
A group of Haitians working with International Medical Corps want their pictures taken with the Hollywood star .
Penn obliges .
Smiles , even , for the camera .
" You , Sean Penn .
Excuse me , " says another man .
" My name is James .
Can you help me get a job ? "
Penn explains he cannot help him and jumps back into his white Toyota Land Cruiser .
It pulls away but Penn is still very much at the hospital .
" He 's not going to die , " Penn says of the boy .
" He 's his father 's only child .
That 's not allowed . "
He pauses before finishing the thought .
" But that 's a brand new law around here . "
At the U.N. logistical base , a spread of trailers and tents erected near the airport after the headquarters building collapsed in the quake , Penn heads to the Deck Bar and Grill .
Ham panini and soda in hand , he walks into a weekly meeting of camp managers at the IOM .
It 's new for Penn to sit through metrics and charts and aid - worker speak .
He does n't have much patience for priority lists aid agencies want made .
He just wants things done now .
The room is packed ; it 's hard to hear speakers in the back .
But not Penn .
His voice is booming .
His language is not pedantic .
The discussion centers on assistance packages for quake - displaced Haitians living in makeshift camps .
Penn disagrees that the aid amount should be a uniform $ 50 per person -- because needs vary -- and until the parameters are worked out , no one gets anything .
" If you have a hospital with some medicines , you start treating the patients .
You do n't wait for the shelves to be full , " he says .
Penn brings up the diphtheria case .
He wants aid agencies to begin immediate vaccinations .
UNICEF has plans to do just that , but has not started yet .
He says Oriel is suffering needlessly .
He does n't want to point fingers but in his mind , he blames inertia on the part of humanitarians who should be acting faster , more efficiently .
He does n't want to hear that they are experts from Africa and that he is just a Hollywood actor .
He just wants them to act .
A boy 's death , an angry activist
In the end , Penn 's efforts to save Oriel were not enough .
He had been sick for six days before receiving treatment .
He died Thursday night .
The child 's death , Penn says , was needless ; one that could easily have been prevented .
Even in Haiti .
Penn has already started chastising the international community .
Where are the vaccines ?
Where is the prevention ?
There wo n't be a rebuilding of Haiti without its people , he says .
Saving their lives must be the top priority -- before jobs , before reconstruction , before anything else .
" We 've got to get people out of these ad hoc camps where these kinds of diseases can spread so quickly , " he tells Anderson Cooper .
Watch Penn discuss diphtheria on " Anderson Cooper 360 "
Penn thinks of his own children often .
They 've been down to visit him in Port - au - Prince .
He had said Oriel 's death would not be allowed .
But Penn did n't have it his way this time .
There are no retakes .
And in his mind , no excuses .
Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson tackle a very tough subject :
Trying to explain exactly what a bank is and does .
They talk to a number of experts about what has gone wrong in banking , but not before bringing us all up to speed on some banking basics , like understanding a bank balance sheet , and a bank 's assets and liabilities , and the squishy business of what banks say about their balance sheets compared to what they are .
Alex and Adam walk us step by step through the complications of the US government buying up bad assets from banks , and explain why , when it comes to footing the bill , the government might just prefer to not be in charge of the very banks it is having taxpayers bailout .
From a dollhouse , to a hypothetical bank worth tens of dollars , to the trillions of dollars being spent to keep banks afloat , Alex and Adam talk economy , and where we might be headed .

No reason was initially given for the decision , but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky 's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel .
Chomsky , who is on a speaking tour in the region , was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on Monday .
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Sabine Haddad said officials were now trying to get clearance from the Israel Defense Forces , which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter that territory .
" We are trying to contact the military to clear things up and if they have no objection we see no reason why he should not be allowed in , " said Hadad .
Chomsky said inspectors had stamped the words " denied entry " onto his passport when he tried to cross from Jordan over Allenby Bridge .
When he asked an Israeli inspector why he had not received permission , he was told that an explanation would be sent in writing to the American embassy .
" They apparently did n't like the fact that I was due to lecture at a Palestinian university and not in Israel , " Chomsky told Reuters by telephone from Amman .
Chomsky arrived at the Allenby Bridge at around 1:30 in the afternoon and was taken for questioning , before being released back to Amman at 4:30 P.M .
In a telephone interview with Channel 10 , Chomsky said the interrogators had told him he had written things that the Israeli government did not like .
" I suggested [ the interrogator try to ] find any government in the world that likes anything I say , " he said .
Chomsky is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is considered among the foremost academics in the world .
He identifies with the radical left and is often critical of both Israeli and American policies .
Chomsky said he last visited Israel and the West Bank in 1997 when he lectured at Ben-Gurion University and also at Bir Zeit .
He said all his previous West Bank visits had been as a part of trips to Israel .
His Palestinian host , lawmaker Mustafa al - Barghouti called the decision " a fascist action , amounting to suppression of freedom of expression . "
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel slammed the Interior Ministry for " using detention and deportation to prevent a man from expressing his opinion " , calling it " characteristic of a totalitarian regime . "
" A democratic country where freedom of expression is a guiding principle does not close in the face of criticism or ideas that are not comfortable and does not deny entry to guests only because it does not accept their opinions .
Instead , it deals with these opinions through public discussion , " said ACRI in a statement .
Kadima MK Otniel Schneller , on the other hand , praised the move .
" It 's good that Israel did not allow one of its accusers to enter its territory , " said Schneller .
" I recommend [ Chomsky ] try one of the tunnels connecting Gaza and Egypt . "
If you want to pick up one of the bestselling books for the Kindle , you do n't have to save your spare dollars or even your pennies -- the 10 top Kindle bestsellers are free .
To find a bestselling Kindle e-book that costs more than $ 0.00 , you have to look to No. 14 , Steig Larsson 's " The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo " -- a book that 's spent more than 18 months in the top 100 , and has the fairly low e-book price of $ 5.50 .
Currently at No. 1 is " Breach of Trust , " a mystery about an ex-CIA agent turned librarian from DiAnn Mills , a successful writer of Christian fiction .
It 's taken the top spot after just three days in the top 100 , and that may change ; Amazon revises its rankings every hour .
With " Breach of Trust " retailing for $ 26.36 in hardcover and $ 9.36 in paperback , why is Mills giving it away ?
Maybe because it 's a year old and her a new novel , " A Woman Called Sage , " was released just three weeks ago .
The idea is that readers will like the older , free e-book so much that they 'll go ahead and pay for a new one from the same author .
But with " A Woman Called Sage " at the respectable but certainly not bestselling No. 8,068 in the Kindle store , is this give - em - a - taste strategy paying off ?
Maybe it would have a better chance if so many people were n't trying it -- but there 's Kathryn Magendie 's free , 2009 novel " Tender Graces , " the Kindle No. 5 bestseller ; her new 2010 book " Secret Graces " is at No. 14,020 on the Kindle list .
And Samantha Sommersby 's " Forbidden : The Sacrifice , " the 2009 start to a supernatural series is now free ; its third book , " Forbidden : The Temptation , " released in March , selling for $ 3.60 , is at No. 1,518 in the Kindle store .
Another strategy is to make the e-book free for just a few days .
That 's the case for several new books in the Kindle top 10 .
" Death of a Trophy Wife " by Laura Levine ( No. 2 ) , " Mistress By Mistake " by Maggie Robinson ( No. 4 ) and " Secrets of the Tudor Court " by D. L. Bodgdan ( No. 6 ) are all from Kensington , and " The Killing Room " by John Manning ( No. 3 ) is from Pinnacle , an imprint .
Abingdon Press has made debut author Linda S. Clare 's novel " The Fence My Father Built " free this week ; it 's at No.
7 .
Once the free download window has closed , these books will sell for the retail price .
But will readers choose to pony up for the books they missed , or go for the new free books that pop up next week ?
Most of the free books currently dominating the Kindle top 10 are mysteries , romances , thrillers and women 's fiction ; Christian fiction is doing very well .
There 's just one self - help book : " Living Organized : Proven Steps for a Clutter - Free and Beautiful Home . "
Does it suggest e-readers like the Kindle as a clutter solution ?
The standard Kindle can hold up to 1,500 books -- a library large enough to include a lot of freebies .

Health care is n't a done deal according to Conn Carroll , who writes over at the Heritage Foundation 's Foundry blog that ...
... the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) confirmed that the federal government will have to spend an additional $ 115 billion implementing the law , bringing the total estimated cost to over $ 1 trillion .
The result , according to Carroll , is that it will only fuel the repeal that is already well on its way .
( CNN ) --
Two police officers were fatally shot and another two were wounded Thursday in two separate shootings allegedly by the same suspects in West Memphis , Arkansas , police said .
The two suspects , who were using an assault weapon , were themselves fatally shot , said Inspector Bert Shelton , who is assigned to city hall for the West Memphis Police Department .
The incident began around 11:36 a.m. ( 12:36 p.m. ET ) , when West Memphis patrolman Bill Evans made a traffic stop on a white minivan traveling eastbound on I - 40 at Airport Road , said Bill Sadler , public information officer for the Arkansas State Police .
After the vehicle exited the Interstate onto an off - ramp near College Avenue , Sgt. Brandon Paudert arrived on the scene as backup , Sadler said .
" It is our belief that Officer Evans was shoved to the ground by one of the suspects in the minivan and gunfire was directed at both officers , " Sadler said .
The suspects then fled , driving east in the minivan , leaving one man dead and the other fatally wounded .
Within minutes , officers from other agencies -- including the Arkansas State Police and the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission -- began to converge on the area , looking for the suspects , he said .
About 90 minutes later , a minivan believed to be the one that had been seen leaving the shooting site was spotted in a parking lot of a nearby Wal - Mart , Sadler said .
There , it was approached by Crittenden County Sheriff Dick Busby and Chief Enforcement Officer W.A .
Wren , who were traveling in the same vehicle , he said .
Both men were wounded in a gunbattle initiated by the suspects , who were using a long rifle and a handgun , Sadler said .
The gunbattle ended after " a very brave , young wildlife officer in his state truck rammed the suspect vehicle , preventing an exit of the suspects , " who were killed , Sadler said .
Both wounded officers were taken to Regional Medical Center at Memphis , where they were in critical condition , said hospital spokeswoman Vivian Crawford .
Authorities would not identify the suspects , saying doing so could affect the integrity of the investigation .
Paudert was the son of Police Chief Bob Paudert , said West Memphis Police Department Assistant Chief Mike Allen .
Both of the dead officers leave widows and young children , he said .
Paudert was 39 , Evans was 38 .
The FBI 's evidence - response team was among the agencies involved in the investigation .
In a statement posted on his website , Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said Paudert and Evans " died upholding their duty to serve and protect the residents of West Memphis . "
He added , " This is a loss shared by all Arkansans . "
A woman who answered the phone at the Wal - Mart Supercenter in West Memphis said the store , which is usually open round the clock , was closed after the incidents , and that store officials hoped to reopen by midnight ( 1 a.m. ET ) .
Rafael Correa has pitted himself against international business before
The Ecuadorean government has threatened to take over foreign oil concessions if the companies resist growing state control of the industry .
President Rafael Correa said every day millions of dollars were going to oil companies that should go to the state .
The government has been pressing the companies to give up concessions that give them a share of oil field profits and accept service contracts instead .
Oil firms operating in Ecuador come from Spain , Brazil , China and Italy .
' Serious action '
President Correa said during a televised address on Saturday : " Every day that passes there are millions of dollars going to these companies that should be going to the Ecuadorean state .
" I 'm out of patience .
We are sending a bill to Congress that would allow for the expropriation of oil fields should the companies not want to sign the new contracts .
" The oil companies are playing with us .
In the coming weeks there are going to be very considerable actions .
I have no regard for these companies , which have abused our country . "
Foreign oil companies operating in Ecuador currently include Chinese - owned Andes Petroleum , Brazil 's oil giant Petrobras and Repsol - YPF , dominated by Spanish and Argentine capital .
In 2008 , Mr Correa defaulted on $ 3.2bn ( £ 2 bn ) of foreign debt he described as " illegitimate " , calling the international lenders " monsters " .
Ecuador is Latin America 's fifth - biggest oil producer but World Bank estimates show that some 56 % of the country 's 13.4 million people live in poverty .
That figure rises to more than 80 % for indigenous Ecuadoreans , who are mainly small farmers in mountainous highlands .
An amendment to Israeli military Order # 1650 on “ preventing infiltration ” is riddled with “ vague language will allow army officers to exploit it arbitrarily to carry out mass expulsions , in accordance with military orders which were issued under unclear circumstances .
The first candidates for expulsion will be people whose I.D. cards bear addresses in the Gaza Strip , including children born in the West Bank and Palestinians living in the West Bank who have lost their residency status for various reasons “ , Ha’aretz recently reported .
The government ’s fear is of “ non-violent resistance ” , which — according to journalist Jamal Dajani — “ could be ” the “ biggest threat to Israel ’s ability to justify its continued military aggression and occupation of Palestinian lands ” ( 6:02 ) :
Ed Miliband to take on brother David in leader battle
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Ed Miliband has confirmed he is to stand for the Labour Party leadership against his older brother David .
The former energy minister declared his intention in a speech to centre - left think - tank the Fabian Society .
He said the party must renew itself and Labour needed to be " clear and honest " about the scale of its election defeat .
He said he would " absolutely " be ready to serve under David Miliband , should his brother win , and promised the leadership contest would be civilised .
The pair are the only two Labour MPs so far to have announced they are standing for the party leadership , previously held by Gordon Brown .
Ed Miliband , 40 , kicked off Saturday 's speech by joking that everybody had been asking whose bid their mother would support - then said she was behind the left - wing MP John Cruddas .
' Lost touch ' Mr Miliband said : " The one advantage of opposition is the chance to renew , to think about the country we live in and the people we seek to represent .
" Fundamentally , we lost touch with the values that made us a progressive force in politics and lost touch with the people we were meant to represent . "
He said Labour had to face up to the fact it had " lost trust catastrophically " over the Iraq war and also MPs ' expenses .
He added that Labour must not allow itself to be divided .
" We have got to leave the whole Blair / Brown business behind us ... [ and ] move on with a new set of ideas , " he said .
David Miliband was the first to announce his intention to stand Asked how he felt about standing against his brother , the former foreign secretary , Ed Miliband said there would be a " civilised contest " .
" David is my best friend in the world .
I love him dearly .
There is no way I 'm going to take lumps out of him either on the record , off - the - record or behind the scenes .
It is not my way of doing politics . "
Speaking before his brother had confirmed his decision , David Miliband , 44 , said he was " absolutely confident " the family could " remain strong " whatever happened .
HAVE YOUR SAY I do not have a problem with either David or Ed Miliband or Andy Burnham .
The next leader needs to assess why the party lost the support of the electorate Richard Ex-Schools Secretary Ed Balls , former Health Secretary Andy Burnham and backbencher Mr Cruddas have all indicated they are considering a bid .
Alan Johnson , Harriet Harman and Jack Straw have ruled themselves out of the race .
Former Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper has also decided against standing .
' Bedtime stories '
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " I could be working for another 25 years .
I 'm only going to be reading bedtime stories to my children for another two or three years . "
However , she said she hoped other women would put themselves forward .
" We need to have more women in senior politics . "
Mr Balls , her husband , said he had offered to support his wife had she decided to stand .
He told the BBC he would speak to people in his Morley and Outwood constituency before deciding whether to stand .

" It 's really important that we listen to voters before we reach conclusions .
If we need to change policy , it must be because voters are saying to us we did n't get it all right . "
Of the Miliband brothers , he said : " Both of them would do a brilliant job , if elected . "
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Ed Miliband 's speech contained a few surprises .
" It was full of criticisms of the last Labour government in which Ed Miliband was a minister and , in effect , of the manifesto which he pulled together , " he said .
He added that Ed Miliband had taken a " strategic decision " to be " very openly critical of what Labour did in office " , despite having served in the party 's last cabinet .
His brother , a former protege of ex-Labour leader Tony Blair , has said he wants to rebuild the Labour Party as " the great reforming champion of social and economic change in this country " .
Union backing David Miliband said Labour had to acknowledge that it had " lost this election and lost it badly " and now had to " re-engage with the public and understand , especially in England , why we lost " .
When asked earlier in the week about speculation Ed would enter the race , he said : " We have talked very frankly and openly to each other because we love each other as brothers . "
He added : " Brotherly love will survive because brotherly love is more important than politics . "
Ed Miliband is less well - known than David and has been an MP for a shorter time , but he is thought to have trade union backing and is known to have supporters in the Parliamentary Labour Party .
David Miliband has already been backed by a number of Labour heavyweights including former home secretary Alan Johnson .

Special By By Carol Forsloff May 7 , 2010 in Environment On Thursday , a Greenpeace official called BP 's reaction to the Gulf oil spill " response theater . "
Also , a Unified Command spokesperson said they sympathize with the concerns of fishermen a BP rep said , " We continue to fight on every front . "
Landry again talked of how people are working hard to control the oil spill , accenting BP 's contributions and responsibilities .
She repeated the statement said daily , " We are forward - leaning in our response efforts . "
Then she spoke of the great work being done in the community , saying " We are committed to working together on this thing " and " understood and listened to their ( the shrimpers ) concerns . "
Suttles stepped to the plate once again declaring , " We continue to fight on every front . "
At the same time he underlined how unique the newest efforts are in trying to control the oil spill , that the Discovery Enterprise and the containment device being used to try to cap the spill has never been done . "
He also assured the public , when asked about putting a cap on the amount of money given to people for their losses , " We will make money available to do what we need to do .
Our actions to date have proven it . "
Those on the ground with environmental groups have a different view .
Mark Floegel , an environmental expert with Greenpeace that a journalist representing three different papers interviewed last week and followed up with his offices today , is busy in the Gulf , looking at the situation , so that he can file his opinion blog .
Direction was made to that blog this morning along with the comment , " You can't imagine the numbers of calls we have been getting from different people and members of the press today .
The numbers are growing daily .
I do n't know whether you will be able to talk with him directly today as he 's swamped . "
The assistant in the Greenpeace offices was hurried as she directed people to more information on what the environmental support group , Greenpeace , is seeing and presently has some concerns .
Floegel now refers to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of Oil What he details next , however is telling “ The executives at BP must be reading the Exxon spill response playbook because they ’re doing exactly what Exxon did , ” he said .
For those of you without access to the oily inner sancta , the playbook ’s rules are these : 1 — Understate the amount of oil spilled .
2 — Understate the environmental damage caused by the oil .
3 — Overstate the effectiveness of your company ’s response .
4 — Try to buy off the locals with tiny amounts of money ( BP is offering $ 5,000 each to coastal residents in Mississippi ) in exchange for waivers promising not to sue for damages .
5 — Slap gag orders on anyone doing business with the corporation .
( Fishermen who want work from BP in the cleanup efforts have to agree in writing not to speak to the media .
The gag orders are legally meaningless ; it ’s the intimidation factor that counts . )
Floegel than examines the booms , as likely not working because unless skimmers are able to lpick up the oil before it reaches shore , the boomers will be of no help because the oil can come assure and as it bubbles up it will mix with water and then slip to the bottom .

This is how BP explains how he now sees it : " Nonetheless , BP had a couple hundred shrimp boats on the gulf Wednesday , trolling booms back and forth .
It ’s not an oil spill response , it ’s Response Theater .
As Rick points out , in the best of circumstances ( and we ’re very far from that in the gulf ) only ten percent of the oil is ever recovered .
In the Exxon spill , after $ 2 billion , three summers with 1,000 boats and 13,000 workers , only five to seven percent of the oil was recovered .
One worry here is that the massive spill — which may spew oil for many weeks to come — will slip around the Florida peninsula and be carried up the east coast by the gulf stream .
At the Exxon spill , which entailed a heavier grade of crude in the much more closed Prince William Sound , the oil was carried 800 miles down the Alaskan coast .
There are several countervailing currents in the gulf , at all depths and of course , this oil is moving at every depth the gulf has .
No one can predict where it will go .
“ There ’s never been a successful response to a marine oil spill .
Ever , ” Rick says .
“ We ’re addicted to oil and like any addict , we are taking larger and larger risks to get our fix and the consequences are more and more disastrous . ”
He ends by telling us , " We have to get over our addiction to oil . "
President Obama and his administration officials have assured folks drilling will continue once the present oil spill is contained and the reasons for it established so that drilling can be safe .
BP executives explain they will pay for everything regardless , as the evolution of how much oil and where it will impact the shoreline is said difficult to determine .
It remains a changing story even as the events narrated over the past two weeks have repeated the mantra by Admiral Landry of how responsive the company has been and will be and how " forward looking " and understanding as well .
On May 7 , Admiral Mary Landry who has been the major spokesperson for the Unified Command fighting the spread of oil in the Gulf and Doug Suttles , for British Petroleum presented a message ongoing for days .

What 's the Best Advice You Ever Got ?
It ’s that time of year : graduation .
Celebrities , dignitaries , and the occasional wild card are ushered forth to send graduates into the future with courage , confidence , conviction ( blah blah , blah blah , blah blah ) ….
And then there ’s a woman we ’ll call only S. , for her mission is a secret one .
Her son , N. , is about to be graduated from high school , and S. is putting together an “ album of advice ” for him .
She ’s been writing to all sorts of people ( including us ) and asking : “ What ’s the best ( or worst ) advice you ’ve ever been given ? ”
As she writes further : “ My mom did this for me when I graduated high school , and I wanted to carry on the tradition for my children .
It was the most memorable gift I ’ve ever received . ”
How could anyone possibly turn down this request ?
My first inclination was to tell N. that the best advice I could give him was to have a mother who cared enough about her kids to solicit advice from strangers .
Anyway , here ’s what I sent him ; I ca n’t say it ’s all that interesting , or even such great advice , but this is what came to mind :
Dear N. , I once received a piece of advice when I was about 14 that was n’t even meant to be advice , but has stayed with me for my entire life .
I was out fishing on a small lake in a little motorboat with a man named Bernie Duszkiewicz .
He was the local barber ( well , one of two — but you get the idea : it was a very small town ) .
My father had died when I was 10 , and there were a few nice men around town who went out of their way to take me on little adventures .
Most of these adventures involved fishing .
I did n’t really like fishing all that much but I think my mom thought I did , and I was too timid or obedient to ever object .
We were out on the lake , fishing for bass I suppose , going from one theoretically good spot to the next and catching absolutely nothing .
Then it started to rain .
Mr. Duszkiewicz drove the boat over toward the shore and anchored us under some low - hanging trees so we would n’t get drenched .
We started casting from there — and lo and behold , I finally caught a fish .
It could n’t have been more than 6 inches long , a sunfish or rock bass , but at least it was a fish .
And then I caught another , and another .
They were too small to keep but it was fun catching them .
Then the sun came out , and Mr. Duszkiewicz pulled up the anchor .
I was a very shy kid and it took everything I had to speak up : “ Where are we going ?
This is a great spot ! ”
“ Ah , we do n’t want to keep catching these little ones , ” he said .
“ They ’re not worth the time .
Let ’s go catch a real fish . ”
To be honest , my feelings were a little bit hurt — the fish I was catching were real fish , and a lot more fun than catching nothing at all .
And we had the same bad luck when we got back out to the deeper spots in the lake : no fish at all .
But the lesson stuck with me .
Even though we returned home empty - handed , we went for the big fish .
In the short run , this kind of thinking might not be as much fun .
But it ’s the long run you should be thinking about — the big goals , the ones that require a lot of failure along the way .
They might be worth it ( of course , they might not be , too ) .
It ’s a lesson in opportunity cost : if you spend all your time catching the little fish , you wo n’t have time — or develop the technique , or the patience — to ever catch the big ones .
Wishing you the very best , SJD
Well , that ’s my fish story .
The funny thing is that , as memorable as that advice was , I constantly fail to follow it all the time — and yet just think how much worse off I ’d be if it were n’t at least haunting me , like a second conscience .
What I really want is to hear your story : what ’s the best advice you ever got ?
Thanks , and congratulations to N .
I felt like writing a story !

There ’s little to see now at the site , an abandoned clothing store two blocks from the former World Trade Center where nearly 3,000 people died on September 11 , 2001 .
But Feisal Abdul Rauf , a New York imam and a leader of the project , says the planned multi-story Islamic center will transform both the drab lower Manhattan street and the way Americans have looked on Muslims since 9/11 .

Boasting a mosque with sports facilities , a theater and possibly day care , the center would be open to all visitors to demonstrate that Muslims are part of their community , not some separate element .
“ There ’s nothing like this that we know of in the United States , ” Rauf told AFP .
“ This will be a community center for everyone , not just for Muslims , but non-Muslims . ”
These are tense times for American Muslims who find themselves increasingly painted both by the public and law enforcement bodies as a possible source of terrorism .
A failed car bomb in New York ’s Times Square on May 1 was allegedly planted by a Pakistani - born American , prompting senior figures in Washington to recommend stripping basic rights from US passport holders suspected of Islamist militant links .
The Islamic center is part of Rauf ’s program , called the Cordoba Initiative , meant to build bridges between the West and the Muslim world .

But because of the proposed mosque ’s location , just around the corner from the gaping Ground Zero hole , Rauf ’s call for peace is seen by some as a battle cry .
“ The outrage continues , ” says website www.nomosquesatgroundzero.wordpress.com under a close - up of the collapsing Twin Towers .
Accusing the Cordoba Initiative of trying to “ sneak it through , ” the protest site says the center will “ cast a rude shadow over Ground Zero . ”

Others compare the idea to building a German cultural center at Auschwitz .
“ Spitting in the Face of Everyone Murdered on 9/11 , ” writes Blitz , a self - described “ anti- jihadist newspaper . ”

That level of anger is not uncommon among New Yorkers who blame Islam , rather than just Al - Qaeda or other militant groups , for 9/11 and the global confrontation with the United States .
“ This is the wrong neighborhood to put the mosque in , ” Scott Rachelson , 59 , said as he went to his office .
Rachelson , who works with people seeking compensation over 9/11 related damages , said his life changed forever the day that two hijacked airliners smashed into Manhattan .
“ I was here .
For me , and everyone else who was here , we have post - traumatic stress disorder , ” he said .
“ It feels like yesterday . ”

A woman living in the apartment building next to the proposed mosque said she could n’t accept the project .
“ I ’d be lying if I said it did n’t make me a little nervous , ” said Jennifer Wood , 36 , as she took her young son for a walk .
“ It seems a little in the face , a little too much too soon .
I do n’t know why it has to be here — this is a big city . ”
An eloquent and erudite man , Rauf sounds slightly weary when asked about hardcore opposition , but says he hopes the center will become a catalyst for helping Muslims and the wider community to integrate .
“ It ’s about building an American Islamic identity , because we have second - , third - generation Muslims who do n’t feel they are part of ( the country ) , ” he said .

“ The complaint throughout the years has been : ‘ Where ’s the voice of the moderate Muslims ? ' ”
Rauf said .
“ Well , here we are . ”
Many look forward to the center , which Rauf estimates will cost 105 - 140 million dollars to build , possibly financed with bonds .
Mohammed - Iqbal Hossain Chowdhury , a Bangladeshi immigrant running a newspaper kiosk across the street , called for an end to prejudice .
“ The people who will come to pray here are working people .
We are coming here to pray to God , ” the 42 - year - old said , lifting his hands skyward with a huge smile .

“ Ground Zero — that is about terrorists .
Terrorism is a different thing .
There are a billion or more Muslims around the world .
They are n’t all terrorists !
I hope people will see us coming here and see that all of us come from one god . ”
Walking past the shuttered - up Burlington Coat Factory retail store to catch a Subway train , local worker Angela Long , 60 , said Muslims can be as American as anyone else .
“ I do n’t believe that Islam equals terrorism .
There are crazy people everywhere , ” she said .
And those arguing that a mosque has no right to exist near Ground Zero ?
“ They should read our Constitution , ” she said .
German car - maker Volkswagen has designed a bike .
Weird , right ?
Actually , no .
The Bik.e is actually a sidekick for your car , something you are supposed to remove from the trunk when you have parked up and can go no further on four wheels .
The Bik.e is electric , and folds up to fit in the spare - wheel well in the back of your car .
While sitting in the dark like a kidnap victim , the Bik.e recharges from the car 's electrical system as you drive , meaning it is always ready to go .
And that 's just as well , as the Bik.e has no pedals .
If you run out of juice when away from the mother - ship then you 'll be scooting back Fred Flintstone - style , or just pushing .
With a 12.5 mile range and a 12.5 mph top speed , it 'll be fine to take you from your Walmart parking space right up to the front door , while the disk - brakes and LED lights will keep you safe .
VW does n't seem to be planning to supply the Bik.e with its own cars yet , but Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg , the R&D boss at VW , told an audience at Auto China 2010 that it is committed to actually bringing it to market .
I 'm all for getting people out of their cars and on to two wheels – after all , one less car on the road means one less two - ton hunk of death piloted by a cellphone - dialing driver directly at vulnerable cyclists .
But I can't imagine that this electric scooter is going to be cheap , so why not just throw a Brompton folding bike in the trunk ?
You might even get fit as you ride it .

Dr. Bastiaan R. Bloem of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands thought he had seen it all in his years of caring for patients with Parkinson ’s disease .
But the 58 - year - old man who came to see him recently was a total surprise .
The man had had Parkinson ’s disease for 10 years , and it had progressed until he was severely affected .
Parkinson ’s , a neurological disorder in which some of the brain cells that control movement die , had made him unable to walk .
He trembled and could walk only a few steps before falling .
He froze in place , his feet feeling as if they were bolted to the floor .
But the man told Dr. Bloem something amazing : he said he was a regular exerciser — a cyclist , in fact — something that should not be possible for patients at his stage of the disease , Dr. Bloem thought .
“ He said , ‘ Just yesterday I rode my bicycle for 10 kilometers ’ — six miles , ” Dr. Bloem said .
“ He said he rides his bicycle for miles and miles every day . ”
In a move aimed directly at marijuana smokers and the vendors who supply them with their pipes and bongs , the Florida legislature has passed a bill that will make it illegal to sell drug paraphernalia in most head shops .
The bong bill , HB 187 , passed the Senate earlier and was approved unanimously in a House floor vote on Wednesday .
It now awaits signature by Gov. Charlie Christ .
Under the bill , only shops where the sale of tobacco products and accessories constitute 75 % of income or shops where the sale of pipes and bongs constitutes less than 25 % of income will be allowed to sell a long list of smoking devices .
These include pipes of any material , water pipes , carburetion tubes and devices , chamber pipes , carburetor pipes , electric pipes , air - driven pipes , chillums , bongs , and ice pipes or chillers .
Violation of the law would be a misdemeanor .
Offenders could face up to a year in jail .
If signed by the governor , the law would go into effect on July 1 .
Head shop owners tried to organize to fight back , even creating a web site , Kill Bill 187 , in a vain bid to block the bill .
Jay Work , the owner of Grateful J's Grateful Deadhead Shop in Margate and a second shop in Boca Raton , led the fight .
" Shop owners , small - business owners are being thrown under the bus here , " he told the Broward Palm Beach New Times .
" They 're saying that if I sell a $ 4,000 piece of art at my store , that I have to sell $ 12,000 worth of cigarettes .
I 'm not sure who that helps , " Work says .
" They 're saying basically you can sell this stuff -- we 're just going to make it really hard . "
While drug paraphernalia is already illegal in Florida , pipes that could be used to smoke tobacco are legal to make , own , buy , and sell .
They only become paraphernalia if they are used to do something illegal .
But this bill attempts to circumvent the law with its restrictions on sales , Work said .
" The pipe itself is just a pipe , " Work says .
" The pipes I sell are harmless unless you take the pipe outside and beat someone over the head with it . "
" I 've been fighting the pipe industry for the longest , because it is all a part of the drug trade and the criminal enterprise that we know exists and destroys neighborhoods , families and order in our society , " said sponsor Rep. Darryl Rouson ( D - Tampa Bay ) earlier this month .
" When was the last time you stopped at a red light and saw someone smoking a hit of tobacco out of one of these one - shooters or water pipes ? " he told NBC Miami .
Rouson , a self - described former crackhead , has gone after paraphernalia in the past , too .
Last year , he proposed a bill that would have imposed an extra sales tax on smoking paraphernalia to pay for DARE programs that were facing cuts .
" Florida has a conscience and an awareness that marijuana and the smoking and ingesting of it is not healthy for an individual , nor is it healthy for public safety and the order in society , " Rouson added .
When it comes to power , density is the key .
Energy density .
The reason that solar power , wind power , and ethanol are so expensive is that they are derived from very diffuse energy sources .
It takes a lot of energy collectors such as solar cells , wind turbines , or corn stalks covering many square miles of land to produce the same amount of power that traditional coal , natural gas , or nuclear plants can on just a few acres .
Each of these alternative energy sources is based on mature technology .
Agriculture and fermentation have their roots in prehistory , windmills date back at least to 65 B.C. , the photovoltaic effect was discovered in 1839 .
Yet nowhere in the world are these technologies serving as primary energy sources without significant government subsidies .
While incremental improvements can be expected , what is needed for them to become viable is an order of magnitude increase in productivity .
As old and as well - researched as the technologies are , such improvements are possible but unlikely .
As significant future energy sources these technologies are dead ends , which is why the government , and not the private sector , is funding them .
Industry is more than willing to risk research dollars on technologies that show real promise , but it is not willing to flush shareholder money down a rat hole .
Politicians , however , operate from different incentives .
When a crisis , real or imagined , makes headlines , they want voters to see them doing “ something ” about it , and they must move quickly because election cycles and constituent attention spans are short .
Funding long - term research in promising technologies is not sufficient to meet politicians ’ needs .
Solar panels , wind turbines , and ethanol refineries are all current technology , and can be erected quickly with fanfare and photo - ops .
By the time these alternative power sources prove to be financial and , possibly , environmental busts , the politicians will have been reelected and voters ’ attention will have shifted to the next crisis .
Another benefit of subsidizing “ shovel ready ” solutions is that existing technologies have existing supporters who can provide campaign funds .
Such supporters , however , constitute a well - financed “ status quo ” that will make government funding , once started , difficult to end .
For example , even though corn- based ethanol has driven up food and fuel prices , increased auto emissions , raised atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ( by causing additional acreage to be tilled ) , and possibly resulted in net energy losses , the government is still subsidizing the industry and still requiring that the fuel be added to gasoline .
Wind energy , for its part , has been “ just a few years away ” from being economically competitive with conventional power for at least the last 25 years , and this will not change any time soon .
The Energy Information Agency predicts that in 2016 wind power will still be 49 % to 77 % more expensive than electricity from either coal or natural gas .
Furthermore , because wind turbines work only when the wind blows , wind farms cannot replace conventional plants .
Backup power from conventional sources , usually gas turbines , must be ready to come on line the moment the wind fails .
Despite these fundamental problems , subsidies continue to flow thanks to an entrenched lobby .
By contrast , consider the significant oil industry investments in researching biofuels made from algae .
Unlike ethanol , biofuels are chemically similar to fuel made from petroleum and , like petroleum - based fuels , have a significantly higher energy content than does ethanol .
Biofuels can also be handled by current fuel distribution systems and can be burned in today ’s vehicles .
Algae can be grown in brackish water on desert land and , with today ’s technology , can produce over 2,000 gallons of fuel per acre each year .
This compares favorably with the approximately 250 gallons of ethanol that can be produced from an acre of corn – a ratio of 8 to 1 .
Accounting for the differences in BTU content , the ratio jumps to over 12 to 1 .
It may even be possible to boost productivity to 100,000 gallons per acre per year , raising algae ’s potential to over 600 times that of corn - based ethanol !
Biofuels are carbon neutral because the carbon dioxide released when they are burned is first extracted from the atmosphere by the algae .
Unlike burning petroleum - based fuels , then , burning biofuels will not result in a net increase in atmospheric CO 2 levels .
With algae ’s vast potential , it is easy to understand why private industry is interested , and why no government subsidies are needed to encourage investment .
Moreover , if algae - based fuels do not prove viable , the companies now researching them will have no “ status quo ” problems with ending their investments and shifting scarce resources to more promising technologies – where “ promise ” is measured in density .

After all it's our ABC .
The world 's third richest man , Warren Buffett , today declared that he saw nothing wrong in an allegedly fraudulent $ 1bn mortgage deal by Goldman Sachs and suggested that losers in the transaction , including Royal Bank of Scotland , had only themselves to blame for exercising " dumb " judgment .
After weeks of silence on the subject , Buffett delivered a valuable endorsement to the embattled Wall Street bank at Saturday 's annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway business empire in Nebraska .
The 79 - year - old billionaire said he " loved " his own $ 5bn investment in Goldman and offered " 100 % " support to the bank 's chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein .
" I do not hold against Goldman at all the fact that an allegation has been made by the Securities and Exchange Commission , " Buffett told a gathering of 40,000 of his followers at Omaha 's cavernous QWest sports stadium .
But if fraud charges were proven , he added , " it 's something more serious and we'd look at that at the time " .
A long - term customer of Goldman , Buffett has enlisted the bank 's help in buying scores of businesses .
At the height of the financial crisis in September 2008 , he lent $ 5 bn to Goldman – a loan that yields annual income of $ 500 m for Berkshire Hathaway , at a rate of $ 15 a second .
" We love the investment , " said Buffett , who accepted that the SEC 's charges had damaged Goldman 's reputation .
" There 's no question the allegation alone causes the company to lose reputation .
Obviously , the past few weeks have hurt the company and hurt morale . "
The SEC's case against Goldman centres on a 2007 mortgage derivatives deal named Abacus , struck by Fabrice Tourre , a banker now based in London .
The SEC contends that Tourre failed to inform participants about the extent of involvement of a hedge fund , Paulson & Co , that had a short position betting on Abacus 's failure .
Within nine months , more than 99 % of the mortgages referenced by Abacus were in default , leaving Royal Bank of Scotland 's Dutch subsidiary , ABN Amro , with an $ 840 m bill as it had insured the derivative against failure .
Buffett was scornful of this loss , pointing out that ABN voluntarily agreed to insure Abacus for a fee of $ 1.6 m .
" It 's a little hard for me to get terribly sympathetic with the fact that a bank made a dumb credit deal . "
The billionaire , who is known as the " sage of Omaha " , described Goldman 's chief executive as " smart " and " high grade " and brushed aside a question about who could replace him : " If Lloyd had a twin brother , I would vote for him .
I 've never given it a thought . "
Buffett 's annual meeting entails a vast influx of people into his modestly proportioned home town .
Omaha 's Eppley airport said it was expecting arrivals from 100 private jets on Friday , 15 times more than usual .
Buffett and his business partner , Charlie Munger , spend a day each year dispensing pearls of folksy wisdom in response to investors ' questions .
Front - row spectators include Bill Gates , a close friend and associate of Buffett .
Early in the meeting , Buffett offered thoughts on the impact of Greece 's financial crisis on the euro .
He described the economic meltdown in Athens as a test case in what happened when a nation made promises to its citizens while it lacked the power to print its own money .
Buffett predicted " high drama " in the eurozone , saying : " I do n't know how this movie ends .
That does n't mean I 'm forecasting disasters .
But I try not go to movies like that . "
With a collection of businesses varying from Dairy Queen cafes to Geico insurance and Fruit of the Loom underwear , Buffett 's personal fortune is estimated at $ 47bn .
He is ranked by Forbes magazine as the world 's third richest man , behind the Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim and Microsoft 's Bill Gates .
1. An awful newspaper with bad , bad jounalism .
It supported the nazis ( no joke ) , is anti-abortion , anti-imigration , racist and homophobic .
Only last week it attacked My Chemical Romance and other such emo bands in a manner reminiscent of post -Columbine articles about Marylin Manson .
The aricle claimed the band promote self harm and warned parents about the " dangerous " emo cult .
Incredibly , it also caled Green Day emo .
In short , if The Daily Mail had it 's way all teenagers would be locked up , the BNP would rule the country and we'd all wear swastikas .
2. A story made up of unbelievable lies is often reffered to as " Daily Mail-esqe "
" The internet has many sites dedicated to Emo fashion ( dyed black hair brushed over your face , layering , black , black , black ) , Emo bands ( Green Day , My Chemical Romance ) , Emo conversation ( sighing , wailing , poetry ) .
" " The courting of misery and death is a long - established teenage tradition .
How many bedroom walls have been plastered with posters of drippy pre-Raphaelite heroines , or Marc Bolan or Kurt Cobain ? " " But compared to the music , the poetry is positively cheerful .
The Gothic bands have names such as Bloody , Dead And Sexy or Colder Than Death . "
Qoutes from The Daily Mail 2 .
" And then the black guy stole my baby and the gay man shot my husband and then the emo kid commited suicide right there in front of me !

The Power of Human Connection
By Gina Simmons , Ph.D .
Many years ago , as a lonely starving student , I took a walk to get away from my dingy apartment and my blue mood .
I saw a rumpled flyer on the wall of a store .
It read “ Volunteers needed for suicide prevention hotline and food bank .
No experience necessary .
Training provided .
Call Crisis House . ”
Attracted to the “ no experience necessary ” phrase and the idea of helping people , I wrote the telephone number on my hand .
The human connections I made from that phone call led me to my first professional job .
That job and those friendships led to my next professional position and my next .
Years later I would meet my husband from the string of human connections made from that random phone call and volunteer experience .
The famous social psychologist , Stanley Milgram , performed a “ small world ” experiment .
He wanted to see how many human connections it would take for a random group of people in Omaha Nebraska to send a letter to a specific person they did n’t know in Boston .
People were told to send the letter to anyone they knew who might know someone in Boston .
On average it took 6 stops before the letter reached the man in Boston .
This spurred the “ six degrees of separation ” concept .
Subsequent modern experiments , using email , support Milgram ’s finding that we are , on average , about six hops from anyone in the world .
For example , I know someone ( one hop ) who knows the American Idol star Adam Lambert ( two hops ) .
Adam knows Ryan Seacrest , the host of a gazillion television shows ( three hops ) .
Ryan knows Oprah Winfrey ( four hops ) .
Oprah knows almost everyone in the world ( five hops ) .
So if you know me you are six hops from anyone in the world .
If you know Oprah you ’re a lot closer .
People still have fun with the “ Six degrees of Kevin Bacon ” game .
For epidemiologists the study of human connections is serious business .
Outbreaks of SARS , AIDS and swine flu send scientists running to contain the spread of potentially fatal diseases .
Human emotions spread in a similar way .
Numerous examples of mass hysteria , have been reported throughout history .
Researchers have found that anger , fear , anxiety , happiness and depression spread like viruses through our human networks .
They discovered that humans influence one another at three degrees of separation .
This is called the “ three degrees of influence ” rule .
For example , if I ’m a happy person my happiness can influence my friend ’s friend ’s friend .
In fact , having happy friends better predicts your happiness than having money .
Similarly we know obesity spreads through networks as our behaviors and norms influence our friends .
Sociologist Brian Uzzi performed some interesting studies on social networks .
He and his colleague Jarrett Spiro studied Broadway shows to try to find out why some succeeded and some failed , despite comparable talent .
They found that shows made with people who had never worked together tended to fail .
At the other extreme , shows made with people who had all worked together previously also performed poorly .
Uzzi found the most successful creative collaborations consisted of individuals with both weak and strong ties .
The strongly linked performers possessed a comfort with one another and the newcomers inspired spice and originality .
Businesses seeking to inspire creativity might learn from this combination of strong and weak ties .
If you want to learn to build stronger networks check out this article coauthored by Uzzi .
Stronger social networks correlate with higher income , better health , fewer days of loneliness and increased happiness .
It appears that a combination of strong and weak ties helps provide the human connections we need for optimal functioning .
Close ties to family and deep long - term friendships provide strong connections that can help us slog along through the storms of life .
If you add weaker ties with community associations , religious or political organizations or other social groups , you infuse your life with a diversity of social connections that can inform and inspire you .
Loss of loved one ’s is a painful fact of life .
Those with a variety of social connections make it through these painful times much better than those on the periphery of the network .
In fact , providing social support to others helps our health and well - being even more than those we support .
If you feel depressed , angry , afraid , anxious , worried … all those gloomy feelings , think about whose day you can brighten .
Think about how you might influence your friends , friend ’s friend .
Self - destructive behavior hurts the people we know and the people they know too .
On a happier note , we can uplift others with simple thoughtful gestures , laughter , music and limitless other kindnesses .
When we help others we literally help ourselves by uplifting our entire network .
On a miserable day , many years ago , I took a walk to get out of my dreary mood .
I saw a flyer , made a call , and worked on a hotline helping others .
That single decision led to many human connections ( including you fine readers ) that inspire and challenge me to this day .
Happy connecting !
Elinor Ostrom ’s findings on behavioral theory ’s relation to collective action are imperative to the formation and sustainability of a libertarian order .
The prevailing myth of statism is that the larger , more uniform the institution of monopolistic governance , the more efficient people are to experience common goals of security , justice and resource allocation .
This is what Professor Elinor Ostrom called , in a revised draft [ .pdf ] of her acceptance of the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics , the “ presumption that governments always do a better job than users in organizing and protecting important resources ” .
( Sorry , professor , I ’m quoting it . )
Prof .
Ostrom reveals the statist rationalization as :
When analysts perceive the human beings they model as being trapped inside perverse situations , they then assume that other human beings external to those involved — scholars and public officials — are able to analyze the situation , ascertain why counterproductive outcomes are reached , and posit what changes in the rules - in - use will enable participants to improve outcomes .
Then , external officials are expected to impose an optimal set of rules on those individuals involved .
It is assumed that the momentum for change must come from outside the situation rather than from the self - reflection and creativity of those within a situation to restructure their own patterns of interaction .
The inefficiencies and immorality of government is assumed to be understood and not the purpose of this post .
Libertarian theory and practice has recognized this to varying degrees — always greater than that of conventional wisdom — but arguments persist as to how we get from a statist society to a libertarian society .
Arguments persist as to what avenues of activism are to be taken .
Arguments persist as to cultural ecosystems of a libertarian society .
What is agreed upon is that non-violent human action is not to be prohibited by force and no forceful barriers should inhibit the polycentric legal order .
The combination of these two basic fundamentals of a free society are expressed in one concept : self - management .
A libertarian society is one where individuals ’ rational self - interests are not inhibited , but freely pursued .
For those whose self - interest is not isolated to a shack in a remote forest , it is a society which challenges the finite time - space construct usage of the current order to maximize pursuit of eudaimonia .
We ’ve evolved , in the technical sense , past the hunter - gatherer and feudal orders , but industrialized capitalism and the technological grid , artificial intelligence has not maximized our liberty and happiness .
The fact is that many of our lives are much more governed by non-governmental organizations — the workplace , our families , schools — than the state apparatus .
I do n’t argue that the State does n’t make these aspects of life more difficult , but when we eat , rest , socialize — establish , enrich and maintain relationships — exercise , secure our psychological stability , learn to understand the world around us and beyond , fancy ourselves with hobbies and the like are largely scheduled and experienced by these non-governmental institutions we exploit to fulfill our most primal needs to survive and infinitely varying sophistical degrees of desire .
Liberating the mind from orthodoxy is a challenge to achieving a free society , but ask the people you know — or random people , for that matter — what they want in life and it ’s seldom a lifestyle of complete inaction or one of constant career - based labor .
It ’s usually one where their labor fulfills their basic needs with minimal interference in — or maximum opportunity to — fulfill higher needs of social interaction , esteem and self - actualization , as modeled by Abraham Maslow .
Neither the State nor our workplaces , churches , families , schools , social circles meet these needs in totality by themselves .
Self - interest in a bubble can be misleading and limiting as our inner collective interest is rarely self - sufficient .
The most benign avatars of the State collectivize interests of the loudest factions at the expense of violently marginalizing others , but its primary objective of preservation requires the conflicting interest of serving oligarchical circles with privilege .
Doing away with the State yesterday establishes a void .
Let ’s say the already inefficient and immoral institutions of security and service — on which society is heavily dependent — no longer exist as we ’ve known them , but the needs , desires and opportunity in them do n’t disappear with the monopoly of the State .
Human action decides the direction of these institutions — their objectives , conduct and sustainability .
The assumption that all will become benign for - profit service providers or mutual community councils that create solutions to the natural crisis of diversity are irresponsible , at best .
In short , a libertarian society understands that aggression is counter - intuitive to harmony , therefore anti-social methods of solving social problems are futile .
Prof . Ostrom ’s dialectic addresses :
The dichotomous view of the world explained patterns of interaction and outcomes related to markets for the production and exchange of strictly private goods ( Alchian 1950 ) , but it has not adequately accounted for internal dynamics within private firms ( Williamson 1975 , 1986 ) .
Nor does it adequately deal with the wide diversity of institutional arrangements that humans craft to govern , provide , and manage public goods and common - pool resources .
The ‘ privatization of the means of production ’ is a difficult term to use because it ’s too commonly accepted that “ public ” means owned and controlled by the State , while “ private ” means owned and controlled by non-State actors .
The State is a partial reflection of some — at least minimally — rational value in common - pool resources .
Even in a anarchotopian version of Lockean - Rothbardian privatization , resource control and dependency overlap .
The anarcho - syndicalists of Spain — no matter what your opinion of them — understood that their society of anarcho - communists , libertarian socialists and republicans could neither be completely communally controlled nor sustainable by sectarianism .
In short : Common interests among individuals that overlap with conflicting interests are a fundamental aspect of the natural law of markets .
Economists call this “ market failure ” and — from my extremely general experiences with economists — explore material incentive - based methods to marginalize the “ failure ” .
In political science , we call this the “ social dilemma ” and — from more my more substantial experiences — explore cooperation - based methods of maximizing the incentives of organization .
Economists tend to isolate the political means to immorally , self - defeating aggressive acts of the State and political scientists tend to isolate the economic means to dehumanizing , materialistic resource acquisition .
Coalescing rational theories of economic sustainability with that of political organization is imperative to the progression of libertarianism .
The conflict between the common views of private and public goods is a false dichotomy between absolutist views of exclusivity and inclusiveness , at its most benign , in theory — morally hazardous forms of domination in practice , at its most destructive .
Libertarian narratives have a — in my view , nefarious — tendency to ignore the interdependent cultural dynamics of self - management , free association and property rights .
( Defining property rights in Prof. Ostrom ’s “ bundled rights ” concept of rights to : access , withdrawal , management , exclusion and alienation . )
These discussions become lazy conflicts between centralizing the final arbiter and mob rule majoritarianism — the former , in the interest of finality and the latter is … well , just lazy .
I literally just finished reading Polycentric Games and Institutions : Readings from the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis ( 2000 ) , from which I want to explore an essay written by Prof .
Ostrom titled , “ A Behaviorial Theory to the Rational Choice Theory of Collective Action ” .
She begins :
“ You would not be reading this essay if were not for some of our ancestors learning how to undertake collective action to solve social dilemmas… .
What our ancestors and contemporaries have learned about engaging in collective action for mutual defense , child rearing , and survival is not , however , understood or explained by the extant theory of collective action ” ( 472 ) .
Actually existing capitalism ‘s pyramid approach to social dilemmas are primitive relative to , what Prof.
Ostrom calls , “ first - generation models of rational choice ” limited by “ bounded or incomplete rationality ” as political science is moving toward a “ second - generation theory of boundedly , rational , innovative , and normative behavior ” ( 487 ) .
She continues :
If political scientists do not have an empirically grounded theory of collective action , then we are hand - waving at our central questions .
I am afraid that we are doing a lot of hand - waving ( 472 ) … .
We have not yet developed a behavioral theory of collective action based on models of the individual consistent with empirical evidence about how individuals make decision in social - dilemma situation .
A behavioral commitment to theory grounded in empirical inquiry is essential is we are to understand such basic question as why face - to - face communication so consistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas or how structural variables facilitate or impeded effective collective action .
Social dilemmas occur whenever individuals in interdependent situations face choice in which the maximization of short - term interest yields outcomes leaving all participants worse off than feasible alternatives .
In a public good dilemma , for example , all those who would benefit from the provision of a public good — such as pollution control , radio broadcasts , or weather forecasting — find it costly to contribute and would prefer others to pay for the good instead .
If everyone follows the equilibrium strategy , then the good is not provided or is underprovided .
Yet , everyone would be better off if everyone were to contribute ( 473 ) .
In prehistoric times , simple survival was dependent both on the aggressive pursuit of self - interest and on collective action to achieve cooperation in defense , food acquisition , and child rearing .
Reciprocity among close kin was used to solve social dilemmas , leading to a higher survival rate for those indivdual who lived in families and used reciprocity within the family ( Hamilton 1964 ) … .
Evolutionary psychologists have produced substantial evidence that human beings have evolved the capactity — similar to that of learning a language — to learn reciprocity norms and general social rules that enhance returns from collective action ( Cosmides and Tooby 1992 ) .
At the same time , cognitive scientists have also shown that our genetic inheritance does n’t give us the capabilities to do unbiased , complex and full analyses without substantial acquired knowledge and practice as well as reliable feedback from the relevant environment …
All long - enduring political philosophies have recognized human nature to be complex mixtures of the pursuit of self - interest combined with the capability of acquiring internal norms of behavior and following enforced rules when understood and perceived to be legitimate ( 474 ) …
Field research also shows that individuals systematically engage in collective action to provide local public goods or manage common - pool resources without an external authority to offer inducements or impose sanctions ( 474-475 ) .
In detail :
“ Behavior in social dilemmas is affected by many structural variables ” which include “ size of group , heterogeneity of participants , their dependence on the benefits received , their discount rates , the type and predictability of transformation processes involved , the nesting of organizational levels , monitoring techniques , and the information available to the participants ” ;
A diversity of disciplines “ have active research programs focusing on how groups of individuals achieve collective action ” .
Valid theories of a free society , solutions to social problems should move toward an “ empirically supported theoretical framework for the analysis of social dilemmas [ to ] integrate and link their efforts … based in theories consistent with out evolutionary and adaptive heritage need to join ranks of theoretical tools used in the social and biological sciences ”
A libertarian society , as opposed to a command economy or one with a pre-packaged system of ownership norms would further prove that “ individuals systematically engage in collective action to provide public good or manage common - pool resources without an external authority to offer inducements or impose sanctions ”
To argue otherwise is to argue for the coerced implementation of tyrannical ‘ final arbiter ’ elements of the State .
“ In all [ social dilemma ] models , a set of individuals is involved in a game in which a strategy leading to a Nash equilibrium for a single iteration of a game yields less than an optimal outcome for all involved .
The equilibrium is thus Pareto inferior .
The optimal outcome for all involved could be achieved if those involved “ cooperated ” by selecting strategies other than those prescribed by an equilibrium solution to a noncooperative game ( Harsanyi and Selten 1988 ) . ” Cooperation being : ( 1 ) All participants have common knowledge of the exogenously fixed structure of the situation and of the payoffs to be received by all individuals under all combination of strategies ; ( 2 ) Decision about strategies are made independently , often simultaneously ; ( 3 ) In a symmetric game , all participants have available the same strategies ; ( 4 ) No external actor ( or central authority ) is present to enforce agreement among participants about their choices ” .
In finitely repeated experiments , the “ rate of decay ” was compared “ when experienced subjects are explicitly told an experiment will last 10,40 , or 60 rounds ” .
The more rounds , the more “ subjects appear to be learning how to cooperate at a moderate level for even longer periods .
Cooperation rates approach zero only in the last few periods , whenever these occur ” .
Politically , we see this crisis of apathy , noncooperation , submission to the decisions of others all the time .
Take the antiwar movement in the U.S. — on a fairly steep upward trend throughout the Bush Administration , began a slight decline to align with the support of John Kerry , began a sharper upward trend after the incumbent ’s victory , began a slighter decline to align with the toned - down rhetoric and illusions of Barack Obama to the point where the illusions of finality through the president ’s victory was perceived .
The experiments not only showed increased mutualization , but also “ how individuals are able to obtain results that are substantially ‘ better than rational ' ” , as defined by the “ currently accepted models ” for two reasons : ( 1 ) “ cheap talk allows individuals an opportunity to make conditional promises to one another and potentially to build trust that others will reciprocate ” ; and ( 2 ) “ the capacity to solve second - order social dilemmas that change the structure of the first - order dilemma ” ( 478-482 ) .
The ‘ supreme final arbiter ’ model of decision - making employs a “ noncooperative game theory ” where “ players are assumed to be unable to make enforceable agreements ” , so mutualization methods of “ communication is viewed ” — I would say , the self - interest of those affected by decision are deliberately suppressed and marginalized to sustain and enrich the supremacy of the final arbiter — “ as cheap talk ( Farrell 1987 ) . ”
I would say the threat of their domination are circumstances where in :
a social dilemma , self - interested players are expected to use communication to try to convince others to cooperate and promise cooperative action but then to choose the Nash equilibrium strategy when they make their private decision ( 483 ) .
Top - down hierarchies are contrary to “ consistent , strong , and replicable findings ” that “ substantial increases in the levels of cooperation are achieved when individuals are allowed to communicate face to face ” .
Analyzing more than 100 experiments involving over 5,000 subjects conducted across the lines of academic disciplines :
Sally ( 1995 ) finds that opportunities for face - to - face communication in one - shot experiments significantly raise the cooperation rate , on average , by more than 45 percentage points [ achieving ] 40 percentage points more an average than in repeated games without communication ( 483 ) .
In discussing the voluntary cooperative ownership of goods , minorities — participating and non-participating — are the most common vocalized concern to critics of self - management .
Rule changes and thin coercion methods of “ using scarce resources to punish those who do not cooperate or keep agreements are usually not considered viable options ” .
There can be no libertarian theory to universally command second - order social dilemmas , which is a common criticism made by those who will jump through hoops to maintain the suppression of the cooperation in the first place in favor of unjust command - based structures .
A truism to be accepted by libertarians is that in opposing command social systems is that individualist ethical theories of self - interest are participatory in practice .
Diversity increases the probability of second - order social dilemmas .
Suppression by force is the destruction of communication and the creation of moral hazard for future dilemmas .
Ignorance brings us back to “ hand - waving ” .
The natural , moral , efficient solution for the diversity problem is in reducing scale and cooperative trial - and - error with lesser stakes in these “ highly unpredictable environments ” ( 485 ) .
Prof. Ostrom continues :
The particular rules adopted by participant vary radically to reflect local circumstance and the cultural repertoire of acceptable and know rules used generally in a region … .
Given the complexity of the physical world that individuals frequently confront , they are rarely ever able to ‘ get the rules right ’ on the first or second try ( 485 ) ….
Toshio Yamagishi ( 1986 ) , for example , conducted experiments with subjects who had earlier completed a questionnaire including items from a scale measuring trust .
Students who ranked higher on the trust scale consistently contributed about 20 percent more to collective goods that those who ranked lower .
When given an opportunity to contribute to a substantial ‘ punishment fund ’ to be used to fine the individual who contributed the least to their joint outcomes , however , low - trusting individuals contributed significantly more to the punishment fund and also achieved the highest level of cooperation .
in the last rounds of this experiment , they were contributing 90 percent of their resources to the joint fund … [ and ] respond more to a change in the structure of the game than those who are initially more trusting ( 486 ) .
In a libertarian system of free association , the “ punishment fund ” is simply a lesser say in the particular decision - making process — a reduction that is most likely reflected in their participation and conduct anyway .
To leave is the association is to have restricted access to the goods in common .
If an individual chooses to withdraw participation , equity share would have to be transferred in proportion to the individuals ’ participation as any property contribution has already been contributed to the collective .
Therefore , it is in an individuals ’ interest to participate , at the very least , to the degree by which decisions affect him or her .
It is in the interest of all participants to pre-determine this rule on the distribution of bargaining power at the very formation of the collective .
Prof .
Ostrom found from her analysis of experiments and field settings that “ individuals temporarily caught in a social - dilemma structure are likely to invest resources to innovate and change the structure itself in order to improve joint outcomes ”
Neither the cooperative nor the noncooperative models could “ adequately predict behavior in one - shot and finitely repeated social dilemma ” or provide “ explanation for the conditions that tend to enhance or detract from cooperation levels ” .
The noncooperative models ’ measure of efficiency is guided by the command and quantified mostly by the gains of the ‘ supreme final arbiter ’ — the politician , capitalist , prosecutor .
How their decision effect others are the social costs , externalized to relative masses with little - to - no power in preventing this anti-social debt .
It ’s ignorant of the “ general theory of human behavior that views all human as complex , fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and who are able to learn heuristics , norms , rules , and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes ” ( 488 ) .
The “ development of a consistent theory ” to maximize cooperation “ is important not only for our scientific understanding but also for the design of institutions to facilitate individuals achieving higher levels of productive outcomes in social dilemmas ” ( 487 ) .
Theories contradictory to such progress is to perpetuate authoritarian elements of society and , worse , regress to feudalistic elements of the old order .
Many libertarians draw on institutional structures of societies past to provide model examples of liberty working .
Unfortunately , industrialized capitalism has exploited the nature of the State to create a global kleptocracy .
Markets free of coercion do n’t exist in our advanced society as power and wealth have become centralized to the peak of the circumstantial pyramids of the zeitgeist .
Conspiracy theorists conclude this to be a manufactured new world order when empirical evidence points more toward a world in great disorder due to our seemingly - archaic norm of passivity .
This has left the oligopolies to employ power and wealth toward efforts to destroy one another .
We ’re the ignored externalized social cost of their wars , economic terrorism ( odious debt , sanctions , cartelizing regulations ) and usage of resources to maintain perpetuity .
The role of participatory democracy in a new order ought to be employed as an organizational method to create second - generation institutions as alternatives to the State and Wall Street as distributors of power and wealth , respectively .
There is little reason to believe that the first - generation institutions which smashed the old older of the ( relatively primitive ) agrarian world can suffice a stateless society after two revolutions — the Industrial and Technological — and the illumination of a post - Enlightenment ethno- cultural melting pot , let alone taking liberation any substantial distance from the lecture halls and blogosphere .
[ I literally just read “ Polycentric Games and Institutions ” and wanted to get these thoughts and impressions out while they were fresh .

BRELS CPU Balancer is a GNU / GPL console utility intended to set the affinity mask of all running processes ( except by protected processes like AVP.exe , from Kaspersky , and Windows XP system process ) , making a balanced distribution of tasks across all system 's logical processors , according to Windows ' scheduling scheme ( affinity mask is only a indication to the OS , not a definitive value ) .
The idea for such an utility came when I purchased a new computer featuring Intel Core i7 920 processor , which sports four cores in HyperThreading , with a total of eight logical processors to Windows .
Being a Windows XP user , I noticed that process execution was restricted to a single core , resulting in high system CPU usage waste .
In the attempt to find how to solve the problem , I came across Process Lasso , which inspired me to release my own alternative , way simpler .
BRELS CPU Balancer is scheduled to run every five minutes , in order to keep the system optimized ( attention : the task must be scheduled manually , the utility runs once and quits ) .
In order to verify the task distribution across the logical cores , run task manager and watch cores ' usage .
Warning : this utility is unnecessary under Windows 7 , since the scheduler already balances the tasks optimally and using the utility may affect its behavior .
To schedule a task to run Cpu Balancer every five minutes , run this in command prompt ( works in XP / Vista / Seven ) :
Deadly Premonition makes the idea clear that the player serves as the voice in the head of the schizophrenic , and these moments remind one that all input in a video game is fundamentally like this .

Tens of thousands of Gaza children are due to attend camp sessions
Masked gunmen have attacked a UN summer camp being set up for children in the Gaza Strip , UN officials say .
The attackers burned tents and destroyed other equipment after tying up a guard .
They also left a letter threatening the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( Unrwa ) , John Ging .
No group has claimed the overnight raid , but observers suspect it is the work of Islamic extremists opposed to such camps for boys and girls .
" The armed men torched the camp , which contained recreational equipment and ( plastic ) swimming pools , and completely destroyed it , " Unrwa spokesman Abu Hasna told journalists .
The camp , due to open next month , is one of dozens of beach facilities set up by the UN offering a summer programme of arts , sport and other activities for some quarter of a milllion children in the Gaza Strip .
Representatives of the Hamas government condemned the attack and said those responsible would be found .
Unrwa chief John Ging said the agency " would not be intimidated by such attacks " .
He pledged the summer camp would take place as planned .
Mr Ging said there was " no doubt in my mind that it is vandalism linked to a certain degree of extremism .
It is an attack on the happiness of children . "

REDWOOD CITY , California —
Police closed in on the man who found and sold a prototype 4G iPhone after his roommate called an Apple security official and turned him in , according to a newly unsealed document in the ongoing police investigation .
The tip sent police racing to the home of 21 - year - old Brian Hogan , and began a strange scavenger hunt for evidence that a friend of Hogan 's had scattered around this Silicon Valley community .
Police recovered a desktop computer stashed inside a church , a thumb drive hidden in a bush alongside the road , and the iPhone 's serial - number stickers from the parking lot of a gas station .
The 10 - page search - warrant affidavit ( .pdf ) – unsealed Friday at the request of Wired.com and other news organizations – sheds new light on the events surrounding the sale of the prototype to Gizmodo , the Gawker Media–run gadget - news site that paid Hogan $ 5,000 for the device .
Gizmodo dropped a bombshell on the gadget world April 19 with a detailed look at the iPhone prototype , which an Apple employee named Robert " Gray " Powell had lost at a bar .
Gizmodo has acknowledged paying $ 5,000 for the phone and returned the phone to Apple after publishing its story about the prototype .
The affidavit confirms that Steve Jobs personally contacted Gizmodo to ask for the phone back , as reported by Newsweek last month .
According to the document , the roommate said Hogan told her he received a total of $ 8,500 for the phone , but did not indicate if all of the money came from Gizmodo or other sources as well .
The roommate also told police Gizmodo promised Hogan a bonus if and when Apple officially announced the product .
Police are investigating Gizmodo editor Jason
Chen for possible receipt of stolen property , copying of a trade secret , and destruction of property worth more than $ 400 , according to the affidavit , which was filed in support of a search warrant for Chen 's home .
Gizmodo partly disassembled the iPhone , a process that Apple alleges left it damaged .
Apple also told the police that the publication of Gizmodo 's story was " immensely damaging " to the company , because consumers would stop buying current generation iPhones in anticipation of the upcoming product .
Asked the value of the phone , Apple told the police " it was invaluable . "
Apple discovered that Hogan was the person who found the iPhone the day Gizmodo 's story broke , after Rick Orloff , director of information security at the company , received a phone call from one of Hogan 's two roommates , Katherine Martinson .
She told Apple that Hogan had found the phone and had been offering it to news outlets in exchange for a payment , despite having identified Powell as the rightful owner from a Facebook page visible on the phone 's display when he found it .
" Sucks for him , " Hogan allegedly told Martinson about Powell .
" He lost his phone .
Should n't have lost his phone . "
Martinson turned Hogan in , because Hogan had plugged the phone into her laptop in an attempt to get it working again after Apple remotely disabled it .
She was convinced that Apple would be able to trace her Internet IP address as a result .
" Therefore she contacted Apple in order to absolve herself of criminal responsibility , " according to the detective who wrote the affidavit .
An Apple spokeswoman told Threat Level that Apple officials took Martinson 's tip directly to the district attorney 's office , and did not show up at Hogan 's house , as a Wired.com source claimed last month .
" We reported what we believed was a crime and the DA is taking it from there , " said Apple spokeswoman Katie Cotton .
Police were preparing a search warrant affidavit for Hogan 's apartment two days later , when Martinson phoned them to report that Hogan and a second roommate , Thomas Warner , were in the process of removing evidence from their Redwood City apartment : a desktop computer , stickers from the iPhone , a thumb drive and a memory card .
Police raced to the apartment , but by the time they arrived , Hogan and Warner had left in separate cars with the evidence .
The police headed to Hogan 's parents ' house , also in Redwood City , and were let in by Hogan 's father .
They found Brian Hogan sitting on his bed with his girlfriend .
When the cops told Hogan that removing evidence implied " consciousness of guilt , " Hogan agreed to cooperate , and phoned his friend Warner , who had taken the computer gear and the stickers away in his car .
Warner directed the police to the nearby Sequoia Christian Church , where the cops recovered Hogan 's black desktop PC and flatscreen monitor outside an administrative office .
Warner initially claimed he did n't know where the other evidence was , but eventually told police where they could find the thumb drive and memory stick hidden in a bush .
He then offered that he may have accidentally dropped the serial - number sticker from the iPhone at a Chevron gas station .
Police found it there , in the parking lot .
Hogan 's attorney , Jeff Bornstein , said Friday he had not yet seen the affidavit , and could not comment on its details .
" Hogan cooperated fully with the police in terms of turning over the evidence that they sought , " said Bornstein .
Wired.com was unable to locate Warner or Martinson for comment .
The apartment where Hogan and his roommates lived was vacant Friday .
The affidavit supports the story , offered by Gizmodo and Hogan 's attorney , that the phone was found , and not stolen from the Apple employee .
The employee , Gray Powell , had been at the Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City with his uncle .
The last time he saw the phone was when he put it in his bag on the floor .
The iPhone may have tumbled from the bag when it fell over .
It was possible , but unlikely , that it was stolen from the bag , Powell told the police .
However , it 's generally considered theft under California law if one “ finds lost property under circumstances that give him knowledge of or means of inquiry as to the true owner ” and yet appropriates the property for his own use “ without first making reasonable and just efforts to find the owner and to restore the property to him . "
Story was updated at 7 pm to include comment from Apple spokeswoman .

Radically Inexpensive iPad Stand
May 26 , 2010 Posted in iPad by MurphyMay 26 , 2010
Walking out of the Apple store I had an idea :
Use a book stand for an iPad stand .
I looked around inside the Sur La Table store right next to the Apple store – did n’t see any dedicated book stands but they had plenty of plate holders .
I picked one up and saw the name Gibson Holder on the bottom .
Found a variant of the plate stand on Amazon , the N4 Display Stand .
It ’s a stable stand .
The white looks ok in my kitchen .
And it ’s inexpensive enough to have a few in the house .
When I got mine it was under $ 3 at Amazon , I bought a single .
It looks like they come in a 6 pack now for $ 8 .
I do n’t see the single listed anymore .
Downside :
In portrait mode it obstructs the home button and the charging port .
I ’m almost always in landscape so I do n’t really mind .
Some people might think it ’s too rigid and that it might scratch the iPad .
Generally I do n’t worry about that stuff – but maybe you do .
I carry my iPhone in my pocket without a case .
Admittedly , I expected more of a pliable coating on the wire frame , but I ’m still happy with it as an iPad stand .
The feel is like a sturdy coat hanger .
I use it mostly in my kitchen , more photos below .

Skype
Skype does not store password directly .
Instead it stores the encrypted hash of the password in the ' config.xml ' located in Skype 's user profile directory .
Typical user profile directory for Skype will be as follows ,
[ Windows XP ]
C: \Documents and Settings\< user_name > \Application Data\Skype\<account_name >
[ Windows Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8 ]
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming \Skype\<account_name >
This config.xml contains < Credentials2 > tag which contains encrypted hash of the password .
As per the research paper ' Vanilla Skype ' written by Fabrice Desclaux and Kostya Kortchinsky , Skype uses the MD5 hash of string " username
skyper
password " for authentication .
If user has set the ' Remember password ' option then this MD5 hash is encrypted using AES - 256 & SHA - 1 algorithms and finally saved into the ' Config.xml ' file .
Since the HASH of the password is saved , it is not possible to directly get the password .
Instead one has to use dictionary or brute force approach to find out the right password from the hash .
This approach may take days or months together based on the length & complexity of the password .
You can use our ' Skype Password Recovery ' to recover your lost or forgotten Skype password .

Let the spreading of FUD begin !
Known patent troll Larry Horn , CEO of MPEG - LA , is clearly feeling the heat – a heat that might set fire to his company ’s license to print money .
After a decade of empty threats towards
Theora , the company is apparently putting its it ’s - impossible - to - create - a - video - codec - that - does n ’t - infringe - on - our - stuff attitude into practice once again , by assembling a patent pool to go after VP8 .
Google , in the meantime , is not impressed .
All Things Digital approached Larry Horn to ask him whether or not the MPEG - LA is creating a patent pool license for WebM and VP8 .
It turns out the MPEG - LA is indeed doing just that , which should n’t come as a surprise because they have stated for years now that they believe it ’s impossible to create a video codec that does not infringe upon their patents .
“ Yes , ” Horn answered , “ In view of the marketplace uncertainties regarding patent licensing needs for such technologies , there have been expressions of interest from the market urging us to facilitate formation of licenses that would address the market ’s need for a convenient one - stop marketplace alternative to negotiating separate licenses with individual patent holders in accessing essential patent rights for VP8 as well as other codecs , and we are looking into the prospects of doing so . ”
In the meantime , Goodle does n’t appear to be particularly worried about the MPEG - LA and its FUD tactics .
The company states it has done its due diligence during the On2 acquisition and the open sourcing of the VP8 codec .
“ We have done a pretty through analysis of VP8 and On2 Technologies prior to the acquisition and since then , and we are very confident with the technology and that ’s why we ’re open sourcing , ” Google product manager Mike Jazayeri told The Register .
Een kat in het nauw maakt rare sprongen .
The MPEG - LA has been very busy the past decade or so to infect every level of the video toolchain , down from the very hardware level all the way up to your browser , and along the way , they continuously threatened competing codecs , such as Theora , without ever actually acting upon those threats .
The classic fear , uncertainly , and doubt tactic .
And now , they ’re facing a huge enemy in VP8 and WebM , which is backed by a pretty major group of companies , like Google , NVIDIA , AMD , ARM , Qualcomm , and numerous others .
If MPEG - LA licensors want to go after VP8 and WebM , they ’ll be shooting themselves in the foot since they ’ll most likely still have a lot of business to do with the companies backing WebM / VP8 .
The industry support for WebM and VP8 is already quite extensive , and I do n’t think the companies that make up the MPEG - LA are willing to anger all those big boys .
This is probably nothing more than a Microsoftian attempt to get companies to pay for a VP8 / WebM license from the MPEG - LA that Google already stated quite clearly they do n’t need .
These are just the usual FUD tactics from the MPEG - LA , something they ’ve been doing for over a decade ; they just replaced “ Theora ” with “ VP8 ” and continued where they left off .
Let ’s not forget that the MPEG - LA ’s CEO , Larry Horn , is a known patent troll , and therefore one of the people holding back innovation in the technology industry for his own good .
He and the MPEG - LA are no better than SCO .
Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Saturday 22 May 2010
So all good citizens this week are poring over the “ Programme For Government ” , and it ’s true to say that there is much to be pleased with .
Labour was n’t all about unbridled credit and fun public sector spending sprees : they kept all your emails , kept records of the websites you visited , used “ anti- terrorism ” legislation on people who plainly were n’t terrorists , and so on .
But most interesting are the noises now being made about crime and evidence .
“ We will conduct a full review of sentencing policy ” they say : “ to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime , protecting the public , punishing offenders and cutting reoffending .
In particular , we will ensure that sentencing for drug use helps offenders come off drugs . ”
These are grand promises .
Compulsory addiction rehabilitation with “ Drug Testing and Treatment Orders ” was introduced precisely 10 years ago as an alternative to custodial sentences or simple probation for those who have committed drug related crimes .
Their implementation without adequate analysis represents just one particularly graphic example of our tragic ineptitude at running simple trials of social policy .
A judge making a decision on a criminal ’s sentence is in the exact same position as a doctor making a decision on a patient ’s treatment : they are choosing an intervention for an individual in front of them , with the intention of producing a particular set of positive outcomes ( reduced crime , and reduced drug use ) ; they get through a large number of individuals in a month ; and in many important situations they do n’t yet know what works .
If you randomly assign a fairly large number of criminals , or patients , to one of two interventions , in situations where you do n’t know which intervention would be best , and measure how well they ’re doing a year or so later , you instantly discover which intervention is best .
Add in the cost and you know which is most cost effective .
The basic principles behind this idea were first described in Daniel 1.12 of the old testament , and can hardly be considered new .
Before being rolled out nationally in October 2000 DTTO ’s were extensively piloted in 3 cities by the Criminal Policy Research Unit of South Bank university , at considerable cost .
What insights did this generate ?
There was no randomisation , and no “ control ” group of identical criminals given traditional sentences for comparison , so the only new knowledge generated by these pilots was the revelation that it is possible to set up a DTTO service and run it in some buildings in some cities .
As it happens , when they did follow up the people who had passed through the service , they had n’t done particularly well , but this finding was n’t published until after the service had been rolled out , and in any case , the chosen study design means we have no idea how these participants would have turned out if given a traditional custodial sentence , so there ’s no sense in giving these results even a moment ’s thought .
This is a tragedy , and not just because drug use is estimated – with the usual caveats on estimating nebulous notions – to cause 85 % of shoplifting , 80 % of domestic burglaries , over half of all robberies , and so on .
This is a tragedy because it speaks to motives that will never go away .
It takes a brave and modern politician to say “ well , I want to introduce a new policy , but I honestly do n’t know if it will work ” , to try it out on half of a group of people , and then measure their outcomes a few years later , perhaps long after the politician has moved on .
This would revolutionise social policy , in far wider domains than sentencing policy , and if Cameron and Clegg were really young and visionary , they would step up to the plate .
But politicians – we must share the blame – will always go further when they reason in terms of rhetoric and absolutes .
There are a number of reasons to believe that the oil spill story currently unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico is close to entering the pantheon of “ epic ” news stories .
For starters , it ’s earned its own shorthand moniker of “ Gulf Oil Spill . ”
It ’s also got its own branded graphics package on the cable news channels .
But more importantly , it ’s beginning to be exploited as a political device , most notably being called “ Obama ’s Katrina . ”
Well , there was a delayed response on this story , but it was n’t by the administration .
If the oil spill is anyone ’s “ Katrina , ” its the media ’s for taking almost week to cover it on an appropriate scale .
How did we get here ?
Well , news of the initial oil rig catastrophe first broke on Tuesday , April 20th .
In the next few day , there were some terrific and horrifying images that came across the wire , and reports of a small oil spill began to surface .
At that time , however , little was known about the story .
Given that the offending rig was so inaccessible , it was difficult to send reporters or a news crew to the region to cover the story , which is a legitimate explanation .
But sources from at least one cable news outlet confirmed privately that the cost of sending reporters or a crew to the Gulf to cover this factored into the decision to not cover it – even though there was the clear understanding that this could very well be a big story .
But more importantly , just as the story was beginning to come in to more focus on Friday , April 23rd , the Arizona Immigration bill was signed into law .
It was almost as if one could almost hear the nation ’s collective news editors deciding that the Immigration Law was to be the controversy for the next few days .
And was it ever .
Over that weekend , and the two days that followed , the Arizona Immigration law dominated the news , seemingly at the cost of the oil spill coverage .
In fact , through a partnership with TV Eyes , we can determine exactly how many times the words “ oil ” and “ spill ” were said in comparison to “ Arizona ” and “ immigration ” on television over the course of those first few days .
Following is a comparison of how the broadcast media covered the two stories in the earliest stages of the oil rig calamity :
Date
Broadcast mentions of “ Arizona Immigration ” Broadcast mentions of “ Oil Spill ” April 23 1,451 1,925 April 24 2,239 729 April 25 1,745 569 April 26 2,044 823 April 27 2,537 795 April 28 2,193 2,502 April 29 1,514 2,624
If you are a more visual person , and need to see these numbers in handy chart form to better understand the news trends of these days , I submit :
Why does the previous research end on April 29th ?
Because that ’s the day that Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal ( working in close communication with Federal authorities ) declared the situation to be a “ state of emergency ” , which also coincides with the day that the media actually started paying attention to the story .
In the past few days , a number of talking heads and media analysts have asked the question whether this oil spill should be considered “ Obama ’s Katrina , ” implying that the administration was slow to respond to this environmental catastrophe in much the same way President Bush was criticized by some who thought he was very slow to understand and act upon the scale of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
There is a valid debate about how quickly and effectively the administration reacted .
On the 22nd , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs released a statement on the President ’s Oval Office meeting to discuss the situation in the Gulf of Mexico that outlined rescue efforts , and announced that the National Response Team had been activated and Unified and Area Commands have been established near New Orleans to coordinate search and rescue operations and oil spill response efforts .
However , during a press conference on April 23rd , Gibbs was a bit more cavalier when asked about how the situation “ I do n’t honestly think it opens up a whole new series of questions , because , you know , in all honesty I doubt this is the first accident that has happened and I doubt it will be the last , ” Gibbs said .
Again , one can debate the merits of the Administration ’s response , but to call it “ Obama ’s Katrina ” reveals more of a political agenda than a fair or astute analysis .
Unlike Katrina , the scale of this was not immediately knowable – the news initially broke that just the leak was relatively small .
And of course , hindsight is 20 / 20 – no one can be blamed for not predicting the future .
It is odd , then , that so many in the media took the “ Obama ’s Katrina ” political meme and ran with it — multiple examples of the metaphor ’s usage can be seen in The Daily Show clip below .
But the truth appears to be that the government ’s response was within the realm of an appropriate reaction from the very beginning of this disaster .
It ’s the members of the media , however , that should be asking themselves “ is this our Katrina ? ”
Have a tip we should know ?

I have long been in favour of fixed - term parliaments , as endorsed by our new coalition government , but anyone who claims they will prevent a second election having to take place soon is wrong .
Fixed terms work well in presidential systems such as France and the United States , where the head of state 's position is not dependent on the support of the legislature .
But in Britain , where the executive and the legislature are merged , the Prime Minister struggles to govern if parliament turns hostile .
Jim Callaghan was forced to hold an election after his government lost a vote of no confidence in 1979 .
Under the Lib Dem - Tory plan , an " enhanced majority " of 55 per cent of MPs will be required to trigger a dissolution .
But it 's not hard to imagine the opposition plus the Tory right and the Lib Dem left joining forces to achieve just this .
And it is worth noting that , in Germany , chancellors including Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schröder have purposely lost votes of no confidence in order to trigger an election at the most convenient moment for the government .
Expect this to become a very tempting option if the government runs into trouble ( as it will ) .
Thus , the only way to ensure genuine fixed - term parliaments is to separate the executive fully from the legislature .
As a republican , I 'm all in favour of this , but I fear it is still just a little too radical for this government .

We 're going to ship an update with another small set of Pyro changes this week .
Like our previous update , our goal is to increase the degree to which skill can make a difference between two Pyro players .
We received a bunch of useful feedback after the last update , and we think we 've managed to address most of it , without removing the skill - based additions .
As always , play with it for a bit , and then let us know what you think .
While we 've been mucking about with game balance , Mister Royzo has unveiled his latest round of creations over on his Fancy vs Nasty Update page .
Go take a look , and try not to melt his web server down .
As the man who took Nintendo from a small toy maker , to a multi-billion dollar global powerhouse , you 'd imagine
Hiroshi Yamauchi has earnt himself a pretty penny .
What you may not have expected , however , is how generous he is when it comes to spreading his wealth around .
The picture above is of a brand new , 82,000 square foot , 8 floor hospital that specialises in cancer treatment in Koyoto .
Costing 7.5 billion
Yen , Yamauchi donated the majority of the figure himself , which equates to some $ 83 m , or £ 57 m .
With departments for radiation oncology , internal medicine oncology , respiratory surgery , gastrointestinal surgery , and urology , the first patients are expected to begin treatment this month .
It 's always nice to see people giving back , but we think it 's fair to say Yamauchi - san 's gone well beyond the call of duty here .
A truly incredible gesture .
Oracle 's forthcoming version 5.1.47 of MySQL is said to contain several important security patches .
The changelog states that the developers have closed three security holes which allow attackers to cause a server crash , obtain unauthorised database access or , in the worst case , inject arbitrary code and execute it on the server .
The developers did n't mention which exact versions are affected .
According to the changelog , the first flaw is caused by the table name argument of the COM_FIELD_LIST command not being sufficiently checked , which , for MySQL version 5.1 and above , allows attackers with DELETE or SELECT privileges for one table to gain unauthorised read and write access to other tables .
A second flaw allows overly long table names to cause a buffer overflow which " could be exploited by an authenticated user to inject malicious code " .
The third flaw can be triggered by sending network packets that exceed the maximum packet size to the server which results in a server crash .
While the flaws are already listed in the MySQL bug tracker , unlike the changelog the bug tracker entries are not publicly available .
It was , therefore , a rather clumsy decision to provide the general public with such detailed information about the security holes ; while the added attention makes it more likely that the holes will be exploited , the hands of admins are tied because they have no fixed version to switch to .

Action auteur and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya seems pretty peeved on the adult - themed portrayals of his titular witch .
Posting a twitter message , Kamiya - san stated , “ It seems there ’s pornographic doujinshi based off Bayonetta …
There are fans who will resent that , and I hardly think those responsible [ for the doujinshi ] hold any love for the game … ”
Regardless of Bayonetta ’s in - game form , the action game received critical praise for its bombastic animations , campy style , and tight combat gameplay .
What do you think of Bayonetta ’s success as a sex symbol ?

Pakistanis woke up on Thursday to find access to popular websites Facebook and YouTube blocked after a government crackdown on websites seen to be hosting un -Islamic content .
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool reports on the reaction from Peshawar .
The Facebook dispute has provoked huge demonstrations in Pakistan " This site is restricted " is the plain message on a white background that most Pakistanis have been getting when they try to access the Facebook website .
It follows a High Court ruling ordering all internet service providers in the country to block the popular networking site until further notice .
What triggered the action was a Facebook group inviting people to draw , and post , cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad .
' Disrespectful ' " I am grateful to the High Court judges for this verdict , " says Fida Gul , smiling .
He is from the Islamic Lawyers Movement , who campaigned to get Facebook banned .
Facebook is a great community , but there are some people on it who are against Muslims and upload these pictures knowing they are going to create anger and hatred
Muhammed Jawad
At his office in downtown Peshawar , Mr Gul says the petition was filed on behalf of all Muslims and was a necessary step .
" We needed to provide a message to non-Muslims not to disrespect our prophet . "
All of the web -users we found at Khattak internet cafe in Peshawar said they were Facebook members .
" Of course it 's totally wrong that there is a page like this trying to hurt Muslims , " says Mustafa Haqqani , 20 .
" But you should n't just block the whole site . "
Others , too , talked on the one hand of their anger at the idea of people posting caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad , but on the other , of alternative responses to dealing with the issue .
" Facebook is a great community , " says Muhammed Jawad , 20 .
" But there are some people on it who are against Muslims and upload these pictures knowing they are going to create anger and hatred .
These people should have been banned . "
Most younger people seem to have similar opinions .
" I 'm one of those who is a great fan of Facebook and use it every day , " says Zulficar Ali Wazir , 30 .
" My friends all post and share news stories and articles on our Facebook pages .
There must be a million Pakistanis using it .
" The answer was for the Facebook administrators themselves to take action against groups like this - not for our courts to ban it . "
Over-reaction
There were one or two people in the internet cafe who thought that a temporary ban was fine , as a means of lodging protest , but most thought it was a step too far .
I am not surprised by this Facebook ruling - it was a sadly predictable next step
Reba Shahid ,
Editor internet magazine , Spider Others suggested blocking only that section of the site that was offensive , rather than the entire site .
" The whole website may not be against the Muslim community , " said Mr Gul .
" But we were advised that it was not possible to ban only that portion of it showing the sketches .
" So we were constrained to file this petition to ban this whole website in Pakistan , and we are very pleased that has now happened . "
Many here see the bans on Facebook and YouTube as an over - reaction .
It is not the first time it has happened .
In trying to block access to a particular YouTube video in early 2008 , the Pakistani authorities disrupted access to the entire YouTube website globally for several hours .
That may have been inadvertent , but there have been previous official directives to ban websites in the same way Facebook has been banned .
" As someone who has monitored bans in Pakistani cyberspace in the past , I am not surprised by this Facebook ruling , " said Reba Shahid , editor of the Karachi - based internet magazine , Spider .
" It was a sadly predictable next step .
" Pakistan is already portrayed in a negative light abroad , as a backward place with political unrest .
Banning first Facebook and now YouTube and others really does n't help us dispel those perceptions .
" The internet is something positive and a place where individuals can be expressive .
It is worrying that the authorities here do n't give a second thought to restricting our use of it in this way . "
Pushing the boundaries Ms Shahid says the ones that will suffer are Pakistan 's internet users and the country 's businesses that advertise on sites like Facebook .
Many women have taken to the streets against Facebook " Of course , no one here endorses this particular page on Facebook , but completely blocking access to such a popular website is something that has upset a lot of people too .
" A few years back , the same thing happened when there was a blanket ban on the whole " blogspot " domain , because some bloggers had chosen to republish the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad by a Danish cartoonist . "
There have been some street demonstrations here against Facebook .
While they may be small in scale and sporadic , they are reminders of the much larger and often violent protests in Pakistan following the publication of those , now infamous , cartoons of late 2005 .
Issues like this are likely to arise again in the future , as boundaries are pushed further , and global internet reach increases .
Web users in Pakistan have been left wondering how next those issues will affect them .

Angry Louisians watched fragile shorelines and rare birds become coated in thick crude Monday as BP came under mounting pressure ahead of a make - or - break “ top kill ” operation to stem the tide of oil streaming into the Gulf of Mexico .
Meanwhile , The New York Times reports that “ state and federal officials feuded with BP over its failure to meet deadlines and its refusal to stop spraying a toxic dispersant . ”

The oil company had indicated that it could stem the flow of oil on Tuesday by trying a procedure known as a top kill , in which heavy fluid would be pumped into the well .
But on Monday morning the companyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s chief operating officer said the procedure would be delayed until Wednesday .
At the same time , BP was locked in a tense standoff with the Environmental Protection Agency , which had ordered the company to stop using a toxic chemical dispersant called Corexit by Sunday .
But BP continued spraying the chemical on Monday , despite the E.P.A. Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s demand that it use a less toxic dispersant to break up the oil .
The company told the agency that no better alternative was available .
With pictures of oiled pelicans and ruined marshland dominating the newspapers , BP hit back with a PR offensive , taking out ads in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and pledging up to 500 million dollars to study the impact of the spill .
BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the delayed “ top kill ” operation to inject heavy drilling fluid into the leak and then hopefully seal the well with cement would now begin first thing on Wednesday morning .
Asked in a CNN interview what the chance of success was for an operation that will be performed by remote - controlled submarines 5,000 feet ( 1,500 meters ) down on the seabed , Suttles gave it a six or a seven out of 10 .
“ We are going to give it every shot .
We are going to make sure everything is ready before we go .
We need it to work . ”

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and top US federal officials have expressed doubts in BP ’s ability to stop the leak and have warned they may be pushed out of the way if progress is not made soon .
“ We met today to take action , take matters into our own hands , ” a frustrated Jindal told reporters Sunday in the port of Venice , which represents the frontline in the battle to stave off a looming environmental catastrophe .
Local residents were taking out their own boats and commandeering idle Coast Guard vessels to lay protective booms around a bird sanctuary , where several birds have already been coated in oil and taken it back to their nests .

The BP - leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers , and sank two days later .
Ever since , hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil , perhaps even millions , have been spewing each day into the sea .
President Barack Obama ’s administration , under pressure itself for its response to the crisis , is insisting the full force of the federal government is bearing down on BP .

“ If we find that they ’re not doing what they ’re supposed to be doing , we ’ll push them out of the way , ” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Sunday , lashing out at BP for missing “ deadline after deadline ” to cap the leak .
“ Do I have confidence that they know exactly what they ’re doing ?
No , not completely , ” he added , saying the company faced an “ existential crisis . ”
But Suttles , adamant that BP was doing everything in its power , pointed out that really the US authorities have little choice as the British energy giant alone has the necessary expertise to end this disaster .

“ I do n’t think anyone else could do better than we are , ” Suttles told CNN .
“ I know that ’s frustrating to hear and our performance to this point I wish was better .
I wish this was done .
We are doing everything we can . ”
If the “ top kill ” fails , relief wells to divert the flow and allow the leaking well to be sealed wo n’t be ready till August at the earliest , meaning tens of millions of barrels of crude could stream into the Gulf of Mexico .
According to the most conservative estimates , more than 6.5 million gallons of crude has already spilled into the sea from the riser pipe that once connected the Deepwater Horizon to the wellhead a mile below .
But analysis by independent scientists suggests the actually many times bigger , possibly too much already for the region ’s fragile ecology — and local communities so reliant on fishing and tourism — to bear .

The amount of oil being suctioned up by a mile - long insertion tube slowed Sunday to 1,360 barrels a day from the previous average of about 2,100 , only a fraction of the total gusher .
The cost of the clean - up also continued to mount .
BP said in London Monday that the operation had so far cost the company 760 million dollars ( 607 million euros ) .
A sign of how much BP figures this disaster will eventually cost it was evident in the fact it was willing to pledge Monday half - a- billion dollars for a 10 - year research program to study the impact of the spill on the environment .
It has also started advertising in major US newspapers to try to reassure skeptical Americans that it can be trusted to stop and clean up the spill .

“ Since the tragic accident on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig first occurred , we have been committed to doing everything possible to stop the flow of oil at the seabed and keep it away from the shore , ” the ad says .

Looks like settlement negotiations in the various Nokia / Apple patent lawsuits are n't going too well -- Espoo 's just hit Cupertino with a second federal patent lawsuit , this time alleging the iPad 3G and iPhone infringe five patents related to " enhanced speech and data transmission , using positioning data in applications and innovations in antenna configurations that improve performance and save space , allowing smaller and more compact devices . "
Interestingly , Nokia 's filed this one in the Western District of Wisconsin , a so - called " rocket docket " that 's well - known for bringing patent cases to settlement or trial in just over a year .
That means we could see some real movement in this dispute within our lifetimes , but we 're not holding our breath for a definitive conclusion -- by our count , Apple and Nokia now have some five pending legal actions between them , including one that 's been placed on hold pending an ITC decision .
Anyone want to bet how long it takes for Apple to add another countersuit to the mix ?
A reader writes , " Members of ask.metafilter.com rescue two Russian girls from probable sex traffickers in NYC , in real time .
You have to read through it to believe it . "
My friend and former student K arrived in DC yesterday , along with a friend .
She came over on some kind of travel exchange program put together by a Russian travel agency called ' Aloha ' .
They paid about 3 K for this program .
The program promised a job offer in advance , but did n't deliver .
They said they would send one via email , but failed there , too .
Her contact in the USA barely speaks English , does n't answer her calls but does answer mine .
He has asked her and her friend to meet in NYC tonight around midnight , with promises of hostess work in a lounge .
Yes , I know how horrific that sounds - that 's why I am working all possible angles here .
Mimas and a map of temperature variations that looks like Pac - Man
The Cassini spacecraft in orbit around Saturn has caught an interesting new view of the tiny moon Mimas .
The probe measured temperature differences across the object 's surface and produced a map that looks just like the 1980s Pac - Man video games icon .
Scientists are unsure why Mimas should display such variations but say it is probably related to the diversity of textures in the surface materials .
Some textures may retain heat better than others , they explain .
Mimas is about 400 km ( 250 miles ) across .
It has a distinctive scar called Herschel Crater which has led many to draw comparisons with the " Death Star " from the Star Wars movies .
The Cassini team says the creation of the crater itself might have played a key role in changing conditions across extensive regions of the moon 's surface .
Cassini is a joint venture between the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( ASI ) .
Its mission was recently extended through to 2017 .
US girl sues for $ 1 m over arrest for desk scribble
Alexa Gonzalez was led out of her school in handcuffs by police A 12 - year - old US schoolgirl is suing the New York City authorities for $ 1 m ( £ 650,000 ) in damages after she was arrested for writing on her desk .
Alexa Gonzalez was led out of her school in handcuffs by police after she was caught scribbling a message to her friends with an erasable , green marker .
Miss Gonzalez and her mother are suing the police and education departments in New York City .
They are claiming for excessive use of force and violation of her rights .
Miss Gonzalez was caught scribbling " I love my friends Abby and Faith " on her desk during a Spanish class in February .
The 12 - year - old said her Spanish teacher then " dragged " her to the dean 's office where police were called .
' Better judgement ' Miss Gonzalez told the New York Daily News she broke down as she was led out of Junior High School 190 in Queens in handcuffs .
" I started crying , like , a lot , " she said .
" I made two little doodles ...
It could be easily erased .
To put handcuffs on me is unnecessary . "
We want to stop this from happening to other young children in the future
Joseph Rosenthal ,
Gonzalez family lawyer
She said she was then held at a local school precinct for hours in what she calls a traumatising and excessive ordeal .
New York City officials have acknowledged the arrest was a mistake , saying better judgement should have been used by the arresting officers .
Miss Gonzalez was suspended from school and tried in a family court , where she was given eight hours of community service and ordered to write an essay about lessons to be learned from the incident .
Her family 's lawyer said the school had overreacted by calling the police .
" We want to stop this from happening to other young children in the future , " the lawyer , Joseph Rosenthal , told the New York Daily News .

Why are most female game characters cut from the same cloth ?
SMU Guildhall masters student Shaylyn Hamm asks this question in her thesis project -- and answers it , with new femaledesigns .
In the introduction , Hamm examines the goals of her masters project .
As Hamm observes , " However , her perspective is that To delve further into the topic , Hamm examines characters from popular series such asand , as well as games that take a very different approach -- andUsing survey data and historical inspriation , Hamm 's new designs for thecharacters are both tremendously different from most female characters in games , and fit perfectly within the world of Valve 's game .
Hamm 's thesis , which includes a link to a document containing her full survey data and high - res art , is live today at Gamasutra 's education - focused sister site , GameCareerGuide .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Young people who smoke cannabis or marijuana for six years or more are twice as likely to have psychotic episodes , hallucinations or delusions than people who have never used the drug , scientists said on Monday .

The findings adds weight to previous research which linked psychosis with the drug -- particularly in its most potent form as “ skunk ” -- and will feed the debate about the level of controls over its use .
Despite laws against it , up to 190 million people around the world use cannabis , according to United Nations estimates , equating to about 4 percent of the adult population .
John McGrath of the Queensland Brain Institute in Australia studied more than 3,801 men and women born between 1981 and 1984 and followed them up after 21 years to ask about their cannabis use and assessed them for psychotic episodes .
Around 18 percent reported using cannabis for three or fewer years , 16 percent for four to five years and 14 percent for six or more years .
“ Compared with those who had never used cannabis , young adults who had six or more years since first use of cannabis were twice as likely to develop a non-affective psychosis ( such as schizophrenia ) , ” McGrath wrote in a study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry journal .
They were also four times as likely to have high scores in clinical tests of delusion , he wrote , and a so - called “ dose - response ” relationship showed that the longer the duration since first cannabis use , the higher the risk of psychosis - related symptoms .
A study by British scientists last year suggested that people who smoke skunk , a potent form of cannabis , are almost seven times more likely to develop psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia than those who smoke “ hash ” or cannabis resin .
Previous studies had also suggested smoking cannabis can double the risk of psychosis , but the British study was the first to look specifically at skunk .
Skunk has higher amounts of the psychoactive ingredient THC which can produce psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations , delusions and paranoia .
McGrath said , however , that “ the nature of the relationship between psychosis and cannabis use is by no means simple ” and more research was needed to examine the mechanisms at work .
As part of his study , McGrath and his team looked at links between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms among a group of 228 sibling pairs and found the association still held .
This suggests other influences like genes or the environment were less likely to be responsible for the psychosis , they said .
A international group of drug policy experts published a book earlier this year arguing that laws against cannabis have failed to cut its use but instead led to vast numbers of arrests for drug possession in countries like Britain , Switzerland and the United States , which cause social division and pointless government expense .
77 Brain Hacks to Learn Faster , Deeper , and Better Source : Online Education Database
If someone granted you one wish , what do you imagine you would want out of life that you have n't gotten yet ?
For many people , it would be self - improvement and knowledge .
New knowledge is the backbone of society 's progress .
Great thinkers such as Leonardo da Vinci , Thomas Edison , Benjamin Franklin , Albert Einstein , and others ' quests for knowledge have led society to many of the marvels we enjoy today .
Your quest for knowledge does n't have to be as Earth - changing as Einstein's , but it can be an important part of your life , leading to a new job , better pay , a new hobby , or simply knowledge for knowledge 's sake  whatever is important to you as an end goal .
Life - changing knowledge does typically require advanced learning techniques .
In fact , it 's been said that the average adult only uses 10 % of his / her brain .
Imagine what we may be capable of with more advanced learning techniques .
Here are 77 tips related to knowledge and learning to help you on your quest .
A few are specifically for students in traditional learning institutions ; the rest for self - starters , or those learning on their own .
Happy learning .
Health 1 .
Shake a leg .
Lack of blood flow is a common reason for lack of concentration .
If you 've been sitting in one place for awhile , bounce one of your legs for a minute or two .
It gets your blood flowing and sharpens both concentration and recall .
2 . Food for thought : Eat breakfast .
A lot of people skip breakfast , but creativity is often optimal in the early morning and it helps to have some protein in you to feed your brain .
A lack of protein can actually cause headaches .
3 . Food for thought , part 2 : Eat a light lunch .
Heavy lunches have a tendency to make people drowsy .
While you could turn this to your advantage by taking a " thinking nap " ( see # 23 ) , most people have n't learned how .
4. Cognitive enhancers : Ginkgo biloba .
Ginkgo biloba is a natural supplement that has been used in China and other countries for centuries and has been reputed to reverse memory loss in rats .
It 's also suggested by some health practitioners as a nootrope and thus a memory enhancer .
5. Reduce stress + depresssion .
Stress and depression may reduce the ability to recall information and thus inhibit learning .
Sometimes , all you need to reduce depression is more white light and fewer refined foods .
Balance 6 . Sleep on it .
Dr. Maxwell Maltz wrote about in his book Psycho - Cybernetics about a man who was was paid good money to come up with ideas .
He would lock his office door , close the blinds , turn off the lights .
He 'd focus on the problem at hand , then take a short nap on a couch .
When he awoke , he usually had the problem solved .
7 . Take a break .
Change phyical or mental perspective to lighten the invisible stress that can sometimes occur when you sit in one place too long , focused on learning .
Taking a 5 - 15 minute break every hour during study sessions is more beneficial than non -stop study .
It gives your mind time to relax and absorb information .
If you want to get really serious with breaks , try a 20 minute ultradian break as part of every 90 minute cycle .
This includes a nap break , which is for a different purpose than # 23 .
8 . Take a hike .
Changing your perspective often relieves tension , thus freeing your creative mind .
Taking a short walk around the neighborhood may help .
Perspective and Focus 9 .
Change your focus .
Sometimes there simply is n't enough time to take a long break .
If so , change subject focus .
Alternate between technical and non-technical subjects .
10 . Change your focus , part 2 .
There are three primary ways to learn : visual , kinesthetic , and auditory .
If one is n't working for you , try another .
11 . Do walking meditation .
If you 're taking a hike ( # 25 ) , go one step further and learn walking meditation as a way to tap into your inner resources and your strengthen your ability to focus .
Just make sure you 're not walking inadvertently into traffic .
12 . Focus and immerse yourself .
Focus on whatever you 're studying .
Do n't try to watch TV at the same time or worry yourself about other things .
Anxiety does not make for absorption of information and ideas .
13 . Turn out the lights .
This is a way to focus , if you are not into meditating .
Sit in the dark , block out extraneous influences .
This is ideal for learning kinesthetically , such as guitar chord changes .
14 . Take a bath or shower .
Both activities loosen you up , making your mind more receptive to recognizing brilliant ideas .
Recall Techniques 15 .
Listen to music .
Researchers have long shown that certain types of music are a great " key " for recalling memories .
Information learned while listening to a particular song or collection can often be recalled simply by " playing " the songs mentally .
16 . Speedread .
Some people believe that speedreading causes you to miss vital information .
The fact remains that efficient speedreading results in filtering out irrelevant information .
If necessary , you can always read and re-read at slower speeds .
Slow reading actually hinders the ability to absorb general ideas .
( Although technical subjects often requirer slower reading . )
If you 're reading online , you can try the free Spreeder Web - based application .
17 . Use acronyms and other mnemonic devices .
Mnemonics are essentially tricks for remembering information .
Some tricks are so effective that proper application will let you recall loads of mundane information years later .
Visual Aids 18 .
Every picture tells a story .
Draw or sketch whatever it is you are trying to achieve .
Having a concrete goal in mind helps you progress towards that goal .
19 . Brainmap it .
Need to plan something ?
Brain maps , or mind maps , offer a compact way to get both an overview of a project as well as easily add details .
With mind maps , you can see the relationships between disparate ideas and they can also act as a receptacle for a brainstorming session .
20 . Learn symbolism and semiotics .
Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols .
Having an understanding of the symbols of a particular discipline aids in learning , and also allows you to record information more efficiently .
21 . Use information design .
When you record information that has an inherent structure , applying information design helps convey that information more clearly .
A great resource is Information Aesthetics , which gives examples of information design and links to their sources .
22 . Use visual learning techniques .
Try gliffy for structured diagrams .
Also see Inspiration.com for an explanation of webs , idea maps , concept maps , and plots .
23 . Map your task flow .
Learning often requires gaining knowledge in a specific sequence .
Organizing your thoughts on what needs to be done is a powerful way to prepare yourself to complete tasks or learn new topics .
Verbal and Auditory Techniques 24 .
Stimulate ideas .
Play rhyming games , utter nonsense words .
These loosen you up , making you more receptive to learning .
25 . Brainstorm .
This is a time - honored technique that combines verbal activity , writing , and collaboration .
( One person can brainstorm , but it 's more effective in a group . )
It 's fruitful if you remember some simple rules :
Firstly , do n't shut anyone 's idea out .
Secondly , do n't " edit " in progress ; just record all ideas first , then dissect them later .
Participating in brainstorming helps assess what you already know about something , and what you did n't know .
26 . Learn by osmosis .
Got an iPod ?
Record a few of your own podcasts , upload them to your iPod and sleep on it .
Literally .
Put it under your pillow and playback language lessons or whatever .
27 . Cognitive enhancers : binaural beats .
Binaural beats involve playing two close frequencies simultaneously to produce alpha , beta , delta , and theta waves , all of which produce either sleeping , restfulness , relaxation , meditativeness , alertness , or concentration .
Binaural beats are used in conjunction with other excercises for a type of super - learning .
28 . Laugh .
Laughing relaxes the body .
A relaxed body is more receptive to new ideas .
Kinesthetic Techniques 29 .
Write , do n't type .
While typing your notes into the computer is great for posterity , writing by hand stimulates ideas .
The simple act of holding and using a pen or pencil massages acupuncture points in the hand , which in turn stimulates ideas .
30 .
Carry a quality notebook at all times .
Samuel Taylor Coleridge dreamed the words of the poem " In Xanadu ( did Kubla Khan ) ... " .
Upon awakening , he wrote down what he could recall , but was distracted by a visitor and promptly forgot the rest of the poem .
Forever .
If you 've been doing " walking meditation " or any kind of meditation or productive napping , ideas may suddenly come to you .
Record them immediately .
31 . Keep a journal .
This is n't exactly the same as a notebook .
Journaling has to do with tracking experiences over time .
If you add in visual details , charts , brainmaps , etc. , you have a much more creative way to keep tabs on what you are learning .
32 . Organize .
Use sticky colored tabs to divide up a notebook or journal .
They are a great way to partition ideas for easy referral .
33 .
Use post - it notes .
Post - it notes provide a helpful way to record your thoughts about passages in books without defacing them with ink or pencil marks .
Self - Motivation Techniques 34 .
Give yourself credit .
Ideas are actually a dime a dozen .
If you learn to focus your mind on what results you want to achieve , you 'll recognize the good ideas .
Your mind will become a filter for them , which will motivate you to learn more .
35 . Motivate yourself .
Why do you want to learn something ?
What do want to achieve through learning ?
If you do n't know why you want to learn , then distractions will be far more enticing .
36 . Set a goal .
W. Clement Stone once said " Whatever the mind of man can conceive , it can achieve . "
It 's an amazing phenomenon in goal achievement .
Prepare yourself by whatever means necessary , and hurdles will seem surmountable .
Anyone who has experienced this phenomenon understands its validity .

37 . Think positive .
There 's no point in setting learning goals for yourself if you do n't have any faith in your ability to learn .
38 . Organize , part 2 .
Learning is only one facet of the average adult 's daily life .
You need to organize your time and tasks else you might find it difficult to fit time in for learning .
Try Neptune for a browser - based application for " getting things done . "
39 .
Every skill is learned .
With the exception of bodily functions , every skill in life is learned .
Generally speaking , if one person can learn something , so can you .
It may take you more effort , but if you 've set a believable goal , it 's likely an achievable goal .
40 . Prepare yourself for learning .
Thinking positive is n't sufficient for successfully achieving goals .
This is especially important if you are an adult , as you 'll probably have many distractions surrounding your daily life .
Implement ways to reduce distractions , at least for a few hours at a time , else learning will become a frustrating experience .
41 . Prepare yourself , part 2 .
Human nature is such that not everyone in your life will be a well - wisher in your self - improvement and learning plans .
They may intentionally or subconsciously distract you from your goal .
If you have classes to attend after work , make sure that work colleagues know this , that you are unable to work late .
Diplomacy works best if you think your boss is intentionally giving you work on the days he / she knows you have to leave .
Reschedule lectures to a later time slot if possible / necessary .
42 . Constrain yourself .
Most people need structure in their lives .
Freedom is sometimes a scary thing .
It 's like chaos .
But even chaos has order within .
By constraining yourself  say giving yourself deadlines , limiting your time on an idea in some manner , or limiting the tools you are working with  you can often accomplish more in less time .
Supplemental Techniques 43 .
Read as much as you can .
How much more obvious can it get ?
Use Spreeder ( #33 ) if you have to .
Get a breadth of topics as well as depth .
44 . Cross -pollinate your interests .
Neurons that connect to existing neurons give you new perspectives and abilities to use additional knowledge in new ways .
45 . Learn another language .
New perspectives give you the ability to cross-pollinate cultural concepts and come up with new ideas .
As well , sometimes reading a book in its original language will provide you with insights lost in translation .
46 . Learn how to learn .
Management Help has a resource page , as does SIAST ( Virtual Campus ) , which links to articles about learning methods .
They are geared towards online learning , but no doubt you gain something from them for any type of learning .
If you are serious about optimum learning , read Headrush 's Crash course in learning theory .
47 . Learn what you know and what you do n't .
Many people might say , " I 'm dumb , " or " I do n't know anything about that . "
The fact is , many people are wholly unaware of what they already know about a topic .
If you want to learn about a topic , you need to determine what you already know , figure out what you do n't know , and then learn the latter .
48 . Multi-task through background processes .
Effective multi-tasking allows you to bootstrap limited time to accomplish several tasks .
Learning can be bootstrapped through multi-tasking , too .
By effective multitasking , I do n't mean doing two or more things at exactly the same time .
It 's not possible .
However , you can achieve the semblance of effective multitasking with the right approach , and by prepping your mind for it .
For example , a successful freelance writer learns to manage several articles at the same time .
Research the first essay , and then let the background processes of your mind takeover .
Move on consciously to the second essay .
While researching the second essay , the first one will often " write itself . "
Be prepared to record it when it " appears " to you .
49 .
Think holistically .
Holistic thinking might be the single most " advanced " learning technique that would help students .
But it 's a mindset rather than a single technique .
50 .
Use the right type of repetition .
Complex concepts often require revisting in order to be fully absorbed .
Sometimes , for some people , it may actually take months or years .
Repetition of concepts and theory with various concrete examples improves absorption and speeds up learning .
51 . Apply the Quantum Learning ( QL ) model .
The Quantum Learning model is being applied in some US schools and goes beyond typical education methods to engage students .
52 . Get necessary tools .
There are obviously all kinds of tools for learning .
If you are learning online like a growing number of people these days , then consider your online tools .
One of the best tools for online research is the Firefox web browser , which has loads of extensions ( add - ons ) with all manner of useful features .
One is Googlepedia , which simultaneously displays Google search engine listings , when you search for a term , with related entries from Wikipedia .
53 .
Get necessary tools , part 2 .
This is a very niche tip , but if you want to learn fast - track methods for building software , read Getting Real from 37 Signals .
The Web page version is free .
The techniques in the book have been used to create Basecamp , Campfire , and Backpack web applications in a short time frame .
Each of these applications support collaboration and organization .
54 . Learn critical thinking .
As Keegan - Michael Key 's character on MadTV might say , critical thinking takes analysis to " a whole notha level " .
Read Wikipedia 's discourse on critical thinking as a starting point .
It involves good analytical skills to aid the ability to learn selectively .
55 . Learn complex problem solving .
For most people , life is a series of problems to be solved .
Learning is part of the process .
If you have a complex problem , you need to learn the art of complex problem solving .
For Teachers , Tutors , and Parents 56 .
Be engaging .
Lectures are one - sided and often counter - productive .
Information merely heard or witnessed ( from a chalkboard for instance ) is often forgotten .
Teaching is not simply talking .
Talking is n't enough .
Ask students questions , present scenarios , engage them .
57 . Use information pyramids .
Learning happens in layers .
Build base knowledge upon which you can add advanced concepts .
58 . Use video games .
Video games get a bad rap because of certain violent games .
But video games in general can often be an effective aid to learning .
59 .
Role play .
Younger people often learn better by being part of a learning experience .
For example , history is easier to absorb through reenactments .
60 . Apply the 80/20 rule .
This rule is often interpreted in dfferent ways .
In this case , the 80/20 rule means that some concepts , say about 20 % of a curriculum , require more effort and time , say about 80 % , than others .
So be prepared to expand on complex topics .
61 . Tell stories .
Venus Flytrap , a character from the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati , once taught a student gang member about atoms , electrons , and protons by saying that an atom was one big neighborhood , and the protons and neutrons had their own smaller neighborhoods and never mixed .
Just like rival gangs .
The story worked , and understanding sparked in the students eyes .
62 . Go beyond the public school curriculum .
The public school system is woefully lacking in teaching advanced learning and brainstorming methods .
It 's not that the methods cannot be taught ; they just are n't .
To learn more , you have to pay a premium in additional time and effort , and sometimes money for commercially available learning tools .
There 's nothing wrong with that in itself , but what is taught in schools needs to be expanded .
This article 's author has proven that a nine - year old can learn ( some ) university level math , if the learning is approached correctly .
63 . Use applied learning .
If a high school student were having trouble in math , say with fractions , one example of applied learning might be photography , lenses , f- stops , etc .
Another example is cooking and measurement of ingredients .
Tailor the applied learning to the interest of the student .
For Students and Self - Studiers 64 .
Be engaged .
Surprise .
Sometimes students are bored because they know more than is being taught , maybe even more than a teacher .
( Hopefully teachers will assess what each student already knows . )
Students should discuss with a teacher if they feel that the material being covered is not challenging .
Also consider asking for additional materials .
65 . Teach yourself .
Teachers cannot always change their curricula .
If you 're not being challenged , challenge yourself .
Some countries still apply country - wide exams for all students .
If your lecturer did n't cover a topic , you should learn it on your own .
Do n't wait for someone to teach you .
Lectures are most effective when you 've pre-introduced yourself to concepts .
66 . Collaborate .
If studying by yourself is n't working , maybe a study group will help .
67 .
Do unto others : teach something .
The best way to learn something better is to teach it to someone else .
It forces you to learn , if you are motivated enough to share your knowledge .
68 . Write about it .
An effective way to " teach " something is to create an FAQ or a wiki containing everything you know about a topic .
Or blog about the topic .
Doing so helps you to realize what you know and more importantly what you do n't .
You do n't even have to spend money if you grab a freebie account with Typepad , Wordpress , or Blogger .
69 . Learn by experience .
Pretty obvious , right ?
It means put in the necessary time .
An expert is often defined as someone who has put in 10,000 hours into some experience or endeavor .
That 's approximately 5 years of 40 hours per week , every week .
Are you an expert without realizing it ?
If you 're not , do you have the dedication to be an expert ?
70 . Quiz yourself .
Testing what you 've learned will reinforce the information .
Flash cards are one of the best ways , and are not just for kids .
71 . Learn the right things first .
Learn the basics .
Case in point : a frustrating way to learn a new language is to learn grammar and spelling and sentence constructs first .
This is not the way a baby learns a language , and there 's no reason why an adult or young adult has to start differently , despite " expert " opinion .
Try for yourself and see the difference .
72 . Plan your learning .
If you have a long - term plan to learn something , then to quote Led Zeppelin , " There are two paths you can go by . "
You can take a haphazard approach to learning , or you can put in a bit of planning and find an optimum path .
Plan your time and balance your learning and living .
Parting Advice 73 .
Persist .
Do n't give up learning in the face of intimdating tasks .
Anything one human being can learn , most others can as well .
Was n't it Einstein that said , " Genius is 1 % inspiration and 99 % perspiration " ?
Thomas Edison said it , too .
74 . Defy the experts .
Dyslexia , in a nutshell , is the affliction of mentally jumbling letters and digits , causing difficulties in reading , writing and thus learning .
Sometimes spoken words or numbers get mixed up as well .
In the past , " experts " declared dyslexic children stupid .
Later , they said they were incapable of learning .
This author has interacted with and taught dyslexic teens .
It 's possible .
Helen Keller had no experience of sight , sound , or speech , and yet she learned .
Conclusion :
There is more than one way to learn ; never believe you cannot .
75 . Challenge yourself .
People are often more intelligent than they realize .
In a world that compartmentalizes and categorizes everything , not everyone is sure where they fit in .
And genius can be found in many walks of life .
If you honestly suspect that there 's more to you than has been " allowed " to be let out , try an IQ test such as the one offered by MENSA .
It 's unlike the standardized IQ tests given in many schools .
You know the kind  the ones which traumatize many young students into thinking they are stupid , simply because the tests do n't really assess all student 's knowledge and learning ability .
And the ability to learn is far , far more important than what you already know .
76 . Party before an exam .
Well , do n't go that far .
The key is to relax .
The worse thing to do is cram the night before an exam .
If you do n't already know a subject by then , cramming is n't going to help .
If you have studied , simply review the topic , then go do something pleasant ( no more studying ) .
Doing so tells your brain that you are prepared and that you will be able to recall anything that you have already learned .
On the other hand , if you did n't spend the semester learning the ideas you need , you might as well go party anyways because cramming at the last minute is n't going to help much at that point .

Do n't worry ; learn happy .

In America , we 're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty .
Life , liberty and property can't be taken from you unless you 're convicted of a crime .
Your life and liberty may still be safe , but have you ever gone to a government surplus auction ?
Consumer reporters like me tell people , correctly , that they are great places to find bargains .
People can buy bikes for $ 10 , cars for $ 500 .
But where did the government get that stuff ?
Some is abandoned property .
But some I would just call loot .
The cops grabbed it .
Zaher El - Ali has repaired and sold cars in Houston for 30 years .
One day , he sold a truck to a man on credit .
Ali was holding the title to the car until he was paid , but before he got his money the buyer was arrested for drunk driving .
The cops then seized Ali 's truck and kept it , planning to sell it .
Ali can't believe it .
" I own that truck .
That truck done nothing . "
The police say they can keep it under forfeiture law because the person driving the car that day broke the law .
It does n't matter that the driver was n't the owner .
It 's as if the truck committed the crime .
" I have never seen a truck drive , " Ali said .
" I do n't think it 's the fault of the truck .
And they know better . "
Something has gone wrong when the police can seize the property of innocent people .
" Under this bizarre legal fiction called civil forfeiture , the government can take your property , including your home , your car , your cash , regardless of whether or not you are convicted of a crime .
It 's led to horrible abuses , " says Scott Bullock of the Institute for Justice , the libertarian law firm .
Bullock suggests the authorities are not just disinterested enforcers of the law .
" One of the main reasons they do this and why they love civil forfeiture is because in Texas and over 40 states and at the federal level , police and prosecutors get to keep all or most of the property that they seize for their own use , " he said .
" So they can use it to improve their offices , buy better equipment . "
Obviously , that creates a big temptation to take stuff .
This is serious , folks .
The police can seize your property if they think it was used in a crime .
If you want it back , you must prove it was not used criminally .
The burden of proof is on you .
This reverses a centuries - old safeguard in Anglo - American law against arbitrary government power .
The feds do this , too .
In 1986 , the Justice Department made $ 94 million on forfeitures .
Today , its forfeiture fund has more than a billion in it .
Radley Balko of Reason magazine keeps an eye on government property grabs : " There are lots of crazy stories about what they do with this money .
There 's a district attorney 's office in Texas that used forfeiture money to buy an office margarita machine .
Another district attorney in Texas used forfeiture money to take a junket to Hawaii for a conference . "
When the D.A. was confronted about that , his response was , " A judge signed off on it , so it 's OK . "
But it turned out the judge had gone with him on the junket .
Balko has reported on a case in which police confiscated cash from a man when they found it in his car .
" The state 's argument was that maybe he did n't get it from selling drugs , but he might use that money to buy drugs at some point in the future .
Therefore , we 're still allowed to take it from him , " Balko said .
Sounds like that Tom Cruise movie " Minority Report , " where the police predict future crimes and arrest the " perpetrator . "
" When you give people the wrong incentives , people respond accordingly .
And so it should n't be surprising that they 're stretching the definition of law enforcement , " Balko said .
" But the fundamental point is that you should not have people out there enforcing the laws benefiting directly from them . "
Balko is exactly right .

We moved the office into the bedroom , and the bedroom into the office this past week .
Which made a lot of sense for several reasons , the best of which is : the office is now in a more open , warm , and light feeling room ; and equally as good , the bedroom is now in the cozier , cooler , more snug - like room .
My workstation , of course , looks pretty much exactly the same .

A few weeks ago , Novell and Red Hat jointly fended off a patent infringement suit thrown their way by a patent troll .
The patent in question more or less came down to the concept of virtual desktops – and thanks to Groklaw , several people helped in finding cases of prior art .
The most interesting one of all ?
A carefully restored and working Amiga 1000 demonstrated to the judge and jury .
When this court case was first revealed back in 2007 , Groklaw asked its readers to help in the hunt for prior art , and later still , Red and Novell asked the community to do the same .
The Amiga was one of the most often mentioned cases of prior art , and it turns out it played a major role in turning this case in favour of Novell and Red Hat .
Someone actually came forward with a carefully restored and working Amiga 1000 from 1986 , which was demonstrated to the jury as a case of prior art .
More cases of prior art were presented , but having a live demo of 1986 hardware sure played an important role according to Groklaw , who has access to the court documents .
The owner of the Amiga 1000 was delighted his machine played such an important role .
“ Apparently my habits of being an eclectic collector of historic computer gadgetry and my work in restoring a 1986 Amiga 1000 system to its multi-screen , muti-tasking glory as prior art evidence for a Red Hat Linux patent fight paid off , ” he said , “ My Amiga killed a troll ! ”
Even 24 years after its original release , the Amiga still manages to leave an impression .
Jay Miner would be proud .
A leading US senator called Tuesday , in the wake of the failed New York car bombing plot , for Americans who target fellow citizens with terrorist violence to be stripped of their US citizenship rights .
“ If you ’re attacking your fellow Americans in an act of war you lose the rights that come with citizenship , ” Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman , an independent , told reporters .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lieberman said he was trying to amend an old US law “ that says that if an American citizen is found to be fighting in the military of a nation with whom we are at war , they lose their citizenship . ”
The lawmaker from Connecticut said the law should state that “ any individual apprehended , American citizen , who is found to be involved with a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the Department of State , would be deprived of their citizenship rights . ”
“ If you have joined an enemy of the United States in attacking the United States to try to kill Americans I think you sacrifice your rights of citizenship , ” said Lieberman .
His comments came hours after US authorities announced they had arrested a Pakistani - American , Faisal Shahzad , suspected of trying to detonate the car bomb in New York ’s popular Times Square district on a balmy Saturday night .
US Attorney General Eric Holder told a press conference Tuesday that Shahzad would be charged with “ an act of terrorism transcending national borders . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
It was not clear whether the proposed measure would cover wholly domestic extremists , such as those who attack abortion clinics or the detained members of a radical Christian militia plotting to kill police and wage war against the government .
Lieberman sided with critics of President Barack Obama ’s administration in saying that Shahzad should not be read his constitutional “ Miranda ” rights to remain silent or have a lawyer before questioning .
“ If they ( US authorities ) make a judgment that this was a terrorist act , the person should be turned over to the military , ” notably an elite interrogation unit formed by Obama , he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The first thing you want to get from somebody like this is information about other co-conspirators , perhaps about other attacks that are planned at the same time , and then a judgment is made about whether he should be read his Miranda rights , ” said Lieberman .
FBI deputy director John Pistole , standing alongside Holder at the same press conference , said Shahzad was actually interrogated early Tuesday under a “ public safety exception to the Miranda rule , ” and that he “ provided valuable intelligence and evidence ” to investigators .

“ He was Mirandized later and continued to cooperate and provide valuable information , ” Pistole said .
IF BULLISH investors had been given two Christmas wishes at the end of 2009 , they probably would have asked for booming profits and a continuation of ultra - low interest rates .
Their wishes have been granted .
According to Morgan Stanley , the first - quarter profits of companies in the S&P 500 have been more than 12 % better than expected .
Meanwhile , few expect the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) or the Bank of England to raise rates this year .
Some think rates will stay where they are in 2011 , too .
So why is the MSCI World index of global equities down by more than 10 % this year , with emerging markets showing double - digit losses and European bourses shedding more than 20 % in dollar terms ?
On May 25th the FTSE 100 index closed below 5,000 for the first time since last October .
The next day the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 10,000 for the first time since February .
This latest setback may simply be a reaction to the phenomenal rally that has taken place since March 2009 .
Back then , fears of a second Depression were widespread .
As confidence returned , the S&P 500 index jumped by 80 % to its most recent high in late April .
Eventually , all the good news was priced in and there were signs of complacency : in early May a survey by Investors Intelligence , a research firm , found that three times as many American financial advisers were bulls ( 54 % ) as were bears ( 18 % ) .
May has seen the re-emergence of a number of worries that had been beneath the surface .
The latest is geopolitical risk , in the specific form of rising tension in the Korean peninsula .
Reports that Kim Jong
Il , the North Korean dictator , had placed his forces on a war footing caused Asian markets to fall sharply on May 25th .
The erratic actions of North Korea , a country with too many weapons and not enough food , are akin to Middle East politics : a wild card that can occasionally upset investors .
However , investors ' biggest financial concern is sovereign debt , notably that of some southern European countries .
In recent weeks the European Union has been forced both to rescue Greece and to unveil a general bail - out package , worth up to €750 billion ( $ 920 billion ) including a contribution from the IMF , for struggling countries .
Investors seem to be in two minds on sovereign debt .
They worry that individual countries may default if they do not cut their deficits and that banks holding their debt will be clobbered .
They think that Greece 's debt crisis has been postponed rather than solved .
But investors are also concerned that , if several governments try to tighten fiscal policy at once , the global economy will take a hit .
Europe is expected to experience sluggish growth in the medium term as it struggles with its debts .
But in recent weeks worries have also emerged about growth in Asia and America .
In Asia , the question is whether China 's attempts to rein in its housing market will prompt a broader slowdown ( see article ) .
In America , momentum seems to have faded a little after a strong performance in the last quarter of 2009 .
Some data , such as initial jobless claims and the Conference Board leading indicator , have been disappointing .
All this has led to a sell - off of the “ risk basket ” — those assets that seem most correlated with global growth , such as the Australian dollar , copper and emerging - market equities ( see chart 1 ) .
Oil has been another casualty , with crude prices falling by around 20 % in May alone .
This week the price of a barrel dipped below $ 70 .
Investors have headed away from risk , flocking into the bonds of what they deem the safest governments : German ten - year bond yields fell to 2.58 % on May 25th , the lowest in recent memory , while the yields on ten - year American Treasury bonds dropped to close to 3 % .
Blaming the markets
A further complication of the debt crisis is that governments have turned from trying to support financial markets to blaming them for the world 's ills .
Rather than accepting rising government - bond yields in southern Europe as a rational response to worsening public finances , politicians believe that troubled countries have been unfairly targeted by speculators .
That seems to explain Germany 's hastily imposed restrictions on short - selling of government bonds and on buying sovereign credit - default insurance without owning the underlying bond .
In response to market criticism of the ban , Wolfgang Schäuble , Germany 's finance minister , quipped : “ If you want to drain a swamp , you do n't ask the frogs for an objective assessment . ”
However , it seems unwise for European governments to start bashing the very people from whom they need to borrow hundreds of billions of euros .
Investors do not need to sell bonds short — bet on a falling price — to cause governments trouble .
All they need to do is to shun bonds in governments ' frequent auctions ( Germany , Italy and Portugal all held auctions on May 26th , for example ) .
A failed auction would quickly cause bond yields to soar , increasing the cost of servicing those huge deficits .
The impression of erratic government policy has been bolstered by the tortured negotiations over America 's finance - reform bill ( see article ) and Europe 's Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive .
Taxes on banks and financial transactions are being discussed .
Such measures may never be agreed on by the G7 or the G20 , but given the financial industry 's unpopularity , countries or regions may act on their own .
On May 26th the European Commission proposed a levy on banks to pay for future failures .
Mr Schäuble has said that the German government will seek a “ European solution ” to a transactions tax if the G20 cannot agree on one .
Last autumn there was a sense that global governments were co-ordinating their actions ; now they seem to be dashing off in different directions in an attempt to appease their voters .
Viewed politically , in fact , the recovery in profits that has given encouragement to the bulls has been a mixed blessing .
With growth in the rich world sluggish , the corollary of the rise in profits has been a fall in the share of income going to labour , because of job losses and stagnant wages .
To the ordinary voter , the picture seems perverse : the bankers and bosses who caused the crisis and were then bailed out by taxpayers are now reaping a disproportionate share of the rewards .
Meanwhile , public services and public - sector pensions and wages face deep cuts — seemingly at the insistence of the same financial elite .
No wonder voters are angry .
Watch the banks
Although falling stockmarkets may capture most headlines , a less obvious alarm signal is probably more unsettling .
This is the sharp rise in the rate at which banks borrow and lend to each other , known as LIBOR ( London Interbank Offered Rate ) .
On May 26th three - month dollar LIBOR was 0.54 % , its highest since last July ( see chart 2 ) .
Although this is still a long way below the near - 5 % reached in 2008 , the trend is worrying .
It indicates that the health of the banking system is once more being called into question .
Indeed , much bigger rate moves are priced into the forward market .
And Pavan Wadhwa , a strategist at JPMorgan , points out that Libor measures the funding cost for only 16 big banks ; smaller banks have to pay a premium .
The Eurodollar future that shows the cost of borrowing dollars for the average bank in the three months between September and December is already 1.1 % .
European banks , which seem desperate to get their hands on the American currency , have to pay a further half a percentage point , making their total cost 1.6 % .
Central banks have tried to ease the pain .
A swap deal between the Federal Reserve and the ECB , intended to last until January 2011 , allows banks to borrow dollars for seven days at 1.25 % .
But the rise in Libor creates a number of potential difficulties .
Mr Wadhwa points out that , as banks become more concerned about their own borrowing costs , they become more reluctant to lend .
That was precisely what caused the interbank markets to freeze in 2008 .
Meanwhile , an increase in Libor squeezes the profits of even healthy banks , since they had been borrowing cheaply from the money markets and investing in higher - yield assets such as government bonds .
There is a strange symbiosis between governments and banks .
It may have been governments that rescued banks in the autumn of 2008 .
But governments rely on banks to market and indeed to buy their debt .
The one cannot survive without the other .
A big reason why EU politicians raced to push through the € 750 billion bail - out package was that a default by a southern European government would create a severe funding crisis for banks .
Royal Bank of Scotland reckons that foreign banks own about € 1 trillion of the sovereign debt of Greece , Portugal and Spain .
There would be a risk of another crisis in the style of 2008 , in which the markets would be uncertain which banks were most exposed to the defaulting assets , and would therefore apply a general boycott .
Spain has been in the spotlight in recent days .
The government has had to rescue CajaSur , a small savings bank , and four other savings banks have chosen to join forces ( see article ) .
An IMF report on Spain , published on May 24th , gave warning that the risks for banks “ remain elevated and unevenly distributed across institutions ” and recommended consolidation “ to reduce overcapacity and produce more robust institutions . ”
The Spanish stockmarket is one of Europe 's worst performers , having fallen by around a third , in dollar terms , since the start of 2010 .
Andrew Smithers of Smithers & Co , a firm of consultants , points out another problem .
If governments now strive to reduce their fiscal deficits ( and contingent liabilities ) , this limits their ability to bail out the private sector , including banks .
In addition , recent political discussions about financial reform have centred on the desire to avoid future bank bail - outs ; Barack Obama has said as much .
Markets may be taking politicians at their word .
These tensions illustrate a contradiction at the heart of the market 's rally from the lows of March 2009 .
Governments and central banks have supported the recovery with huge fiscal deficits and near - zero interest rates .
Yet the sheer scale of these measures should have given investors cause for concern , as they indicate how fearful the authorities had become .
At some point , if the economy recovers , the stimulus will have to be withdrawn , leaving the markets facing higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy .
And if the stimulus fails to work , market hopes of future profits growth ( double - digit gains are expected in 2011 and 2012 ) would clearly be disappointed .
Governments have shown they can support consumption in specific areas , such as the cash - for - clunkers subsidy in cars or the homebuyers ' tax credit .
But sales have fallen back quickly once the subsidies end .
Lacking strong demand at home , governments are tempted to let their currencies depreciate so that their exporters can grab a bigger share of the global market .
The problem is that not all currencies can fall at once .
Britain stole a march when the pound fell sharply in 2008 .
Now the euro is taking a battering , hitting a four - year low against the dollar .
With China seemingly unwilling to let the yuan appreciate , the danger is that a series of beggar - thy - neighbour competitive depreciations create protectionist pressures .
This is a particular danger in America , where congressional elections take place in November .
Governments ought also to consider the creditors ' point of view .
Deficit countries are all competing for the good opinion of global savers .
Depreciation may help the domestic economy , but it inflicts a loss on foreign holders of local - currency government bonds .
Rationally , investors should eventually respond by demanding higher yields to compensate for the currency risk .
It seems rather surprising , for example , that Britain can still borrow for ten years at 3.5 % when its central bank has been so relaxed about letting its currency depreciate and its budget deficit is among the highest in Europe .
In addition , government borrowing could crowd out the private sector .
That may not be a problem at the moment , when companies and consumers are so reluctant to borrow .
But it could become one if deficits do not fall substantially in the medium term , beyond a mere reflection of a cyclical improvement in the economy .
“ We 've long held the view that risk assets could see crowding - out over the next few years as there is more and more Western government debt to finance , ” says Jim Reid , a strategist at Deutsche Bank .
“ It makes perfect sense that risk assets would trade at lower levels than they would do if governments had less [ debt ] to issue . ”
But the absence of crowding - out at the moment is hardly a matter for rejoicing .
It simply indicates that the private sector is not yet ready to shoulder the burden of recovery from the public sector .
Demand for credit remains low .
Companies have issued just $ 47 billion of bonds so far in May .
They are on course for the lowest monthly total since December 1999 , according to Bloomberg .
And earlier this month Volkswagen was forced to postpone a bond issue of nearly € 700 m , backed by Spanish car loans .
Yields on corporate bonds have been rising again , discouraging companies from raising money .
Broad - money supply was flat in the euro zone in the 12 months to the end of March .
America 's measure of broad money rose by only 1.6 % in the year to April , and fell slightly in the second half of that period .
The bears come out of the woods
The latest market setback has given heart to those bearish commentators who were looking out of touch towards the end of last year .
Albert Edwards of Société Générale has long believed in an “ ice age ” in which deflationary pressures drag down equity valuations , as they have in Japan over the past 20 years .
He believes the recovery will be short - lived .
“ Renewed recession awaits , ” he says .
With core measures of consumer - price inflation in both America and the euro area below 1 % , “ the icy tentacles of outright deflation are now just within reach . ”
Bears would also argue that shares do not look cheap .
This may seem remarkable , given that profits are close to a 50 - year high as a proportion of American GDP and the S&P 500 index is back at levels it first reached in March 1998 .
But chart 3 , from a website updating “ Irrational Exuberance ” , a book by Robert Shiller of Yale University , shows the best long - term valuation measure , the cyclically adjusted price - earnings ratio .
On this indicator , which smooths profits over a ten - year period , shares are still trading at 20 times earnings , more than double the ratio of the 1930s or early 1980s .
“ These types of brutal downdraughts coupled with intense volatility are generally the hallmark of overvalued markets as we saw in 1990 , 1998 , 2000 and again in 2007 , ” says David Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff , a Canadian asset - management firm .
But the bulls will continue to take comfort from those low rates and booming profits .
Company finances are improving .
The default rate on speculative corporate bonds has been steadily declining ; according to Standard & Poor 's , only 7 % of issuers defaulted in the past 12 months , down from almost 10 % in the year to November .
With companies still churning out cash and paying dividends , bulls say investors will eventually be tempted to put their money back into the stockmarket , especially given the tiny yields on cash .
Some see good signs in the mad dash into Treasuries : American mortgage rates will drift lower , supporting the housing market .
When investors get a few days without bad political news , bulls argue , the markets will rebound .
Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research spies a buying opportunity in the turmoil , because the underlying economic situation is improving and the monetary authorities may provide further support , such as asset purchases by the ECB .
A slowdown in Europe is not as important as it used to be , given Asia 's strength .
On May 26th the OECD raised its forecasts for global GDP growth to 4.6 % for this year and 4.5 % for 2011 .
That is largely because of optimism about China , India , Brazil and , to some extent , America ; its predictions for euro - area growth rose only from 0.9 % to 1.2 % this year and from 1.7 % to 1.8 % next .
Markets are thus trying to make sense of a world in which political and regulatory risks are balanced by strong profits growth and low interest rates .
No wonder they have been volatile .
That is also the picture that emerges from the VIX , a measure of volatility that shows how much investors are prepared to pay to insure themselves against extreme market outcomes .
After a long period of calm , the VIX has soared again ( see chart 4 ) .
Investors are clearly expecting a bumpy ride .
Well , let ’s get down to the nitty - gritty without shilly - shallying or dilly - dallying : we ’re looking at another victim of phonetic profiling here , that kind of pseudo - etymological flim - flam that seeks to control others by imputing guilt for the very use of a word that just happens to bear a vague resemblance to a racist term .
( See picnic – specifically , see Help stop a word - lynching . )
I mean , imagine .
An innocent word is just walking down the street .
Some self - appointed language cop sees it and says , “ Hey , that word looks suspicious to me .
Do n’t like the colour of it .
Looks a little bit too much like this bad word here .
So it must be related to it .
In fact , I ’m gonna conjecture a story about it so I can bust it and toss it in the cooler . ”
We all know what happened to niggardly , eh ?
A word with purely Germanic roots tracing back to proto-Germanic and cognates in Germanic languages all meaning “ stingy ” , and it just happened to sound like the wrong thing .
Well , here ’s another victim .
Now , yes , I ’m the first person to point out that you ca n’t escape the echoes and overtones of words .
Niggardly pretty much ca n’t be used without a little hint of you - know - what - word .
But – and this is the most important thing – it does n’t automatically equate with intention .
After all , no one has a problem saying suffocate or country even though they contain within them phonetic strings identical to those of very vulgar words .
If you know someone will be offended by the use of the word , then , yes , intention comes into it ; but one cannot escape asking what reason they have for being offended .
Typically the justification given is an etymological one , and that is where the arguments break down .
Once someone claims picnic or niggardly or nitty - gritty is offensive on the basis of racism in the etymology , they have holed their argument below the waterline , because there is no racism in the etymology of any of these words .
Moreover , they are committed to being offended by nice ( which used to mean “ foolish ” or “ ignorant ” ) and not being offended by silly ( which used to mean “ blessed ” ) .
Which is only lucky for them because I say that they are being very silly and not at all nice .
But I mean that in the modern senses .
Today , class , we are going to learn rule number one of etymology : Coincidence is nothing .
Evidence is everything .
It is beyond easy to find sound coincidences .
This was famously satirized in My Big Fat Greek Wedding where the father invents an etymology for kimono on the basis of its sounding like the Greek word for “ winter ” ( kheimón ) and a kimono being a garment one may put on to keep warm in cold weather .
True , I fill my word tasting notes with word plays , but while sound coincidences can ( especially if you ’re paying attention to them ) affect how you receive a word ( and they do sometimes affect the meaning of a word over time ) , they simply are not reliable guides to the origin of a word without further evidence .
Oh , they can lead you to look for evidence .
But if that evidence is not there , then you ca n’t make an assertion .
And if there ’s abundant counter - evidence ( as there is , for instance , with picnic ) , then your theory is toast .
So , for instance , nitty - gritty is a word first attested in the 20th century .
The oldest printed use of it so far found is from 1940 , but it is generally considered to have been in use for at least a couple of decades before that .
It was popular among black jazz musicians in particular back then , and it has always meant “ the fundamental issues ” or “ the most important things ” .
Now , it happens that there is a conjecture being passed around ( by people who do n’t seem to think research is important ) that it originated as a term for the dirt ( grit ) left behind after African slaves ( ni … ) had been unloaded from slave ships .
The problem with this conjecture is that there is not even the merest scintilla of support for it .
It is not really believable that this term could have been in use for two centuries without so much as once being documented .
( There is also the matter of its documented uses always being positively toned and referring to essential things rather than negatively toned and referring to waste , but meanings can shift over time , as I have already pointed out . )
So , now , let us put that frankly obnoxious unsupported etymological conjecture about slave - ship origins behind us and let us taste this word on its own terms .
Obviously there is an enough of an echo of “ the n- word ” for many people to have noticed it .
On the other hand , no one is protesting that Niagara is racist ( or if they are , I have n’t heard it ) , so we need not consider this word poisoned .
The strong taste of its elements nit and grit , along with the tapping of the /t/s , gives it a certain get - dirt - under - your - fingernails edge , the kind of focus on specifics that can involve sifting through a lot of itty - bitty particles .
And then , yes , there ’s that reduplication .
We do like reduplication in English ; it adds an ideophonic touch , that performative aspect to a word .
There ’s an insistence in nitty - gritty that is n’t there in nuts and bolts , for instance .
Just as super - duper is a greater degree than super , and teeny - weeny is smaller ( and cuter ) than teeny or tiny , likewise nitty - gritty is more fundamentally fundamental for being reduplicative .
And , hey , you want to dot the i‘s and cross the t‘s ?
Well , here are two i‘s and four t‘s – double your specificity !
And where else will this word lead us ?
I think Jamaica in the moonlight …
What ?
Oh , those are words from “ American Dream , ” a song by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band .
Jamaica is also where the reggae singer who called himself Nitty Gritty hailed from .
So take your pick : country - folk - rock or reggae … and let ’s get down to the nitty - gritty !
Thanks to Elaine Freedman for asking for nitty - gritty .
Hard to believe " Three Days of the Condor " is 34 years old , because it was such a damned prescient movie .
And now , in light of this latest military report , I expect that our government wo n't even try to hide a " blood for oil " foreign policy once the American public is clamoring for it :
The US military has warned that surplus oil production capacity could disappear within two years and there could be serious shortages by 2015 with a significant economic and political impact .
The energy crisis outlined in a Joint Operating Environment report from the US Joint Forces Command , comes as the price of petrol in Britain reaches record levels and the cost of crude is predicted to soon top $ 100 a barrel .
" By 2012 , surplus oil production capacity could entirely disappear , and as early as 2015 , the shortfall in output could reach nearly 10 million barrels per day , " says the report , which has a foreword by a senior commander , General James N Mattis .
It adds : " While it is difficult to predict precisely what economic , political , and strategic effects such a shortfall might produce , it surely would reduce the prospects for growth in both the developing and developed worlds .
Such an economic slowdown would exacerbate other unresolved tensions , push fragile and failing states further down the path toward collapse , and perhaps have serious economic impact on both China and India . "
Who are they kidding ?
It 's going to put major economic and social stresses on what 's left of the United States economy , because China 's selling us all those cheap goods .

16 people have been implicated in the Starcraft match fixing scandal : eleven current and ex-progamers , three brokers , and two individuals who used inside information on the fixing to place bets .
Korean laws allow for a certain degree of privacy regarding those involved in legal cases , but by allowing last names and details about the crimes to be revealed , some identities can easily be deduced .
Three brokers were indicted , gaming academy owner Mr. Park ( under arrest ) , K3 ( 3rd division ) soccer pro Mr. Jung , and the gangster Mr. Kim ( wanted ) .
The brokers used their relationships with the progamer Mr. Ma ( obviously savior ) to offer other progamers between 2~6.5 million won ( $ 2k~6.5k ) to intentionally lose matches .
Twelve games are alleged to have been tampered with in this manner .
In December of 2009 , Mr. Ma is said to have cooperated with the broker Mr. Jung to pay progamer Mr. Jin ( obviously Hwasin ) to lose a match , and continued to bribe Mr. Jin and two other progamers .
Mr. Ma is said to have skimmed off 2 million won in bribe payments to other progamers for himself .
Mr. Won ( obvious Justin ) received 3 million won from a broker last September to intentionally lose his match , and went on to cooperate with the brokers to bribe six other gamers a total of eight times .
Mr. Won and Mr. Park pooled their money to bribe their gamers , and Mr. Won made 35 million won in gambling winnings .
Mr. Park ( possibly luxury or yarnc ) , and the six other progamers bribed through Mr. Ma and Mr. Won agreed to 1~3 cases of match fixing , and were promised anywhere between 1 million to 6.5 million won , though some of the payments were not fulfilled .
Fomos says image has no relation to actual case ( after people linked it to sAviOr of course )
The results are out , and what all ESPORTS fans have been fearing is now confirmed to be true - the match - fixing scandals are all real .
They are only using the surnames in the article , but so far these " names " are released .

“ … This is but one example of the encounters that I have on a regular basis with friends , family , and colleagues who have no idea what is going on in the world .
They read the New York Times and believe they are informed .
There is no intellectual curiosity , no questioning of reporting , and no analysis of what the mainstream media is pouring out to the masses .
While we all like to blame the …media …at some point we all have to take responsibility for our own thoughts and decisions . ”
– Lauri B. Regan
A FEW WEEKS AGO , a man associated with a well - known American mass media outlet called from Tokyo for a pleasant chat that at one point touched on the media ’s coverage of Japan overseas .
He asked me how I thought the broadcast and print media could improve their reporting on this country .
I replied that the media ’s reporting on Japan is never going to improve , and gave as my reason their preference for offering a preexisting narrative rather than providing factual descriptions of events in news articles and leaving their interpretation or agenda to the op - ed pages .
What I did n’t tell him is equally germane :
There are two reasons the media relies on preexisting narrative templates for countries , issues , or people .
( In addition to the one for Japan , there are templates for Israel , George W. Bush , Barack Obama , Sarah Palin , the UKIP in Britain , and dozens more . )
First , the narrative is meant to simplify issues and personalities for readers in bite - size form , converting them to a form of entertainment that helps sell their product and the accompanying advertising .
It also spares the readers from the time required to peruse an in - depth characterization and the trouble of having to think too much about something they might not be interested in to begin with .
Serious consumers of news realize at an early age that what the media really offers is infotainment , and that it ’s a feature of the product , not a bug .
Second , it should now be obvious to even the casual observer that the Western media and its public intellectuals will never accord even - handed treatment to Japan , despite an exemplary record of conduct unmatched by any of its G7 counterparts for more than 60 years .
Alone among the nations of the world it combines the absence of military aggression with an altruistic financial generosity that is ignored , taken for granted , or unrecognized .
It contributed $ US 13 billion to the reconstruction of oil - rich Kuwait after the Gulf War , for example , but when the government of Kuwait took out a full - page ad in the Washington Post to thank the nations that came to its assistance , Japan was left off the list .
Saddam Hussein deliberately drained the wetlands where roughly 500,000 Shiite Arabs lived in southern Iraq , destroying the local ecology and forcing them to become refugees .
How many people realize that Japan paid $ US 11 million for the restoration of those marshes , much less give them credit for it ?
No , it ’s much easier and more entertaining to fill the space with annual stories about whalers and the whacked - out eco-pirates who ram them broadside .
Bad Oriental guys , rakish Hollywood - funded good guys , and photos of bloody whales sells product .
Then recall how many stories you ’ve seen about the imminent resurgence of Japanese militarism that somehow never seems to resurge .
After seeing the pattern repeat itself time and again in the stories published by every important Western print media outlet in English and the op-eds and magazine articles of public intellectuals on both the left and right over several decades , one can only conclude that the media ’s narrative template about Japan is informed by an ill - concealed deformity of thought that deserves a term of its own : anti-Nipponism .
The following is yet the latest demonstration that the default view of Japan for Western elites is the Goofball Kingdom of East Asia , populated by otaku xenophobes and female children aged 18 to 80 .
It has all the disfiguring characteristics on display : media presentations that are a superficial gloss of the facts –whenever they crop up amidst the editorializing and inaccuracies–and rendered so as to present Japan in the worst possible light .
These presentations were swallowed whole by soi-disant public intellectuals who make elementary mistakes in reading comprehension that seem to derive from seeing what they want to see regardless of what the words say .
They toss off a combination of sophomoric snark and anti-Nipponistic criticism before losing interest in toying with the lightweights of the world , furrowing their brows , and turning their attention to serious issues .
You think I ’m exaggerating ?
First we ’ll look at the facts .
Then we ’ll look at the people who ca n’t handle the facts .
Let ’s start with this Japanese - language link to a 31 March announcement from the Ministry of Health , Labor , and Welfare about a voluntary government plan to provide assistance allowing financially strapped ethnically Japanese foreign workers with no job prospects to return home .
My English translation follows .
( Keep in mind that a bureaucrat wrote the original . )
*****
Re : Providing financial assistance to displaced workers of Japanese descent for returning to their home country
With the prevailing social and economic conditions , it is extremely difficult for laborers of Japanese descent in unstable types of employment , such as seconded workers or subcontractors , to be reemployed once they have lost their jobs .
Some have insufficient Japanese language ability , are unfamiliar with Japanese employment practices , and lack work experience in this country .
Therefore , reemployment after returning to their home country is increasingly becoming a realistic alternative .
In view of these circumstances , the ruling party ’s project team for new employment measures has proposed that financial assistance be provided to these persons of Japanese descent who wish to return to their home country for that purpose .
The Ministry of Health , Labor , and Welfare will implement a program starting in business year 2009 ( i.e. , 1 April ) offering financial assistance to those displaced workers who have decided to return to their home country , under the following specified conditions , to respond to their acute need .
( Refer to separate document . )
In addition , we are working to utilize all the existing programs and financial assistance for obtaining housing in support of their efforts to find new employment , and to maintain that employment for those people who continue to stay in this country and seek reemployment , just as we would for Japanese people .
In the future , we will provide appropriate support , including that for reemployment , through the expeditious enhancement of systems for support and consultation with such measures as increasing the number of people providing interpretation and consultation services in accordance with local circumstances , and efficiently implementing employment preparation training that increases skills , including Japanese language ability .
*****
The first Ministry page links to the separate document ( pdf ) with charts that contain more detail .
* There we find out that guest workers who are still receiving unemployment compensation and choose to return will be granted an additional JPY 100,000 if they have 30 days remaining in unemployment benefits and JPY 200,000 ( about $ US 2,100 ) if they have more than 60 days remaining in unemployment benefits .
* It also mentions that in those regions where the nikkei ( ethnically Japanese ) workers are concentrated , 9,296 foreign job - seekers visited Haro Waaku , the government employment agency , for the first time ever from November 2008 to January 2009 .
That is a roughly 11 - fold increase from the year - before period .
* The page emphasizes that the offer is being made to those people who are “ extremely unlikely ” to find employment due to a lack of Japanese language ability or job skills .
* The workers are being given special help for finding jobs at nine separate branches of Haro Waaku , and the help included interpretation .
By mid-March , one - stop service centers to deal solely with this issue were established in municipal offices in 33 locations .
* An additional three new centers for consultation and advice have been established in areas with many foreigners and the benefits have been increased
* The site says these measures implement activities to enhance support for reemployment and maintain present employment .
These include subsidies for trial employment and compensating employers for hiring them .
There are also measures to enable people to retain their housing .
* Starting this year , the government will offer more interpretation and consultation services .
They will also conduct job training programs to improve their job skills , including Japanese language instruction , during the period they are receiving unemployment compensation .
They have budgeted JPY 1.08 billion ( about $ US 11.355 million ) for the current fiscal year to help roughly 5,000 people .
* The training programs will be the responsibility of the Japan International Cooperation Center ( JICE ) , a non-profit foundation that conducts human resource development programs for developing countries .
* The training will be conducted over a three - month period with the objective of improving Japanese language communication ability , and inculcate an understanding of working conditions , employment practices , and government benefits for employment and other social insurance schemes .
It also provides unemployment benefits for a minimum of 90 days to assist the unemployment find new work and to take part in this training .
* When basic training is finished , they will be eligible to move to more advanced training , with subsidies provided during the extended training period .
Special “ navigators ” for the guest workers will be assigned to help them until they find steady work .
Asahi Shimbun
Here ’s a link to a Japanese - language newspaper article that appeared in the Shizuoka edition of the Asahi Shimbun .
It contains a range of opinions from native Japanese and nikkei alike on the program , including those from Japanese who think the government should have done more to encourage the nikkei to stay .
This is not unusual ; the Japanese media is just as capable of examining their behavior from different perspectives as the Western media , if not more so .
One of those who thinks the departure of the nikkei is a “ great loss ” also had this to say :
“ This is a test case .
There are still many adults who chose to live only among foreigners without learning Japanese .
If they lose work at the seconding company , their inability to speak Japanese prevents them from getting another job … the national government ’s support for those people who came to Japan as migrant workers and do n’t have the funds to return home is perhaps a humane policy . ”
Insisted one ministry official involved with the program :
“ The assistance for returning home is provided at government expense to those people who are suffering from unemployment and do not have the funds to return if they want to .
The intention is not to remove the nikkei from the country . ”
The new policy is good news for local governments , which are financially responsible for welfare payments and are having trouble finding the money due to the sharp increase in households consisting of foreigners receiving government assistance .
Said one local government official :
“ It would be cheaper for Japan if they returned home . ”
The city of Hamamatsu is where the most Brazilians live .
At the end of February , it had 116 Brazilian households receiving welfare benefits , compared to 70 at the same time the previous year .
The benefits total more than 100,000 yen per month per family .
They receive the welfare benefits after their unemployment compensation runs out .
Michiko Ramos , a third generation nikkei , commented :
“ Brazilians are too lax .
If they do n’t like the government program , they do n’t have to use it .
Each person should decide for themselves how they ’re going to live , and it ’s their responsibility to do so . ”
The article also notes that the Japanese government will pay travel agencies for the tickets and deposit the remainder of the money in dollar - denominated accounts in the recipient ’s name in Brazil .
Private correspondence
One reader of this site is employed by a national Japanese media outlet .
He spent two months covering this issue on the ground , and here is some of the information he provided to me .
* The program targets almost exclusively Brazilians ( with either Japanese ancestry or a Japanese spouse ) in Japan on working visas who can not speak Japanese and have no savings .
Most have at least $ US 30,000 dollars in annual income , with their housing expenses paid by the company .
* The same program was not offered to Okinawans who came to the same part of Japan to work and were laid off at the same time for the same reasons .
( Okinawa is roughly 800 miles from Nagoya , the hub of the Japanese auto industry , and is only accessible by air or sea from there . )
* The correspondent notes that the workers can be divided into two broad groups :
Those who “ have a plan ” and those who do n’t .
The people in the former group put their children in Japanese public schools , learned to speak and read Japanese , and received permanent residence visas .
* The workers ’ hourly wages start at JPY 1,200 yen for unskilled labor , but the auto industry in that part of Japan often pays JPY 1,400 ( about $ US 14.70 ) an hour .
Most households have two workers because the wives also work .
The income of many Brazilian families is about 4 to 5 million yen annually , not counting inexpensive or non-existent housing costs , because the company covers them .
* Some Brazilian workers rejected the option of becoming full - time employees because doing so meant that pension and insurance funds would be withheld from their salaries .
They see themselves as migrant workers and wanted the cash immediately .
* Why do some people need financial assistance to return home ?
As my correspondent reports , in what he admits is an extreme example :
“ Many simply spend too much .
I ’ve been to a house in Shizuoka where all four family members work in a factory .
This family has four cars ( although you do need cars for everyday life in that part of Shizuoka ) , a house , and a racing car and trailer .
( Drifting has become a popular sport among Brazilian youth ) .
They ca n’t speak Japanese despite being here for 17 years …
Many Brazilians who do n’t have money to buy tickets back home are not literally broke .
Many of them have houses in Brazil built with their money they earned working in Japan .
They just do n’t want to sell them for the tickets , which is ( a ) rational ( decision ) .
However , if they are in Japan asking for welfare to sustain ( their lifestyle ) in Japan , that ’s another story … ”
* They are not ordinary guest - workers , because they have become “ spoiled in a way ” now that their community has become established in all “ dimensions of life ” ( i.e. , media , schools , supermarkets , and entertainment ) .
( N.B. : the Brazilian primary school in Hamamatsu recently closed . )
Therefore they no longer need to associate with Japanese and live in a Portuguese - only environment .
He also notes that municipal transportation facilities in Nagoya have Portuguese - language announcements .
* He reports this direct quote ( his English translation ) from the Brazilian vice - consulate and said he ’s got it word for word in his notes :
“ They are in their mess , because they are in their mess .
We did n’t put them in their mess .
It ’s called self responsibility . ”
The reporter wryly notes that Nissan ( and Renault ) CEO Carlos “ Cost Killer ” Ghosn , a Brazilian ( and French and Lebanese ) national was lionized by the Western media as the savior of Japanese business when he turned around Nissan some years ago by laying off thousands of Japanese workers .
The BBC described his moves at Nissan as “ savage ” .
CNN and the Detroit News dubbed him a “ superstar ” .
This February , the Brazilian Cost Killer brought out the knife again and announced he will cut 8.5 % of the company ’s staff worldwide by laying off 20,000 workers .
Not all of the cuts were specified , but of those 20,000 , 10 % were in Japan .
My correspondent points out that when the CEO of Toyota lays off Brazilian workers for the same reason , and the Japanese government provides the funds to those unskilled workers with no Japanese ability and no savings who choose to return home voluntarily , it becomes a “ humanitarian crisis ” .
Sidebar 1 : Mr. Ghosn was in Tokyo this week to unveil the new Nissan Leaf , an all - electric car .
He says he spends 40 % of his time in Japan , and he has been head of Nissan for more than a decade , yet he chose to speak to the Japanese broadcast media in English .
There ’s a reason I provided this information .
The following is a description of a newspaper article and a magazine article , with an attendant blog post for each one .
They all presume to criticize Japan for its policy , yet 95 % of the above information is not included .
Freakonomics
University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York journalist Stephen J. Dubner published Freakonomics : A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything in 2005 .
It has since sold 3 million copies , and they operate a blog on the New York Times website called Freakonomics : The Hidden Side of Everything to “ continue the conversation ” .
Somebody named “ Freakonomics ” wrote the following post this April .
When Japanese unemployment edged up to a three - year high of 4.4 percent in February , the government started looking for creative ways to lower it .
One solution : get the unemployed out of the country by offering citizenship buyouts .
The program applies only to unemployed people of Japanese descent who were born abroad but now live in Japan ( they ’re known as nikkei ) .
The plan pays out - of - work nikkei $ 3,000 to return to their country of origin , not to return until economic conditions improve in Japan .
Like other strange Japanese ideas , we do n’t expect this one to spread to our shores any time soon .
Somehow , Mr. Freakonomics — the journalist or the university professor , whoever — got the idea that the Japanese program is a “ citizenship buyout ” , despite having nothing to do with ( a ) citizens , ( b ) buying anything , or ( c ) buying out citizens .
In fact , the author was so enamored of this idea that he created a hot link for the phrase to a Time magazine article , which you can see here .
Time magazine conveniently saves their readers of taking the trouble to weigh the factual evidence and make up their own minds by giving the article the deliberately misleading headline of , “ Thanks , but you can go home now ” .
Immediately under the headline is a photo captioned , “ Brazilian workers of Japanese descent stage a protest against layoffs in central Tokyo on Jan. 18 , 2009 . ”
One wonders what the point of the protest was .
Japanese automakers are also laying off Japanese workers , so the protest is n’t going to get them rehired .
None of them live or work anywhere near central Tokyo , so perhaps they were demonstrating in front of corporate headquarters , though Time ca n’t be bothered to tell us that .
Another possibility is that they were angling for media coverage .
For that matter , one wonders why Time printed the photograph , which is of only tertiary importance to the issue , and gave it this page positioning , unless it was for propaganda purposes .
The photo is followed by two paragraphs more suitable for a daytime soap opera than a news story , which includes the claims that the Japanese government has made the unemployed feel “ unwanted ” .
The first person quoted — indeed , the first person mentioned — is the leader of the nikkei labor union crying “ discrimination ” .
After all , we know that labor union leaders are the go - to source of information about government programs .
The seven - paragraph article contains only one sentence about the Japanese government offer .
The third paragraph is a straightforward description of current domestic economic conditions .
The rest is nothing more than an anti-Nipponistic editorial , and Time manages to mangle the facts while it ’s at it :
The money is n’t the problem , the Brazilians say ; it ’s the fact that they will not be allowed to return until economic and employment conditions improve — whenever that may be .
No , they will not be allowed to return at all on a special nikkei work visa , and the reason for the incorporation of that restriction should be obvious : to prevent repeated use of the program and scamming extra money off the deal .
Then Time benevolently dispenses to its readership the wisdom of the Western biens pensants regarding how Japan should conduct itself as a nation :
“ The U.N. has projected that the nation will need 17 million immigrants by 2050 to maintain a productive economy . ”
Yes , we all know how accurate UN projections are for 40 years in the future , particularly for global warming climate change .
Does Japan need to add a total number of immigrants equal to 13 % of its present population to “ maintain a productive economy ” , or does it need that many people to maintain its social welfare system for an aging population — which is not the same thing — and in so doing , eliminate the concept of “ Japan ” as we know it as a functioning entity ?
But what ’s that to public intellectuals and their acolytes in the West ?
As we saw here recently , the Canadians have concluded that large - scale immigration is not the answer .
And we ’ve also seen how the huge influx of Muslim immigrants , specifically admitted to fill unskilled labor jobs and prop up the social welfare system for an aging population , has worked out in Western Europe .
( By the way , they ’ve been rioting in France again , and this time it ’s so bad the French government has forbidden the police from disclosing the statistics . )
There ’s some input from Carlos Zaha , a “ community leader ” :
“ I do n’t think [ the government ] thought this through well . ”
The government is offering a generous financial assistance program that is entirely voluntary .
The ones who have to think it through are the Brazilians — take it or leave it .
Leaving it means that to survive in this economic climate , they ’ll actually have to do stuff like learn Japanese and job - related skills for something other than sweeping up the shop room floor .
Fortunately , the Japanese government is making it easier for anyone with the motivation to do just that .
The article also quotes the union leader ’s son :
“ They have to help people to continue working in Japan , ” he says .
“ If Brazilians go home , what will they do there ? ”
If we know “ they ” are helping people to continue working in Japan , why does n’t he ?
Perhaps he ’s one of those who did n’t bother to study Japanese , but then again the Japanese government provides free interpreters to explain the program .
He also does n’t explain why the government “ has ” to do things for a group specifically targeted because they chose the easy money route rather than the assimilation route .
Nor does he explain why it is the business of the Japanese government what Brazilian citizens do in Brazil .
But back to Mr. Freakonomics .
He / they conclude(s ) : “ Like other strange Japanese ideas , we do n’t expect this one to spread to our shores any time soon . ”
The gratuitous “ other strange Japanese ideas ” phrase ( there are so many , after all ) is hot linked to another post by that Freakonomics guy presenting some photos of “ Only in Japan ” strange “ products ” .
They discovered this hidden side because a reader of their blog sent them a chain e-mail letter .
If you have a Windows machine and right click the photos as if to save them to your computer , which is what Freakonomics did , you ’ll see that they ’ve already been given a title at their site .
I ’ll show two of those photos here ; their site ’s title for the first photo is “ Japs 1 ” , and the title for the second is “ Japs 3 ” .
Hmm , the hidden side of everything …
Here ’s the photo of the first product at “ Japs 1 ” .
Yes , that is a strange product .
It looks like something a junior high school student might buy if she were in a spending mood and had some money to burn .
But since I ’ve never seen this product in anyone ’s home , any store , or in any broadcast or print advertising , that ’s only speculation on my part .
Perhaps they ’re hidden in this country somewhere .
Maybe the money earned from the book transformed the lives of Messrs .
Freakonomics so much they no longer have to shop where the simple folk do .
Or perhaps they had a refined upbringing .
That would explain their unfamiliarity with the idea of novelty products .
Still , they should be old enough to remember Pet Rocks .
In 1975 , American advertising executive Gary Dahl bought ordinary rocks for a few cents apiece , wrote a tongue - in - cheek manual to accompany them , and packaged the combination as Pet Rocks .
Each product unit cost less than 30 cents to produce , and Mr. Dahl sold them for $ 3.95 .
In fact , he sold an estimated 5 million pet rocks in six months , earning him about $ US 15 million .
I ’ll bet those cushion makers wish they could cash in like that .
Another example of a highly profitable American novelty item is mood rings .
These rings are most often made with a sham gemstone covering a thermo-chromic liquid crystal that responds to body temperature .
The people who take these rings seriously claim that body temperatures change in tandem with emotion , and that the rings turn specific colors to match the specific emotion of the wearer .
Though they were a faddish novelty item of the 1970s , they ’re still being sold today , sometimes for less than $ US 4.00 .
Indeed , the concept has spread , as you can see from one note on this page :
“ Ahh , but the newest version of the mood ring ?
Mood Piercing !
That ’s right , body jewelry with the mood ring twist .
It ’s a curved bar bell with the mood piece on the lower ball .
It ’s intended for a navel ring , but I have mine to determine my sexual mood , if you catch what I ’m saying .
It was a joke between a friend and I who both have our clitoris hoods pierced how cool it would be , so I got us each one .
I ’m not sure it ’s ever really been accurate … ”
Moving on to “ Jap 3 ” , here ’s a photo of what the post ’s author thinks is a Japanese “ product ” because that ’s what someone told him in a chain e-mail .
Long - time friends of this site will immediately realize that is n’t a product at all .
It ’s a one - of - a - kind item known as chindogu , or “ unusual tool ” , and could best be described as comical pop art with an avant - garde twist .
Those who want to delve into the hidden side of chindogu can read this previous post .
Who knows , a gallery exhibition in Western countries might be quite successful .
Actually , this is not the first time someone ’s been made the sucker by chindogu .
This post describes how the New York Times interviewed another chindogu artist who stitched together some fabric to make herself look like a soft drink vending machine .
Somehow , this was enough to convince the Times it was a sign the Japanese were concerned about crime in the streets .
The horse laughs over that journalistic pratfall still reverberate through cyberspace .
My post on the topic received quite a few links from around the world , and ranks # 2 on the site Hit Parade .
I suspect Messrs .
Freakonomics are right about this strange idea being unlikely to spread to their shores , though .
That would require having a sense of humor .
Besides , they do n’t need any more strange avant - garde artwork over there .
They ’ve got plenty of their own .
For example :
That ’s the notorious 1987 photograph Piss Christ by Andres Serrano , which shows a plastic crucifix in a glass of the photographer ’s urine .
It won an award in the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art ’s “ Awards in the Visual Arts ” competition , partially sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts , a United States Government agency that funds artistic projects .
Mr. Serrano received $ US 15,000 , some of that from the taxpayer - funded NEA .
In addition to strange Japanese novelty products or pop art , Messrs .
Freakonomics are convinced the U.S. wo n’t go for this strange Japanese immigration relief measure either .
That ’s probably because they think America has a perfectly wonderful immigration system .
Well , the perfect part has it right .
The American immigration system is perfectly dysfunctional and has been for years .
The United States lost control of its borders decades ago and shows no sign that it will ever regain that control .
Consider :
* Immigrants account for 13 % of the current U.S. population , and 30 % of those are illegal aliens .
Except now they have their own lobbying organizations that wet their pants in indignation for a living , so the phrase “ undocumented migrants ” is often used instead .
In raw numbers , estimates of the latter range from 12 - 20 million in a country of 300 million .
* Between 1 - 2 million immigrants , both documented and illegal , arrive every year .
On the whole , they have fewer job skills and less education than Americans , and they receive more from taxes than they contribute by a 3 - 1 ratio .
* Many of these immigrants never intend to assimilate .
For several generations , it ’s been possible to live from birth to death throughout the country , including Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York , Miami , and most of Texas , without speaking a word of English , much less become a legal resident .
An estimated 85 % of the Mexicans living in the U.S. are thought to be there illegally .
This has been a problem for some time .
Here ’s a direct quote from the New York Times , circa 1951 , in the days before the political correctness of language :
“ The rise in illegal border - crossing by Mexican ‘ wetbacks ’ to a current rate of more than 1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer - exploiters of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal Government . ”
One of the several concerns was that the illegal immigrants worked in the agriculture sector for half the salary paid to Americans , which put the Americans out of work .
That concern is ongoing , and opponents of guest worker programs in the United States often point out that the lower salaries distort the economic structure .
In contrast , the nikkei in Japan were paid salaries identical to those of Japanese in the same positions .
In 1986 , the U.S. government threw up its hands entirely by passing an amnesty bill that allowed an estimated 2.7 million illegal aliens to receive citizenship .
Many naturally complain that this was a reward for breaking the law .
Six additional amnesties ( not all blanket amnesties ) were passed from 1994 to 2000 .
The American political class is incapable of formulating a coherent immigration policy .
Business interests want to keep the cheap labor source , and they are abetted by politicians in both parties .
( Not just the big business GOP , either ; as a senator , the later - to - be President Lyndon Johnson , a Texas Democrat , favored lax immigration enforcement . )
Labor unions dislike guest worker programs , but their favored party , the Democrats , realize that the beneficiaries of so many government programs tend to vote for that party , and that guest workers usually wind up as permanent residents .
President George W. Bush failed to gain passage of an immigration reform act that included amnesty , but President Barack Obama is going to try again , even though Mr. Bush ’s legislation was defeated due to public opposition .
As the New York Times put it :
But , ( Obama ) said , immigrants who are long - time residents but lack legal status “ have to have some mechanism over time to get out of the shadows . ”
Nothing describes current immigration policy and enforcement in the U.S. better than this lead sentence from a CNN article .
“ Six months to the day after Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al - Shehhi flew planes into the World Trade Center , the Immigration and Naturalization Service notified a Venice , Florida , flight school that the two men had been approved for student visas . ”
So it ’s entirely understandable that the Messrs .
Freakonomics , Americans both , would find the Japanese success at controlling their borders and the influx of guest workers to be a strange idea that would n’t work on their shores .
If I were Japanese , I ’d be proud of the country for their handling of the situation .
Sidebar 2 : Some people were impressed the two Freakonomics authors discovered that sumo wrestlers in certain situations tend to lose matches they statistically should be expected to win , which suggests that they ’re throwing the matches for the benefit of their fellow rikishi .
Except the Japanese have known this for centuries , and have never been shy or hesitant to write or talk about it .
You just have to be able to read mass - market Japanese paperbacks and talk to Japanese people in Japanese for all these hidden sides to come to light .
Imagine if you will the reaction in the West , particularly by these media outlets and public intellectuals , if a Japanese were to observe pet rocks , mood rings ( including those on pierced clitoris hoods ) , Piss Christ , and an endemic problem with illegal immigration , and wrote :
Like other strange Western ideas , we do n’t expect this one to spread to our shores any time soon .
Not an attractive image , is it ?
Daniel Drezner
Mr. Drezner is a professor of international politics at Tufts University .
He is given space to write a blog for the Foreign Policy website , which is part of the Slate group , which in turn is part of the Washington Post / Newsweek group .
Prof . Drezner decided to weigh in on the Japanese government policy .
The title for the link to his post , which shows up at the top of the Internet browser page , is “ A Demographic Disaster of a Country Kicks Out Immigrants ” .
His post is headlined , “ Reason # 347 Japan is less influential than it should be . ”
His post is not quite as bad as the Freakonomics post , though I realize that is damning it with faint praise .
But he still lets fly with this corker :
“ Apparently , Japan is trying to kick out some of the paltry number of immigrants it currently has in its territory . ”
Readers , it ’s time to congratulate yourselves .
By now , you are already more knowledgeable about Japanese policy toward Brazilian immigrants than a grad school professor of international politics at an elite American university writing a blog on a mainstream media website .
The difference , however , is that you do n’t get paid to spout off .
Prof .
Drezner was so taken with his “ kick out ” line that he turned it into a hot link to this New York Times article .
Incidentally , he does n’t attempt to make any connection between the specific policy and Japan ’s “ punching below its weight ” in international politics .
Perhaps he ’s used to students nodding at everything he says so they do n’t jeopardize their chances for a post - graduate degree .
In regard to what he terms this “ puzzling maneuver ” , he concludes : “ In terms of demographics , about the best thing one can say about Japan is that at least it ’s not as bad as Russia . ”
The snark may be on a more sophisticated level than in the Freakonomics post , but it ’s still snark .
According to UN statistics , the Japanese fertility rate is slightly below that of Russia , equivalent to that of Italy , and higher than Bulgaria or South Korea .
It is n’t significantly different from that in Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Belarus , or the Ukraine .
While it ’s still less than that for the countries of Western Europe , all those countries are still under the population replacement level even when counting the offspring of their fertile Middle Eastern immigrants .
What specific contribution the latter makes is difficult to say because many of those European countries forbid the breakdown of demographic statistics by ethnic group .
Here ’s an idea :
Is the reason Japan is “ punching below its weight ” due in part to the fraudulent coverage given at every turn by an anti-Nipponistic Western media and the dismissive indifference to the facts shown by anti-Nipponistic public intellectuals ?
A comment on this post at the site is also worth looking at .
“ The xenophobic mindset of Japan , is something akin to the Wahabi equivalent in Islam – if it goes so far as to exclude ethnic Japanese , from Brazil ! ”
Lord knows the man ca n’t stop ignoramuses from posting in his comment section , but that ’s clearly anti-Nipponism , and all the more revealing because one would expect the site itself would attract a highly educated and aware readership .
But Prof .
Drezner still has no justification for his claim that the Japanese are “ kicking out ” the nikkei , based on the New York Times article .
The New York Times
This article is written for a section called Global Business , but only 212 of the 1,261 words describe the actual policy itself without editorializing .
It includes only the barest of facts .
Another 120 words blandly describe the economic circumstances that led to the formulation of the policy .
There are 10 direct quotes .
Three of those are sob stories , three are direct criticisms of the Japanese position by Japanese calling it a “ disgrace ” , “ baffling ” , “ cold - hearted ” , and “ an insult ” , and two are accounted for by a simple question and answer .
There is an unattributed quote calling it “ short - sighted ” and “ inhumane ” .
The single quoted Japanese who defends the policy is also given a chance to say , “ I do n’t think Japan should ever become a multi-ethnic society ” .
And I do n’t think the New York Times should stack the deck , but let ’s proceed .
The government will pay thousands of dollars to fly Mrs. Yamaoka ; her husband , who is a Brazilian citizen of Japanese descent ; and their family back to Brazil .
But in exchange , Mrs. Yamaoka and her husband must agree never to seek to work in Japan again .
Not only is this incorrect , but the author knows it .
She later says that they can return on different visas :
But those who travel home on Japan ’s dime will not be allowed to reapply for a work visa .
Stripped of that status , most would find it all but impossible to return .
They could come back on three - month tourist visas .
Or , if they became doctors or bankers or held certain other positions , and had a company sponsor , they could apply for professional visas .
My , but is n’t that “ certain other positions ” a convenient formulation ?
The author does n’t mention it also includes recent graduates of universities with bachelor ’s degrees in the contemporary equivalent of basket weaving hired to teach English at chain schools .
Notice also the doctor / banker part .
That ’s inserted to offer a frisson of righteous indignation over the injustice of it all to the newspaper ’s upper - middle class / upper class readership , some of whom are doctors or bankers , who will then finish reading the paper and head off to their six - or seven - figure jobs elsewhere on the island of Manhattan , or in a private cubicle in some ivory tower .
Here ’s the first direct quote :
“ I feel immense stress .
I ’ve been crying very often , ” Mrs. Yamaoka , 38 , said after a meeting where local officials detailed the offer in this industrial town in central Japan .
Yes , that ’s the Grey Lady and not the National Enquirer .
Here ’s the first quote from a Japanese :
“ It ’s a disgrace .
It ’s cold - hearted , ” said Hidenori Sakanaka , director of the Japan Immigration Policy Institute , an independent research organization .
“ And Japan is kicking itself in the foot , ” he added .
“ We might be in a recession now , but it ’s clear it does n’t have a future without workers from overseas . ”
Prof .
Drezner also repeats that last sentence approvingly , as if everyone with functioning cognitive facilities can see the blinding clarity of its correctness .
Perhaps he needs to read the Canadian report issued above showing that immigration is n’t going to solve anyone ’s population problem .
It ’s also not so clear that the aging of society would be a problem if citizens assumed a greater liability for their own social welfare benefits and responsibility for long - term care , combined with growth - friendly taxation policies and reductions in the sheer mass of government .
And it ’s also clear that most of Western Europe — as we know it — does not have a future with workers from overseas .
The guest workers quickly became the largest group of foreign blue - collar workers in an otherwise immigration - averse country , filling the so - called three - K jobs ( kitsui , kitanai , kiken — hard , dirty and dangerous ) .
Japan is n’t so averse to immigration from people with job skills , a willingness to assimilate , and a desire to learn the language .
I ’m one of those in “ some other position ” who easily received a permanent residence visa .
I know many more who did , and I have no doubt they and I could just as easily become naturalized citizens .
Sidebar 3 : Recruitment of Chinese and Korean workers in Fukuoka
From a Nishinippon Shimbun article , buried in the local news section : Fukuoka Prefecture and other groups sponsored a joint job interview conference on 30 May for foreign students looking for work in Japan .
A total of 194 students at regional universities and graduate schools attended .
Many companies are not hiring at present due to economic conditions , so only seven companies sent representatives .
That was less than half of the companies represented last year , which caused some uneasiness among the students .
This year ’s conference was the eighth , and the prefecture said that about 30 students are hired as a result of the interviews every year .
“ Naturally , we do n’t want those same people back in Japan after a couple of months , ” Mr. Kawasaki ( Jiro , an LDP official formerly with the Health Ministry ) said .
“ Japanese taxpayers would ask , ‘ What kind of ridiculous policy is this ? ’ ”
That ’s the first sensible thing I ’ve read in any of those articles or blog posts yet .
At the packed town hall meeting in Hamamatsu , immigrants voiced disbelief that they would be barred from returning .
Angry members of the audience converged on officials .
Others walked out of the meeting room .
And I ’m sure others went to the rest room , wandered aimlessly in the hall looking at the artwork , or went outside to smoke a cigarette .
Why should they be angry about an optional program ?
Are the comments of Michiko Ramos and the Brazilian vice - consul above beginning to make sense now ?
Claudio Nishimori , 30 , said he was considering returning to Brazil because his shifts at a electronics parts factory were recently reduced .
But he felt anxious about going back to a country he had left so long ago .
“ I ’ve lived in Japan for 13 years .
I ’m not sure what job I can find when I return to Brazil , ” he said .
But his wife has been unemployed since being laid off last year and he can no longer afford to support his family .
Note that Mr. Nishimori and his wife both worked and that Mr. Nishimori has been here 13 years , presumably employed the whole time , yet he has neither the financial wherewithal to survive a layoff of a few months nor the job skills to find employment elsewhere .
Nor , obviously , the desire to participate in the Japanese government ’s job - training and language instruction program .
“ They put up with us as long as they needed the labor , ” said Wellington Shibuya , who came six years ago and lost his job at a stove factory in October .
“ But now that the economy is bad , they throw us a bit of cash and say goodbye … .
We worked hard ; we tried to fit in .
Yet they ’re so quick to kick us out , ” he said .
“ I ’m happy to leave a country like this . ”
With that attitude , Mr. Shibuya , I suspect that “ a country like this ” is even happier with your decision than you are .
Summary
There is nothing inherently wrong with privately owned media outlets using a preexisting narrative template to offer their information .
That ’s how they choose to present themselves to their customers , and their customers are free to accept or reject the template as they choose , according to their time , level of interest , and intellectual inclinations .
The problems arise when the templates are manifestly inaccurate and biased .
There is no question that the employees of these media outlets are accomplished and intelligent people , and that the outlets themselves have the financial resources and access to information to enable those people to get it right .
Yet , as I have noted here often in the past , those media outlets seldom , if ever , get it right when the subject is Japan .
That accomplished , intelligent people with the resources to get it right never do cannot be laid to incompetence .
It must necessarily be the result of intentional design , either on their part or the part of ownership .
The articles by Time magazine and the New York Times plainly do not get it right .
Just as plainly , it was because they chose not to get it right .
I submit that the cause of this disfigurement and abuse of their resources and customers is anti-Nipponism .
There is also no reason to object to privately owned media outlets having a point of view .
That point of view belongs in sections clearly labeled as opinion , however .
As with both articles under review here , editorial opinion should not masquerade as news .
If these were opinion journals , such The Nation or Commentary , for example , it would be a different matter entirely .
But these two media outlets insist on calling themselves news organizations .
The two articles here are putatively news articles that present the facts , yet both are unfair and ugly distortions of the facts .
I submit the cause of these distortions is anti-Nipponism .
Let ’s not pretend any longer , shall we ?
These are not honest mistakes .
This is not sloppy research .
Someone , somewhere , has made a conscious decision to depict the Japanese as negatively as possible , however possible , whenever possible .
These depictions of Japan are the rule rather than the exception .
University of Chicago Prof. Levitt and Mr. Dubner of Freakonomics are also without question intelligent and accomplished people .
Yet the Messrs .
Freakonomics read a
Time magazine article and draw the breathtakingly incorrect conclusion that it is about a “ citizenship buyout ” .
They find a harmless novelty item to be yet another one of those strange ideas from the Goofball Kingdom , while overlooking even stranger — and financially successful — novelty items from their own back yard .
At least the Japanese product is functional .
They take the word of a chain e-mailer that an innocent , amusing , and obscure work of pop art is a commercial product , and snicker with their oh - so - hip audience at the Japanese weirdness for even conceiving of it .
Yet they seem oblivious to situations in their own country ( how often this happens ! ) , in which a downright peculiar work of art was given a cash award partially funded by taxpayers , and which was the subject of a loud public controversy for that very reason .
They are citizens of a nation with perhaps the most dysfunctional immigration system in the modern world , yet they conclude that the Japanese government ’s generous and considerate offer of a voluntary program to people in need , who seem to more closely resemble Aesop ’s grasshopper rather than his ant , is stranger still .
Certainly Tufts University Prof. Drezner is equally accomplished and intelligent .
Yet he reads a New York Times article and draws the breathtakingly incorrect assumption that it is about “ kicking out ” people from Japan .
He then suffers an intellectual short - circuit and concludes this is one of the reasons Japan lacks diplomatic clout .
He ( or someone at that site ) thinks Japan is a “ demographic disaster ” .
Well , perhaps it is , but if it sinks , it ’s going to go down on the same ship as Western Europe , South Korea , and Singapore .
Yet he will only allow that it ’s not as bad as Russia .
If either of those university professors were submitted a paper that reached those conclusions based on evidence that slim in any other subject , they ’d flunk the student faster than you can say Cliff ’s Notes .
Perhaps that is due to what might be called a big - league complex , common among people of certain professions ( particularly lawyers ) .
They think it ’s their job to behave as if they know something about everything , and so act accordingly to uphold their professional reputation .
Freakonomics is about “ the hidden side of everything ” after all , and “ international politics ” covers quite a lot of territory .
But I do n’t think that ’s the reason .
I ’m sure they would vehemently deny they are guilty of what amounts to knee - jerk prejudice — some of their best friends are Japanese , no doubt .
But I submit the cause of their misguided thinking and behavior is anti-Nipponism .
As Ms. Regan ( a financial attorney ) says in the quote at the start of the article , it is time for people to ignore the fishwrap farce that the New York Times , Time magazine , and their ilk have become , and take responsibility for their thoughts and decisions .
Unfortunately , the people described here seem to have used those publications as giftwrap to beautify their preconceived notions .
As for the Japanese , it is time to start drawing conclusions from the fact that the anti-Nipponism of the Western media and its public intellectuals will always prevent them from getting it right .
Shelby Steele , part African - American , a former university professor , and current research fellow at the Hoover Institution , long ago wrote that one of the most important things he ever learned he heard during a conversation with an elderly Jewish woman .
“ No matter how hard you try , ” she told him , “ they ’re never going to love you . ”
It does n’t make any difference how pacific your behavior or generous your contributions have been for the past few generations .
Most media outlets and many influential people in the West have become so infected with anti-Nipponism that they are never going to love you .
If those conclusions you draw require that Japan choose a more independent course of action in the world , so be it .
As the Arabs say , the dogs bark , and the caravan moves on .
Afterwords :
* Anti-Nipponistic attitudes are apparent in more than just political or pop culture reporting .
Note how the AP handled their obituary for a prominent Japanese psychiatrist at the end of this recent post .
* I did n’t include Chinese or Korean examples in this post , though anti-Nipponism is of course present in those countries , too .
But Japan ’s relationships with the Han Chinese on the mainland and the people of the Korean Peninsula are deep and stretch back for millennia , so the current strand of anti-Nipponism in northeast Asia has a different meaning .
It is most often fomented or exacerbated by the political class for domestic advantage .
Westerners have no such excuse .
* This post does n’t begin to address the problem of Brazilian workers who either chose not to participate in the national pension system to begin with , or have not worked long enough in Japan ( 25 years ) to quality .
The Brazilian workers have been coming to Japan for more than 15 years , and those who came in their mid-40s are now hitting the age of 60 .
That ’s when many Japanese retire , and the unskilled Brazilian laborers working through employee seconding agencies that age are not going to be called as frequently for work .
As a result , they receive welfare payments and other benefits from the Japanese government .
In those areas with a concentration of these workers , the older ones who can no longer find employment are now starting to hang out during the day on street corners and park benches .
One can imagine the reaction of younger Japanese taxpayers who work for a living and are footing the bill .
Why should the Japanese government support the elderly citizens of another country with whom it has no pension reciprocity ?
That ’s Brazil ’s responsibility , is it not ?
( Japan does have agreements with the U.S. and Germany , among others . )
* As the New York Times article in particular hastened to assure us , some Japanese are also critical of their government ’s policy .
Higuchi Naoto , Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Tokushima , expressed his criticisms in this English - language article in the Asahi Shimbun .
While I disagree with Prof .
Higuchi ’s solution , he gets to the crux of the matter here :
I have interviewed more than 300 Japanese - South Americans , and according to my observation , those who graduated from unstable non-regular employment to regular work had one thing in common–strong Japanese - language skills … .
To survive in the labor market , Japanese language skills are more important than academic qualifications or work experience .
Yes .
However :
The majority of these have never been given the financial support or time to acquire Japanese language skills , without which they have virtually no chance of finding new work at a time when they need it most .
Disclaimer : I have a biased outlook in this matter .
Not one of my great - grandparents was a native speaker of English , yet all of those who reached the United States acquired English language skills .
( That includes two grandparents . )
All the men were originally unskilled laborers , and one grandfather had only one year of schooling in Russia .
Needless to say , none of them were given financial support or the time to acquire English - language skills .
They just went ahead and did it on their own .
One great - grandfather died at the age of 40 .
His five children quit school and went to work , and his German - born wife did the nurses ’ laundry for the nearby Johns Hopkins Hospital .
She studied English by reading the newspaper aloud every evening to her twin daughters and having them correct her pronunciation and explain unfamiliar words .
The article also has internal contradictions :
Some 400,000 Japanese - South Americans are said to live in the country .
One - third have already obtained permanent residence visas .
Many families have also taken out loans to buy homes …
In order to earn 300,000 yen a month from a job that pays 1,200 yen an hour , a worker needs to put in 250 hours a month .
With such long hours , it is almost impossible to spare time for studies .
It ’s also almost impossible to take out a home loan with that sort of income , either .
But as for language studies , you know what they say about there being a way if there ’s the will .
Turn on the TV or radio and voila !
Instant language instruction 24 hours a day .
Because there was no need for them to learn Japanese , there was also no motivation .
Living here is not motivation enough ?
Surely the reason they came was because they thought they would have more opportunities in Japan than in Brazil .
The opportunity to stay and make the most of those opportunities should be sufficient motivation for anyone .
The government should devise a learning program under which participants are paid aid equivalent to one year ’s unemployment benefits , allowing them to focus solely on the language … .
A system is needed to allow them to enroll in Japanese - language schools on a full - time basis for a year so that they may acquire communication skills , including reading and writing , needed to work in Japan .
In other words , the sociology professor thinks that people whose motivation was such that they were unable to use whatever education they received at home to acquire rudimentary job skills are going to be able to read and write Japanese after a one - year course , rather than a three - month course .
As someone who has spent the last 18 years working full - time as a Japanese - English translator after spending a considerable chunk of my life gaining Japanese - language fluency , and who also has taught English , I can only conclude that Prof.
Higuchi is a cockeyed optimist .
That ’s the basis of most Japanese complaints — the government did n’t do enough to help the nikkei assimilate .
But there are two serious problems with that suggestion .
First , it completely ignores the responsibility of the people themselves to take charge of their own lives .
Ten ha mizukara tasukuru mono wo tasuku — Heaven helps those who help themselves .
Second , it also completely ignores the lesson that everyone left of the political center has failed to learn , and alas , probably never will learn .
If it were so easy for governments to accomplish these things , socialism would have been a success .
A big thanks to the people who helped with this post .
You know who you are !
UPDATE : I just found out the program has been amended to allow for re-entry after three years .
In other words , it is almost identical in terms to a Spanish offer to unemployed immigrants for repatriation .
According to that article , more than 5,000 people accepted the offer .
Most of them are from other Spanish - speaking countries , so linguistic assimilation should not have been at issue .
The fertility rate in Spain , incidentally , is nearly the same as that of Japan .
Does this mean there will be a sudden outbreak of Spain - bashing or a let - up in anti-Nipponism from the Western elites ?
I think not .

A teenager 's foster mother alleges that the Department of Human Services forced the girl into an abortion , revealing a little - seen angle on the right to choose .

Regina Medina of Philly.com writes that the Philadelphia sixteen - year - old , whose name has not been made public , had a one - year - old daughter when she became pregnant again .
Her foster mother , who has also not been identified , says Department of Human Services caseworker Cynthia Brown told the teenager her children would be separated if she went through with the pregnancy .
The foster mother alleges that she wanted to carry her fetus to term , and that she only agreed to an abortion for fear of losing her other child .
The case has number of complications .
Most significantly , the foster mother is not fluent in English , and another source disputes her account , saying the girl was never unduly influenced .
What is clear , however , is that choice can be a fraught concept when a minor is pregnant , and especially when that minor is in the foster care system .
But regardless of her circumstances , the Philadelphia teen deserved control over her body .

We do n't always discuss money as an aspect of abortion politics , but it 's going to become ever more important as healthcare reform makes insurance for abortion hard to come by , and as Florida requires abortion - seeking women to pay for their own ultrasounds .
Economic hardship is going to force more women not to have abortions , but on the flip side , it 's possible that the economic concerns of the foster care system forced the Philadelphia teen to terminate .
The most disturbing interpretation of the case is that DHS did n't want to have to care for her second child .
If that 's not true — and let 's hope it 's not — it 's still the case that by virtue of her status as a foster child , the teen had more people around to potentially influence her decision .
DHS could use its resources to counsel and support pregnant foster children , whatever they choose to do — it should n't use them to take away teens ' choices .
One voice is absent from coverage of this story : that of the teen herself .
Medina was n't able to reach her , but really it's her perspective that 's the most important .
Yesterday Margaret Morganroth Gullette wrote poignantly in Women 's eNews of her mother 's decision to abort in order to devote her time , money , and energy to the two children she already had .
That 's an option everyone deserves to have , but it's also a choice everyone , even at a young age , deserves to make for herself .

Last weekend , Arcade Fire posted a postcard on their website , letting the world know that their new 12 " single would be out in " a couple of weeks . "
And now , we can hear a pair of tantalizingly short snippets of the two new songs , with vinyl pops and scratches added in , on the band 's website .
Check it out here .
From the look of things , the new single will indeed be titled " The Suburbs " b/w " Month of May " , as was rumored .
Judging by the few seconds we get to hear , " The Suburbs " sounds like a sunny lope , while " Month of May " sounds like a fairly ferocious punk / rockabilly rager , with Win Butler singing , " Gonna make a record in the month of May / When the violent wind blows the [ something ] away . "
Hey , May !
That 's now !

The White House directed BP to cut its use of chemical dispersants to break up the Louisiana oil slick by as much as 50 % yesterday , reflecting concerns that the clean - up of the spill could be worsening the economic disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Lisa Jackson , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , said the Obama administration wanted the oil company to scale back its use of chemicals on the water surface .
The order came amid increasing tension between the administration and the oil company about how to manage the oil on the ocean floor , more than a month after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
" I am recommending as strongly as we can that we absolutely minimise the use of dispersants and that we monitor as rigorously as we can , " she told a conference call with reporters touring Louisiana marshes contaminated by the oil .
She said she thought BP would be able to cut its use of chemicals to break up the spill by half or even 75 % by injecting smaller quantities underwater .
The directive is in line with a hardening of administration 's rhetoric against BP .
With thick brown sheets of crude oil now washing up on shore , the White House – as well as the oil company – is feeling the pressure of not stopping the leak .
Louisiana 's governor , Bobby Jindal , said he had warned the administration for days that the booms deployed by BP would not keep back the oil .
He has said some 65 miles of Louisiana 's coastline is affected , contaminating oyster beds and coating pelicans and sea turtles in oil .
Independent scientists and members of Congress have also been warning about BP 's heavy reliance on a dispersant called Corexit which is banned in the UK because it is harmful for marine life .
BP has poured more than 650,000 gallons of the chemical on to the spill .
Scientists told congressional hearings last week that Corexit was more toxic and less effective than other dispersants on the market .
Conservationists fear the chemical could further jeopardise already depleted stocks of fish such as Atlantic bluefin tuna or poison endangered species of turtle .
The Centre for Biological Diversity petitioned the Obama administration yesterday to protect the bluefin tuna as an endangered species .
The move would compel the administration to consider the consequences of offshore drilling before sanctioning any more oil rigs .
Jackson directed the EPA last week to seek out alternative chemicals within 24 hours , but admitted yesterday that BP had continued to use Corexit to break up the spill .
She and the coast guard commander , Mary Landry , defended the use of the chemical , arguing it had prevented a more devastating landfall of heavy crude .
But she admitted the longterm consequences of using enormous quantities of the chemical over such a long period of time were unresolved .
" It is clear to me that the science of dispersants has not in any way kept up with our ability to drill and use fossifl fuels and that is a huge disconnect , " she said .
Endangered Language Alliance Preserves Dying Languages in New York City
An organization called the Endangered Language Alliance is working to preserve dying languages in New York City .
New York City may be one of the only places in the world where you can always count on getting a knish at 3 AM if the urge strikes you .
But along with its diverse cuisine and culture , it ’s also home to some of the world ’s rarest languages .
There ’s Garifuna , a language passed on from African slaves who were shipwrecked in the Caribbean and then sent to Central America .
Vlashki , a language originating from the mountain regions of Croatia , is more common in New York than in its homeland .
And a small neighborhood in Flushing , Queens , is home to Ormuti , a rare language from the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Altogether , researchers estimate that the city is home to around 800 separate languages .
“ It is the capital of language density in the world , ” Daniel Kaufman , an adjunct professor of linguistics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York , told the New York Times .
“ We ’re sitting in an endangerment hot spot where we are surrounded by languages that are not going to be around even in 20 or 30 years . ”
Language is about more than just sound — it ’s cultural memory .
When a language dies , so does a piece of its people ’s history .
So the City University Graduate Center knew that something must be done to preserve the heritage of these endangered languages with just a few living speakers .
They ’ve created the Endangered Language Alliance to record and document endangered languages from all over the world .
And because so many obscure languages have a presence in New York , they wo n’t have to travel far to do it .
The researchers are even doing their part to help the languages remain alive in the community .
They ’ve asked Daowd I. Salih , a refugee from Darfur , to teach his tribal language , Massalit , to a New York University linguistics course .
With his help , the students are working to create a formal lexicography of the endangered tongue .
“ Language is identity , ” said Salih .
“ This is the land of opportunity , so these students can help us write this language instead of losing it . ”

El anuncio de que Petróleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) está por otorgar este año contratos a extranjeros , quienes podrán iniciar a finales de 2010 trabajos en el sector petrolero mexicano , por primera vez en más de siete décadas , demuestra que estas asignaciones a las trasnacionales , con plazos de hasta 25 años , ocurrirán gracias a la anticonstitucional reforma energética y al servilismo de la mayoría de legisladores a Estados Unidos , consideró el Comité Nacional de Estudios de la Energía ( CNEE ) , integrado por especialistas del sector energético .

Prominent Anti-Gay Preacher Secretly Hires Escort with “ 8 - inch ” Penis
The pictures on the Rentboy.com profile show a shirtless young man with delicate features , guileless eyes , and sun-kissed , hairless skin .
The profile touts his “ smooth , sweet , tight ass ” and “ perfectly built 8 inch cock ( uncut ) ” and explains he is “ sensual , ” “ wild , ” and “ up for anything ” — as long you ask first .
And as long as you pay .
On April 13 , the “ rent boy ” ( whom we ’ll call Lucien ) arrived at Miami International Airport on Iberian Airlines Flight 6123 , after a ten - day , fully subsidized trip to Europe .
He was soon followed out of customs by an old man with an atavistic mustache and a desperate blond comb-over , pushing an overburdened baggage cart .
That man was George Alan Rekers , of North Miami — the callboy ’s client and , as it happens , one of America ’s most prominent anti-gay activists .
Rekers , a Baptist minister who is a leading scholar for the Christian right , left the terminal with his gay escort , looking a bit discomfited when a picture of the two was snapped with a hot - pink digital camera .
Reached by New Times before a trip to Bermuda , Rekers said he learned Lucien was a prostitute only midway through their vacation .
“ I had surgery , ” Rekers said , “ and I ca n’t lift luggage .
That ’s why I hired him . ”
( Medical problems did n’t stop him from pushing the tottering baggage cart through MIA . )
Yet Rekers would n’t deny he met his slender , blond escort at Rentboy.com — which features homepage images of men in bondage and grainy videos of crotch - rubbing twinks — and Lucien confirmed it .
At the small western Miami townhome he shares with a roommate , a nervous Lucien expressed surprise when we told him that Rekers denied knowing about his line of work from the beginning .
“ He should ’ve been able to tell you that , ” he said , fidgeting and fixing his eyes on his knees .
“ But that ’s up to him . ”
For decades , George Alan Rekers has been a general in the culture wars , though his work has often been behind the scenes .
In 1983 , he and James Dobson , America ’s best - known homophobe , formed the Family Research Council , a D.C. - based , rabidly Christian , and vehemently anti-gay lobbying group that has become a standard - bearer of the nation ’s extreme right wing .
Its annual Values Summit is considered a litmus test for Republican presidential hopefuls , and Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter have spoken there .
( The Family Research Council would not comment about Rekers ’s Euro - trip . )
He has also influenced American government , serving in advisory roles with Congress , the White House , and the Department of Health and Human Services and testifying as a state ’s witness in favor of Florida ’s gay adoption ban .
A former research fellow at Harvard University and a distinguished professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of South Carolina , Rekers has published papers and books by the hundreds , with titles like Who Am I ? Lord and Growing Up Straight : What Families Should Know About Homosexuality .
“ While he keeps a low public profile , his fingerprints are on almost every anti-gay effort to demean and dehumanize LGBT people , ” says Wayne Besen , a gay rights advocate in New York City and the executive director of Truth Wins Out , which investigates the anti-gay movement .
“ His work is ubiquitously cited by lobby groups that work to deny equality to LGBT Americans .
Rekers has caused a great deal of harm to gay and lesbian individuals . ”
Rekers is a board member of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) , an organization that systematically attempts to turn gay people straight .
And the Huffington Post recently singled out Rekers as a member of the American College of Pediatricians — an official - sounding outfit in Gainesville that purveys lurid , youth - directed literature accusing gays of en masse coprophilia .
( In an email , the college ’s Lisa Hawkins wrote , “ ACPeds feels privileged to have a scholar of Dr. Rekers ‘ stature affiliated with our organization .
I am sure you will find Prof.
Rekers to be an immaculate clinician / scholar , and a warm human being . ” )
Rekers lectures worldwide , from Europe to the Middle East , on teen sexuality .
Yet during his ten - day sojourn with Lucien to London and Madrid , he had no lectures scheduled .
Both men deny having sex on the trip , and emails exchanged between the two before their jaunt are cautiously worded .
“ I ’d like to propose another trip to Rome , Italy , for a week or more , ” Rekers wrote in an email dated March 21 obtained by New Times .
“ This is so exciting to have a nice Travel Assistant and traveling companion !
Wow !
I ’m so glad I met you . ”
“ I called and talked to the reservation guy in London and reserved a room with two twin beds , ” Rekers wrote on March 26 .
“ Now that I ’m packed , tomorrow I ’ll work on completing my income tax return , ” Rekers wrote two days later .
“ Not fun …
But I ’ll just remind myself that the fun trip is coming soon . ”
In his interview with New Times , Lucien did n’t want to impugn his client , but he made it clear they met through Rentboy.com , which is the only website on which he advertises his services .
Neither Google nor any other search engine picks up individual Rentboy.com profiles , any more than they pick up individual profiles on eHarmony or Match.com .
You can not just happen upon one .
Everything you write — blog posts , marketing copy , emails , etc. — is a reflection of your professionalism , your communication skills and your experience .
Of course no one is perfect , but you still should want to give the best impression you can by writing with as few typos and grammatical errors as possible .
In an ideal situation , you will be able to have someone else proofread your writing for you , but that ’s not always possible .
Sometimes , it ’s necessary to self - edit .
Here are some tricks for proofreading your own writing so you can present the sharpest , most knowledgeable and best “ you ” through your words .
Make Your Own Shortcuts
We each have our own writing demons … words we frequently misspell , punctuation we misplace and phrases we misuse .
Start a list to keep track of mistakes you make repeatedly , with the correction right alongside it .
Not only will this give you one place to go for a quick error - check , but putting the list somewhere you can see it every day will help you remember the right way , first .
Get a Stylebook
Stylebooks are not just for professional writers ; they can be valuable tools for anyone writing just about anything .
There are several different writing styles ; pick one that feels best to you and use it as your frame of reference for all of your writing .
A stylebook also helps you write with consistency , and that can enhance your professionalism .
Read It Out Loud
Reading out loud is a great way to catch grammatical errors .
It ’s also a useful exercise for identifying locations for commas and other punctuation .
If wording sounds off to you when you read it out loud , it probably will to others , too .
Print and Read Backwards
This is a trick I learned in my college days when I worked in the publications office at the University .
Print out your writing , and read it backwards word - for - word ( it ’s helpful to use an envelope or other straight - edge tool to keep your place ) .
Forcing your eye to look at each word — out of sentence context — can help you catch errors you might otherwise miss .
Use Spelling and Grammar Checks
Spellcheckers are n’t perfect , but they can help you find common errors , or at least show you words and phrases that might have alternatives .
It ’s a good idea to run a check on everything you write before letting it loose .
Give
It a Rest
When you feel like you ’ve caught everything you can , give it a break and come back to it a few hours later with a fresh eye .
You might find errors or ideas for improving language that seemed perfect when you first wrote it .

Old fashioned values are often espoused as something we ’d like to aspire to , whether in our personal lives , or in business .
When a deal used to be sealed with a handshake , the world must have been grand .
Take a quick glance at advertisements from long ago , and those that are frightfully recent , and you can see how far society has come ( and in some cases , how short a distance ) .
From bogus remedies and health claims , to outright abusive and misogynistic images , here are 33 disturbing vintage advertisements we ’re glad are gone :
If only we lived in the past , when cigarettes were n’t bad for you , as proved by scientists and doctors alike !
Even Santa lit up a smoke on those long sleigh rides on Christmas Eve .
These are some of the most humorous ad examples , as they stand in such contrast with today ’s attitudes toward tobacco products .
( Images via pzrservices , ngc2632 , funnyphotos , breakupgirl )
Domestic abuse is a violation of any moral code , and not something that should be mocked , but it is especially inappropriate as the content for an ad campaign .
Some of these ads were not created that long ago , and it ’s startling to see how casually abuse and disrespect were celebrated with a wink and a smile .
Imagine living in an age where cigarettes and tape worms were touted as effective weight loss aids .
I ’m sure a lot of the bogus weight loss supplements we sell today are no more effective than a sugar pill , but I feel confident saying none of them were as outright ridiculous as intentionally infecting yourself with intestinal parasites .
( Images via popularwealth , saynotocrack , darkroastedblend , juicetheblog )
Children are quite effective when used in ad creatives , as who can resist the grin of a toddler ?
It ’s clearly taken marketing teams quite a while to come up with their current formulas , as these examples hit far from the mark .
In a society that likes to keep children innocent , it ’s interesting to see how different views used to be .
( Images via jezebel , hpg123 , patdollard , stephaniehillberry )
Housekeeping is unequivocally women ’s work ( or so these advertisements would have you believe ) .
What greater joy could a woman get from life than the crispness of a clean sheet on the bed , or surveying the shining counter - tops of her kitchen ?
I ’m quite certain women are glad to have shed these biases and such blatant misogynistic messages … but there ’s still a lot of progress to be made .
( Images via herodesignstudio , neatorama )
It ’s safe to say ad campaigns were not always incredibly sensitive .
Consumers today would have a fit if a store tried to classify their children as “ chubbies ” and child protection groups would get chills if they saw ad images that glorified the “ sexiness ” of innocence .
( Images via katnip , weirdomatic , boingboing , theretroblog )
The image of the smiling , happy go lucky kid next door with the gap toothed grin has been prevalent in ad copy for decades .
With so many ads being produced , some were bound to come off as strange .
Even the slightest angle can change a child ’s face from cherubic , to scary .
( Images via bakersfield , graphicmania )
Yet another example of a “ what were they thinking ? ” ad image , and strange medical remedies .
It ’s no wonder older generations are always trying to fatten their granchildren up , as plumpness was clearly a sign of good health and a robust disposition .
( Images via emilyswindowseat , midnighttoke , biancasunshine )
Women are supposed to submit to their husbands , and please them in every way possible .
It ’s important then , to be sure you keep yourself and your clothing in perfect repair , or you might lose his respect , and love .
This kind of messaging would be hilarious , it ’s so ridiculous , if these ads had never been real .
Since this is a glance into history , and not fiction , it just becomes disturbing .
( Images via pzrservices , fooffa , popularwealth )
It ’s interesting that their are n’t any ads about the guy spreading disease , or being “ good time guys ” , but , unfortunately , this is a bias that ’s still a very real presence in modern media .
World War II spurred a lot of safe sex advertising , out of the fear of the troops becoming infected with debilitating illnesses that would leave them unable to fight effectively .
Soldiers from four NATO countries , including the US , joined about 10,000 Russian troops for a massive military parade across Red Square on Sunday to mark the 65th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany .
This year 's Red Square parade was the first time foreigners have ever taken part in the march , an annual red banner and hammer - and - sickle festooned event that continues to evoke powerful emotions in the former USSR , which lost 27 - million people in World War II .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Chinese President Hu Jintao , and about two dozen other high - level foreign guests watched the parade from the same granite viewing stands , next the mausoleum of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin , formerly occupied by Communist leaders .
This year 's parade was the most elaborate since the collapse of the Soviet Union almost twenty years ago , featuring almost 200 tanks – including vintage wartime vehicles – mobile howitzers , anti-aircraft rockets , and giant intercontinental missiles rumbling across Red Square 's pink cobblestones , and followed by a thundering flyover by 150 modern warplanes and helicopters .
New weaponry
During the cold war , military parades were closely watched by Western intelligence agencies because they often were employed as a showcase for new weaponry .
The Kremlin did n't disappoint this year , rolling out six recently - developed hardware systems : the Pantsir - S1 and Buratino anti-aircraft rockets , the Topol - M intercontinental missile , and the Yak - 130 air trainer .
Military experts show particular interest in two new attack helicopters that were displayed in public for the first time , the Mi-28 – Russia 's answer to the Apache – and the exciting new Ka - 52 gunship .
Despite the sovietesque atmospherics , the main political theme of the event was historic reconciliation between Russia and its former cold war foes .
Medvedev : Peace is ' still fragile '
" Today , at the military parade , soldiers of Russia , of countries of the former Soviet Union , and of the Allied powers march together , in one column , which is evidence of our common readiness to defend peace , " Mr. Medvedev said in a Red Square address .
" Peace is still fragile and it is our duty to remember that wars do not start in an instant , " he said .
" It is only together that we shall be able to counter modern threats . "
Communist and nationalist politicians had denounced the invitation to NATO troops to take part in the parade , but a poll last week by the independent Levada Center in Moscow found that less than a third of Russians agreed with them , while 55 percent viewed the participation of the wartime allies favorably .
Another controversy swirled around a decision by Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov to include portraits of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin , who led the country through World War II , among the publicity materials for the Victory Day celebration .
The Russian government rescinded that decision , and no pictures of Mr. Stalin were visible around Red Square on Sunday , but the furore illustrates the ongoing sensitivity of many unresolved Soviet - era historical disputes in Russia .
The Voice of America quoted the commander of the participating American unit , Capt .
Matthew Strand , as saying that the experience of marching in Russia 's Victory Parade raised the level of camaraderie between NATO participants and their Russian counterparts .
Captain Strand told the VOA that his 90 - year - old grandfather was a US pilot during the war .
" Every time my grandpa meets a veteran from World War II , even if he does n't know him , the second he meets him , they automatically have something in common , " Strand said .
" And just by me having a grandfather that was in it , I have something in common with the veterans I meet here in Russia . "
Pittsburgh nun foils wallet theft with reprimand
PITTSBURGH -- A Pittsburgh thief turned out to be no match for a little nun with a commanding voice .
Sister Lynn Rettinger did n't even have to break out a ruler for a man who reached into an opened car window and stole a wallet Tuesday .
She just needed the tone of voice she 's used for nearly 50 years in Catholic schools .
After a teacher saw the man swipe the wallet , the 5 - foot - 3 principal of Sacred Heart Elementary School went outside and firmly told the man : " You need to give me what you have . "
The thief turned over the wallet , apologized and walked away .
Rettinger said she merely talked to him as she would to students when she knows they have something they should n't .
Police are still looking for the man .

VIEWPOINT
Margi Prideaux
New research is showing that whales and dolphins possess intelligence and culture more complex that we had previously assumed , says Margi Prideaux .
And , she argues , this raises anew the question of how we should relate to them - including whether it is ever right to hunt them .
Blinded by the limits of our own imagination , historically we have found it difficult to envisage another entity with capabilities that rival our own
Despite long held preconceptions of human pre-eminence , scientists are discovering sophisticated intelligence beyond the boundaries of our own species .
It may surprise us , but dolphins and whales have such qualities .
Is it possible that 2010 could be remembered as the year when we faced our insecurities and embraced other highly evolved species , with all the responsibility that entails ?
This year , which is set to be an eventful one , started with a physical clash between whalers and activists in the Southern Ocean .
Perhaps our unfulfilled anticipation of action on climate change late last year made us reach for progress somewhere else - namely biodiversity .
The confrontation between whalers and campaigners sparked a global debate about how we regard other species on the planet .
In this case , it was asked whether whales and dolphins exist as a resource for humans , or whether they have an inherent right to their life , their liberty and their home .
Meeting of minds
In February , the 2010 Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) addressed the unprecedented subject of " intelligence in dolphins : ethical and policy implications " .
The SeaWorld incident raised questions about keeping orcas in captivity A panel of three well - regarded academics discussed whether the emerging scientific knowledge about the cultural and cognitive processes of whales and dolphins should influence international policy decisions and ethical considerations for their treatment .
Their conclusions were that yes , it should .
Within days of the AAAS conference , a veteran animal trainer in the US drowned when a male orca dragged her underwater .
Surprisingly , there was not a media or public outcry against the whale itself .
Instead , attention was focused on the appropriateness of keeping this mighty , complex and intelligent species captive for human entertainment .
In March , the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) met to discuss the details of a " deal " about the future of whaling activities .
The global discussion then erupted into sharp debate , with some favouring a return to whaling , and others saying such a precedent should never again be set .
Governments in both camps suddenly found themselves under significant pressure from their constituencies , and the political dance for positions began .
Perhaps it is time for us to decide that we believe whales and dolphins do have a right to their lives , their liberty and the protection of their home and family
At the same time , The Cove - a documentary investigating the annual slaughter of more than 20,000 dolphins and porpoises around Japan - unexpectedly received the Academy Award for Best Documentary 2010 , mainstreaming another example of our need to confront our relationship with these species .
By the end of March , a Los Angeles restaurant was closing its doors as a self - imposed penalty for serving whalemeat .
In late April , an unprecedented US Congressional oversight hearing was held to review the education and conservation value of keeping marine mammals in captivity .
The hearing came about through a convergence of important events , including the orca incident , public uproar about the link between the dolphin drive hunts in Japan and the international zoo and aquaria industry , and a timely regulatory review process .
April also marked the second major oil spill in six months seriously to threaten habitats of whale and dolphin populations in different parts of the world .
Setting the agenda
With four eventful months behind us , we now look towards the IWC meeting in June where governments will formally consider the proposal that could usher in the return to whaling .
This meeting will , in some ways , conclude the six - month conversation and set the tone for our relationship with these animals for decades to come .
The future of whaling is on the menu at this year 's IWC meeting Will our consideration of whales and dolphins be based on numerical calculations of abundance , or will we recognise them as highly evolved mammals living in complex societies ?
The fact that discussion is even taking place indicates we are on the road towards a position of respect .
Many whale and dolphin researchers now agree that they are studying sophisticated , evolved intelligences , born of a differently constructed sense of self ; without necessarily needing to be an " intellect " directly comparable to ours .
We now understand that dolphins and whales , in various different ways , have distinct personalities and identities ; that they can think about the future , and have the innate ability to learn language .
Much of whale and dolphin behaviour is cultural , learned and passed down through generations .
They have complex decision - making and communications structures , and an independent evolution of social learning and cultural transmission appropriate to the radically different environment they live in .
Decision time Blinded by the limits of our own imagination , historically we have found it difficult to envisage another entity with capabilities that rival our own .
It has been our own insecurity that impedes our recognition of the impact of our actions on animals that society could otherwise regard as having moral significance .
In so many ways , they are as complex as we are .
Clashes in the Southern Ocean have stirred debate Acknowledging that at least some animals are " beyond use " brings forward implications spanning philosophy , law , science and policy .
However , the evidence suggests that a challenge to the status quo is the next logical step .
No -one is suggesting that whales and dolphins be granted a right to vote , to hold a driver 's licence , or to receive a free and fair education .
But in this short half - year we have had enough examples posed to evoke a deep and thoughtful global conversation about our collective moral compasses .
Perhaps it is time for us to decide that we believe whales and dolphins do have a right to their lives , their liberty and the protection of their home and family .
Or will we return to a world that accepts whaling ?
Will whales and dolphins , like the orca in the US marine park , continue to circle pools for our entertainment ?
The choice is ours to make .
Margi Prideaux is strategic policy director for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) International The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental issues running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Margi Prideaux ?
Do whales and dolphins display signs of sophisticated intelligence and complex culture ?
If so , should that change our relationship with them ?
In particular , does it proscribe hunting them and keeping them in captivity ?
Imagine for a moment if we as homosapiens had a more intelligent , natural predator that brutally slaughtered us for pleasure .
Would pro-whaling supporters like having a harpoon fired into them then being hacked into pieces while they are still conscious ?
Humankind has achieved many staggering accomplishments in the short time we have existed so far .
But they way we treat ourselves and other living creatures shows perfectly just how juvenile a species we are , and far we still have left to go .
The planet may end up being a very lonely place for our children ...
Ben , Aldershot Firstly , I do not doubt that dolphins and whales , like many other species , have very complex social structure and high ' intelligence ' .
' evolved ' intelligence simply means neural structure specialized toward a certain purpose , and two species do not necessarily share that purpose , even if they both have brains or are both mammals .
The purpose may also change over the course of evolution .
It is true that human intelligence is unique , as shows in our active modulation of our niche in the world .
But dolphin intelligence may as well be unique in other aspects .
Because our brains are different we may never know the full extent of their consciousness .
Their brains can do things our brain can't , for a start : alternate wakefulness of left and right side of the brain .
So to say ' intelligent or not ' is extremely simplistic .
Secondly , I would like to argue that ?' intelligence ' is a rather strange criterion for not killing an animal for food , and even if it were I struggle to imagine where the threshold would have to lie .
Third , if someone has a problem with whale and dolphin hunting they should , if they do not wish to be a hypocrite , condemn the hunting and slaughter of many other animals for food or other reasons , whether they believe the ' intelligence argument ' is ethically justified or not .

It 's ok , we 'll only hunt the stupid ones .
Alex , Tokyo , Japan
My hesrt is grieved and very saddened at the amount of effort people are going too to save the whales .
Yes I love animals and they portray an amazing creator .
Actually everything in this world displays such intricate detail and are masterpieces in design .
I would love to see this amazing effort of saving whales to be considered in saving HUMANS .
We seem to give a blind eye to the little lives that are aborted everyday .... the intricate masterpiece of a person so amazingly created .... just like you or I .
We do n't even blink at what we are actually doing .
the value we put on animals and creation far out weighs the value of human beings .
My heart is that we re-evaluate the importance of life and have an understanding that humans are meant to be valued and loved far above anything else .
Yes there needs to be a balance in the whaling industry but why does n't the government decide to put a stop to killing humans and find other stratergies in saving these lives instead of the easy option ?
Lewina Stewart , Toowoomba , Queensland , Australia
What troubles me is the inconstancy of variable standards -- do n't eat whales / dolphins / great apes because of their intelligence ; do n't eat dogs and cats and bunnies because they 're our companions , but wait , lots of folks eat dogs and bunnies ...
I hope that we can , as a step to a more compassionate world , at the very least recognize that perhaps the only true distinct quality about humans is that those of us who can afford to can make choices .
Choose to eat no animals at all .
Too radical ?
How about choose to recognize that some of the food we eat are living beings , treat them with compassion and kindness while alive , kill them " humanely , " and truly be grateful that they - - our fellow planet dwellers -- provide sustenance ?
I too am concerned about the endangered " intelligent " species .
But what about all the other not - so - intelligent ones ?
What about our own hypocrisy and arrogance in mandating what creatures should and should n't be eaten ?
How about some humility , gratitude and awe ?
Vita , Santa Rosa , Calif .
USA
We can't even treat our own kind with this level of respect so I do n't hold out a lot of hope for the Whales and Dolphins .
Kate , Adelaide , Australia I can't remember the last time I 've read such a load of namby - pamby , wooly - minded nonsense .
What evidence is there that they are as intelligent as us and that they feel pain and loss as greatly as we do ?
Incredibly simple creatures such as bees can give the illusion of intelligence whereas really they are just following a few basic hard - coded instructions in their tiny brains .
As for mammals , I believe that they feel pain and a few basic emotions such as fear but I think it is a huge leap to attribute them with conscious thought .
The truth is that none of us can know what goes on inside another mammal 's head but if we are happy to eat cows , pigs and sheep as I am , then what problem can we possibly have with cultures that like to eat whale meat ( provided it is from a non-endangered species ) ?
How would we like it if Hindus started using " direct action " to stop us eating beef ?
Ian Moore , Southampton , UK I would n't eat whales or dolphins - just as I would n't eat a Chimpanzee .
Billah , Albuquerque , NM , USA animals > humans
Stephanie , Fresno , CA What Margi Prideaux explains in this article is nothing new , it is something people who have had direct contact with or researched whales and dolphins , have known for a number of decades .
However it is until now that the global community begins to wake up from this dream that we humans are the only intelligent life form , and that intelligence is something that cannot be placed under just one label , " Human Intelligence " , there are different kinds of intelligence all molded by the environments that we were bron into , so obviously we cannot have the same capabilites , cetaceans who live in the great oceans and humans who live on land .
Hopefully if the global community does reach an agreement on stopping all whaleing , we will leave the dolphins and whales clean oceans to live in , for we know how well most humans take care of their planet .
Marcel Arvizu , Pasadena , California , U.S.A .
Every living creature , irrespective of usefulness or intelligence , has an irrefutable right to life , safety and freedom - from hunger , abuse and everything in between - humans have no right to decide who lives or who dies - and no rights or privileges greater than the other creatures , who share the planet with and sustain us .
It is the basis of the fine tuned , and complex web of life .
Aditi raychoudhury , Oakland , ca Whales and Dolphins may have rights , but what about the millions of krill , plankton and fish that Whale and Dolphin mindlessly slaughter every year in their selfish pursuit of not wanting to be hungry ?
Do n't those animals have rights , too ?!
Steve , Manchester I reckon there are many many human beings with less intelligence or culture than the average whale or dolphin .
Why not turn them into a source of protein ?
Nick , South Africa
I agree that whales / dolphins have an intellect beyond assumption .. but I 'm afraid I find its conclusion somewhat random .
Slavery - to return to something both human and ignored by the western world - was not justified on the basis of the slaves being ignorant .. in fact the Greek ideas surrounding the treatment of the Helots ( especially within Sparta ) were often centralised about the slavery of them being good for them .. it was treated as an educational process .
Of course , this is different .. we assume that they 're not learning off us and would be so much better in the wild etc etc
But I am afraid the logical conclusion is n't far from the Greek one .. all this will mean will be zoos renamed to ' nature reserves '.. which will simply be more space and the animals will likely be studied at an advanced level rather than simply there to swim circles .
William Slyfield , Derbyshire , England I completely agree with this article .
Underwater sonar , explosions and other devices have caused massive disruption and damage in ways we cannot begin to know .
Over fishing on an industrial scale has caused damage to bio-diversity and to the delicate eco-sytems of the oceans that the human race has little understanding of .
Drilling for oil and other fossil fuels has caused destruction and devastation on an enormous scale and it seems we will not stop until it has all run out and we become engineers of human and the biosphere 's destruction .
Humans - intelligent - I do n't think so !
Perhaps the other species do n't want us to understand what they are communicating .
Maybe it is n't very complimentary about us , and I for one would n't blame them !
Karen Varga , Nr Stratford on Avon , UK we are not gods and have a responsibility not only to all living creatures that we share this planet with but also the planet itself .
This should always be of prime importance as it supports all life - ours included .
Respect for living creatures is paramount .
sue corfield , shropshire , england I agree to a certain extnent , but at the end of the day , has it not always been survival of the fittest ?
If we had not evolved to this complxity , something else would of and it would treat us no differently , however at the same time I do think that as the most advanced species on the planet we do have some innate responsibility to care for other species , but nothing in this world is free , we cannot have it every way , and for anyone arguing that there is enough vegetables for us to eat , what gives them any less right to life than an animal
Harry Fuge , Portsmouth
I am very confused about animals life because some people says to save them and does 'nt allow to eat also but some in vice - versa , so i want to ask which decesion will be right and whom opinion we have to follow .
If you allow me to write some thing then I will write that what Allah ( God ) allowed to eat us , we have to use them for eat and what din't premit by Allah , take care them because he is our creature and he knows what is better for us and what is wrong .
Mohammad Shekaib Alam , Malaysia / India Quite frankly intellegence is irrelevant ( although how typical of the human race to assume no other living creature could ever have intellegence as ' superior ' as ours )
What this boils down to is saving creatures that were here long before us , before the human race 's ignorance and arrogance destroys everything !
One of the previous comment saying ' when was the last time a dolphin sent anyone to the moon ' backs up everything I said .
How dare anybody challenge our intellect hey ??
At the end of the day ALL species deserve their rightful place on earth irrespective of size , intellegence , beauty or any other category .
They also deserve the right to live in their NATURAL habitat , not kept in glorified swimming pools or tanks !
Good onh the whale at Orlando .... how many more before we realise ?
Melissa Tunmore , England
It appears that the main benficiary of hunting whales and other cetations is the gourmets of land of the rising sun .
It is time that we stamped on their deceiving excuse of ' research ' to hunt ANY of these creatures .
It is for GREED NOT NEED that this nation pushes for the free resumption of hunting these intelligent creatures .
The detention of these creatures in Aquaria where they are used to provide entertainment is totally abhorent too and should be banned .
The excuse of ' scientific research ' here is equally specious and hides the profiteering aspect of this practice .
These creatures are entitled to live free of human predation .
Ted Warren , Weston - super- mare , Somerset , England When Al from Stirling quoted Douglas Adams he is exactly right .
Notice there are n't any comments from Japan here .
We already know that their claim that their whaling is for ' scientific ' purposes is fictional .
Tribal whaling is a tough one though , but it 's very restricted , and it's not done with the hysterical enthusiam demonstrated by some countries .
Al , Seattle , Seattle , US You either eat meat or you do n't .
I think that it would take us humans a few thousand if not tens of thousands of years to evolve from our omnivorous roots and become herbivores .
In the mean time , individuals should have the right to determine which animals , if any , they choose to eat .
Conservation and animal cruelty would be a good yardstick on which to base these decisions , but beautiful and majestic ?
Give me a break .
When will those who are bent on imposing their arbitrary views and values upon others ever learn ?
It 's as if you cherish diversity in the non-human world but want only your view to prevail in the human .
Get a grip .
Hiroshi , Yokohama , Japan
An over - due decision .
Time to stop teaching them tricks , and start learning their language .
Kiteman , Eastest Anglia
I do always find these things interesting , as no one seems to mention that we are the top of the food chain and have the luxury of being able to make all the decision , its not whether they are abit more intellegent it the fact that through natural selection we are in charge quite frankly we can do what we want .
Thats not to mean just be nasty to everything .
In doing alot of these things we are not looking at the big picture which is us and our survival , a thriving echo system on land and in perticular in the oceans is massivley important as Star Trek relicators have n't been invented yet so we can't magic food out of thin air as yet .
This is the the same for fossils fuel and really all of our planets resources .
What we need is not for people to look at everything as individual topics and more in a sustanable globle plan to guarantee the continuation of our species , much of which suffers while we give money to protect wild life instead of our children .
Once we deal with that we will truely have the luxury of looking at these little individual topics properly , though on the road to doing it we may well find we have dealt with this sort of thing already .
John Perkins , Bournemouth
Humans just lost their hunting license whether we know it or not and their right to decide the outcome of a very grave extinction event unless an abrupt u-turn occurs in how the environment is treated happens and happens fast .
Baleen
Whales in the Arctic may live to close to 200yrs with some found with ivory and stone points in them not used since the 1880s .
Dolphins are washing ashore in Gulf of Mexico clearly destroyed in a horrible way by the affects of oil yet drilling is still set for Arctic waters .
People need to respect their elders and that includes creatures who have lived with their families and in conjunction with Nature long enough to see the affects of things like a third rise in ocean acidity .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado , USA all i can say is if humans are the intelligent species , then all liveing animals should be saved because we have the choice not to eat them , we have options , but pete tangradee who thinks because we are at the top of the food chain , we can eat everything below us , because we went the moon , is so narrow minded , we can survive on veg , nuts , etc , not anything that moves , the sea is in a terribble state of depletion , and it aint getting any better , and as for land animals , they are just in as bad a state
alan , edinburgh
The tone of the article was n't strong enough and came from an angle that suggested any other alternative than to leave them alone and respect their intelligence could even be conveived as okay .
Not okay !
The plan to close the HUMP restaurant came from me and a friend in DC .
I promoted The Cove all last year .
Can you choose your next breath , I can 't !
Dolphins can .
So how much more conscious are you when you decide in every moment to live or die .
Enough said .
And if it is n't enough show every child you ever meet The Cove and put an end to the slave trade and the accompanying slaughter once and for all .
The more children you show and the more children they show it to and the more we keep that going , the sooner this will all end .
In ancient Greece is was punishable by death to kill a dolphin .
They were known to save humans .
Consciously !
Have we gone backwards with our knowledge .
Let 's not do it again .
If you can get your ass down the IWC and make yourself seen and heard , it could make a difference .
One person can make a difference and if you do n't believe it 's you get behind someone else who is doing it the right way for the right purpose .
How do you know who is doing it the right way for the right purpose ?
You know because everything they say is about their message .
Not about them .
Not about what they are trying to sell !!!
Larry David Eudene , Malibu , CA Taste like chicken :-)
Michael Keilman , Raleigh , NC Keep spending billions of dollars searching for intelligent life in the cold dark recesses of the universe while we obliterate the life found on this planet .
Intelligent or not whales are an incredibly majestic creature as are dolphins and every living thing ...
This article definitely misses the point that many before me have made , that is we need to reevaluate our position as apex predator and the arrogance that is synonymous with it .
Colin Childers , USA / Planet Earth C'mon , now we start thinking about whales .
Why make them better than other animals ?
What makes you think a cow is a stupid machine of producing milk .
Our live is a race .
Eather we begin to live in harmony with a planet and all become vegetarians , or we go on killing .
The question is if we kill for eating , or for some ambitious goals , like having a snake leather bag or ivory necklace .
You know , choosing whales and dolphins to protect is like concidering if black / native americans / jews are people .
Irina , Russia
No animal life should be used as a resource by humans .
Utilize the plants which God gave us .
Kengele Haribuse , Philadelphia Pennsylvania USA
If things are to be based on intelligence then people should look at all animals , humans included .
If the average human IQ is 100 , then for every ' clever ' person at 130 + , there is also someone who is incapable of making informed decisions , these people are certainly less intelligent than a ' clever ' crow , dog or dolphin .
Yet I doubt whether this view will ever be accepted as , like many other sensible views , eg the world is overpopulated compared to resources and this is the ONLY real question to address for the future wellbeing of humanity , it does n't fit in with big business or our parochial governments .
Fred Dawlanen , Wigan UK I agree completely !
I have interacted with wild dolphins in several places around the world and so I know that it is not only their intelligence but their behavior towards us that merits their protection and recognition .
Wild dolphins are the rare - perhaps unique - example of a truly wild animal that , of its own accord , approaches humans for interaction and play without coercion or food reward .
They approach us with great trust when they initiate interactions as these .
We should return it in kind , behaving towards them in a way that honors that trust .
Wild dolphins are the exceptional creature that reaches out across the species divide to tell us that Nature is NOT uncaring of humans .
They show us that the Natural world offers a trusting playmate .
We should take that cue and stop treating dolphins - or any other animal as mere resources - but as the individuals they are .
As Prof White suggested at the AAAS conference mentioned in this article , we should consider cetaceans as non human ' persons !
Not only because of their intelligence and culture - but because of their regard toward us .
Chisa Hidaka , MD , New York City , NY , USA I definitely agree that whales and dolphins are too intelligent to be treated like they are , but also agree with most of the comments saying how hypocritical it is just to protect these ; pigs have been shown to be as intelligent as dogs and in some cases as intelligent as some of the great apes ; elephants suffer in captivity such as zoos and circuses because of their intelligence , memory and comple social lives etc. etc.
we need to protect all the animals which show such signs of intelligence , although beginning with whales and dolphins is a start .
Rachael Cooper , Preston , UK Pete from Tandragee : why does sending people to the moon give us an automatic right to kill species that do not send individuals to the moon ?

Hairy Dan , Brighton .
UK I agree with Ms. Prideaux but am skeptical that the cruelty that humans direct at animals and each other will decline noticeably before we inevitably destroy ourselves .
JP , Atlanta , GA , USA
Whilst dolphins , whales and other animals likely do not possess the same intelligence and self - awareness of most adult humans , it is easy to provide examples of humans ( e.g young children , severely mentally disabled people ) who we still give many basic rights to that many animals could be considered more intelligent than .
If you judge someone not by their actual attributes and abilities , but by a single irrelevant fact such as skin colour , sex , or sexuality , then you are racist , sexist , or homophobic .
If you judge someone not by their actual attributes and abilities but merely by being a member of a particular species , then you are being speciesist .
Matt , London , UK Yes , I whole - heartedly agree with Ms Prideaux .
Mark Farrell , Exeter , UK
It 's ironic that we should go into such depth regarding ethical conduct for whales and dolphins when we can't even take care of our selves .
Kristian Stewart , Cambridge , UK Whales and Dolphins - most people are lumping them together ... but they 're quite different .
Toothed whales ( incl dolphins , orcas and sperm whales ) are the intelligent ones , social with detailed communication .
Conversely baleen whales are majestic and huge but probably similar to domestic cattle in terms of intelligence .
THEY ARE NOT THE SAME .
Thylacine , Liverpool , UK I absolutely with Margi Prideaux .
It is 2010 , we have enough information that tells us that hunting these creatures is an abomination .
We also know that using them for entertainment is clearly NOT educational and serves only to make corporations richer on the suffering of these highly intelligent mammals .
Stop these atrocities against whale , leave them in the sea , do n't kill them , do n't use them for " research " and free the whales in captivity , now .
Sarah May Grunwald , Genzano di Roma Italy Neither ' resource ' or ' right ' but rather fellow citizens of spaceship Earth .
Leave them alone , and keep their oceans from being destroyed .
The ocean is a ' resource ' and it is ' right ' to keep it from being destroyed .
Kurt Olsen , Honolulu , HI " Capabilities that rival our own " ?
This is pure rubbish .
When was the last time the dolphins sent someone to the moon ?
People are generally the top of the food chain .
That means we are entitled to eat whatever is below us .
That 's what Mother Nature intended .
There is certainly an argument for preserving an endangered species , but dolphin and whales ' rights ?
Get a grip .
What 's next , a requirement for employers to hire a certain number of dolphins ?
Pete , Tandragee
The more we learn about whales and dolphins , the more the aquariums and whale shows sound to me like modern day bear - baiting .
Amy , Vancouver
Yes , fully agree .
Let 's change what is within our powers , I am ashamed what we will once tell our kids ...
Lorenz , Vienna / Austria
To take a side step in this discussion ( where I 'm glad to see that everyone agrees with Ms Prideaux ) , the more pressing need in cetacean conservation is the need to protect their habitat and food sources .
We 've known for some time now that fish stocks have dwindled to dangerously low levels , and that the marine food chain is collapsing .
Just think of the impact on the cetaceans - and other marine mammals - if fish , krill etc are depleted entirely by mid-21st century as many scientists ( and the UN , finally ! ) predict .
It 's not only time to stop whaling and keeping cetaceans in captivity , more importantly it 's the time that each of us change our eating habits and leave the few remaining fish to the marine predators .
Joanna , The Netherlands Ahah !
so now we question whether it is right to abuse / hunt / capture / eat intelligent / social creatures .
I know what we could do - we could devise a set of IQ tests for creatures and if they fail we could abuse / hunt / capture / eat them with a clear conscience .
If they pass we must endeavour to learn their language and apologise for past wrongs and then apologise for using the seas as out dustbins .... hmm , that should do the trick ..... or we could simply learn to respect all of our fellow creatures ( yes we are nothing more than creatures ourselves ) look after our shared planet and stop making ridiculous points based on how much like us certain creatures are and how that merits our good will .
Mr Underhill , Countryside I agree with MArgi Prideaux .
I think , we should end up with human arrogance and ignorance !
Why shouldn´t there be other creatures with intelligence ?
Hopefully people of IWC stop thinking about killing ...
S. Gobel , Berlin , Germany I 'd like to agree with Ms. Prideaux , but the evidence so far is not so compelling .
Have n't read this article yet , but most whale intelligence papers have been thin on substance , long on wishful thinking .
Conservation issues alone should be sufficient to protect whales , regardless of their mental capacities .
G.Curt Fiedler , Tokyo , Japan
I just wonder how disturbed we have made these animals .
What are the last cries they scream out when brutally slaughtered ...
Riikka Ketola , Turku , Finland
This conversation is absurd .
Not because I believe that we should be slaughtering whales and dolphins ... I do n't .
But the premise that inteligence ( or how cute , or how cuddly , or how whatever ) should be the criteria used to decide which of the creatures on this planet are deserving of " special " protections .
A dolphin is no more intrinsically deserving of life than a dog , goat , guppie , amoeba , carrot , radish , stinging nettle , or human ( etc , etc , etc ) .
Living Beings all require the death of other Living Beings for their own continued existence .
The moral / ethical question should be is it strictly necesary for this creature to die for me to continue to live .
Until we begin to address this fundamental question , we 're just blowin smoke .
Steve Garrison , Bellingham USA
This article has absolutely ZERO evidence about the intelligence of whales or dolphins .
You 've taken a question that can be addressed in one sentence , and dressed it up to take an entire article .
Lazy journalism at its best .
How about some FACTS ?
Brett M , Phoenix , AZ , USA
Whilst I agree with Margi Prideaux and the fundamentals that Whales & Dolphins should be treated as sentinel beings as they possess the ability of self - recognition and to live in complex family structures .
I could dream of nothing better than 2010 being the year we finally woke up to the fact that we are not alone here on Earth , that there are other intelligent lifeforms right here already .
The reality of the fact is that the Japanese will be going south again to conduct their " research " , whilst their fellow brothers are slaughtering dolphins in Taiji .
The Norweigians and Icelandic fleets will set sail and sadly most of the worlds population will sit back and comment on how bad it is without actually standing up and doing something about it .
Gary Stokes , Hong Kong
Why should we protect just those animals who are considered " beautiful " and " majestic " ?
They are not the animals who feel pain , suffering , and loss .
Yet they are the ones everybody rushes to protect .
Has anyone suggested we treat pigs with the dignity their intelligence deserves ?
Not recently at least .
No one has jumped on the band wagon to protect the " ugly " animals .
Its rather hypocritical if you ask me .
I am not advocating we stop eating animals , I enjoy bacon as much as the next person .
What needs to happen is regulation .
Oh what a dirty word , regulation .
Hunting licenses and quotas are a strong way to insure over - hunting does not happen , but still allows for people to eat the animals they chose .
Alexis Lund , Glendive , Montana , USA I m a marine scientist who has been engaged with the business of the IWC for 60 years .
I entirely agree with all Margi 's points .
Unfortunately nwhat is happening now therein promises to put us back many years to the time of no science , whales are just things to be mined .
Sidney Holt , Paciano ( PG ) , Italy Putting this type of animals rights chicanery into the category of " environmental " issues or any sort of scientific category is what makes it difficult for people to take real environmental issues , like climate change , seriously .
Ron , Bristol
Why stop with whales and dolphins ?
What about Apes , cattle , elephants , or crows ?
Does an animal need to have so - called ' intelligence ' for humans to assume ethical standards of conduct towards it ?
Then what about frogs ?
Let there be intelligent whales and dolphins if it helps to save whales and dolphins .
But let intelligent humans realize that intelligence is narrowly defined and of dubious value in assessing our conduct toward any form of life .
Shermin de Silva , U.S.A. / Sri Lanka
Remarkable studies have been done by John Lilly in in Man and Dolphins ; and The Mind of Dolphins .
Carl Sagan wrote in The Dragons of Eden ( Speculation on the evolution of Human Intelligence ) , about the brain to body weight ratios that determine intelligence .
Cetations have had a greater brain to body weight ratios for 70 million years .
Homosapiens = Us ? at best two thousand years .
Societal intellects tell us ; where are their libraries ? , architecture , and museums , and that it is anthropomorphic to think of them as willfully intelligent creatures because they have happen to evolve in a different medium , and are perfectly suited as sophisticated communicators and phycicists using echolocation as a actual tool and as communication in an aqueous environment .
Their harmonious evolution has left them using their gift as a tool for development , and survial rather than for destruction .
Who in the hell do we think we are , determining once again what form of existence is progress and which will prevail .
mark hamilton , san diego ca usa
We still have a long way to go in our treatment of other humans .
Sam , Hilo , Hawai'i
Yes I completely agree with Margi , there is no doubt in my mind that whales and dolphins are intelligent and majestic .
This is true for all animals , and we as humans have no right to exploit these beautiful creatures to the point of extinction just to make a quick buck .
I think there are cultures out there who do not see the natural world with the respect it deserves and that is a scary thought .
I think the other issue is gutless governments refusing to take a stand on these issues because they are scared it will be bad for trade or the economy , while on the other hand saying they are dedicated to climate change ... do they not understand without a healthy ocean , you cannot have a healthy world ... its all related , and it will come back to bite us when we do nothing .
Nature will eventually win , and we will lose ... and we will have deserved it .
Gemma Thornton , Sydney , Australia Agree !
Yes , they display sentience , sapience , and cultural traditions !
I believe our relationship with them IS changing ...
I am HOPING that it changes fast enough globally wide to allow a shared path to the future .
In particular : hunting , imprisoning , eating , isolating , degrading , ... , forcing them to perform for our entertainment , ... , separating them from their families , ... , is just WRONG !
osmia , Sunny Okanagan , BC , Canada
I would dearly love to believe that there are reasoning , communicating intelligent beings outside our own species , right here on Earth , and to extend them every legal protection .
However : it is scientifically inaccurate to credit all whale & dolphin species with the same high intelligence ( equal or even superior to humans ) , and with complex societies and cultures .
Despite decades of study , nobody has managed to translate any cetacean vocalisations into human language , or to prove that their songs have much greater information content than those of birds .
The largest whales , for one thing , have a grazing lifestyle - feeding on fish or krill as cattle feed on grass - which gives little evolutionary pressure for the development of advanced minds .
Evolution does not build in excess .
Toothed whales , especially dolphins , have a more intellectually demanding way of life , as did our primitive ancestors .
If they have evolved bonafide language and a sense of history , though , would they not have learned by now to avoid the locations where they are regularly slaughtered , such as Japan ?
Nicholas Wordsworth , Leeming , UK
Not only do I agree , but I think her sentiments should be applied more liberally to all animals .
It is clear that cows , pigs , turkeys and chickens and fish also have intelligence , rich family lives and complex social structures .
All animals should be protected from cruelty and the threat of being turned into food .
Garrett Mize , Austin , TX USA Certain species of whales had a near global communication system ( because their speech in low frequencies travels very well underwater ) before we even existed as modern humans .
Millions of years ago if intelligent life came to this planet and wanted to speak to the dominant intelligence it would have been Cetaceans , not our ancestors , they would want to speak to .
Currently we can not decipher most of how Cetaceans communicate .
This leads me to believe that their is major advancements in the understanding of their grammar we have left to figure out .
Is it a geometric form of grammar like sign language instead of a temporal form like our vocal languages , or something even less intuitive ?
Considering how specialized our brains our for communication , and that we 've started to crack the vocabulary of other more human like species , I would consider it a very tragic loss if we could never understand what whale songs mean .
Athen Ananda , LostInThought Nobody has the right to kill these majestic , intelligent animals , yes , but then what gives us the right to kill other animals , such as cows and pigs , for similar purposes ?
The Japanese eat whales , like Westerners eat red meat .
The Japanese kill whales , just like the Westerners slaughter their farm animals .
So the level of intelligence of these animals allows us to decide which animals can be killed and which cannot ?
Stop killing animals for food .
It 's not like we live in such harsh conditions that prevent us from growing vegetables for us to eat .
We 're eating meat for luxury .
We wo n't die not eating meat .
It 's definitely right to be against whaling , but right now we are very much the hypocrite .
Perhaps once we eradicate all cruelty of animals on our side , we can start poking our heads into other societies with more pride and righteous purpose .
Kaoru Kodama , London , UK
Those who support whaling have much in common with the conclusions to be drawn from this article .
Both are no -brainers !
Great to see WDCS going from strength to strength and shame on those others within the NGO community who are reportedly negotiating a deal to allow SOME whaling .
Just what gives YOU the right to condone the brutal death of even a single animal ?
Finally , do n't forget the porpoises guys .
always the forgotten member of the family !
Nic Davies , Isle of Mull , Scotland Yes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tyler Marie , Lacey WA
If the recent and even the past advances in zoology have shown us anything it is that our concepts of animals and their levels of intelligence can be proved wrong .
Recent studies have shown advanced tool use in from the great apes , i.e the use of spears by chimpanzees in Senegal , the fact that dolphins are capable of language and even names , as well as emotion .
In short we can not look upon life on earth in the black and white terms of humanity , we look upon ourselves as a basis to compare other species .
If they are not human they are of no consequence , as a species we are unique yet we have to acknowledge that other intelligent species are also uniqie .
The same yet differnt in ways beyond explaination .
Absolutely we should treat these beings with the respect that they deserve , as we are ourselves would to be treated , within reason .
Aaron Mulhern , Belfast I agree .
I think is a shame we even have to argue about giving animals their right to live .
It is obvious they have the right to live in their ecosystems , and it is us who have to adapt to it .
I do n't mean this in an extreme way of saying , but in a way that we have n't for decades , shown any respect to animals , and neither for life itself .
This happens even with the forests .
I think we should be re-educated in this matter and we should learn that all kinds of life are to be loved and respected !
I have always found hard to believe that people go to jail because the murder other people , but what about those who kill animals and trees ?
are n't they also killing a life ?
That 's just my point of view , but I think is should be important that life is consider no matter in which way , it is what it is : LIFE .
Aryana , Buenos Aires , Argentina
We just need more corn , wheat , etc. , crops .
The complexities of measuring intelligence are an exercise in avoidance .
Less rapaciousness is in order , in so many ways .
habrow2 , petaluma , cal. , usa Humans are the least intelligent form of life on this planet , pretty soon we will realize this .
Dolphins or any other form of life does n't care what we " think " .
They 're only thoughts , and in actuality is what seperates us from life .
lgndsgn , Plano , US I find it ironic that , we look for life / intelligence amongst the stars , but , we can't see it on our own planet .
Even , as we see that intelligence enjoys the joke of the slash zone as much as the audience .
( Yes , I was soaked at marine wold . )
SyD Standen , Calgary , Alberta , Canada Don't all things suffer ?
Why should any animal have to pass an IQ test to be able to join our ' club ' ( as if being human exempts anyone or anything from human cruelty ) ?
How do we know that ' dumb ' animals do n't suffer as much as a whale or dolphin or human baby ?
Why not be healthier , help the planet , stop consuming animals and stop abusing them in the name of ' science ' and other pursuits which help rationalize our bestial behaviour ?
John Olson , San Francisco USA
Let me start by saying that I do not advocate the killing of whales .
However , how does one decide which animals should not be killed ?
I realize that many would say that the answer is none , and that it is never OK to kill another living species .
But Prideaux suggests that the high intelligence of cetaceans is reason enough for us to protect them .
As others have referenced , what about monkeys ?
How about pigs , which seem like feeling animals .
It seems plausible to say that all animals experience pain .
With that said , we must advocate one way or the other .
Either , it 's fair game to kill any animal , or it's never OK in any circumstance .
Robert Mills , Rigmarole , Washington
Of course , I totally agree with Margi Prideaux .
Whales and dolphins truly are sophisticated evolved sentient beings .
We have to get over speciesism paradigm that recognise human species as the " superior " And I give you this Alice Wlaker quote : " The animals of the world exist for their own reasons .
They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white , or women created for men . "
Pablo Cubos , Ciudad de México , México Animals as a whole are a lot more intelligent than humans give them credit for , a lot of this appears to be because the animal scientists who look at animal behaviour have never owned a pet , if they had they 'ed soon realise how intelligent they were and that they have similar emotions to humans .
I have a dog that uses mirrors to keep an eye on me to see what I 'm doing when she is n't looking directly at me .
Stephen , St. Ives , England I do agree that dolphins & whales have high intelligence and should be respected .
I doubt they are the only species whose intelligence we have severely underestimated .
With that said , I see a mentality that ALL life should be treated with respect .
I think that 's a great mentality to have , but it 's not exactly functional .
I 'd like to point out that the food chain is a fundamental part of Earth life .
Life can't continue to exist without death .
We are omnivores .
We eat a wide variety of plants and animals and our variety in diet has played a key role in the survival of our species .
Killing for food is necessary and you and I are alive because of it .
So , yes .
Let 's try to be as respectful of other creatures ( especially intelligent ones ) as is humanly possible .
But life and death are inextricably connected and that 's not something we can change .
Such is Earth .
Deborah ,
The questioning about whether we should classify them as sentient and therefore stop hunting them is fairly ridiculous , since we consider ourselves sentient and spend billions of dollars hunting each other .
Wayne , Providence US
It is obvious that whales and dolphins are intelligent .
It is also obvious that many humans are not intelligent , yes they have the manual dexterity to physically pick things up , like a pint glass or TV remote , but the average human does not possess discriminate thought or the ability to take action .
mr Philips ,
Whaling is the stuborn residue of times long gone when humans were fewer and struggled to survive in competition with other species .
Now that our numbers have increased , we are responsible for the survival of other species .
Some of us even recognize all species are GOD blessed .
Camina Tripodi , Arroyo Grande California USA
The only ones who can disagree with this report are the greed people who only ever think of profit ( perhaps they are all Ferengi ) .
These people who still want to hunt , kill and capture these creatures are the true morons of the human race and I wonder if they even have any self respect as they certainly do not have it for anything else .
Michael McIver , Hastings
England we do n't need to search for life on other planets when we already share our own with so many as yet , little understood other amazing species .
what an excellent & insightful article .
katie sabry , limassol , cyprus Brilliantly written article !
It shows how much has been going on in the past few months .
It brings hope to see our attitudes towards these amazing animals changing .
A crucial time has arrived in which difficult decisions need to be made .
Starting in June with the IWC meeting .
It would be a disgrace for humanity if the whaling ban was lifted .
Let 's keep making our voices heard for whales and dolphins and their ethical treatment .
A few weeks ago I had the honour of seeing hundreds of dolphins and whales in the wild .
We need to look after them , we need to respect them , we need to let them be and be free !
May this indeed be the year in which everything changes for good for whales and dolphins !!
Carina Vonk , UK
Is n't it about time for people to start to appreciate the intelligence and importance of these amazing animals .
The idea of keeping marine mammals in captivity is abhorent , and is just another example of the arrogance and cruelty of the human race , there is no educational value to be gained and is purely a money generating excercise .
I hope that in some parallel universe humans are taken from their home and put in a tiny room , kept there for the rest of their lives and made to do tricks by cestacian trainers ( who will probably say they really love those in their custody ) .
Anyone who has been lucky enough to observe whales and dolphins in the wild undoubtly are aware of this higher intelligence these animals posess , and their right to be free .
Everyone should watch " The Cove " and it should be put onto the school curriculum .
Tony Bright , Wells , England
With whales and dolphins exhibiting an intelligence that is comparable to ours , it makes sense that we should respect their habitat and their right to live .
Regardless of the intelligence of a species , humans can be responsible for either the destruction or survival of any species on earth .
It is our responsibility , as the dominant species on earth , to protect wildlife regardless of their intelligence .
The fact that whales and dolphins are so complex intellectually only furthers our incentives to protect their kind .
Aric , Brussels , Belgium
Why would be that only intelligent animals should be treated in this way ?
There is no point in saving these animals if we are only to continue plundering the sea of all natural resources and fish stocks .
Surely we need to take a long hard look at our actions as a species and respect and treat all the other animals and plants that share this planet with more respect , after all , it is no more out planet than theres , a natural requires a certain balance to exist .
There is no doubt that these majestic creatures should be treated with more respect that getting them to jump through hoops , but sadly , the same could be said about a much much wider group of animals .
Scott Hadden , Cheshire , UK Agreed , totally !
Rahul , Chennai & India
To fully appreciate the extent of dolphin and whale intelligence , merely look at an MRI of their brain .
As sophisticated and large ( if not more so ! ) than a human brain .
Ryan , US Disagree .
And good luck telling everyone that it 's OK to only eat animals that you consider " stupid " .
timmy ,
The justification for hunting Dolphins and Whales becomes weaker and weaker the more research that is done into the affair .
It is disgusting that in this day and age of reason and understanding such primitive , unwarranted and barbaric practises continue .
Cetacean meat serves no purpose , is often sold at a loss rather than a profit , is not sustainable and most right thinking nations DO NOT WANT IT .
Kurt Wylde , Brighton Rather than commenting on the article itself this comment is more in response to the above comments , which I agree with about protecting both species , I would like to ask exactly what qualifies Whales and Dolphins as having " culture " comparable to humans ?
Even if you rightly accept that such creatures exist in sophisticated societies you would still have to massively reduce the complexity and intelligence of human culture to make it comparable to whales and dolphins .
Does anyone making such comments as above have access to a dictionary or even a basic understanding of humanity and its magnificent achievements ?
Does empathy and understanding of other species mean we have to demean our own ?
Whether you like it or not , here 's a unavoidable truth : whales , dolphins and the other great apes are inferior to us , in culture ( reduce the meaning of that word all you like ) and intelligence .
Before anyone gets upset , really read what I just said : protect and cherish other species as other wonderful beings .
But stop demeaning our own species in order to do so .
cynicalpete , I have to say that I agree .
We should release these animals and our dependence upon them .
Dolphins have been known to save our lives , and all hunting of them and whales should cease .
Dawn , Columbus , Ga , Usa I once was blessed with a dolphin encounter .
I was panned by the so called " experts " for this very evident beach meeting in Cornwall .
The animal showed intelligence , fear , regard - a whole string of emotions .
He , for " he " became evident - related to my dog quite happily .
This is an intelligent creature .
There is absolutely no basis to begin to think of killing any of these beings .
They have no exceptional food or other value in any way .
Like us , they have a right to life .
Nature put them on the earth for a purpose .
We need to respect that .
John Osborne , La Houssiere , France Being kept in captivity is one thing , what about the slaughter of Calderon Dolphins in Denmark .
A display of human behaviour at its finest .
How on earth such barbaric activity is allowed to continue quite simply makes me sick to my stomach .
S W , cheltenham
Whilst a dolphin's or whale 's frame of reference is clearly different to our land based view of the world , they are clearly right up there in the pecking order of intelligence .
Douglas Adam 's comical view is rather close to the truth .
Hunting is obviously wrong and captivity highly dubious unless it becomes absolutely necessary for conservation .
I look forward to the day when we can not only translate between human languages but we can effect communication of sorts between species .
We have got some way there with African Grey 's and chimps - when we make that breakthrough with cetaceans they can give the IWC a piece of their mind .
AP , Tunbridge Wells , UK
The debate on whether cetaceans are intelligent is old , age old .
Just how intelligent or comparable to us is debatable , honestly I really do n't think any animal is on a par with human intelligence and comparing them , to me , only seems like another effort to use propaganda that can relate to everyone .
I really do n't think they are any more intelligent that pigs , elephants , dogs etc .
Although this debate has achieved much progress in public opinion and succeeded in bringing the issue to everyone around the globe , it is still very much a matter of simple economics and complex cultural identity .
Combatting the problem on these battle grounds to me , seems like it might lead to more permanent measures being taken .
We can stop the entertainment industry from using cetaceans for vulgar profit by simply boycotting them , but whaling escapes this particular domain .
So ... yes I agree they are intelligent , but I honestly believe they are not on a par with humans , however should they be hunted ?
There are many arguments of a technical nature and in the area of consumer health that I think would be far more useful in this next stage of whale conservation and protection .
Benjamin Clarke , Santiago Chile
Only the naive can thing that cetaceans , along with many other species , lack intelligence and culture .
Unfortunately until the great majority of human leaders start looking outside of their boxes and truly see a world as diverse as ours , possibly the only one in the universe , will other life forms be saved .
We are still a billion miles from sustainability .
Cetaceans should not be hunted , but then neither should we be hunting their food to extinction either .
Wolves have an incredible complex level of culture and intelligence , so do all the apes , not just the big ones .
There are just so many examples yet humans continually hunt and maim other animals or slash and burn our forests .
' We have to live somehow ' , is the message from the poor people of the world and ' We have to turn a profit ' from the rich people .
The only thing we can do to live really sustainably is to start to depopulate this planet .
Sounds horrible does n't it .
If we do n't do it voluntarily one thing is certain - wars or natural catastrophes will do it for us ventually .
Steve , Warlingham , UK yes
Don , Holland A lot of thanks to Margi Prideaux .
I would like to say , every individual cetacean has the right to life .
No cetacean should be held in captivity or servitude ; be subject to cruel treatment ; or be removed from their natural environment .
All cetaceans have the right to freedom of movement and residence within their natural environment .
Engr Salam , Kalai , Bangladesh Sadly , I think Ms. Prideaux is unrealistically optimistic .
If the discovery that Chimpanzees , our closest relatives , use tools and are smarter than we thought did not stop the bushmeat trade , medical research , or their captivity , I find it hard to imagine that cetaceans will be treated much better .
Dom , Washington , DC Whales and dolphins have very complex social structures and strong familial bonds .
They use their sonar to navigate , to forage for live fish , and to communicate - it is a rich sensorial part of their lives .
In a concrete tank , they have no use for sonar as they are fed dead fish at the surface of the water , the sonar reverberates back to them in an unnatural manner , and they 're not going anywhere ....
So their sonar , much akin to a human 's use of sight and hearing , is typically greatly diminished in captivity and replaced with stress - induced , aberrant , maladaptive behaviors , not seen in free whales and dolphins .
And the irony is that in the captive situation , you have people using rudimentary sign language to " teach " the whales and dolphins silly tricks for their meals when it is highly likely that they have so much more to teach us if we would only allow them , but to do that we would have to allow them their freedom first .
So you ask if I agree with Ms. Prideaux ?
Absolutely .
Thank you for your time .
Nora Sinkankas , Bethany , Oklahoma United States of America
We continue to demean ourselves and torture whales and dolphins by our callous treatment of them .
Whaling must stop , culls of dolphins in the name of tradition must stop , only subsistence catches should be allowed as long as that is truly what they are .
These intelligent creatures deserve better from us than a slow , painful death , or being kept in the equivalent of a bathtub to provide so - called entertainment for ignorant people .
Susan Platter , Swindon , Wiltshire , England .
It makes sense that other animals have evolved an intelligence of their own .
In some ways these creatures have more sense than us humans as they do n't squander their environments to the point that they are on the verge of collapse .
I hope these ideas will extend to our closest living ancestors , chimpanzees , gorillas and other great apes .
They too are hunted close to extinction and have their habitat destroyed by humans .
Caroline , Kirkcaldy , Scotland I absolutely agree with Margi Prideaux .
Whales and dolphins are highly evolved mammals with a sophisticated intelligence .
In anything , hunting and keeping them in captivity should make us question our own intelligence ... not to mention our self - proclaimed right to the moral high ground .
Can I just add that these view points should only apply to whales and dolphins but to all life .
It is a sad truth that the vast majority people do not waste a single thought on the welfare for any other life forms on our planet , as exemplified by our attitude towards the production of farm animals for food .
Ilse Hendriks , Edenbridge
What gives us the right to hunt and kill these majestic , inteligent , sociable animals ?
Until enough of us stand up and say ' Not in my name ' then it will continue .
Until enough of us realise eating them or using them for our own pleasure just because we ' have always done so 'is n't a good enough reason , then it will continue .
Until enough of us tell our political leaders we do n't want this to go on , it will continue .
Continue until nothing is left , the seas are void of whale , dolphin and any fish come to that .
People used to say " It 's good to beat a child , they learn right from wrong , it does them no harm .
Do we still beat children ?
No .
Because someone said " This is n't right "
Do we kill dolphins and whales for ' scientific purposes ' yes , until we all say " Stop , this is n't right " .
Ian , Wolverhampton
The great apes are far closer to us and display more recognisable qualities we consider to be sentient , and yet after decades of abuse we 're still no closer to respecting their right to life , so what hope do the marine mammals have ?
Simon , We ( as a species ) measure our existence by the numbers of fellow humans we can " scr*w over " .
There was still cannibalism going on into the middle of the last century .
Irrespective of how intelligent etc .
Cetaceans are , our behaviour is even less likely to be curbed when a different species is involved .
Individually , humanity has some shining examples of conscious good behaviour .
Collectively , we deserve everything that 's coming to us .
Peter , London UK
Yes !
David Edwarsd , Aberdare
Im just surprised that this has taken so long .
Im not really understanding what 's so difficult about this way of thinking , I mean , Im no hippy , but all things on this planet have the right to their own lives .
Im not of the belief that all things on this planet are here to serve humans , the mighty being .
Everyone needs to get off their high horse .
It 's really barbaric .
Im fully of the opinion that these majestic beings should have their undisturbed place in this world .
So should everything else .
Not a difficult concept , but refused by the greedy and the ignorant .
Im in favour of having these people in captivity rather , I 'd be interested to see how they feel afterwards .
Deesha Singh , Johannesburg , South Africa
I have believed for many years , especially after learning to scuba that all sea life was precious with reefs being exploited beyond the breaking point .
I had undestood from various dolphin programs that they were about as intelligent as dogs .
My own thoughts were that they were closer to our own intelect , but with greatly expanded senses into the sonic snd bioelectric arena .
What seems to be becoming increasingly obvious with our knowledge of cetaceans becoming more complete , is that these beings are not our equal , but excede us in some respects .
What awful scenes we see in this light are the slaugter of whales and dolphins by Japanese Whalers and Fishermen in most of the feeding grounds for these species .
We can surely find alternative sources for the products we get from whaling .
Let us campaign at world government level for a change to the existing policies .
Bring it up at the UN .
Demarcate the Cetacean feeding grounds like we do Marine Reserves .
But surely stop whaling altogether and stop dolphin hunts as well .
Damien Handslip , United Kingdom Cetaceans have been known to possess intelligence for some decades ( John Lilly 's research in the 1960 's showed this ) .
They seem to have a complex language , and even a global communication system ( relaying messages in a chain fashion from one whale to the next ) .
Whilst it is human nature to farm / hunt other species , surely an indication of sophistication and intelligence in a species should exclude them from being looked upon as simply a ' resource ' ?
I wonder how humanity would feel if another species began hunting us for food , especially if that ' other species ' decided to turn a blind - eye to our ' intelligence ' ?...
tim burnett , Horley , UK
As a species we seem to think it is ok to put whales and dolphins in a zoo or theme park and that we own them .
We have to understand that doing this is wrong .
There are people who will argue that captivity has saved certain species from extinction and that could be a convincing argument but in the process we seem to have forgotten that these are actual creatures with the intelligence to know they are no longer free .
The tragic case of the orca keeper who died is a key example of this - this is clearly an unhappy animal who has turned destructive but we 've put the poor creature in such a situation where we cannot release it for fear it wo n't survive .
So instead we 'll put it in what appears to be a massive tank but to a whale is like a bath tub and ask it to do tricks or breed .
Hardly an existence is it ?
How can that ever been deemed as fair or justified ?
Keeping whales and dolphins in captivity is abhorrent and whaling is even worse .
What leaves a bitter taste with regard to whaling is when the fleets dress it up as Research .
If whaling is brought back at the IWC meeting it should bring shame on those leaders who agree to it .
The only factor we can hope for is that they will not approve the move and if they do them organisations such as Sea Shepherd will be there to stop them .
Jenny , Surrey , UK I agree and think that not only whales and dolphins but many more animals display signs of sophisticated intelligence and complex culture .
Because we do not understand them does not make us superior at all .
There is only one species that has a negative impact on animals and environment .
No we should not hunt whales and dolphins but we should observe and study them , they can teach us their positive qualities .
Mercedes De Windt , Philipsburg , St. Maarten , Netherlands Antilles
Whales are incredibly sophisticated creatures and feel pain and suffering and loss as greatly as we do , who are we to deny them the right to live ?
I do n't believe that whales should be hunted or kept / bred in captivity - no bi-product of the whales cannot be replicated by other means , so where is any justification to hunt them ?
There was a time when certain nationalaties of human beings were not considered ' evolved ' enough to be given rights - this is another form of ignorance and discrimination .
Inge Hansen , South Africa
It is about time people have started to realise and take note the intelligence and importance of these amazing animals .
There is nothing we can learn from marine mammals being in captivity , and the whole purpose of it is simply for money and our own entertainment .
It is like basing a study on humans on one indvidual who has ben taken from their home and put in a tiny room everyday for their entire life , banned from the right to communicate with others and to simply act natural .
Anyone who has been lucky enough to observe whales and dolphins in the wild undoubtly are aware of this higher intelligence these animals posess , and their right to be free .
Stacey Emiliou , Sutton Coldfield Douglas Adams said it best : " Man has always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much ... the wheel , New York , wars and so on ... while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time .
But conversely , the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man ... for precisely the same reason . "
al , stirling Yes I agree with Margi Prideaux .
We have moved away from slaying these Intelligent , beautiful & Majestic Mammals .
This is the way it should remain .
For far to long we have placed ourselves at the top of an intelligence tree ignorant & oblivious to the intelligence of other species it's about time we started moving forward together to preserve this planet & the species on it of which we 're included .
The hunting that has happened in the past was carried out by a young abscent minded , immature human race ..... we now know much more than ever before about these mammals ( Whales & Dolphins ) & we have probably only just delved beneath the surface , to allow the hunting to happen again in the southern oceans would mean that perhaps we ought to retest our own intelligence levels because if it carries then clearly we 're not as intelligent as we think .

I ’m interested in finding out how and why climate change action became a partisan issue .
As Stephen Schneider says in his new book , there ’s a reason that “ conservation ” sounds so much like “ conservatism ” .
The fiscal conservative school of thought is to save money for a rainy day , and to minimize spending so the economy is more sustainable in the long run – so why does this only apply to money ?
Money , after all , is only a representation of wealth , which – more often than not – ends up representing resources and ecosystem services , which depend on a stable climate .
Conservatism , at least in our society , also tends to be more aggressive to national security threats such as terrorism .
Why is climate change exempt yet again ?
Is it somehow any less threatening ?
It seems dubious that climate change action really conflicts with conservative ideologies .
How and why did it begin to be framed this way ?
At some point along the line , conservative media and politicians began to repeat it , to the point where it became accepted as the “ party line ” of the ideology , and citizens who were conservative on most other issues accepted this addition to the party line automatically .
This is why I would ideally prefer a direct democracy , as it allows citizens to vote directly on each issue , rather than just choose the party that hits the most of their requirements .
We ca n’t just categorize people by ideology and assume that all of their opinions will fit neatly into one box .
( Or three boxes at once – several flagged comments accused me of being “ a Communist and a socialist and a Marxist ” – is it even possible to be all three of those things at once ?
Do n’t they have some inherent contradictions ? )
I ’ve stated before that my opinions on policy tend to be more social , but I ’m beginning to wonder more and more how much this reflects my character and how much reflects my age .
In world issues class , everyone took the Political Compass quiz , and plotted their results anonymously on a single graph so we could look at the class as a whole .
Virtually everyone was in the bottom left quadrant – social libertarian .
I was somewhere in the middle of those dots .
Unless my class was a hotbed of radicals , it seems that ideology tends to correspond to age .
Maybe it ’s not because I ’m a social libertarian .
Maybe it ’s just part of being seventeen , and as I grow older , I ’ll remain somewhere near the centre of my society ’s political spectrum , wherever it may fall .
Right now , at least , my opinions regarding many matters of policy fall to the left on Canada ’s political spectrum .
However , I view my work on climate change communication to be very separate to ideology .
It began as a bid for a secure future for my generation , which is looking less and less likely .
However , as the anti-action campaigns began to attack scientists and the scientific process , rather than ( or in addition to ) the theories and statistics themselves , I have begun to defend the nature of science , specificially climate science , instead .
I think I have the mind of a scientist , and I really want to be a scientist .
Not to be a doctor / dentist / pharmacist , which is often the automatic course for high school students who are good at science and math , but to be a researcher and conduct studies and publish in journals and discover things .
I feel more and more sure about this as I get older .
I think this deep connection to the scientific process has given me some elements of conservatism .
I am quite conservative about the process of peer - review , resist change to its structure , and hold tightly to fundamental discoveries in the field of climate science , rather than blowing off Arrhenius just because of something written in Energy & Environment .
I am not writing this blog , or pushing for climate change action and communication , for any ideology or party or political belief .
I am defending both science and the future , two parties that get very little say in the political system .
I am defending the mountain of evidence that many seem willing to discount entirely .
I am defending the millions of unborn citizens who have the right to a world just as good , if not better , than the one we have today .
This post has become a ramble I did n’t expect to go on – it ’s late , after all , and I ’m a teenager who needs her sleep .
So I ’ll bring it back to the beginning .
Are there any recommendations as to which sources I should look at for research into how and why this became a partisan issue ?

Moscow plans to celebrate the Soviet Union 's victory over Hitler 's Germany with a spectacular parade on Sunday .
But this year a shadow has been cast over the festivities by a row over whether posters of Stalin can be hung in the city .
Five decades after his death , Russians are still arguing over whether the dictator can be a positive role model .

" There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed . "
– Luke 2:1
One of the great and striking facts of recent months is the growing resistance to further taxes on the part of the long - suffering American public .
Every individual , business , or organization in American society acquires its revenue by the peaceful and voluntary sale of productive goods and services to the consumer , or by voluntary donations from people who wish to further whatever the group or organization is doing .
Only government acquires its income by the coercive imposition of taxes .
The welcome new element is the growing resistance to further tax exactions by the American people .
In its endless quest for more and better booty , the government has contrived to tax everything it can find , and in countless ways .
Its motto can almost be said to be " If it moves , tax it ! "
Every income , every activity , every piece of property , every person in the land is subject to a battery of tax extortions , direct and indirect , visible and invisible .
There is of course nothing new about this ; what is new is that the accelerating drive of the government to tax has begun to run into determined resistance on the part of the American citizenry .
It is no secret that the income tax , the favorite of government for its ability to reach in and openly extract funds from everyone 's income , has reached its political limit in this country .
The poor and the middle class are now taxed so heavily that the federal government , in particular , dares not try to extort even more ruinous levies .
The outraged taxpayer , after all , can easily become the outraged voter .
How outraged the voters can be was brought home to the politicians last November , when locality after locality throughout the country rose in wrath to vote down proposed bond issues , even for the long - sacrosanct purpose of expanding public schools .
Defeat in New York
The most heartening example — and one that can only give us all hope for a free America — was in New York City , where every leading politician of both parties , aided and abetted by a heavily financed and demagogic TV campaign , urged the voters to support a transportation bond issue .
Yet the bond issue was overwhelmingly defeated — and this lesson for all of our politicians was a sharp and salutary one .
Finally , the property tax , the mainstay of local government as the income tax is at the federal level , is now generally acknowledged to have a devastating effect on the nation 's housing .
The property tax discourages improvements and investments in housing , has driven countless Americans out of their homes , and has led to spiraling tax abandonments in , for example , New York City , with a resulting deterioration of blighted slum housing .
Government , in short , has reached its tax limit ; the people were finally saying an emphatic " No ! " to any further rise in their tax burden .
What was ever - encroaching government going to do ?
The nation 's economists , most of whom are ever eager to serve as technicians for the expansion of state power , were at hand with an answer , a new rabbit out of the hat to save the day for Big Government .
They pointed out that the income tax and property tax were too evident , too visible , and that so are the generally hated sales tax and excise taxes on specific commodities .
But how about a tax that remains totally hidden , that the consumer or average American cannot identify and pinpoint as the object of his wrath ?
It was this deliciously hidden quality that brought forth the rapt attention of the Nixon administration , the " Value Added Tax " ( VAT ) .
The great individualist Frank Chodorov , once an editor of Human Events , explained clearly the hankering of government for hidden taxation :
It is not the size of the yield , nor the certainty of collection , which gives indirect taxation [ read : VAT ] preeminence in the state 's scheme of appropriation .
Its most commendable quality is that of being surreptitious .
It is taking , so to speak , while the victim is not looking .
Those who strain themselves to give taxation a moral character are under obligation to explain the state 's preoccupation with hiding taxes in the price of goods .
( Frank Chodorov , Out of Step , Devin - Adair , 1962 , p. 220 )
The VAT is essentially a national sales tax , levied in proportion to the goods and services produced and sold .
But its delightful concealment comes from the fact that the VAT is levied at each step of the way in the production process : on farmer , manufacturer , jobber and wholesaler , and only slightly on the retailer .
The difference is that when a consumer pays a 7 percent sales tax on every purchase , his indignation rises and he points the finger of resentment at the politicians in charge of government ; but if the 7 percent tax is hidden and paid by every firm rather than just at retail , the inevitably higher prices will be charged , not to the government where it belongs , but to grasping businessmen and avaricious trade unions .
While consumers , businessmen , and unions all blame each other for inflation like Kilkenny cats , Papa government is able to preserve its lofty moral purity , and to join in denouncing all of these groups for " causing inflation . "
It is now easy to see the enthusiasm of the federal government and its economic advisers for the new scheme for a VAT .
It allows the government to extract many more funds from the public — to bring about higher prices , lower production , and lower incomes — and yet totally escape the blame , which can easily be loaded on business , unions , or the consumer as the particular administration sees fit .
The VAT is , in short , a looming gigantic swindle upon the American public , and it is therefore vitally important that it not pass .
For if it does , the encroaching menace of Big Government will get another , and prolonged , lease on life .
One of the selling points for VAT is that it is supposed only to replace the property tax for its prime task of financing local public schools .
Any relief of the onerous burden of the property tax sounds good to many Americans .
But anyone familiar with the history of government or taxation should know the trap in this sort of promise .
For we should all know by now that taxes never go down .
Government , in its insatiable quest for new funds , never relaxes its grip on any source of revenue .
You know and I know that the property tax , even if replaced for school financing , will not really go down ; it will simply be shifted to other expensive boondoggles of local government .
And we also know full well that the VAT will not long be limited to financing the schools ; its vast potential ( a 10 percent VAT would bring in about $ 60 billion in revenue ) is just too tempting for the government not to use it to the hilt , and , in the famous words of New Dealer Harry Hopkins , " to tax and tax , spend and spend , elect and elect . "
Let us now delve more deeply into the specific nature of the VAT .
A given percentage ( the Nixon administration proposal is 3 percent ) is levied , not on retail sales , but on the sales of each stage of production , with the business firm deducting from its liability the tax embodied in the purchases that he makes from previous stages .
It is thus a sales tax hidden at each stage of production , from the farmer or miner down to the retailer .
A " Regressive " Tax
The most common criticism is that the VAT , like the sales tax , is a " regressive " tax , falling largely on the poor and the middle class , who pay a greater percentage of their income than the rich .
This is a proper and important criticism , especially coming at a time when the middle class is already suffering from an excruciating tax burden .
The Nixon administration proposes to alleviate the burden on the poor by rebating the taxes through the income tax .
While this may alleviate the tax burden on the poor , the middle class , which pays most of our taxes anyway , will hardly be benefited .
Furthermore , there is a more sinister element in the rebate plan : for some of the poor will get cash payments from the IRS , thereby bringing in the disastrous principle of the guaranteed annual income ( FAP ) through the back door .
But the VAT is in many ways far worse than a sales tax , apart from its hidden and clandestine nature .
In the first place , the VAT advocates claim that since each firm and stage of production will pay in proportion to its " value added " to production , there will be no misallocation effects along the way .
But this ignores the fact that every business firm will be burdened by the cost of innumerable record keeping and collection for the government .
The result will be an inexorable push of the business system toward " vertical mergers " and the reduction of competition .
Suppose , for example , that a crude - oil producer adds the value of $ 1,000 , and that an oil refiner adds another $ 1,000 , and suppose for simplicity that the VAT is 10 percent .
Theoretically , it should make no difference if the firms are separate or " integrated " ; in the former case , each firm would pay $ 100 to the government ; in the latter , the integrated firm would pay $ 200 .
But since this comforting theory ignores the substantial costs of record keeping and the collection , in practice if the crude - oil firm and the oil refiner were integrated into one firm , making only one payment , their costs would be lower .
Vertical Mergers
Hence , vertical mergers will be induced by the VAT , after which the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice would begin to clamor that the free market is producing " monopoly " and that the merger must be broken by government fiat .
The costs of record keeping and payment pose another grave problem for the market economy .
Obviously , small firms are less able to bear these costs than big ones , and so the VAT will be a powerful burden on small business , and hamper it gravely in the competitive struggle .
It is no wonder that some big businesses look with favor on the VAT !
There is another grave problem with VAT , a problem that the Western European countries which have adopted VAT are already struggling with .
In the VAT , every firm sends its invoices to the federal government , and gets credit for the VAT embodied in its invoices for the goods bought from other firms .
The result is an irresistible opening for cheating , and in Western Europe there are special firms whose business is to write out fake invoices which can reduce the tax liabilities of their " customer . "
Those businesses more willing to cheat will then be favored in the competitive struggle of the market .
A further crucial flaw exists in the VAT , a flaw which will bring much grief to our economic system .
Most people assume that such a tax will simply be passed on in higher prices to the consumer .
But the process is not that simple .
While , in the long run , prices to consumers will undoubtedly rise , there will be two other important effects : a large short - run reduction in business profits , and a long - run fall in wage incomes .
The critical blow to profits , while perhaps only " short - run , " will take place at a time of business recession , when many firms and industries are suffering from low profits and even from business losses .
The low - profit firms and industries will be severely hit by the imposition of VAT , and the result will be to cripple any possible recovery and plunge us deeper into recession .
Furthermore , new and creative firms , which usually begin small and with low profits , will be similarly crippled before they have scarcely begun .
The VAT will also have a severe , and so far unacknowledged , effect in aggravating unemployment , which is already at a high recession rate .
The grievous impact on unemployment will be twofold .
In the first place , any firm that buys , say , machinery , can deduct the embodied VAT from its own tax liability ; but if it hires workers , it can make no such deduction .
The result will be to spur over - mechanization and the firing of laborers .
Secondly , part of the long - run effect of VAT will be to lower the demand for labor and wage incomes ; but since unions and the minimum - wage laws are able to keep wage rates up indefinitely , the impact will be a rise in unemployment .
Thus , from two separate and compounding directions , VAT will aggravate an already serious unemployment problem .
Hence , the American public will pay a high price indeed for the clandestine nature of the VAT .
We will be mulcted of a large and increasing amount of funds , extracted in a hidden but no less burdensome manner , just at a time when the government seemed to have reached the limit of the tax burden that the people will allow .
It will be funds that will aggravate the burdens on the already long - suffering average middle - class American .
And to top it off , the VAT will cripple profits ; injure competition , small business , and new creative firms ; raise prices ; and greatly aggravate unemployment .
It will pit consumers against business , and intensify conflicts within society .
One of the Parkinson 's justly famous " laws " is that , for government , " expenditure rises to meet income . "
If we allow the government to find and exploit new sources of tax funds , it will simply use those funds to spend more and more , and aggravate the already fearsome burden of Big Government on the American economy and the American citizen .
The only way to reduce Big Government is to cut its tax revenue , and to force it to stay within its more limited means .
We must see to it that government has less tax funds to play with , not more .
The first step on this road to lesser government and greater freedom is to see the VAT for the swindle that it is , and to send it down to defeat .

The Predator operators reported seeing only military - age men in the truck , the report said .
The ground commander concurred , the report said , and the Special Operations team asked for an airstrike .
An OH - 58D Kiowa helicopter fired Hellfire missiles and rockets , destroying the vehicles and killing 23 civilians .
Twelve others were wounded .

The New York Times
The report , signed by Maj. Gen. Timothy P. McHale , found that the Predator operators in Nevada and “ poorly functioning command posts ” in the area failed to provide the ground commander with evidence that there were civilians in the trucks .
Because of that , General McHale wrote , the commander wrongly believed that the vehicles , then seven miles away , contained insurgents who were moving to reinforce the fighters he and his men were tracking .
“ The strike occurred because the ground force commander lacked a clear understanding of who was in the vehicles , the location , direction of travel , and the likely course of action of the vehicles , ” General McHale wrote .
The “ tragic loss of life , ” General McHale found , was compounded by the failure of the ground commander and others to report in a timely manner that they might have killed civilians .
Predator drones and similar aircraft carry powerful cameras that beam real - time images to their operators , and some are armed with missiles , as well .
The C.I.A. operates its own drone operation , mostly focused on Pakistan and separate from the military’s .
In this case , the military Predator operators in Nevada tracked the convoy for three and a half hours , but failed to notice any of the women who were riding along , the report said .
According to military officials in Washington and Afghanistan , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters on the case , intelligence analysts who were monitoring the drone ’s video feed sent computer messages twice , warning the drone operators and ground command posts that children were visible .
ORGANISED crime syndicates have infiltrated Australian airports , with corrupt baggage handlers , Customs officials and airline staff suspected of smuggling drugs and firearms into the country .
Federal authorities , trade unions , border - protection groups and airlines have revealed there are gaping holes in aviation and maritime security .
A new federal parliamentary inquiry , into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime , has been told less than one per cent of air cargo is physically examined and catering trucks are never searched .
The extraordinary evidence was given in public hearings in Sydney on Friday and Melbourne on Thursday .
Evidence presented by NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Dave Hudson was so sensitive it was heard in a closed session with no public access .
The Australian Federal Police Association claims the current " declare " or " nothing to declare " customs system also allows drug mules to freely smuggle illicit drugs without being caught .
" The introduction of the voluntary ' declare ' or ' nothing to declare ' process at Australian airports has increased the ability for organised crime to utilise mules to transport narcotics and other illicit goods through the Customs barrier undetected , " the Association 's submission states .
The Australian Services Union is also critical of the honour - based system , saying it is inappropriate that international passengers are allowed to bypass scrutiny .
Qantas ' submission to the inquiry admits corrupt employees could misuse their positions to perpetrate unlawful activities and facilitate criminal and terrorist activity .
" The potential for a trusted insider ( airport / airline employees , contractors , security personnel , retailers , etc ) to circumvent security measures and use their knowledge of the environment is an ongoing consideration for aviation industry participants , " it states .
Labor senator and committee chairman Steve Hutchins , who oversaw two public hearings last week , admitted border security was lax .
" We are not at all impressed about what appears to be the ease with which people are able to access maritime cards let alone aviation security cards , " he told The Sunday Telegraph .
" Over the years , it 's been proven that on the waterfront and in airports , there are clearly people who have links to organised and serious crime .
Whatever we can do we should do to root them out and make sure that illegal drugs and firearms are n't on the streets . "
Senator Hutchins said he was also disturbed by claims that people accessing areas near baggage handling services did not have aviation passes .
The Transport Workers ' Union national secretary Tony Sheldon said catering materials and air cargo were rarely inspected and that a delegate with 20 years experience was only aware of one inspection in the past year .
According to Australian Customs , fewer than 40,000 of the 6.1 million pieces of luggage screened by X - ray are physically opened and searched .
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission is expected to hand down its findings later this year .
During a public hearing in Sydney on Friday , Mr Sheldon said airport security was flawed because companies were " trying to do it on the cheap " and not training enough staff .
Mr Sheldon was particularly critical of the main screening system for airport employees - the aviation security identification cards , or ASIC , system .

Are speculators like the giant bond fund PIMCO trying to crash the Greek economy in order to make a quick pay day on the collapse of its bonds ?
Max Keiser thinks so .
Is Max delusional ?
Well , two months ago , he predicted that the Greece crisis was going to spread to all of Europe .
This was at the same time financial " experts " stressed there was " no problem " and whatever problems Greece had would be " contained . "
Score - Max : 1 Media - approved experts:0
In the second video , Max talks about parallels between Iceland and Greece and the looming problem of " debt slavery " the citizens in these two countries face .
It 's been proposed that the people of Greece sell parts of their territory and cultural treasures to pay back the banks .
Should the public pay for government corruption and financial industry fraud ?
That 's the multi-trillion dollar question .
Iceland 's public has said no and Greece 's citizens are in the streets .
What 's next ?
In March , Max pointed out that in spite of their posturing Germany and France do n't have the money to make good on all the bad paper the economy of the world has purchased from Goldman Sachs and friends .
This is not an " overseas " problem .
US citizens will be next to face the " debt slavery " issue .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
The percentage of loans in foreclosure or with at least one payment past due was a non-seasonally - adjusted 14.01 % in the first quarter , down from 15.02 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday .
But the seasonally adjusted delinquency rate for mortgages on one - to four - unit residential properties , which includes mortgages at least one payment past due but does n't include those in foreclosure , rose to 10.06 % , from 9.47 % .
Mortgages in the foreclosure process hit a record high at a non-seasonally - adjusted 4.63 % , up from 4.58 % in the fourth quarter .
" The issue this quarter is that the seasonally adjusted delinquency rates went up while unadjusted rates went down , " said Jay Brinkmann , MBA 's chief economist , in a news release .
" Delinquency rates traditionally peak in the fourth quarter and fall in the first quarter and we saw that first quarter drop in the data .
The question is whether the drop represents anything more than a normal seasonal decline or a more fundamental improvement . "

Joshua McAuley , 15 , refused blood transfusion because of religious beliefs after being crushed by car in West Midlands
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A teenage Jehovah 's Witness who was crushed by a car as it crashed into a shop died after refusing a blood transfusion in hospital .
Joshua McAuley , 15 , was airlifted to hospital from the incident in Smethwick , West Midlands , on Saturday morning , but died later that day .
The schoolboy , who received abdominal and leg injuries , is believed to have told doctors at Birmingham 's Selly Oak hospital not to give him a blood transfusion because of his religious beliefs .
Clive Parker , an elder at Kingdom Hall of Jehovah 's Witnesses in Smethwick , where Joshua and his family worshipped , said Joshua was conscious after the accident and " made a stand on the blood issue " .
He said : " I do n't want to talk about it any more than that because I do n't want to add to the family 's distress .
" A mother has lost her son , and Joshua had a brother .
He has lost his brother , he was there in the morning and then gone by the afternoon .
" They are terribly distressed . "
A spokesman for Selly Oak hospital said he could not comment on the individual case but described the issue as an " extraordinarily complex area " with no set rules .
He said : " There is not one single policy and not one single law regarding transfusions .
" There is no automatic right to override parental wishes or that of a minor .
It is a very complex area that has to be approached on a case - by - case basis .
" Any decisions that have to be made are made in consultation with as many people as possible . "
A postmortem is expected to be carried out by a Home Office pathologist on Thursday .
A spokesman for West Midlands police said Joshua 's family , who live in Smethwick , did not wish to speak about the tragedy .
He said : " The family of Joshua has asked for privacy at this difficult time … we ask that their privacy is respected . "
Two other adults were injured in the crash , which happened in the Cape Hill area at 11.14am .
Police said a 24 - year - old woman was in a serious but stable condition in hospital , and a 32 - year - old man sustained a suspected broken arm and leg .
A 28 - year - old man from the Winson Green area of Birmingham who was arrested after the crash was bailed pending further inquiries , police said .
I would n’t have believed it if I had n’t read this message of a Danish group opposed to the plan .
Greens clear - cutting trees in a national park and evicting people , whoda thunk ?.
Seems like a case of “ we had to destroy the village to save it “ .
Here ’s the description of the park from the Danish National Parks website :
The west of Thy has been designated as the first Danish national park .
The National Park ,
Thy stretches for an up to 12 - kilometer - wide belt along the Jutland west coast from Agger Tange in the south to Hanstholm in the north .
It is an enormous and unspoiled natural area totaling 244 km2 – almost the size of the Danish island of Langeland .
In the National Park you can go between outstretched , wind - swept wilds and aromatic pine trees .
You can also throw yourself into the sparkling waves of the North Sea or bike through cool dune plantations .
I ’ve reposted the message from the opposition group below .
Dear environmentally aware citizen of the world !
www.nationalttestcenter.dk
Copenhagen , December 2009
The Danish government plans to clear forests and destroy unique nature for the benefit of industry .
The Danish environment minister Troels Lund Poulsen decided , on behalf of the government , on 30th September 2009 , that the clearing of 15 km2 of forest in the north west of Denmark will take place .
A test centre for the development of offshore windmills is planned to take up 30 km2 of land in the Thy region , near Østerild .
This deforestation will create an increase of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emission , the equivalent of the CO2 emission of 100,000 people per year .
The government will force the local population out of their homes .
The reasoning behind this is said to be for the benefit of the Danish windmill industry , which will in turn create more Danish jobs .
The regulations to finalise the evictions goes against Denmark ’s constitution and is therefore clearly illegal .
In current plans , the area is categorised as a recreational area , where the set up of windmills is prohibited .
The region is one of Denmark ’s most beautiful areas .
With its rugged landscapes and grand views , as well as many rare species of animals , birds and plants , the area is representative of authentic Danish nature .
There are very few areas of Denmark left , where one can experience darkness at night and complete silence .
The windmills , which are 250 meters tall , are planned to be along a 6 km linear south / north stretch .
This will prevent birds in the international Ramsar - area , Vejlerne , which is situated to the east of the test centre , from flying west to the EU - habitat area Vullum Sø and to Thy National Park just south of Hanstholm .
The Danish government has not consulted properly about the plans .
The Danish citizens had little time to put forward comments of the project .
The hearing has only been 11 days long , with 9 of those being a national holiday .
The environment minister has decided that a report on this projects impact on nature and the wildlife will be completed by early December 2009 .
The consequence of this is that it is impossible to produce a well documented scientific report , to act as the foundation for a political decision .
The local population has formed an association , “ Landforeningen for Bedre Miljø ” ( The Association for an Improved Environment ) with the aim to inform about the environmental consequences for both the society and nature , if plans for the national test centre are followed through .
So far , “ Landsforeningen for Bedre Miljø “ has tried , in vain , to persuade the Danish government to produce a more thorough investigation of the project ’s impacts on the surroundings .
The association is discontented with the planning process so far , because they have neglected ordinary , well - known , democratic principles , which Denmark otherwise uses every opportunity to talk about across the world .
If you , as an environmentally aware citizen of the world , thinks that questions ought to be asked concerning this unjust conduct towards our future generations inheritance of the nature , please spread the word about this planned national test centre .

Chris Horner of Pajamas Media has a summary of the issue :
President Obama was caught flatfooted by the embarrassing truth about Spain ’s “ green economy ” after he instructed us — on eight separate occasions — to “ think about what ’s happening in countries like Spain ” as a model for a U.S. future .
Spain , of course , is suffering an economic meltdown from enormous public debt incurred through programs like a mandated “ green economy . ”
But Obama also just implored Spain to drastically scale back or risk becoming Greece .
A flip he immediately flopped , by pushing hard to enact the Kerry - Lieberman “ path to insolvency ” bill based on … Spain .
( Cue Benny Hill theme . )
So , embarrassed — or perhaps shameless — Obama changed his pitch : “ Think about what ’s happening in countries like Denmark . ”
Of course , the experience of Denmark — a country with a population half that of Manhattan ’s , not exactly a useful energy model for our rather different economy and society — is no great shakes , either .
But it gets better .
In my new book — Power Grab : How Obama ’s Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom and Bankrupt America —
I describe the absurdity of the “ free ice cream ” theories of the “ green economy ” our statist friends now embrace as their latest raison d’etre for a controlled society .
My mother - in - law — visiting from Denmark — is reading my book with a particular interest in its exposé of what her heavily taxed labor pays for in that country .
The book also prompted her to relay an amazing new anecdote to the case study referred to by the Danes as “ the fairy tale of the windmills . ”
In the northern region of Jutland called Thy , Denmark is forcing people off of their land ( “ Kelo ” is apparently Danish for “ Kelo ” ) and — wait for it — preparing to clear - cut fifteen square kilometers of forest , and eventually thirty , in order to put up more of the bird - and job - killing monstrosities .
These giant windmills are not even intended to fill an energy gap for the Danish economy .
No , they are to be onshore experimental versions of massive new off - shore turbines — with the facility to be rented out to wind mavens like Siemens .
The argument they are forwarding for doing this is not just the typically risible claim that this is necessary for the environment .
After all , “ [ the ] deforestation will create an increase of 400,000 tons of CO2 emissions , the equivalent of the CO2 emissions of 100,000 people per year . ”
They are also forwarding the argument that this must occur in order to create Danish jobs .
Of course , “ creating jobs , ” to the extent such mandates can do this ( as they are typically net job killers ) , appears much more necessary after the state first made it difficult for the private sector to do such things .
Denmark enforced what methods , and what quantity of those methods , are acceptable for producing electricity .
It always turns out that the acceptable ways are inefficient , intermittent , and expensive .
Which sort of explains the need for mandates .

The Mother of All Bubbles Huge National Debts Could Push Euro Zone into Bankruptcy
Greece is only the beginning .
The world 's leading economies have long lived beyond their means , and the financial crisis caused government debt to swell dramatically .
Now the bill is coming due , but not all countries will be able to pay it .
By SPIEGEL staff .
I am a firm believer that there are a number of ways in which the world can definitively be divided into two types of people :
People who can touch their toes and those who can’t .
People who are fundamentally dishonest and those who are n’t .
Starfish sleepers and corpse sleepers .
And people who love hot chilli and those who do n’t .
And like starfish and corpse sleepers who inevitably end up married to one another ( ask around – you ’ll see I ’m right ! ) , more often than not a chilli - lover and a chilli - hater end up married to each other .
Seeing as I am of the opinion that Nando ’s lemon and herb chicken is a little on the spicy side , obviously I had to go and marry a man who once downed a double tot glass of half Tabasco and half tequila for a laugh .
The line between stupid and hard - core narrows daily !
Years of marriage have kind of conditioned me to believe that everyone except me loves hot food , so when I cook I tend to assume that if I can take the heat then it should be fine for everyone else too .
But as Samuel L Jackson said , assume makes an ass out of you and me .
So when I made a spicy chicken tagine as the second course of a recent Valentine ’s Day lunch ( to follow the halloumi with zaa ’ tar and red pepper coulis ) , I tasted it and dubbed it hot but not unbearable … but some of my guests thought I was trying to incinerate them .
Live and learn !
This recipe is adapted from one by Jean - Christophe Novelli .
I replaced the poussin with chicken pieces , fiddled with some of the spice quantities and added some touches of my own , like preserved lemons .
The dried apricots I used were diced , but next time I would use whole or halved dried apricots – otherwise their sweetness gets lost .
NB – there is a LOT of spice in this recipe !!
if you like things not - so - spicy , I would reduce the cayenne pepper by half but if you like spice , this dish is perfectly balanced between sweetness and heat .
In the interests of full disclosure , I made mine not in a traditional tagine but in my trusty 5 litre Corningware casserole dish .
I served it on fluffy couscous and accompanied by a simple salad of flat - leaf parsley , cherry tomatoes and diced cucumber .
And a cool bowl of yoghurt on the side for spice - phobes !

Martin Gardner died over the weekend .
He was 95 and living in Norman , Oklahoma , not too far from his birthplace in Tulsa .
Like many others , I grew up on Martin ’s “ Mathematical Games ” column in Scientific American .
Later I joined the staff of that magazine — but do n’t imagine that Martin and I became office buddies .
As a matter of fact , I never once saw him in the office .
He worked at home .
He attended none of our editorial meetings .
We never had lunch together .
Indeed , I never would have met him at all except for the coincidence that we lived a few blocks apart , and every now and then I would be called upon to deliver a package of urgent proofs .
( By the way , his address in those days was on Euclid Avenue ! )
Someone on the magazine staff described Martin as “ a shy woodland creature , ” and the tag stuck .
Looking back , however , I think it tells only half the story .
Yes , Martin was no schmoozer , and he preferred to stay out of the spotlight , both in person and in print .
Most of his best - known columns reported on someone else ’s discoveries —
Conway ’s game of life , RSA ’s cryptosystem , Penrose ’s tilings .
He delighted in annotating other people ’s work , as in his celebrated edition of Lewis Carroll .
Yet he was anything but timid or retiring .
In an argument , the shy woodland creature was a grizzly bear .
He had strongly held opinions and philosophical convictions , and he knew the worth of his own work .
He was a man of ideas , to be taken seriously , yet also a man who had fun with his ideas .
As a celebration of Martin ’s peculiar genius , I would like to revive the little puzzle that formed the basis of his very first column , in January of 1957 .
( He had published a few articles in Scientific American earlier , but this was the first column to appear under the “ Mathematical Games ” title . )
On the bingo card above , choose any number , circle it , and cross out all the other numbers in the same column or row .
Now select a second number from among those that remain unmarked , and again circle your choice and then cross out the rest of the column and row .
Continue in this way until there are no unmarked numbers left to choose .
The sum of the circled numbers is 57 .
How did I know that ?
How did Martin construct the matrix ?
Update 2010 - 05 - 29 : Here is Martin ’s own explanation of the 1957 puzzle :
Like most tricks , this one is absurdly simple when explained .
The square is nothing more than an old - fashioned addition table , arranged in a tricky way .
The table is generated by two sets of numbers : 12 , 1 , 4 , 18 , 0 and 7 , 0 , 4 , 9 , 2 .
The sum of these numbers is 57 .
If you write the first set of numbers horizontally above the top row of the square , and the second set vertically beside the first column [ see Fig. 9 ] , you can see at once how the numbers in the cells are determined .
The number in the first cell ( top row , first column ) is the sum of 12 and 7 , and so on through the square .
For pianists and guitarists , small fingers are a curse .
But a study published in the Journal of
Neuroscience on December 16 , 2009 , suggests that diminutive digits do have an advantage : they are more sensitive .
The paper reports that sensory receptors called Merkel cells , which discern the texture and structure of materials pressed against the fingertip , are more closely packed on small fingers as compared with large ones .
Because women tend to have smaller fingers than men , they are , in general , better able to distinguish the shapes of the things they feel .
Indeed , compared with the men , the women in the study could more easily discern the orientation of thin grooves in a piece of plastic that had been pressed against their fingers .
Off -ice gamesmanship is nothing new in the Stanley Cup Playoffs for road teams .
Players and coaches have long complained about having the hot water turned off for the post - game shower or even about between - period stat sheets not being available .
But having an off - ice issue like that turn into an on-ice problem is a rarity .
As you know Farms of Shame sometimes take up the story of an individual dog in a puppy farm .
I was sent a picture of a puppy , not a happy and confident puppy but a puppy just about to have puppies herself for her puppy farmer owner , .
Looking into her eyes I felt that we should try to tell the story of this sweet and shy puppy that was bought not to love but just to make money , given a sketchy pedigree and described as an Australian Labradoodle .
Here she is
Sunsethills Crimson Aurora was born on the 4th of December 2003 , the result of a mating between a poodle and a cocker spaniel crossed with a labrador ( or so they said ) .
Of course puppyhood is just an inconvenience to a puppy farm and she was mated at 7 months old by Melinda Radus to a poodle and had her first litter at only 9 months old on the 25th of September 2004 at Sunset Hills Puppy Farm .
She shed hair so in order to carry on the pretence of breeding “ hypoallergenic ” dogs she was bred constantly from then on to poodles or dogs that were well over 80 % poodle according to our researchers ..
51/2 months later on the 2nd of March 2005 poor Rorie had another litter to a poodle .
Her little body could n’t cope and she had an emergency c-section almost a week early
We have a picture of her looking thin and miserable and shaved to the skin .
She has some tiny puppies that Sunset Hills fought hard for as they had big money waiting for them and export deals .
You would think this 15 month old puppy had now done enough for her owner but sadly that was not all .
5 months later again on the 11th of August 2005 , Rorie had her 3rd litter after another difficult labour .
The fact that she had only recently had a caesarean was not enough to give her a rest from producing puppies for sale .
Rorie was n’t fit to have a picture taken and photoshopped to the desired gold / red colour and anyway she was n’t important , only the puppies mattered .
as some were kept for breeding and sold for a minimum 25 , 000 AUD as breeding stock .
All this from a puppy bitch who had no real pedigree , just another mongrel .
Rorie ’s bitch puppies Elly , Abi , and Crimson were kept on to produce more puppies in America and Australia for Sunset Hills .
Only 5 months after her last litter at the beginning of January 2006 Rorie was exported to America .
She was 7 weeks in whelp and had her puppies at Alpenridge , Sunsethills ’ American branch on the 23rd of January .
This branch was first set up with Melinda ’s mother Sue Broady described on the website :
Sue is a wonderful and caring person who has been involved in animal breeding programs for over 30 years now .
She has a great love for animals and a talent for developing breeding programs .
Note the picture of Sue Broady
http://web.archive.org/web/20050221165128/http://www.sunsethills.biz/sunsethills_cascades.htm
By the time Rorie was sent heavy with pup for the long and uncomfortable trip to her new “ home ” at Alpenridge there had been some changes , Sue Broady is now called Crystalyn Widic but with an identical description : Christalyn is a wonderful and caring person who has been involved in animal breeding programs for over 30 years now .
She has a great love for animals and a talent for developing breeding programs .
http://web.archive.org/web/20060429075628/http://www.sunsethills.biz/about_alpen_ridge.htm
Click on the picture of the 2006 website and you can see the Sue Broady picture now labelled Crystalyn .
This is Sunset Hills new Breeding Center located in the USA .
Our Center is operated by Christalyn Widic recently relocated from Crooked River Ranch , Oregon to Elko , Nevada , the home of the anual National Cowboy Poetry Contest !
Sunset Hills is like most puppy farms , nothing is quite what it seems , names are changed at will and we are all expected to believe everything we are told .
These farms trade on the gullibility of the public who after all only want a puppy to love .
I do n’t know whether life was better or worse for little Rorie in America , but I do know that she was still not allowed to just be a young dog given freedom to have fun and love with a family .
5 months later on the 2nd of July 2006 after finally having some health testing done , Rorie had her 5th litter in America at Sunset Hills new breeding centre Alpenridge .
After that we do not know what happened to her .
I hope she was finally retired as they claim and allowed to have a life , not just litter after litter of puppies until her poor body could take no more .
Rorie , a cheap little cross breed puppy , earned hundreds of thousands for her owners , she deserved a wonderful life after being sentenced to Hard Labour every 5 months .
Rorie ’s life was not exceptional at Sunset Hills , it was typical for any bitch unlucky enough to remain in the kennels .
I believe that loyalty is a virtue we should all respect , but there comes a time when we need to look carefully at what demands our loyalty and judge if it is worthy of it .
In this case Sunset Hills has clearly got a number of loyal friends but it is time they took stock .
I know many already have .
The producers behind The Dark Knight and Spider - Man are teaming for Mass Effect , a live - action , big screen adaptation of the Electronic Arts - BioWare videogame .
Legendary Pictures ' Thomas Tull and Jon Jashni have acquired the film rights to the game and will produce the movie along with former Marvel Studios honcho Avi Arad and his son Ari Arad .
BioWare co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk will serve as executive producers , as will Casey Hudson .
Warner Bros. will distribute the film .
Furthermore , the producers are in negotiations with screenwriter Mark Protosevich ( I Am Legend , Thor ) about penning the script .
The Mass Effect movie is in the nascent stages of development .
Mass Effect is a tremendous property ripe for translation to the big screen , " said Thomas Tull , Chairman and CEO of Legendary Pictures , in a statement .
" Mass Effect is a prime example of the kind of source material we at Legendary like to develop ; it has depth , compelling characters and an engaging back story .
This coupled with Avi and Ari producing and the skills of a great team adapting the screenplay , are the start of turning this smash videogame based property into a successful feature film . "
" We are thrilled to be working with Legendary , " said producer Avi Arad .
" EA and BioWare are terrific partners who have created a brilliant piece of fiction with a universe filled with amazing aliens and technology .
More importantly , though , they created a parable whose conflicts mirror the ones we currently face in our own world .
This story emphasizes the need for all cultures to learn to work together .
All this magic is presented in a fast paced action - adventure that makes for the best kind of movie experience . "
" At BioWare , we 've always thought of Mass Effect as having the depth , emotion and plot twists perfectly suited for an adaptation to a motion picture , " said Casey Hudson .
" With Legendary and Avi and Ari Arad attached , we believe that the Mass Effect movie will be an extraordinary entertainment event that realizes our vision for the franchise and thrills fans .
"
BioWare 's epic science fiction series takes place in the year 2183 and follows Commander Shepard of the SS Normandy who leads a team on a mission to defeat an ancient alien race that invades the galaxy every 50,000 years , wiping out all organic life .
The most recent game in the series , Mass Effect 2 , was released in January of 2010 .
( CNN ) --
A predicted busy hurricane season this summer is on a collision course with an unprecedented oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , and the results are anyone 's guess , weather experts say .
" The problem is that this is a man - made experiment we wish we had n't made , " said Jenni Evans , a professor of meteorology at Penn State University .
Scientists on Thursday said as much as 19,000 barrels of oil have been spewing every day from the BP well in the Gulf , making it the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
Most of the oily water lies off the coast of Louisiana , where marshes and wildlife have been coated and the state 's fishing and tourism industries have taken direct hits .
Not only is it hard to track how contaminants would be redistributed by a hurricane , but it's also hard to predict how the slick would affect the storm , NOAA Public Affairs Officer Dennis Feltgen and Evans agreed .
Evans said the storm could either move the oil along the water 's surface or it could mix the oil with the water and cause it to sink .
If the oil moved horizontally , the shoreline would be polluted , she said .
If it moved vertically , the marine life under the surface would suffer .
The oil could slow the storm 's growth , Feltgen said .
Evaporated ocean water fuels hurricanes , and the oil forming a film across the Gulf could buffer the water from the air , preventing the ocean water from feeding the hurricane , he said .
But other scientists say the storms could be stronger than usual because the black oil would heat the water faster and accelerate formation of hurricanes , which rely on warm waters for their development , Evans said .
CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers said there was another threat from the volatile mix of hurricanes and oil : storm surge .
" All the winds would be coming here , " he said , indicating the coast on a map , " and there would be storm surge here .
All the winds would be going this way , and there would be scouring and cleaning of the beaches on this side .
But the storm surge that could make its way up and bring the oil miles inland could be completely contaminating the oil inland . "
Oil in the Gulf coast is n't the only worry for hurricane forecasters this year :
In earthquake - devastated Haiti , roughly 1.5 million displaced people are at risk .
They are living under tarps and in tents in makeshift camps .
In Haiti , aid agencies relocated about 20,000 people who were vulnerable to flooding and mudslides when the rainy season began .
But it is impossible to hurricane - proof the congested tent cities that many are calling home right now , said Heather Paul , CEO of the aid program SOS Children 's Villages .
Paul 's program is working to provide permanent , stable homes to orphans in the form of polypropylene shelters .
While her program 's anchored shelters have the greatest potential to withstand strong winds , the outlook appears grim for many Port - Au - Prince residents .
" It 's only short of a miracle to prepare these people for hurricane season , " she said .
We were in this liquor store buying some beer , and at the counter they had these Pocket Shots .
They came in Gin , Tequila and Vodka .
The lady behind the counter said they 'd had Scotch but had sold out .
Go figure .
We bought the vodka and took it out to show all our friends .
We all had a laugh .
What the hell ?
What kind of alcoholic market agency thinks up this stuff ?
We guess you never know when you 're going to need a shot - in airplanes or in cabs , at work or at bar mitzvahs .
Actually the Vodka Pocket
Shot tasted fine and did the trick .
Really , it 's pretty ingenious .
We might go back for another little pouch of booze to keep handy at our next court hearing ...
First rock from the sun
THREE centuries have passed since the polymath Sir Christopher Wren predicted that “ a time will come when men will stretch out their eyes — they should see planets like our Earth . ”
By most astronomers ' accounts , that time is just about nigh .
Indeed , detecting big planets orbiting other stars is no longer tricky — nearly 450 such exoplanets have been catalogued .
Smaller , rocky planets orbiting at a comfortable distance from their stars — as the Earth does — remain more elusive .
Most exoplanets have been discovered by inferring their presence from the rhythmic wobble their gravity imparts on their home star — like a waltz between two dancers of markedly different weights .
The problem is that this method favours the discovery of large planets close to their stars .
As a result , the catalogue of planets is filled with “ hot Jupiters ” , huge bodies baking brightly in the light of their sun .
To find places that might support life it is necessary to look for planets a little farther away from their stars , but not so far away that they are frozen lumps of ice and rock , like the dwarf planet Pluto .
But it is n't easy .
Spotting the light from a tiny planet across astronomical distances is akin to discerning a red - hot pinhead right next to a floodlight from many kilometres away .
Astronomers have partially solved the problem of looking at objects near to a star 's bright glare by inventing the coronagraph , which focuses all the incoming light around a dark spot in the telescope 's innards , neatly clipping off most of the central starlight and passing on much of the planetary glow .
For exoplanet hunting that is not quite good enough .
Some of the starlight still gets through , easily obscuring planets that are millions of times fainter than their parent stars .
A novel approach plays with the peaks and troughs of the light waves to do the job more effectively .
This week , in Nature , Eugene Serabyn of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and his colleagues describe a stunning implementation of what is known as an optical vortex coronagraph .
In place of a dark spot , this uses a disk of glassy material , etched with a carefully designed pattern which changes the phase of the incoming light , in effect twisting it back onto itself and creating a dark hole in the centre of the image .
This blots out the starlight more effectively , making it easier to see any nearby planets .
In order for this technique to work , the distortions imposed on the incoming light during its passage through the Earth 's atmosphere must be removed using a trick called “ wavefront correction ” .
The researchers did this using a small part of the giant Hale telescope in California , with which they examined a star called HR 8799 in the constellation of Pegasus .
When images showing three planets orbiting this star were obtained in 2008 , it was the first time exoplanets had been directly observed .
The researchers could also see the planets — and their telescope was in effect five times smaller than the telescopes used in 2008 .
With a two - metre telescope — small by modern astronomical standards —
Dr Serabyn and his team say they could spot a planet 33 light - years away orbiting its host star at a similar distance to that at which the Earth orbits the Sun .
Such a planet would fall into the so - called “ Goldilocks zone ” ( neither too hot nor too cold ) where the interesting chemistry should happen .
As well as bringing planet - hunting within the reach of many smallish telescopes on Earth , the new technique also means that smaller , cheaper , or perhaps more numerous space telescopes — entirely free of deleterious atmospheric effects — could be employed to stretch out the eyes of men and finally fulfil Wren 's prediction .
Here 's an important heads up .
Today at 10:00 AM
Ben Bernanke will attending a hearing on " The Economic Outlook . "
There 's always some nervousness before he speaks ( will he all of the sudden sound more hawkish ? ) .
Let us give you a preview of some things that might come up :
Following 9/11 , the number of people converting to Islam began to rise .
In the US it is estimated that approximately 30,000 convert annually .
There are about 2.4 million Muslims in Britain and studies suggest there are between 10,000 and 14,000 white converts among them .
It is estimated that 75 per cent are female .
As a feminist who rejects religion on the grounds that it promotes inequality between men and women , I wanted to try to understand why so many women are attracted to Islam .
Its messages are clear about a woman ’s role .
She will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him and raising his children .
“ If a man calls his wife to his bed , and she refuses , and he goes to sleep angry with her , the angels will curse her until morning , ” is a popular phrase recited to Muslim women during religious study .
“ The true Muslim woman is always keen to win her husband ’s love and to please him .
Nothing should spoil his happiness or enjoyment of life , ” says the Sisters ’ section of Muslimconverts.com .
The website also has a section on how the Taliban upheld certain rights of women that are “ non-existent in the West ” .
Saskia converted to Islam 15 years ago during her first year at university .
“ I did so because I married a Muslim .
I ca n’t imagine why women would do it for other reasons . ”
But prior to meeting her future husband , Saskia had begun to engage with Islam .
“ The Bible can be vague about the roles of men and women and I wanted certainty .
Islam gave me that . ”
She was brought up by an atheist father and a “ pushy feminist ” mother who occasionally attended church .
“ Although they had quite a traditional marriage , my mother made it clear that the only options for her daughter ’s future , as far as she was concerned , were an education and a career .
I rebelled . ”
Soon after starting at university , Saskia began attending its Islamic Society through which she met Muayid , a Moroccan Muslim .
“ I was attracted to the conservative family values and the high esteem in which mothers are held . ”
Dropping out of university , Saskia married Muayid and had two children within the first three years .
But she was unhappy .
“ Marriage to Muayid was very hard .
I wanted to be a good Muslim but he hardly prayed and almost never went to mosque . ”
Saskia became increasingly devout and as a result tension built up in the relationship .
The children would be taken to mosque every day to learn Arabic but Muayid was uninterested in their education .
“ He did n’t even work , even though the Koran makes it clear that a man has to provide for his wife . ”
The fact that Muayid ’s family lived in Morocco meant that there was no pressure on him to change his ways .
“ The mother reigns supreme in Islam and even grown men have to respect and obey them , ” says Saskia .
“ If I needed Muayid to listen to me I would ask my mother to talk to him , which sometimes worked . ”
The couple divorced five years ago after ten years of marriage .
“ He really changed after 9/11 .
All of a sudden , he stopped drinking alcohol and began to pray and attend mosque .
He would endlessly talk about the Zionist conspiracy and how Zionists rule the world .
I found tapes and books that just fed his paranoia about Jews .
I disliked the radical Muayid more than I did the non-devout one . ”
What is the attraction of Islam for Saskia today ?
“ Women are respected and not seen as sex objects .
Western women are defined by their appearance but we are viewed as whole human beings .
I find the veil liberating . ”
Saskia tells me she gets “ particularly mad ” when white men tell Muslim women they should not cover up .
“ In whose interests are they arguing ? ”
On gender segregation , she says : “ I think it is good for Islamic women .
Western women are often rivals but Muslim women have a much stronger sense of sisterhood . ”
Rahila Gupta is a writer and member of Women against Fundamentalism , set up in the 1980s in response to the Salman Rushdie affair .
She believes that dissatisfaction with consumerism and the perceived moral decadence of the West has sometimes pushed people into a search for religious or spiritual transcendence .
However , she does not think that white women converting to Islam is the start of a new trend .
“ Islam is superficially attractive in that it offers an analysis [ and condemnation ] of the abuse of women ’s bodies to sell products but once you look deeper , as with most religions , it is women who are blamed for men ’s predatory behaviour and who must cover themselves for protection . “
Inequality between men and women exists in Christian , Jewish and Muslim communities but perceptions of female sexuality differ considerably within those religions .
The Islamic view of women as active sexual beings who are encouraged to enjoy sex with their husbands is uncomfortable for the traditional Muslim man , and therefore stricter control of women is seen as necessary .
Islam ’s obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage .
In Muslim countries , Western feminism is seen as irrelevant and part of the wider process of colonisation .
I attended a Saturday afternoon meeting of the New Muslim Sisters at the notorious East London Mosque .
Last year , the venue was criticised for hosting a pre-recorded talk by Anwar al - Awlaki , the radical cleric based in Yemen whom US officials claim acted as a spiritual leader for three of the 9 / 11 hijackers .
The room is packed with women and their children .
We sit in a circle and introduce ourselves .
I am the only one with an uncovered head .
I explain that I am researching a piece for a magazine on women who convert .
No one is uncomfortable with me being there and the room is vibrating with warmth and friendliness .
There are women from Tanzania , Australia , France and the UK , a number of black and mixed - race Londoners and two Anglo - Asians born into Sikh families .
There are also Muslim - born women who say they are “ reclaiming ” their religion , having been brought up by fairly secular parents .
The group leader tells me I should use the term “ revert not convert .
All people were Muslim once so we are just reverting to our natural state . ”
One woman is married to a Caribbean - born man who is also a convert .
A 19 - year - old who converted six months ago constantly asks questions about modesty .
She raises the issue of menstruation , asking : “ Are we allowed to come to mosque if we are having a period ? ”
She is told yes , but she must not go anywhere near the men ’s areas , speak to any of the “ brothers ” in the communal areas , or pray .
“ You are not allowed to touch the Arabic letters in the Koran if you are menstruating .
Read it with gloves , ” says the group leader .
“ Or touch the lettering with your pencil . ”
It sounds to me as if they have accepted blatant misogyny as religious protocol .
Every sentence is peppered with several “ In sha ’allahs ( God willing ) .
“ How many children do you have ? ” “ Four , In sha ’allah . ” “ Is the Imam coming to talk to us today ? ” “ In sha ’allah , yes .
He said he would come after the brother ’s group , In sha’allah . ”
Aisha asks if she is ever allowed to show her feet ( she was hoping to be able to wear sandals in summer ) and was told : “ No .
The only part of a woman ’s body which can be shown in public is the hands . ”
The conversation turns to the five pillars of Islam .
I leave .
I meet Fatima in a Soho café .
Her name used to be Isabelle .
She was born in France and converted to Islam when she was 30 , five years ago .
Having escaped an extremely violent relationship , she decided to undergo an entire identity transformation .
“ I had moved to a new city and would walk past a group of Islamists outside my local library , handing out leaflets and encouraging people to read the Koran . ”
One man told Fatima about a “ sisters group ” for converts being held at the mosque and the following day she found herself in a hall with 20 other women and their children .
“ It gave me such a warm feeling to be a part of something that I knew there and then Islam was for me .
I have never looked back . ”
Moving to London last year to be closer to her sister , her only surviving relative , Fatima found that she could instantly make friends with other Muslim women by attending one of the many groups in the local mosque .
“ I feel I could go anywhere in the world now and be safe and surrounded by friendly faces . ”
Not everything in Fatima ’s life is easy , however .
Her unmarried and childless status can arouse suspicion , and she tells me that , at her age , she is doomed to be “ permanently on the shelf ” .
Fatima has also experienced hostility from others who react to her white face beneath the hijab .
“ They seem to take personal offence at the fact that I have chosen a religion and way of life deemed only suitable for backward women from Muslim countries .
The idea that an educated Western woman would choose it puzzles them . ”
It also puzzles some Muslim - born women .
Selay Ghaffar is the director of Humanitarian Assistance for the Women and Children of Afghanistan ( HAWCA ) , an Afghan national NGO dedicated to working for the social wellbeing of women and children who live in Afghanistan or in refugee communities in Pakistan .
Much of its work focuses on male violence towards women and children .
Ghaffar is clear that women living under Islam find it “ extremely difficult , if not impossible ” to achieve anything close to equality with men .
“ Violence and abuse are allowed , even expected , because under Islam the man ’s word is law . ”
Dr Haifaa Jawad is Senior Lecturer in Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at Birmingham University and is currently writing a book on the contribution of European converts to Islam .
She believes that converting to Islam “ provides a sense of belonging and a clear identity .
Islam has clarity to it that some other religions or lifestyles do not .
Some women in the West may feel let down by feminism .
But it is probably for spiritual reasons that many women convert .
We have to ask , why go through with it despite the negative view of Islam at present ? ”
All the women I spoke to insisted that Islam affords them rights as women that no other religion does .
As one woman told me : “ In Islam , women have a much higher status than in other religions .
In Christianity , for example , the women were regarded as someone who did not even have a soul . ”
( This is , of course , untrue . )
Yasmin is a British - born woman who converted 30 years ago .
In her late teens , Yasmin travelled to Yemen with a friend who was looking for her estranged father .
She was looking forward to starting university later that year and to a career as a journalist .
While there she was gang - raped .
“ My friend left me .
I do n’t think she could cope .
I was desperately lonely and going a bit off my head .
A nurse told me Yemeni girls do n’t get raped because they dress modestly and do n’t go out alone .
It sounds mad but I decided there and then I would convert , and I did . ”
On her return to the UK , Yasmin met Mohammed , a British man of Caribbean descent , who had also converted .
They married and had a child within a year .
Mohammed started to beat her during her pregnancy and when their son was born threatened to kidnap him and take him to live in Jamaica .
“ I went to the imam for help but he just told me to look at my own behaviour .
He said a good wife does not make her husband angry . ”
Yasmin fled from Mohammed and took her son to live in a refuge .
She has changed her name and moved to another town , so scared is she of him tracking her down and killing her .
“ I know why he converted , ” she says , telling me she plans on giving up her faith and raising her son outside it .
“ Islam gave him the perfect excuse to treat his wife like dirt .
It helped him feel like a real man .
I thought being a good Muslim meant putting up with what he did to me , but no woman deserves that . ”
There are many women , I am told , who have converted to Islam , married a Muslim man and then live happily ever after .
But , despite the fact that the women I spoke to were open and generous with their time and effort to help me understand why they had converted , I found I was unable to comprehend their choices .
Perhaps it is my disdain for all religion , perhaps my radical feminism .
And so I continue to ask , why do women in the West , having grown up with the benefits that four decades of feminism have brought , choose a lifestyle and religion which brings them such a subjugated existence ?

I can remember this cartoon being passed around my Computers class in 10th grade .
Back then , the five kids that were addicted to Newgrounds ( myself included ) would finish their work , load up NG , and watch this , usually more than once .
It 's a very different kind of humor .
The jokes in this Flash are subtle at first , just being kind of odd , rather than a " WTF ! " kind of deal .
Slowly , I enjoy that the cartoon delves deeper and deeper into surreal humor .
The rising action is sweet , gradually building upon a bizarre premise .
This makes the climax a moment that really should go down in history : the Fountain of Murray .
" What about the art ? " " What about it , " I say .
Stick figures are usually the sign of an absolutely abominable Flash , the insignia of laziness and brilliant ideas gone to waste .
Here , however , nothing would have been more suitable .
Simple art forces the viewer to focus on the humor and the truly unique style .
I 'm struggling to classify it as any specific genre .
Plot , sound , and art form a beautiful union in this production , and it's worthy of nothing less than a 10 , simply because it 's well - done , and there 's nothing else like this .

For many residents and businesses along Florida 's Panhandle , the oil spill has been met with uncertainty , CNN affiliate WALA reports .
The question for many Floridians bracing for the oil spill to head their way is n't why , or how , but simply , what to do now ?
" I guess one thing about hurricanes is you know what you can do , " Santa Rosa County Chamber of Commerce President Meg Peltier told WALA .
" You go to the store , you shop , you buy all your goodies and you get ready .
People want to get ready for this , but they do n't know what to do , " Peltier said .
Buddy Rogers , who operates a beach business , told WALA that " The phones have just about stopped ringing , and those that are calling , they 're cancelling charters . "
Rogers said , " I 've offered the boat [ to authorities ] in any way I can , pull booms , whatever they think we can do to help .
Right now , all I can do is cut all my spending , save what little bit I can . "

Tour boat captain says oil spill worse than Katrina
CNN All Platform Journalist Sarah Hoye and photojournalist Mark Biello are currently in Gulfport , Mississippi .
They spent the morning with local tour boat captains , whose livelihoods – ferrying tourists around the barrier islands – are threatened by the approaching oil spill .
Louis Skrmetta is the operations manager of Ship Island Excursions , a family - owned business since 1926 .
He told CNN that the oil coming to shore is worse than Hurricane Katrina .
" At least with Katrina we had clean water and something to eat , " he said .
" I 'd rather lose my house again than go through this . "
With his three boats docked , Skrmetta says he is considering filing for bankruptcy if he cannot operate tours this summer , his busiest time of year .

Crude oil - eating microbes
An Indiana company that specializes in removing toxic waste may hold the holy grail of oil spill cleanups : A crude oil - eating microbe .
Steve Kennedy , president of Bioremediation Inc. , told CNN affiliate WSBT his business partner in Florida is working to get the company a shot at the oil slick .
“ Ours would be a simple way , " Kennedy told WSBT .
" It would be spraying [ the product ] down and letting the microbes consume it off .
That is how it works . ”
Kennedy told WSBT : “ Us as humans , we consume steak and pizzas .
Our microbes consume hydrocarbons , and crude oil is a hydrocarbon . "
Tourism in southwest Florida
While the oil spill Friday was more fright than bite for southwest Florida , that did n't stop tourism officials in the region from fretting .

UAB researchers :
Oil slick endangers terrapins
University of Alabama - Birmingham researchers have decided not to release a group of Alabama diamondback terrapins in the Gulf this weekend due to the oil spill , CNN affiliate WBMA reports .
" If you get an oil slick in there - [ the terrapins ] live in the salt marsh , that 's going to coat the salt marshes , " Dr. Thane Wibbels , a UAB biologist told WBMA .
" And these things feed off crab and snails , and anything they eat is going to be covered in oil .
The immediate impact is they are going to be eating oil laden food .
It 's going to be bad for their health and possibly result in mortality . "
A team of researchers is heading to the Gulf , where the mature male terrapin population is " teetering , " Webbels said .

WPLG -TV : The tarpon fish threatened
Among the wildlife that could be affected by the oil spill is the tarpon fish , CNN affiliate WPLG - TV reports .
The tarpon , the icon of Florida 's $ 10 billion fishing industry , grows up to 10 feet long and can live for 80 years .
Before it swims into Florida 's waters , the tarpon grows up in the Gulf of Mexico .
" The entire path of which they are operating is under assault , if you will , " said Gerald Ault , a marine biologist who studies tarpon migration at the University of Miami's Rosensteil School .
" The timing , really , for that animal probably could n't be any worse because this is right in the middle of peak spawning period . "
Ault has detailed charts that map the location of the oil rig explosion off the coast of Louisiana and its slick growing larger than West Virginia .
The projected path of the oil , if it is carried east around the Florida peninsula , mirrors the tarpons ' migratory pattern , Ault said .
" It 's going to seriously impact or have an impact on Florida fisheries both in the Gulf and the southeastern U.S. , " Ault said .

Lesueur 's velvet gecko , ( Oedura lesueuri ) .
When it comes to habitat destruction , startling events like oil spills and deforestation are certain to grab the headlines .
Yet as a new study in the journal Animal Conservation shows , sometimes habitat destruction can be so subtle that it passes under the eyes of all but the most astute scientists .
David Pike and fellow researchers from the University of Sydney look at the case of reptiles in outcrops and find that people moving rocks less than 30 centimeters out of place can ruin the habitat for species like the endangered broad - headed snake that shelter in narrow crevices .
This impact to rocky environments is widespread across the world , particularly from reptile enthusiasts , researchers , and collectors who move rocks slightly out of place to search for their favorite species .
With an elaborate experimental design , Pike and his team were able to show that altering the position of rocks negatively impacts reptile habitat by modifying crevice microconditions that species prefer .
The study also demonstrated that the impact is easily reversible by restoring the rocks to their original position .
The researchers surveyed for lizards in Morton National Park in southeastern Australia under previously disturbed and undisturbed rocks .
Disturbed rocks are easily identifiable because they normally fit flush with underlying substrate ( i.e. they do not wobble when pushed ) and displacement usually leaves a light colored " scar . "
The researchers found that broad - headed snakes and their prey , velvet geckos , were much less likely to be found under disturbed rocks .
The scientists also conducted a field experiment in which they found 26 pairs of previously disturbed rocks and returned one rock from each pair to its original setting .
They found the restored rocks harbored a much greater number of reptiles , showing that the impact is easily reversible .
It also provides evidence that changes in the crevice habitat itself cause the decreased reptile numbers under disturbed rocks rather than people scaring the animals or collecting them .
To understand how rock displacement alters habitat microconditions , the researchers took life - sized casts of the crevices under disturbed and restored rocks and compared the differences in surface area .
They also placed data loggers in the crevices over a period of time to compare differences in microclimatic conditions .
The researchers found that restoration increased crevice surface area by 59 % and raised mean daily minimum temperatures .
The findings from this study will hopefully raise awareness among resource managers in rocky environments to warn hikers and reptile enthusiasts in particular against displacing rocks from their original setting .
As the study shows , sometimes the ideal habitat for species forms over geological time and can be destroyed in the matter of a second by an act as subtle as moving a rock a few centimeters out of place .

Chinese hydropower lobbyists are calling for construction of the world 's biggest hydro-electric project on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra river as part of a huge expansion of renewable power in the Himalayas .
Zhang Boting , the deputy general secretary of the China Society for Hydropower Engineering , told the Guardian that a massive dam on the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo - the Tibetan name for the river - would benefit the world , despite the likely concerns of downstream nations , India and Bangladesh , which access water and power from the river .
Zhang said research had been carried out on the project , but no plan has been drawn up .
But documents on the website of a government agency suggest a 38 gigawatt hydropower plant is under consideration that would be more than half as big again as the Three Gorges dam , with a capacity nearly half as large as the UK 's national grid .
" This dam could save 200 m tonnes of carbon each year .
We should not waste the opportunity of the biggest carbon emission reduction project .
For the sake of the entire world , all the water resources than can be developed should be developed . "
That CO2 saving would be over a third of the UK 's entire emissions .
The mega - facility is among more than 28 dams on the river that are either planned , completed or under discussion by China , according to Tashi Tsering , a Tibetan scholar of environmental policy at the University of British Columbia .
Tsering publishes a map today of all of the projects that have been reported by Chinese newspapers and hydro - engineering websites .
From this , he concludes that the Tsangpo - Brahmaputra – until recently considered the last great undammed river in Tibet – will be the next focus of government efforts to increase the nation 's power supply .
One of them is a map of planned dams showing a 38 - gigawatt hydro- plant at Motuo on the website of Hydro China , an influential government enterprise responsible for dam construction .
A separate State Grid map of future transmission lines indicates the remote area will soon be connected to the rest of China 's power supply .
Hydro China and State Grid declined requests for clarification .
The government has not confirmed the existence of the scheme , but Tsering cites several newspaper reports of survey teams exploring the area and provides links to other online documents that indicate preparations for large - scale hydro - development of the area .
Given the huge expense , technical difficulties and political sensitivities of the scheme , it is far from certain of final approval by the government .
But several Chinese hydroengineers see it as the ultimate goal in an accelerating race with India to develop water resources in one of the planet 's last remote regions .
Tapping the power of the river as it bends and plunges from the Himalayan roof of the world down towards the Indian and Bangladeshi flood plains has long been a dream of the world 's hydro - engineers .
Along with the Congo river at the Inga falls , this is considered one of the two greatest concentrations of river energy on earth , but it was long thought impossible to access because of the rugged , high - altitude terrain and the risk of water - related conflict with neighbouring countries .
But China has overcome many engineering obstacles with the construction of the railway to Tibet , and its growing energy demands are spurring exploration of ever more remote areas .
" Tibet 's resources will be converted into economic advantage , " Yan Zhiyong , the general manager of China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Group , told China Energy News earlier this year .
" The major technical constraints on damming the Yarlung Tsampo have been overcome . "
He declined the Guardian 's request for an interview , saying the subject was too sensitive .
The exploitation of the Brahmaputra is already under way .
China recently announced plans to build five dams further upstream , including a 500MW hydroplant at Zangmu , which is under construction by the power utility Huaneng .
According to Tsering , the biggest of them will be a huge plant at the great bend – either at Metog , known as Motuo in Chinese , or at Daduqia .
The former would involve the construction of a series of tunnels , pipes , reservoirs and turbines to exploit the spectacular 2,000 - metre fall of the river as it curls down towards India .
Although there has been no official confirmation of plans for a dam , the discussion is far from secret .
On a prominent Chinese science forum , Zhang said a dam on the great bend was the ultimate hope for water resource exploitation because it could generate energy equivalent to 100 m tonnes of crude coal , or all the oil and gas in the South China sea .
He warned that a delay would allow India to tap these resources and prompt " major conflict " in a region where the two nations have sporadically clashed over disputed territory .
" We should build a hydropower plant in Motuo ... as soon as possible because it is a great policy to protect our territory from Indian invasion and to increase China 's capacity for carbon reduction , " he wrote last year
Any step forward is likely to be controversial .
Tibetans consider Metog a sacred region , and environmental activists warn against building such a huge project in a seismically active and ecologically fragile area .
" A large dam on the Tibetan plateau would amount to a major , irreversible experiment with geo- engineering , " said Peter Bosshard of International Rivers .
" Blocking the Yarlung Tsangpo could devastate the fragile ecosystem of the Tibetan plateau , and would withhold the river 's sediments from the fertile floodplains of Assam in north - east India , and Bangladesh . "
China 's construction of dams also raises the prospect of a race with India to develop hydropower along south Asia 's most important river .
" India needs to be more aggressive in pushing ahead hydro projects ( on the Brahmaputra ) , " Jairam Ramesh , the Indian environment minister , told the Guardian during a recent visit to Beijing .
" That would put us in better negotiating position ( with China ) .
To minimise the risk of water - related conflict , the two nations have agreed to share information about hydro-plans on the Tsangpo - Brahmaputra .
Indian media have raised concerns that Beijing may ultimately embark on a gigantic diversion scheme that would channel water away from India to the dry northern plains of China , but such fears are dismissed by Tsering , who says the dam at Metog would be for hydropower , not water diversion .
" The laws of physics will not allow water diversion from the Great Bend . "
BOSTON –
The state 's highest court has ruled Lowell school officials can't fire a teacher who failed two English fluency tests .
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said a lower court could not overturn an arbitrator 's decision in favor of the teacher , Phanna Kem Robishaw .
Robishaw began teaching in the Lowell public schools in 1992 after fleeing the Khmer Rouge regime .
She was one of five teachers at her school of Cambodian birth , where nearly half the student population was Cambodian .
In 2002 , voters approved a ballot question designed to eliminate bilingual education and require schools prove teachers are proficient in English .
Robishaw had four state teaching licenses but failed the English tests in part , she said , because she was suffering from post - traumatic stress .

This is pretty sweet : a statement from President Obama blasting Republicans for defending the low liability limits that protect oil companies from paying for the economic damages caused by spills , costs that would instead be borne by taxpayers .
I am disappointed that an effort to ensure that oil companies pay fully for disasters they cause has stalled in the United States Senate on a partisan basis .
This maneuver threatens to leave taxpayers , rather than the oil companies , on the hook for future disasters like the BP oil spill .
I urge the Senate Republicans to stop playing special interest politics and join in a bipartisan effort to protect taxpayers and demand accountability from the oil companies .
As President Obama points out , if oil companies do n't pay for the damage they cause , taxpayers will be left on the hook .
That 's effectively a big oil bailout , allowing oil companies to enjoy unlimited profits while accepting only limited risk .
It 's what Sarah Palin might call big oil bailout socialism -- if she were n't a flaming hypocrite .
Obama 's statement comes as Republicans once again filibustered Democratic efforts to move forward on raising the liability limits .
Meanwhile , Senate Democrats are rejecting a Republican counter - offer because they say it is does n't hold oil companies accountable .
Sam Stein outlines the GOP proposal :
On Monday , the Republican Party , led by Sens. David Vitter , R - La. , Jeff Sessions , R - Ala . and Roger Wicker , R - Miss put out the first GOP counter - proposal .
Under its design , a company responsible for a spill would have to pay either the last four quarters of its profits or double the current cap ( $ 150 million ) -- whichever one is greater -- to help with economic damages caused by the spill .
The GOP plan is absurd .
On paper , it seems to establish a fairly high cap for companies like BP who have multi-billion dollar profits , it 's completely arbitrary .
Moreover , with all the accounting games one can play , you 'd have to be crazy ( or bought by big oil ) to support something like this .
Harry Reid has come forward with the best plan of all : he wants to abolish the cap altogether .
Reid told reporters that a proposal pending before the Senate to lift the liability from the current $ 75 million to $ 10 billion is inadequate because the $ 10 billion figure is " too small . "
" We 're told that the damage from the oil spill in the Gulf now is $ 14 billion already , " Reid said , referring to the BP spill off the coast of Louisiana .
" I 'm for no cap . "
In other news today , Democrats are continuing to push for accountability .
Eight Senate Dems have joined together , calling for a criminal inquiry into BP 's disaster .
They feel BP may have knowingly misled the government about its ability to handle a disaster like the one unfolding int he Gulf .
The most important thing here is to get good legislation passed and to hold BP accountable , but let 's not forget that there are political implications at stake .
Right now , Republicans are demonstrating what things would be like if they were returned to power .
Democrats have their problem spots ( see Landrieu , Mary ) , but the GOP is bought and paid for by big oil .
There 's no question we need change in DC , but we need change for the better -- and Republicans are once again proving they are incapable of delivering it .
Democrats can , as long as they proceed with boldness and stay true to the mission of the Democratic Party : to represent the people .
MapReduce is one of those simple ideas that you look back on and say , well damn , I could have thought of that .
MapReduce is a simple technology that allows programmers to write two simple functions , a mapper and a reducer , and have them scale to attack very large problems .
I was recently needing to run some MonteCarlo experiments involving various graph algorithms over random graphs .
Luckily I had access to some compute time on a very large MapReduce system .
I have n’t seen much discussion on putting them together .
So , this article describes how to use MapReduce as a tool for MonteCarlo simulations .
MapReduce
Most of you already know a bit about them , but just a reminder .
MapReduce jobs consist of two main phases : Map and Reduce .
To begin , some large body of data is broken into manageable pieces ( say , one line of text from a huge file , or a single HTML file from the entire internet ) .
Each of these pieces is handed to a Mapper .
The Mapper takes this piece of the larger data and emits key - value pairs .
Before theses key - value pairs are passed to the Reducers , they are sorted and the keys are aggregated .
A reduce instance will get all of the values associated with a single key .
It will then compute some new value from this , emitting an answer ( also as a key - value pair ) .
One of the canonical examples of how this works is to calculate word - frequencies from some very large body of text .
What follows is some Python - esque pseudo code for doing just this .
def Mapper ( line ) : for x in line .
split ( " " ) : emit ( x , 1 )
This takes each word and emits it as the key with a value of one .
Now , each of these are aggregated and passed to Reducer instances .
So , for example , the following Reducer might be called with a list of values associated with the key “ the ” :
def Reducer ( key , values ) : count = 0 for v in values : count += v emit ( key , count )
Now , the output after the Reducer has run is the frequency for every word occurring in the data - set .
MonteCarlo
The basic idea of a MonteCarlo experiment is that you ’re trying to calculate the value of some underlying function or variable , and you do so by repeated random experiment .
For example , you can calculate pi easily using a MonteCarlo experiment .
Imagine you have a dart board with radius 1 meter ( big dartboard ) .
It ’s contained within a perfectly fitting square , thus it ’s 2 m on a side .
If we throw a dart , what ’s the probability that we hit the dart board , given that we hit within the square ?
It ’s the area of the board divided by the total area of the square , so .
To make the math easier , let ’s just look at the upper right quadrant .
Thus , \ ( x\in [ 0,1 ] , y\in [ 0,1 ] \ ) .
The area within the square in this quadrant is 1 , and the area of the circle is \ ( \ pi /4 \ ) .
Note that the probability of hitting the dart board is the same .
We can parameterize the circle as \ ( x ^2 + y^ 2 \leq 1 \ ) .
So , let ’s set up our experiment like this .
\ [ hit ( x , y ) = \{\begin{aligned} 1 & & \text {if }x^2 + y^ 2 \leq 1 \\ 0 & & otherwise \end{aligned} \]
Now , \ ( hit ( x , y ) \ ) is an indicator random variable .
Thus , \( \text { E}( hit( x , y ) ) = p\ ) where \ ( p\ ) is the probability of hit ( x , y ) = 1 , which we already stated is \ ( \ pi /4 \ ) .
So what ?
The expected value of this function is \ ( \ pi/4\ ) , who cares ?
Well , this means that if we uniformly choose numbers between 0 and 1 and pass them through hit ( x , y ) , and figure out what the experimental average number of hits is , this should converge to the expected value .
In other words .
Throw thousands of darts and find the ratio of hits to total throws .
This will tend toward \ ( \pi /4\ ) .
Bringing it together
Because our random numbers are drawn with replacement , there is no real difference in running 10 experiments with 100 darts and 1 experiment with 1000 darts .
But , what do we pass to the Mapper ?
When we teach undergraduates about random number generators , we show them the pitfalls of not seeding a random number generator .
Then , we show them the easy way to correct this , which is to just use the current time as the seed .
Also here , we also want our experiment to be repeatable .
So , instead of using current machine time , let ’s seed each experiment with a different number .
Thus , the input to our MapReduce job is just going to be the seeds .
For ours , lets just make the input be \ ( [ 1 , \ldots , 100 ] \ ) .
And , say that each Mapper only gets a single input .
The Mapper is where the MonteCarlo experiment actually happens .
Let each mapper run 100 sims ( not necessary , but why not ? ) :
import random def Mapper ( s ) : random .
seed ( [ s ] ) hitCounter = 0 for i in range ( 100 ) : x = random .
random ( ) y = random .
random ( ) if x * x + y * y <= 1 : hitCounter += 1 emit ( 1 , hitCounter )
Of note here is that the key being emitted is 1 for all of the Mappers .
This means that only a single reducer will run .
The reducer need just aggregate these counts :
def Reducer ( key , values ) : totalHits = 0 for v in values : totalHits += v # each value is out of 100 , to total is 100 * |values| emit ( key , totalHits / ( 100 . * len ( values ) )
Because there 's only only one Reducer , there 's only one answer from the whole experiment , the experimental average of the number of hits .
This should converge to \ ( \pi/4\ ) as the number of experiments increases .
Conclusion
Sure calculating \ ( \pi\ ) like this is serious overkill .
Yes , there are much more efficient methods .
But the point is that this is a fairly easy technique .
I used this with Erdős–Rényi random graphs with varying edge - probabilities .
So , in addition to the seed , the input to my Mappers also included the edge probability .
So , the idea is that you design a single Monte Carlo experiment with paramerized variables and pass those in to the Mappers .
This made my life much , much easier .
I was able to use several hundred CPU hours of experimentation but with only a few hours of wall time .
With Amazon 's Elastic MapReduce instances only being $ 0.015 per CPU hour , this is definitely worth putting some thought into .

Google today announced that it acquired mobile streaming service Simplify Media two months ago , and will be leveraging its technology to let Android users to stream music directly from their home PCs .
Simplify Media had previously made a very popular iPhone app with the same streaming capabilities , but announced in March that it was discontinuing its iPhone app and moving the company in a " new direction . "
It turns out that direction was being bought by Google .
During a keynote presentation today , Google vice president of engineering Vic Gundotra revealed the company 's plans to build Simplify Media 's technology into Android .
SimplifyMedia 's server application runs on both Windows and Mac computers , and can stream music from apps like iTunes , WinAmp , and Windows Media Player .
It can also stream photos from apps like iPhoto .
Music and photos can then be streamed from a home computer to a remote one , or to an iPhone or iPod touch using the Simplify Media iPhone app .
According to Gundotra 's comments , Google will focus on enabling music streaming from home PCs to Android - based mobile devices .
This is in contrast to services like Pandora , Spotify , or the soon - to - be defunct Lala , which streams music to mobile devices from the cloud .
Further evidence Satire Is Dead ™ can be found in the recently leaked survey of CBC national radio reporters providing management with feedback .
It reads like something written by Ken Finkleman of The Newsroom .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Via the survey , about 30 radio reporters tell a mind - boggling tale of institutional incompetence .
It 's a surprisingly amusing story , with great literary potential , and you might as well enjoy it : it 's your tax dollars at work .
Like most listeners I 'd noticed the sudden decline in CBC national radio news , but now I know the reason : The Hub .
Here 's the back story .
Management is trying to integrate national radio and local TV so one reporter can serve both outlets .
This efficiency will be achieved through The Hub , a layer of middle management that is supposed to select stories for use across platforms .
Reporters grouse that The Hub is a world - class time - waster transferring newshounds from phone to phone or leaving them on hold like some pitiful cable customers .
The Hub is a " black hole " into which story pitches disappear , yet reporters are forbidden to talk to the individual show producers .
The Hub is actively interfering with newsgathering .
" It 's 1:24 p.m . and I have just received ' clearance ' on my assignment , " one correspondent reports , with barely concealed disdain for managers who do n't know the basics of journalism .
( A radio reporter could have filed five stories in that time , without breaking a sweat . )
More than 40 per cent of the journalists say they can't get a good story to air anymore .
Apparently , The Hub is a barrier of TV - serving people " not qualified to be called junior reporters . "
A whopping 90 per cent of those surveyed say " radio culture " is much worse than it was a year ago .
A recurring theme is that there are too many chefs in the kitchen : " I 'm not even sure who my boss is .
Seriously .
And I 'm not the only one , " one commenter reports .
Do n't touch that dial
I 'm sure The Hubsters are green , given that they do n't know enough to lie about some things : " Most do n't even listen to national [ radio ] news -- I know because they 've told me , " another reporter tells us .
I sympathize with that .
I do n't listen to CBC national radio news much either .
Not since I awoke to the startlingly irrelevant announcement that Mackenzie Phillips would be on Oprah later that day telling us all about how her father ( Papa John Phillips ) had sexually abused her .
At the time I thought some line - up editor was having a bad day .
But now I know it 's The Hub .
The earnest survey questions about this initiative elicit delightfully wry responses .
" Do you feel there are more or fewer opportunities ? " our publicly - funded managers ask .
" If opportunities mean putting out fires all the time because mistakes are being made , then there are more opportunities , " comes one response .
Asked if they felt valued by radio news managers , many wags piped up with some variation on , " Is someone managing radio news ? "
Phil in the blanks
The survey develops into a weirdly compelling story as characters begin to emerge through the comments .
One talented producer named " Phil " has his hard work acknowledged repeatedly by otherwise disgruntled bingo callers .
" I 'm worried Phil will be fired , " my computer consultant said , after reading the novel - in - comments .
" Management is trying to kill the radio journalism culture , which means they 'll kill all the remnants . "
I 'm worried about Phil too .
But I 'm cheering for the swashbuckler from the East Coast who is openly defiant of a system that asks him to do bad journalism in the name of being a good employee .
" I'm in rebel - held Halifax , " he writes , explaining why he had n't signed on to some practice or other .
I 'm dying to know more about the Atlantic revolutionaries : is there a coup d'etat in the works ?
When a Hub becomes ' impotent '
Of course there 's the smarty - boots who can't resist calling the bosses idiots to their faces , with a cockiness that implies he or she is close to retirement .
" The Hub is impotent .
What else do you expect when you have a level of editorial judgement that 's removed from the actual program that is the end user of the content ? "
And there 's always one savvy reporter who is a little sharper than the pack .
This one cuts through management 's attempt to mollify its cranky staffers with a much - approved statement that " Radio has often been said to have a unique , strong culture . "
" Culture smulture .
We have different deadlines [ than television ] .
We have an ability to tell stories when there are no pictures and no stars driving the story ...
This is n't a culture .
It 's journalism .
What TV does is sometimes journalism .
Usually it 's just pictures with words . "
Astute as that comment is , it 's also a touch disingenuous .
That commenter 's view reflects the wider culture of journalism , which has always had contempt for TV .
The nastiest critics include journos who work in the medium .
I recall a video editor who used to refer to TV as " radio with wallpaper . "
One cameraman liked to call TV reporters " walking special effects . "
Another referred to them as " mic stands . "
Keep it in the family ?
Management 's attempt to spin this at InsideTheCBC.com proves more of a confirmation of the staffers ' views than a defence .
They point out the morale problem is not widespread and the survey represents only 30 staffers .
( Oooh , does this mean there are more leaked surveys coming ? )
Then they introduce us to Cathy Perry , executive producer of CBC news , who is credited with creating The Hub .
She says it 's unfortunate the survey ended up online .
( For whom ?
I 'm enjoying it immensely . )
" I think we just hurt each other here , " she tells the site .
" We should be able to have these debates and share opinions without having it go out on the Internet . "
I hate to tell her this , but had she read the surveys she 'd see the reporters felt ignored .
Or maybe they just can't cut through The Hub to reach her ?
There 's no use crying over lost stories .
CBC may be short on journalism these days , but this survey is a bang - up radio drama .
Or in the spirit of the integrated newsroom maybe some webisodes ?
I want to hear more from this plucky band of malcontents and the news - blind deskers who order them about .
Perhaps we could flesh out the characters in the next installment ?
I need to know if Phil survives the coming decimation .
Will Halifax rebels succeed in a coup ?
And who is the real villain ?
There 's a recurring character on The Hub with such lousy news judgment that he 's relying on the newspapers to tell him what he should cover -- I nominate him .
Having seen that survey , I 've no doubt the radio scribes are talented enough to write a series .
And I understand they have lot of free time in the mornings while waiting for their assignments .
I can even suggest a tagline .
The Hub : it is n't a problem , it 's an opportunity .

A heavy runaway star rushing away from a nearby stellar nursery at more than 400 000 kilometers per hour , a speed that would get you to the Moon and back in two hours .
The runaway is the most extreme case of a very massive star that has been kicked out of its home by a group of even heftier siblings .
Tantalizing clues from three observatories , including the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope 's newly installed Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) , and some old - fashioned detective work , suggest that the star may have travelled about 375 light - years from its suspected home , a giant star cluster called R136 .
The homeless star is on the outskirts of the 30 Doradus Nebula , a raucous stellar breeding ground in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud .
The finding bolsters evidence that the most massive stars in the local Universe reside in 30 Doradus , making it a unique laboratory for studying heavyweight stars .
30 Doradus , also called the Tarantula Nebula , is roughly 170 000 light - years from Earth .
Nestled in the core of 30 Doradus , R136 contains several stars topping 100 solar masses each .
The observations offer insights into how massive star clusters behave .
" These results are of great interest because such dynamical processes in very dense , massive clusters have been predicted theoretically for some time , but this is the first direct observation of the process in such a region , " says Nolan Walborn of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and a member of the COS team that observed the misfit star .
" Less massive runaway stars from the much smaller Orion Nebula Cluster were first found over half a century ago , but this is the first potential confirmation of more recent predictions applying to the most massive young clusters . "
Runaway stars can be made in a couple of ways .
A star may encounter one or two heavier siblings in a massive , dense cluster and get booted out through a stellar game of pinball .
Or , a star may get a " kick " from a supernova explosion in a binary system , with the more massive star exploding first .
advertisement
" It is generally accepted , however , that R136 is young enough that the cluster 's most massive stars have not yet exploded as supernovae , " says COS team member Danny Lennon of the Space Telescope Science Institute .
" This implies that the star must have been ejected through dynamical interaction . "
The runaway star research team , led by Chris Evans of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh , UK , published the study 's results on 5 May 2010 in the online edition of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Astronomers have been on the trail of this rogue star since 2006 when a team led by Ian Howarth of University College London , UK , spotted it with the Anglo - Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory .
The observation revealed that the stellar misfit is an exceptionally hot , massive blue - white star and relatively far from any cluster in which such stars are usually found .
Hubble astronomers unexpectedly picked up another clue when they used the star as a target to calibrate the COS instrument , installed in May 2009 during Servicing Mission 4 .
Those ultraviolet spectroscopic observations , made in July 2009 , showed that the wayward star is unleashing a fury of charged particles in one of the most powerful stellar winds known , a clear sign that it is extremely massive , perhaps as much as 90 times heavier than the Sun .
The star , therefore , also must be very young , about one million to two million years old , because extremely massive stars only live for a few million years .
Sifting through Hubble 's archive of images , astronomers found another important piece of evidence .
An optical image of the star taken by the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in 1995 revealed that it is at one end of an egg - shaped cavity .
The cavity 's glowing edges stretch behind the star and point in the direction of its home in 30 Doradus .

Another spectroscopic study from the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile revealed that the star 's velocity is constant and not a result of orbital motion in a binary system .
Its velocity corresponds to an unusual motion relative to the star 's surroundings , evidence that it is a runaway star .
The study also confirmed that the light from the runaway is from a single massive star rather than the combined light of two lower mass stars .
In addition , the observation established that the star is about ten times hotter than the Sun , a temperature that is consistent with a high - mass object .
The VLT observations are part of a legacy program called the VLT - FLAMES Tarantula Survey .
The survey , conducted by an international team led by Chris Evans of the Royal Observatory , comprises more than 900 stars in the 30 Doradus region .
Like the COS observations of the star , the FLAMES results also were serendipitous .
The star 's location is far from the nebula 's central region , placing it at the edge of the FLAMES survey field .
The renegade star may not be the only runaway in the region .
Two other extremely hot , massive stars have been spotted beyond the edges of 30 Doradus .
Astronomers suspect that these stars , too , may have been ejected from their home .
They plan to analyze the stars in detail to determine whether 30 Doradus might be unleashing a barrage of massive stellar runaways into the surrounding neighborhood .
The wayward star will continue to streak across space , says team member Paul Crowther of the University of Sheffield in England , and will eventually end its life in a titanic supernova explosion , likely leaving behind a remnant black hole .

The price of a barrel of crude oil dropped below $ 70 yesterday afternoon in intra-day trading for the first time since late February thanks to continued concerns over both the European debt crisis and weaker than expected demand .
However , as the U.S. stock markets rallied to end the session in positive territory , the price of oil finished slightly over $ 70 per barrel .
Â
In trading this morning , the price of oil has climbed to $ 71.64 per barrel .
Despite this morning ’s small rally , the price of oil has fallen significantly over the last two weeks after hitting a nearly two - year high of $ 87.15 per barrel on May 3 .
The corresponding response from gasoline prices has been relatively muted , with prices falling from $ 2.94 per gallon on May 5 , to this morning ’s price of $ 2.87 per gallon .
Â
However , since we are nearing the start of the busy summer driving season , I suppose this makes sense .
Currently there are nine states reporting an average gasoline price above $ 3 per gallon , with Alaska reporting the highest price at $ 3.59 per gallon .
Â
Oklahoma has the lowest state - wide average price at $ 2.65 per gallon .

Noam Chomsky has decided not to try to travel through the Allenby Bridge border crossing a second time .
Instead , he will hold his scheduled lecture at Birzeit University by video conference from Amman .
The lecture will also be broadcast live on Al Jazeera television .
Despite reports in the Israeli media that Israel would allow Chomsky to cross , the linguist discovered yesterday that there was no official guarantee of this .
He told his hosts at Birzeit he felt the Israeli authorities were playing games .
His daughter and friends , who are traveling with him , also said they prefer not to tire the 81 - year - old with another fruitless journey .
Chomsky spoke yesterday to Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , whom he was supposed to meet in Ramallah .
Fayyad 's office released a statement saying the two men " discussed the political situation and developments in Palestine . "
Fayyad said he " strongly condemns the decision of the occupation forces to prevent Chomsky from entering Palestinian land . "
Israel 's refusal to allow Chomsky to travel to the West Bank received considerable coverage in the foreign media and blogosphere .
The BBC quoted Chomsky as saying the Israeli officials were very polite , but did n't let him in because " the government did not like the kinds of things I say and they did not like that I was only talking at Birzeit and not at an Israeli university too . "
Chomsky told Al Jazeera yesterday that nobody likes the things he says , so this puts Israel in the same category as every other government in the world .
" I asked them if they can find a government that does like the things I say . "
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Mark Regev told the New York Times yesterday that the idea that Israel prevents people critical of the government from entering is " ludicrous , " and " it 's not happening . "
Mr. Shahzad , 30 , a Pakistani - American who was naturalized as a United States citizen last year , has been charged with terrorism - related crimes and has waived his right to a speedy arraignment , officials said , meaning that he does not have to be brought to court right away .
The government has said Mr. Shahzad admitted receiving bomb - making training in the tribal regions of Pakistan and then driving the car bomb into Times Square over the weekend .
The latest details about how investigators tracked him down add to a detective story worthy of a Hollywood movie .
When New York police were alerted to the presence of the smoking Nissan Pathfinder and rendered it safe on Saturday night , they started out without any immediate suspects .
The owner had evidently taken steps to avoid being identified , buying the vehicle with cash and apparently removing the visible vehicle identification number .
But after the police found the vehicle number on a hidden part of the engine , they tracked down the Connecticut woman who had sold it .
While she did not remember the buyer ’s name and had no paperwork from the sale , she did have the number of the phone he had used to contact her .
That number led to a prepaid cellphone with no registered owner .
The authorities have said that phone received four calls from Pakistan in the hours before he bought the 17 - year - old sport utility vehicle for $ 1,300 .
When they ran all the numbers tied to that phone through government databases , the only match they got was the number Mr. Shahzad had given when he returned to the United States on Feb. 3 on an Emirates flight .
Because he was coming from Pakistan , Mr. Shahzad was pulled aside for secondary screening upon arrival , the authorities said .
After a Nigerian man tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight bound for Detroit on Dec. 25 , the federal government mandated additional screening for all passengers arriving from 14 mostly Muslim countries , including Pakistan .
That program has since been dropped in favor of a more selective screening system .
Aboriginal hunting and burning increase Australia 's desert biodiversity , Stanford researchers find
A Stanford research team is exploring what makes aboriginal hunting grounds molded by fire more biologically diverse than lands untouched by humans .
Rebecca Bird Martu hunter Burchell Taylor burns a clump of spinifex grass to reveal lizard burrows in Australia 's Western Desert .
In Australia , Martu hunter - gatherers light fires to expose the hiding places of their prey : monitor lizards called goanna that can grow up to 6 feet long .
These generations - old hunting practices , part of the Martu day - to - day routine , have reshaped Australia 's Western Desert habitats , according to Stanford University anthropologists Douglas and Rebecca Bird .
" Martu " refers to a group of about 800 indigenous Australians from eight dialect - groups that inhabit the Western Desert .
For 10 years , the Birds have been investigating Martu hunting strategies and their lasting environmental impacts .
With support from the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford , the researchers have begun to explore what makes aboriginal hunting grounds molded by fire more biologically diverse than lands untouched by humans .
" The results of our work will be used to assist conservation efforts and joint indigenous land management policy in the Western Desert , " said Douglas Bird , an assistant professor ( research ) of anthropology and principal investigator on the Woods Institute Environmental Venture Projects grant .
In many cases , humans are n't the wrench in nature 's gears but an important piece of the clockwork , he added .
And because so much of Australia 's Western Desert , from lizards to shrubs , revolves around Martu practices , conservation efforts will succeed only if they incorporate traditional goanna - hunting practices , he said .
" We 're trying to demonstrate what would happen if you did pull people off the landscape , " he said .
" What happens when you break all of these co-evolutionary links between people who 've lived on the landscape for thousands of years and the diversity of the faunal and floral community ? "
Douglas Bird Nyalangka Taylor , at right holding a hunting stick , searches for goannas in Australia with Stanford anthropologist Rebecca Bird .
Martu life
Martu life revolves around hunting and fire , Douglas Bird explained .
Martu inherit ritual duties that correspond to certain tracts of desert called " estates . "
An important part of this inheritance is the knowledge of when and where to light smoldering brush fires .
Martu never start blazes without knowing every nook and cranny of a territory and often forgo campfires when traveling through foreign estates , he said .
" You never burn unless you 're with someone who has all of that knowledge about that estate , " he added .
" If your fire were to threaten one of those totemic spots where they keep all their religious paraphernalia associated with these rituals , it 's technically punishable by death . "
The middle - aged and elderly women who typically hunt for goanna can spot the animal 's burrows and tracks better in burn scars than in thick spinifex grass , explained Rebecca Bird , an associate professor of anthropology .
Burning desert in about 55 - acre chunks , the hunters make their grounds a patchwork quilt of recently burnt earth and recovering vegetation .
These scars are much smaller than those left by lightning wildfires , which char an average of 2,000 acres .
Burning back grasses and other fire - prone plants encourages the growth of a diverse range of annual vegetation , she said .
The variable turf of Martu hunting grounds allows small mammals to find plenty of places to hide from predators , she added , while areas free of human burning lack this patchwork quality and are home to fewer plants and animals .
" The thing that anthropogenic fire does is rearrange the landscape variation into smaller and smaller bits , " said project collaborator James Holland Jones , an assistant professor of anthropology and a Woods Institute center fellow .
" It happens to be the scale that animals , plants and people work at . "
While Martu families believe strongly in preserving their lands and know all the animals and plants that benefit from burning , their fires are , first and foremost , tools for nabbing goanna meat .
" Martu do n't think of it as , ' We apply fire in order to promote the future long - term biodiversity , ' " Douglas Bird said .
" They can talk about all those effects , but that 's not what maintains the system . "
To determine the impact of Martu hunting practices over time , the research team is searching the geologic record for evidence of burning thousands of years into the past .
The researchers also will recreate the diversity of historic plant communities using molecular clues hidden in animal remains .
Conserving Australia 's deserts
Despite growing awareness of the role that fire plays in wild space , many Australians have been slow to accept Martu burning practices , Rebecca Bird said .
" They see it as a destructive force .
It 's in line with the thinking of most ecologists who view humans as a disturbance of the natural equilibrium , " she said .
" The Martu perspective is much more that humans are part of it all . "
Most Australian conservationists have only paid lip service to Martu hunters , Douglas Bird noted .
But desert conservation programs wo n't work unless they include an understanding of Aboriginal fire , he said .
And because hunting is so central their culture , Martu men and women will only accept land - management practices that are compatible with their day - to - day subsistence .
" When you 're drafting a fire - management program for a national park , if it 's not done with respect to the actual practice of folks and the tradeoffs people face on a daily basis , then those prescriptions are disregarded , " he said .
To bring Aboriginal representatives into a true dialogue on land management , a delegation from the Western Desert will meet with researchers on the Stanford campus in 2011 or 2012 .
The Birds and Martu leaders also will host an international conference for anthropologists and ecologists in Australia in 2011 on the role of fire in hunter - gatherer communities and ecosystems .
A goal of the conference is to communicate that " indigenous knowledge is not different from scientific knowledge , " Rebecca Bird said .
" Through generations of hunting for goanna , Martu appreciate fire for what it can be : a tool for shaping human communities as well as the natural world , " she said .
" They see the burned areas as beautiful .
They say , ' It 's safe .
There are no snakes , no nasty things living here now that we 've cleaned it up . ' "

Every now and then a web project will come up that has special and unique layout requirements , and the current capabilities of CSS just are n’t enough .
With projects such as these , jQuery can be your best friend .
So here are 10 jQuery plugins to help you out with page layouts .
The UI .
Layout plug - in can create any UI look you want – from simple headers or sidebars , to a complex application with toolbars , menus , help - panels , status bars , sub - forms , etc .
This plugin let ’s you build full featured and fully skinnable containers .
The container can be set to draggable , resizable , collapsable and minimizable .
The project aims at providing web designers with a way to use the W3 ’s CSS Template Layout Module today .
As a jQuery plug - in , the script parses a given set of CSS rules and displays the content as indicated in the specification .
Options include the ability to select the CSS parsed , as well as an optional prefix to use for the CSS rules .
Specifying a prefix allows style rules that are interoperable with a possible future browser implementations .
Masonry is a layout plugin for jQuery .
Think of it as the flip side of CSS floats .
Whereas floating arranges elements horizontally then vertically , Masonry arranges elements vertically then horizontally according to a grid .
The result minimizes vertical gaps between elements of varying height , just like a mason fitting stones in a wall .
Columnizer will automatically layout your content in newspaper column format .
You can specify either column width or a static number of columns .
jQSlickWrap forces text to wrap around the contents of an image , not just its bounding box as it does when you use a float with CSS .
Equal Heights loops through the top - level child nodes of a specified element and sets their min-height values to that of the tallest .
js-columns is designed to help with the creation of newspaper - style column layouts in HTML .
While CSS3 has a variety of column - style properties , these are not yet widely implemented , and none help with the creation of page - based layouts .
jQue­ry Co­lum­ni­ze al­lows you to crea­te a newspa­per - li­ke co­lumn lay­out .
jLayout provides four layout algorithms for laying out HTML elements in web pages .
This plugin allows you to lay out your elements with as little code as possible , and behaves correctly when used with margins , padding and borders .
9:40 PM : We ’re now getting a clearer view of the terrain in PA - SEN .
And the upshot seems to be that Specter racked up a good margin in Philadelphia .
But Sestak is doing well enough pretty much everywhere else that he ’s looking like the winner .
Way to early to call it .
But that ’s how it ’s looking at this moment .
9:55 PM : Judy Miller resurfaces as elections commentator on Fox .
Huh .
9:57 PM : As I noted earlier , remember that in the Arkansas Senate primary Blanche Lincoln ’s real opponent is n’t so much Bill Halter as it 50 % +.
And right now she ’s a few points shy .
10:00 PM : Sestak ahead of Specter by 2 with 40 % of the vote in .
10:03 PM : And now it ’s 4 points .
10:04 PM : The margin is still close with less than 50 % of the votes in .
But if you look at the map , it does n’t seem like Specter has enough places left to find the votes to catch up .
Too much of the vote has already come in in Philly .
And Sestak ’s doing well in Pittsburgh area .
10:09 PM : Now that the PA - SEN race seems pretty clear , check out PA - 12 , down at the bottom of our scoreboard .
That ’s Jack Murtha ’s old district .
About a third of the vote in , and the Dem Critz is kicking the Republicans butt .
Now , a lot of the Republicans ’ big areas have n’t reported in yet .
But that ’s a big margin .
And if the Dems can hold on to that seat — which is a classic swing district ( went for Kerry , went for McCain ) with a cultural tinge that should be difficult for Dems this year — that ’s going to be a big deal .

When the Falcon 9 rocket makes its inaugural test flight , expected later this month , it will carry with it NASA 's hopes for a new generation of low - cost rockets to ferry cargo and people into space .
The rocket -- touted as a possible savior of human spaceflight -- could also solve a serious problem facing the next generation of space probes .
Satellites that observe Earth and nearby planets , as well as space telescopes able to look deep into the cosmos , are about to be hit by the retirement of the Delta II rocket , a workhorse that has launched 60 percent of NASA 's science missions during the past decade .
Among NASA 's stable of rockets , the Delta II is the right size for all but the most ambitious science missions , and at about $ 50 million per rocket the price was right too -- ten years ago .
But since then , the cost of a Delta II launch has roughly doubled , making it unaffordable .
The last science launch scheduled for the Delta II is in 2011 , for GRAIL ( Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory ) , a mission to study the Moon 's core by mapping tiny variations in its weak gravitational field .
" We 're almost reaching the stage of desperation for launch vehicles , " says Jack Burns , a space scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder and a member of NASA 's science advisory committee .
NASA science chief Edward Weiler adds , " If there is no replacement ever for the Delta II , that would take away a critical capability . "
He hopes that in three or four years the Falcon 9 , developed by SpaceX of Hawthorne , Calif. , will emerge as a low - cost replacement .
" Very much hoping , I might add . "
SpaceX unveiled its plans for Falcon 9 in 2005 , and a year later won NASA contracts worth $ 278 million to develop rockets that could carry supplies and science experiments to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
In December 2008 , SpaceX won a $ 1.6 - billion contract for 12 ISS resupply flights , up until the end of 2015 .
The rocket 's potential role expanded in February , when President Barack Obama proposed axing the suite of NASA rockets intended to replace the Space Shuttle and once again send humans to the Moon .
Some $ 6 billion over 5 years -- money that would have gone to the Constellation rockets -- would instead be ploughed into commercial providers such as SpaceX , in the hope that they could transport not only cargo , but people as well .
This radical transition is still very much in doubt , as legislators in Congress fight to protect space - industry jobs .
Yet even the most ardent critics of Obama 's new space vision are eager to see whether Falcon 9 can help to keep NASA astronauts in space .
In the obsession over human space flight , many are overlooking the role that the Falcon 9 could have in replacing the Delta II , which came to prominence during a golden era in the 1990s when rockets were plentiful and relatively inexpensive .
The rocket 's biggest buyer , the U.S. Air Force , had to launch a constellation of global positioning satellites , and private satellite - communication companies such as Iridium were also snapping up the rockets by the handful .
But then the communications satellite market dried up , and the Air Force said it no longer had an essential need for the Delta II , conducting its final launch with one last year .
Instead , the Air Force has committed to sustaining the very large Delta IV and Atlas V rockets in the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program .
Price hikes
As buyers have bailed , the price of a Delta II , including launch , has shot up .
A decade ago , they were a relative bargain , ranging from $ 50 million to $ 80 million apiece .
Now , each one costs about $ 120 million -- almost as expensive as the much bigger Atlas V -- with further hikes expected .
United Launch Alliance , the joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing that makes the Delta II , would be happy to continue selling it to NASA .
The components for five rockets are waiting to be assembled , says William Wrobel , who directs NASA 's launch services program .
The problem is that , without the additional buyers and bigger market , NASA cannot afford to pay for the upkeep of the launch - pad infrastructure that the Air Force had paid for .
" NASA ca n't go it alone , " says Wrobel .
Wrobel says that most imminent mission launches , such as the 2011 launch of the heavy Mars Science Laboratory and Juno , a mission to Jupiter , needed the extra thrust of an Atlas V anyway .
But if NASA officials are forced to buy more Atlas Vs in the future , they will be paying extra for unused launch capacity .
" The more that the launch vehicle costs , the less science mission you get for your money .
Or fewer missions , " says Alan Stern , a planetary scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , NASA 's former science chief and an advocate of commercial space flight .
Several missions could take advantage of Falcon 9's leaner launch capability and lower price of about $ 50 million per launch .
These include the Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission , an Earth - observing satellite due for launch in 2015 ; the International Lunar Network , a system of landers designed to measure the Moon 's seismic activity , among other things ; and modest - sized astrophysics and planetary - science missions that would launch in 2016 .
All bets are not riding on the Falcon 9 , however , which will launch from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , and carry a prototype of its cargo capsule Dragon .
Orbital Sciences , headquartered in Dulles , Va. , and another winner of ISS cargo - transport money , is developing the Taurus II , another medium - sized launcher that is scheduled for first test flights in 2011 ( see Mid- sized rockets need a boost ) .
For the planned 2012 launch of the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ( LADEE ) , Orbital is putting together stockpiled ballistic missiles into the Minotaur 5 , which costs less than $ 50 million and is just the right size for the small Moon mission .
If Falcon 9's test launch is successful , it should be carrying cargo to the ISS within a few months .
But scientists will have to wait a while longer -- before a new rocket can carry a scientific payload , NASA requires three successful launches and a technical certification that takes about three years .
NASA hopes to certify Falcon 9 or one of its competitors by the end of 2013 .
A group of Chinese and Turkish evangelical explorers said on Monday they believe they may have found Noah 's Ark - 4000 m up a mountain in Turkey .
The team say they recovered wooden specimens from a structure on Mount Ararat in eastern
Turkey that carbon dating proved was 4800 years old , around the same time the ark is said to have been afloat .
" It 's not 100 per cent that it is Noah 's Ark but we think it is 99.9 per cent that this is it , " said Yeung Wing - cheung , a Hong Kong documentary filmmaker and member of the 15 - strong team from Noah 's Ark Ministries International .
The structure had several compartments , some with wooden beams , which were believed to house animals , he said .
The group of evangelical archaeologists ruled out an established human settlement on the grounds that one had never been found above 3500 m in the vicinity , Yeung said .
Tech enthusiasts and futurists think implantable radio chips , such as those embedded in Amal Graafstra ’s hands , could mean safety , security and convenience .
But civil libertarians are concerned about privacy .

Where ’s Jimmy ?
Just Google His Bar Code
By Gene J. Koprowski
Scientists currently tag animals to study their behavior and protect the endangered , but some futurists wonder whether all humans should be tagged too .
Scientists tag animals to monitor their behavior and keep track of endangered species .
Now some futurists are asking whether all of mankind should be tagged too .
Looking for a loved one ?
Just Google his microchip .
The chips , called radio frequency identification ( RFID ) tags , emit a simple radio signal akin to a bar code , anywhere , anytime .
Futurists say they can be easily implanted under the skin on a person ’s arm .
Already , the government of Mexico has surgically implanted the chips , the size of a grain of rice , in the upper arms of staff at the attorney general ’s office in Mexico City .
The chips contain codes that , when read by scanners , allow access to a secure building , and prevent trespassing by drug lords .
In research published in the International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development , Taiwanese researchers postulate that the tags could help save lives in the aftermath of a major earthquake .
“ Office workers would have their identity badges embedded in their RFID tags , while visitors would be given temporary RFID tags when they enter the lobby , ” they suggest .
Similarly , identity tags for hospital staff and patients could embed RFID technology .
“ Our world is becoming instrumented , ” IBM ’s chairman and CEO , Samuel J. Palmisano said at an industry conference last week .
“ Today , there are nearly a billion transistors per human , each one costing one ten - millionth of a cent .
There are 30 billion radio RFID tags produced globally . ”
Having one in every person could relieve anxiety for parents and help save lives , or work on a more mundane level by unlocking doors with the wave of a hand or starting a parked car — that ’s how tech enthusiast Amal Graafstra ( his hands are pictured above ) uses his .
But this secure , “ instrumented ” future is frightening for many civil liberties advocates .
Even adding an RFID chip to a driver ’s license or state ID card raises objections from concerned voices .
Tracking boxes and containers on a ship en route from Hong Kong is OK , civil libertarians say .
So is monitoring cats and dogs with a chip surgically inserted under their skin .
But they say tracking people is over - the - top — even though the FDA has approved the devices as safe in humans and animals .
“ We are concerned about the implantation of identity chips , ” said Jay Stanley , senior policy analyst for the speech , privacy and technology program at the American Civil Liberties Union .
He puts the problem plainly : “ Many people find the idea creepy . ”
“ RFID tags make the perfect tracking device , ” Stanley said .
“ The prospect of RFID chips carried by all in identity papers means that any individual ’s presence at a given location can be detected or recorded simply through the installation of an invisible RFID reader . ”
There are a number of entrepreneurial companies marketing radio tracking technologies , including Positive ID , Datakey and MicroChips .
Companies started marketing the idea behind these innovative technologies a few years ago , as excellent devices for tracking everyone , all the time .
Following its first use in an emergency room in 2006 , VeriChip touted the success of the subdermal chip .
“ We are very proud of how the VeriMed Patient Identification performed during this emergency situation .
This event illustrates the important role that the VeriChip can play in medical care , ” Kevin McLaughlin , President and CEO of VeriChip , said at the time .
“ Because of their increasing sophistication and low cost , these sensors and devices give us , for the first time ever , real - time instrumentation of a wide range of the world ’s systems — natural and man-made , ” said IBM ’s Palmisano .
But are human ’s “ systems ” to be measured ?
Grassroots groups are fretting loudly over civil liberties implications of the devices , threatening to thwart their development for mass - market , human tracking applications .
“ If such readers proliferate , and there would be many incentives to install them , we would find ourselves in a surveillance society of 24/7 mass tracking , ” said the ACLU ’s Stanley .
The controversy extends overseas , too .
David Cameron , Britain ’s new prime minister , has promised to scrap a proposed national ID card system and biometrics for passports and the socialized health service , options that were touted by the Labour Party .
“ We share a common commitment to civil liberties , and to getting rid — immediately — of Labour ’s ID card scheme , ” said Cameron according to ZDNet UK .
These controversies are impacting developers .
One firm , Positive ID , has dropped the idea of tracking regular folks with its chip technology .
On Wednesday , the company announced that it had filed a patent for a new medical device to monitor blood glucose levels in diabetics .
The technology it initially developed to track the masses is now just a “ legacy ” system for the Del Ray Beach , Fla. , firm .
“ We are developing an in - vivo , glucose sensing microchip , ” Allison Tomek , senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications , told FoxNews.com .
“ In theory it will be able to detect glucose levels .
We are testing the glucose sensor portion of the product .
It will contain a sensor with an implantable RFID chip .
Today ’s patent filing was really about our technology to create a transformational electronic interface to measure chemical change in blood . ”
Gone are the company ’s previous ambitions .
“ Our board of directors wants a new direction , ” says Tomek .
“ Rather than focus on identification only , we think there is much more value in taking this to a diagnostic platform .
That ’s the future of the technology — not the simple ID . ”
The company even sold off some of its individual - style tracking technology to Stanley Black and Decker for $ 48 million , she said .
These medical applications are not quite as controversial as the tracking technologies .
The FDA in 2004 approved another chip developed by Positive ID ’s predecessor company , VeriChip , which stores a code — similar to the identifying UPC code on products sold in retail stores — that releases patient - specific information when a scanner passes over the chip .
Those codes , placed on chips and scanned at the physician ’s office or the hospital , would disclose a patient ’s medical history .
But like smart cards , these medical chips can still be read from a distance by predators .
A receiving device can “ speak ” to the chip remotely , without any need for physical contact , and get whatever information is on it .
And that ’s causing concern too .
The bottom line is simple , according to the ACLU : “ Security questions have not been addressed , ” said Stanley .
And until those questions are resolved , this technology may remain in the labs .
During a follow - up interview to Wednesday 's privacy controls announcement , Wired asked Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg what he thought of Diaspora , the anti-Facebook project that four NYU students will spend the summer building .
Zuckerberg 's response : " I donated .
I think it is a cool idea . "
His support for an idea that directly opposes the openness of Facebook is somewhat surprising , especially since Zuckerberg is intent on " making the world more open . "
How much Zuckerberg donated to Diaspora 's Kickstarter fund is unknown , but he revealed that he 's motivated to help these college kids because he sees " a little of myself in them . "
Zuckerberg also claims to welcome a different approach to sharing , and looks forward to seeing whether these NYU students can come up with a new solution for handling the trickier challenges Facebook has faced in dealing with privacy around content shared with friends of friends .
We find the gesture to be quite benevolent , although it could be a more calculated maneuver to help paint the CEO in a more positive light .
BERLIN — A German priest has been suspended and ordered home from a posting in the U.S. as he faces allegations he sexually abused teenage girls in Germany two decades ago , church authorities said Tuesday .
The Roman Catholic diocese of Mainz in southwestern Germany said it had informed prosecutors in Darmstadt of the abuse allegations .
It gave little detail but said there was no suggestion that he sexually abused children under the age of 14 .
The priest has most recently been working at the German Catholic Mission in Washington , D.C. , pastoring to Germans there .
Church authorities did n't identify him .
The Mainz diocese and the German bishops conference said in a joint statement the suspended priest is suspected of " having had sexual relations in the late 80s and early 90s with female youths and young women who had confided to him in his capacity as a pastor . "
One person reported abuse to the Schoenstatt Institute of Diocesan Priests , to which the priest belongs , for help as early as 2004 , the statement said .
But the Schoenstatt Institute leadership at the time did not inform the diocese , the statement said .
Instead , the group -- citing a previous relationship between the priest and a woman -- asked the bishop of Mainz to grant him " time to reflect " and proposed that he be sent abroad , it added .
" They should have gone to the diocese " with the allegations , diocese spokesman Tobias Blum told The Associated Press .
" If we had known about it , we would never have sent him abroad . "
A spokeswoman for the Schoenstatt Institute , Kornelia Fisch , told AP the group was still trying to find out what exactly happened in 2004 .
She could not immediately say how the allegations came up again now , what exactly the priest is accused of and how many alleged victims might be involved .
" It is our interest to fully clear up these things , " Fisch said .
She said the Schoenstatt Institute has been in touch with its branch in Washington but no allegations were known there .
Blum said the priest is back in Germany but did not disclose details .
The Schoenstatt Institute had informed the diocese on March 30 , according to the statement .
Blum could not immediately say why the statement was issued three weeks later .
Separately , a prominent German bishop accused of physical abuse of children decades ago and of financial misconduct on Tuesday offered an apology .
" I am pained in my heart and sorry for causing many people grief , " Bishop Walter Mixa said in a statement without specifying what he meant .
The statement comes after Mixa met with the priest council in his Augsburg diocese in southern Germany .
It said the council " shares the concern of many about the credibility of our church . "
Mixa initially denied he had ever used any kind of violence against youngsters but later acknowledged he may have slapped children .
A special investigator has also said there were financial irregularities at a children 's home under Mixa 's responsibility .

( Natural News ) Breast reduction operations are becoming rapidly more popular among men , according to data released by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons .
The figures show that the operations increased 80 percent , from 323 to 581 , between 2008 and 2009 .
In 2004 , just 22 male breast reductions were performed .
The actual numbers are almost certainly higher -- most likely closer to 1,000 in 2009 -- as only one in three British aesthetic plastic surgeons are members of the association .
The overall rate of plastic surgeries increased by 6.7 percent between 2008 and 2009 , with only a 5 percent increase among women .
The rate of cosmetic surgeries in men , in contrast , increased by 21 percent .
" There 's a lot of pressure on men now to shape up , " said researcher Rajiv Grover .
" Men 's grooming is on the rise , and big fashion houses are using half - naked men , such a David Beckham , to advertise .
"
In the United States , male breast reduction operations have not increased so drastically , and there was actually a slight drop in 2008 , perhaps due to economic hardship .
But according to Robert Cattani of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery , the overall trend is still upward .
" We 've seen an increase , " Cattani said .
" In the last five years , I personally have done 200 to 300 male breast reductions per year .
" Breast reduction is the fourth most common form of male cosmetic surgery in the United States , following nose jobs , eyelid surgery and liposuction .
Excess mammary tissue in men , known as gynecomastia , can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions including obesity , breast cancer and the use of illegal or prescription drugs .
" Most of the time , it 's just normal variance but you have to rule out underlying causes , " said breast surgeon Sharon Rosenbaum - Smith , of St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital in New York .
" Guys ' boobs do go up and down in size as they gain or lose weight , just as women 's do .
But if you 're a pot smoker and you are overweight , just changing your lifestyle may mean you would n't need to have a breast reduction .

You would think a basic winning tactic in football would be to kick the ball between the posts .
Your opponent 's posts , that is .
The team that is best at this wins the match .
Most of the time that 's true , but an infamous game between Barbados and Grenada in 1994 turned logic upside - down .
Going into the last group game in a Caribbean Cup tournament ( the Shell Caribbean Cup ) , Barbados needed to beat Grenada by two goals in order to reach the final .
A draw after 90 minutes would result in extra time whereas anything less than winning by two goals would see Grenada through to the final .
The catch , however , was that the organisers had decided that in the case of extra time a golden goal would count as two goals .
Barbados took an early 2 - 0 lead , but Grenada made it 2 - 1 with seven minutes remaining .
Barbados were heading out unless they scored a goal — any goal !
One Barbadian striker realised that his team were unlikely to score another goal against Grenada , with only a few minutes to go and Grenada playing an ultra-defensive tactic .
Instead , he decided that their best chance of winning was to make the game go into extra time and score a golden goal , which would count as two goals .
So he promptly powered the ball past his own stunned goalkeeper to make it 2 - 2 .
Now , Grenada needed to score a goal — at either end — to avoid extra time and to go through to the final .
The Grenada players , initially stunned by the goal and suddenly realising what was going on , turned around and headed for their own net .
Now the comedy really starts as the Barbadians had anticipated this move and rushed to defend the Grenada goal — in addition to their own — until the whistle went for extra time .
Now be honest , who could make up a story like this ?
In the end , Barbadian ingenuity was rewarded as one of their strikers scored the winning goal four minutes into extra time , which sent Barbados to the final .
As was to be expected , the Grenadians were not amused .
Grenada manager James Clarkson was furious .
" I feel cheated , the person who came up with these rules must be a candidate for the madhouse .
" The game should never be played with so many players on the field confused .
Our players did not even know which direction to attack ; our goal or their goal .
I have never seen this happen before .
In football , you are supposed to score against your opponents in order to win , not for them . "
Just in case you doubt this whole story and its authenticity , have a look at this videoclip .

This is part of a multi-part guide on redefining the CHP monad and primitives to generate a CSP model rather than executing the program .
In this relatively self - contained part , we examine the issue of tracking values as they are communicated around the process network .
Modelling the mere occurrence of communications and synchronisations themselves is quite straightforward .
We just label each created channel / barrier with a unique identifier , and then every time it is used we record in the model which channel / barrier was used .
We can , however , do a bit better than that .
Consider this code :
do x <- readChannel input writeChannel output x
What if we could tell that the value sent on the output channel was the same value as the one received on the input channel — that would be much more powerful than simply recording that a communication took place on the input channel followed by a communication on the output channel .
Identifiable Bottoms
Haskell has a function , undefined :: a .
This produces a “ bottom ” value of any type , and will give an error if evaluated .
It has a counterpart , error :: String -> a that allows the error message to be customised to be something useful .
The Control .
Exception module provides a try function that can catch these messages , and an evaluate function to examine values .
If we put all of these together , we can create dummy values of any type , and later on we can identify them ( but see the limitations section at the end of this post ) .
This is the same technique used by Lazy SmallCheck , which we used for modelling IO computations in the previous part of the guide .
Input and Output
When an input occurs , we use the identifier of the channel ( which is passed to the fakeComm In function below ) to form a uniquely - identifiable bottom value , which we make a note of in our state and then return :
bottomPrefix :: String bottom Prefix = " __CHP.bottom__ " fakeCommIn :: Integer -> CHP a fakeCommIn n = addSpecT1 $ do st <- get put $ st { chpNextBottom = succ ( chpNextBottom st ) } return ( error $ bottom Prefix ++ show ( chpNextBottom st ) , Sync $ Right ( n , DirInput , chpNextBottom st ) )
The Sync .
Right item holds the identifier of the channel , “ n ” , the direction of the communication , and the identifier of the bottom value involved .
In our corresponding output function , we watch out for these bottom values :
fakeCommOut :: Integer -> a -> CHP ( ) fakeCommOut n x = addSpecT1 $ do possErr <- lift $ C.try $ C.evaluate x case possErr of Left ( C.ErrorCall s ) | bottom Prefix `isPrefixOf` s -> return ( ( ) , Sync $ Right ( n , DirOutput , read $ drop ( length bottom Prefix ) s ) ) --
Was n't one of our bottoms : _ -> return ( ( ) , Sync $ Left n )
That is all the core code we need .
Our replacement channels just store the channel identifier , and delegate reading and writing on channels to the above two methods .
Example
For an example , we will use a process that reads two values from one pair of channels , and sends them out , swapped , on another pair of channels :
import Control.Concurrent .CHPSpec import Control .
Monad ( replicateM ) swap :: ( Chanin a , Chanin b ) -> ( Chanout b , Chanout a ) -> CHP ( ) swap ( inA , inB ) ( outB , outA ) = do ( a , b ) <- readChannel inA < ||> readChannel inB writeChannel outB b < |*|> writeChannel outA a p :: CHP ( ) p = do leftIn <- oneToOneChannel ' $ chanLabel " leftIn " leftOut <- oneToOneChannel ' $ chanLabel " leftOut " rightIn <- oneToOneChannel ' $ chanLabel " rightIn " rightOut <- oneToOneChannel ' $ chanLabel " rightOut " swap ( reader leftIn :: Chanin Int , reader rightIn :: Chanin Int ) ( writer leftOut , writer rightOut ) main :: IO ( ) main = specify True p >>= putStrLn
This program is able to generate the following model , that correctly follows the values through the process :
channel left
In channel left
Out channel right
In channel right
Out main_1 = ( (( leftIn?x_1 -> SKIP ) ||| ( rightIn?x_2 -> SKIP ) ) ; (( leftOut!x_2 -> SKIP ) ||| ( rightOut!x_1 -> SKIP ) ) )
Limitations
The technique of identifying bottoms is far from foolproof .
In particular , for Int , “ 1+x ” will be identified as being the same as “ x ” .
What we are really identifying is that the bottom value received is used somewhere prominent in the output .
So the idea is nice , but the execution is imperfect .
Tristan Allwood suggested looking at stable names — these may help to reduce the imperfection , but they do not provide a strong enough guarantee to make the technique water - tight either .
I have now covered most of the model - generation technique .
In the next part I will tackle the complex matter of recursive processes , probably followed by a final part showing how the top - level specify method works — at which point I hope to release all of this as a library , alongside the next CHP release ( with the mtl dependency removed ) .
Alfredo Fernandez Rodriguez
Alexis Jardines graduated with a degree in philosophy from the St. Petersburg State University ( 1983 ) and received a doctorate degree in 2001 from the University of Havana , an institution where he works as a tenured professor .
With a stoic attitude , Alexis has learned how to endure the ostracism to which people are subjected who do not parrot the authorized line .
Currently he is working as a professor in a municipal university , considered the last rung in Cuban higher education .
There , he is my co-worker and friend , a circumstance that allowed me to conduct this interview with him .
In the Cuban academic panorama , philosophy has been the specialty with the most obscure destiny ; it has been restricted to Marxism and its materialistic historical vision almost since the victory of the Revolution in 1959 .
For five decades now , metaphysical thought in Cuba has suffered from a crusade waged against it , which was only overcome by what occurred in those countries belonging to the now extinct socialist bloc .
Even with this , Minerva ( the goddess of wisdom ) found a crack in the materialistic empire of ideas in Cuba ; she disguised this as a small tropical Quixote , brought to us as Professor Jardines .
Today he responded to a few questions on a hot May afternoon .
Alfredo Fernandez : Alexis , you are the sole intellectual who writes about philosophy in Cuba .
Nonetheless , outside of a small circle of admirers , friends and students in your present course , your books are ignored – or at least they ’re ignored by readers .
To what do you believe this is due ?
Alexis Jardines : A co-worker and friend from the Complutense University , Ignacio Gomez de Liaño , one of the most competent teachers I know — told me , after the publication of my first book in Madrid , that I was a writer for minorities .
I was left perplexed by such a severe observation .
What did he mean by that , that my book did n’t sell ?
Gradually I began to realize the accuracy of his opinion .
Generally I write about dense issues and for people who know or have previous knowledge of the matter in question .
Nevertheless , I make a tenacious effort to present the material in the most intelligible form possible , without falling into the trap of oversimplification of course .
If you unite all this with the unfortunate half - century long loss of philosophical culture in Cuba , and to the almost absolute dominance of criticism and of historiography among Cuban intellectual life , you will have an approximate answer to your question .
In any case , I would dare to say that I am indeed ignored by the media and by most of the public , but not by seasoned readers .
The print runs of my books are quite small ; they range between 1,000 and 1,500 copies – which are sold out immediately .
So , if my readers are few , at least they must figure among the most select .
On the other hand , there is only one publishing house on the whole island that puts out philosophical writings , so today this situation is making it impossible for me to publish .
There ’s not even one journal that specializes in philosophical issues , despite Cuba having had the best philosophical journal in all Spanish - speaking America in the 1940s and ‘ 50s .
AF : In 1989 you wrote “ Réquiem , ” a controversial essay in which you revealed the true nature of Soviet Marxism and the supposed philosophical thought of Marx , Engels and Lenin .
Despite having been withdrawn from the bookstores , thousands of copies managed to be sold in less than a month with the consequent academic intellectual stir .
From what I ’ve found out , this was the reason your separation from the University of Havana was requested ( a step that would ultimately never materialize ) , the place where you worked as a professor .
What made you decide you to write an essay that seemed designed for the Cuban of 2010 ?
Alexis Jardines :
Those were other times ; 2000 copies of “ Réquiem ” were published .
The overwhelming majority of these were snatched off the shelves in a question of 15 days .
However , the curious thing is that the university itself bought a good portion of the copies that were sold at the bookstore at L and 27th streets ; its purpose though was to destroy them ( funds of the University of Havana ’s Young Communist League were directed toward that end ) .
The purpose of the writing , which diverged from the framework of what I commonly wrote , was to settle my tab with the Marxist tradition of thought .
This was especially true of Soviet Marxism , which was based on the supposition that thinking creatively was an exclusive attribute of the founding fathers ( Marx , Engels and Lenin ) .
I have my own thoughts , and Marxism — as a philosophy — is a farce ; moreover , that of the Soviet brand is a farce that suffocates .
So , in order to dedicate myself to writing my own books , I published what I considered a requiem for that straightjacket .
It had to be abandoned since it lacked that which , according to Einstein , all theory should have if in fact a valid theory : an external justification and an internal end .
AF : Alexis , you promote “ actual - virtual correlations ” as the central axis of your philosophical system as a way of upgrading the systems of Edmund Husserl and Henry Bergson .
Given that this thought is so very different , how has it been received among your co-workers ?
Alexis Jardines : Allow me a small correction .
As I present and develop them , the concepts of the actual and the virtual are the heirs of the whole western metaphysical tradition .
What happened with Husserl and Bergson is that they were the first philosophers who became conscious of the importance of these concepts .
In fact , until these thinkers , such terms — especially as correlated concepts — simply did not figure in the history of philosophy or , since they were not absolute , in any of the important philosophical systems .
Just as the Aristotelian categories of “ action ” and “ potential , ” the “ ideal ” and the “ material , ” as well as “ possibility ” and “ reality , ” or “ essence ” and “ existence ” are all subsumed in the single idea of correlations or “ actual - virtual configurations , ” without them , one simply cannot think of the current state of culture .
In terms of the acceptance of such propositions , it is only a matter of time .
Due to superficial reflection , undoubtedly , it might seem that the philosopher is a species in danger of extinction .
On the other hand , the sole reason there are few philosophers in the world is that the world has decided to begin to philosophize .
I do n’t know if someone else has brought this to light , but we are in the presence of a new type of knowing , one that goes beyond perfomative and paralogistic knowledge described by Jean - François Lyotard in his celebrated postmodern manifesto ( The Postmodern Condition ) , because the dividing lines between particular and philosophical knowledge are increasingly blurred .
Contrary to Richard Rorty , I believe I see a pan-epistemological world in which knowledge , that in a Hegelian fashion seeks to know itself in itself , realizes that the world is its crystallization , as was continued in the phenomenology of Husserl , and not the other way around .
If I ’m correct , my co-workers — and not only them — will still take some time to grasp the idea that history as well as the objective world exist in - and - for culture .
Therefore humans are not a result , but an absolute “ prius . ”
This is as worth as much as saying that we did n’t come from the “ Big Bang ” or from proto - human species but that — in my terms — these are “ structured knowledge ” in reality .
Let ’s make the case for our African ancestry .
We virtually built this in the logical - discursive plane based on a situation of genetic crossbreeding that we can currently note in the form of appropriate technology .
We then demand , through hypothesis , that this theoretical construct is the cause of a biological , vital phenomenon .
The question would be how a theory could be transmuted and produce human beings ?
Or , formulated in a more specific way : how are “ living ” individuals able to be the product of the evolution of the species ( families , genera ) whose nature is taxonomical - conceptual ?
The great dilemma of the theory of evolution , in any one of its variants , is that in principle the species evolved — not the individuals — however , species “ do not have genes . ”
As you see , without an understanding of the actual - virtual nature of reality there is no way of reconciling ourselves with the epistemological fissures that act to undermine the “ structure of plausibility ” ( Berger ) of science .
AF : In your book “ Filosofía Cubana ( Cuban Philosophy in a nutshell ) .
Ensayo de historia intellectual ” ( Essay on intellectual history ) you affirm :
What is being done presently in Cuba in the academic study of philosophy is neither philosophical nor Cuban . ”
Supposing that you ’re right , I ask :
What possibilities do you see in Cuban thought for recapturing the forgotten path of creativity in the field of ideas ?
Alexis Jardines : Many , provided there is respect for the basic principle of philosophizing around everything , which was clearly recognized ever since Schelling and Hegel in the freedom of thought .
Obviously this not only involves epistemological liberty , but also political freedom .
On the other hand , it ’s necessary to infuse trust in our future philosophers , in the fact that they can and should think with their own minds .
In this sense , Marxism ( the ghastly and doctrinal Soviet model as well as decrepit western Marxism ) constitutes a true obstacle .
Paraphrasing Ortega y Gasset — whose influence , has had more to do in defining our process of cultural constitution than that of whole legions of Marxists — said that what was good in Cuban Marxism was that which was Cuban , not that which was Marxist .
In my particular case , I do n’t situate Marx above any authentic philosopher , but nor do I excommunicate him .
I recognize his effort as I do that of a Freud or a Lévi-Strauss – no more , no less .
AF : So Alexis , do you like Jorge Mañach believe that it ’s possible to “ make philosophy at 78 º Fahrenheit ” ?
Alexis Jardines : Mañach , on the contrary , questioned it .
However , for me heat has not been a problem I can’t fight .
The real difficulty is constituted in language , and I believe what is essential is having to overcome it .
I educated myself philosophically in the Russian language .
I knew , for example , that German was ideal for philosophy , just as English seemed to be of lesser value .
But , thinking in Spanish at that time was exotic .
We did n’t have a tradition of philosophical thought in our language .
Jose Ortega y Gasset , our highest exponent , died considering himself a journalist more than a thinker – obviously he exaggerated .
So I set myself a Quixotic task , which to a large degree was also his , that of teaching philosophy to Spanish speakers .
Today I can tell you that Spanish is wonderful and that from it one can and must think of philosophy the same as or more than with any other language .
My answer : yes .
Accusing world famous astrophysicist Stephen Hawking of spreading misinformation about threats from aliens , former Canadian defence minister Paul Hellyer claimed that extraterrestrials have actually been visiting earth for decades .
Rather than harm mankind , he said , their ( aliens ’ ) spaceships have provided information for triggering today ’s microchip and IT revolution on the planet .
Hawking has recently warned humanity against contacting aliens .
“ If aliens visit us , the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America , which did n’t turn out well for the Native Americans , ” the British astrophysicist has said .
According to Hawking , if human beings tried to contact aliens , they could invade us and take away our most important resources .
“ If they ( aliens ) wanted to use our solar system , for some super project , our complaints would be like an ant colony protesting the laying of a parking lot , ” Hawking has said in a new documentary .
Hawking has also said that though most extraterrestrial life could be only in the form of small animals , but there could also be “ nomads , looking to conquer and colonize ” other planets .
Taking issue with Hawking , the former Canadian defence minister , who is an expert on the subject and has been speaking about aliens for years , said aliens have already visited earth and contributed to our technological advancement .
Hellyer told the Canadian Press that “ the reality is that they ( aliens ) have been visiting earth for decades and probably millennia and have contributed considerably to our knowledge . ”
He said our computer screens have their origins in alien spaceships .
“ Microchips , for example , fiber - optics , they are just two of the many things that allegedly - and probably for real - came from crashed vehicles , ” the Canadian said .
Blaming Hawking for scaring mankind about aliens , he said , “ He ( Hawking ) is indulging in some pretty scary talk there that I would have hoped would not come from someone with such an established stature .
I think it is really sad that a scientist of his repute would contribute to what I would consider more misinformation about a vast and very important subject . ”
PHOENIX -- The Phoenix Suns will wear " Los Suns " on their jerseys in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals on Wednesday night , owner Robert Sarver said , " to honor our Latino community and the diversity of our league , the state of Arizona , and our nation . "
The decision to wear the jerseys on the Cinco de Mayo holiday stems from a law passed by the Arizona Legislature and signed by Gov. Jan Brewer that has drawn widespread criticism from Latino organizations and civil rights groups that say it could lead to racial profiling of Hispanics .
President Barack Obama has called the law " misguided . "
Sarver , who was born and raised in Tucson , said frustration with the federal government 's failure to deal with the illegal immigration issue led to the passage of what he called " a flawed state law . "
" However intended , the result of passing the law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question , " he said , " and Arizona 's already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when the state can ill - afford them . "
The measure makes it a crime under state law to be in the country illegally , and it directs local police to question people about their immigration status and demand to see their documents if there is reason to suspect they are illegal .
The controversy surrounding the law has led to picketing at some road games of baseball 's Arizona Diamondbacks and a call from the Rev. Jesse Jackson for major league baseball to move next year 's All - Star Game from Phoenix .
Sarver came up with the " Los Suns " jersey idea but left it up to the players for the final decision , Suns guard Steve Nash said , and all of them were for it .
" I think it 's fantastic , " Nash said after Tuesday 's practice .
" I think the law is very misguided .
I think it 's , unfortunately , to the detriment of our society and our civil liberties .
I think it 's very important for us to stand up for things we believe in .
As a team and as an organization , we have a lot of love and support for all of our fans .
The league is very multicultural .
We have players from all over the world , and our Latino community here is very strong and important to us . "
Nash was born in South Africa and moved with his parents to Victoria , British Columbia , when he was 1½ years old .
He was one of four Canadians to light the torch in the opening ceremony of the Vancouver Olympics this year .
San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said his team was interested in taking part but could n't get new " Los Spurs " road jerseys in time for the game .
" It 's a wonderful idea , " Popovich said .
" because it kind of shows what we all should be about .
Sure there needs to be a lot of work done , obviously .
A lot of administrations have done nothing about the immigration deal and now everybody 's paying the price , especially a lot of people in Arizona .
That 's a bad thing , but the reaction is important , too , and this reaction [ the Arizona law ] , I believe with Mr. Sarver , is inappropriate . "
Phoenix general manager Steve Kerr said he and Sarver talked about making the gesture as the team flew home from Portland last week .
" We just felt like it was important , " Kerr said .
" We 're in the public eye and this is obviously a huge issue .
We acknowledge there are two sides to the issue and there are a lot of dynamics .
It 's a difficult thing to sift through and there are going to be differing opinions .
But what we 're focusing on is we want to celebrate the diversity that exists in our state and the diversity that exists in the NBA , make sure that people understand that we know what 's going on and we do n't agree with the law itself . "
The NBA Players Association released a statement criticizing Arizona 's immigration law and praising the Suns for the gesture .
" We applaud the actions of Phoenix Suns players and management and join them in taking a stand against the misguided efforts of Arizona lawmakers , " the NBAPA said .
" We are consulting with our members and our player leadership to determine the most effective way for our union to continue to voice our opposition to this legislation . "
But Kerr said " this is n't a huge political stand as much as it is just a celebration of diversity . "
He said the Suns called the NBA for approval " and they were all for it . "
Suns coach Alvin Gentry did n't want to comment on Arizona 's immigration bill and said he was focused on showing appreciation for the Latino community and Arizona 's diversity .
" I 'm not trying to duck it , " Gentry said .
" I do n't know enough about it to really comment on it .
I would think that if it had anything to do with racial profiling , then obviously as an African - American I would not be for anything that had any hint of racial profiling . "
The Suns wore the " Los Suns " jerseys twice in the regular season , and won both games .
" It 's going to be great to wear Los Suns , " Phoenix 's Amare Stoudemire said , " to let the Latin community know that we 're behind them 100 percent . "

Seasoned case modder and hater of all things beige , Jeffrey Stephenson has been squeezing fully functional mini-PCs into all sorts of strange and beautiful outer shell designs ever since first crunching a VIA mini-ITX motherboard into a cigar box in 2002 .
The latest stylish addition to his expanding collection was inspired by the six drive Thermaltake Level 10 gaming monster and includes VIA 's latest Pico board which pumps out 1080 p video , 160GB of solid state storage , 2GB of memory and a DVD burner .
Jeffrey Stephenson got his first computer in 1983 ( a Texas Instruments TI - 99 4 / A in black with brushed aluminum trim ) .
He first toyed with the idea of creating his own case mod when the invasion of the beige began but the cost of the technology necessary took a good while to reach an affordable level .
With the mantra " it does n't have to be ugly " in mind , and the timely release of the VIA mini-ITX motherboard , he managed to fit all of the necessary components into a cigar box , bringing the Humidor PC to life in 2002 and starting on an epic journey that 's resulted in over 20 case mods now dotted throughout his Florida home .
Taking it to the next level
His latest build began in January as VIA announced its new palm - sized motherboard , the EPIA P820 - 12L Pico ITX which features a 1.2GHz VIA Nano 64 - bit x86 processor on an integrated VX855 chipset and Integrated VIA Chrome9 3D / 2D AGP graphics capable of 1080 p HD playback .
Inspired by a monster of a gaming machine the Thermaltake Level 10 and a custom case mod called Edelweiss , the Level Eleven has only just now been completed .
Thermaltake Level 10 six drive gaming monster on which Level Eleven is loosely based
The flattened upright shell of Level Eleven is constructed from birch ply covered in Pennsylvania cherry veneer and contains the Pioneer DVD burner , fan and front - mounted USB ports .
Two similarly finished boxes sporting stylish aluminum detailing ( thankfully the original design , which looked somewhat like a Japanese flag was abandoned ) and vents for airflow contain the Pico board with 2GB DDR2 memory ( left ) and Intel X25 - M 160 GB SATA SSD ( right ) .
Inside the vertical panel , showing the optical drive and USB ports
Above the board 's container , which is cut away so that the USB , HDMI , VGA and Ethernet ports are showing , a T&T 11 - blade 12V fan draws air through a silver - painted 35 piece vented box with stacked fins at the top of the unit , which is where the power switch , power jack and auxiliary audio connections are found .
Below the SSD container sits a similar looking DE box ( for the purposes of creating a tiny bit of intrigue or suspense , the function of this box will be revealed later ) .
Driving the system is Windows 7 64 - bit edition .
The EPIA P820 - 12L Pico ITX and Intel X25 - M 160 GB SATA SSD
More case mod examples
Past works have had public showings in museums ( the most recent saw the Mission , Unidyne , G-metric Nano , DECOmputer , Decomatic and Pico Bayard works shown as part of a Rods and Mods event at San Francisco 's Exploratorium ) and technology events , such as six of the last eight CES trade shows .
They 're also on display at Stephenson 's website and some choice examples have made it into the gallery here .
Ingraham model , a tribute to the 1946 Stromberg Carlson model 1110H
Included here is 2008 's Ingraham model , a tribute to the 1946 Stromberg Carlson model 1110H , and similarly styled Art Deco speakers .
The Ingraham features a VIA VB8001 mainboard with the 1.6GHz VIA Nano processor , 4GB of DDR2 RAM and a 64GB SSD .
There 's also the DECOmputer , made from a 1930 's toaster .
Looking like a relic from a B - movie sci - fi epic , the cast aluminum and Bakelite box built in 2005 houses a Kontron board with a 1.8 GHz Pentium processor , a gigabyte of memory and a Seagate 40 GB HDD .
Art Deco motif finishes off the DECOmputer nicely
Walking " that fine line between genius and insanity " Stephenson created a computer within a PSU in 2005 .
This one sports an Advantech 5820 babyboard with a Geode 233MHz processor , 6GB HDD and a USB port to the top .
My personal favorite though is the Unidyne .
Sitting atop a cast iron mic stand is an aluminum - painted basswood replica of a Shure 55 microphone .
VIA 's mini-ITX board , cooling fan and HDD just slide into the cavity of the vented frame .
The Unidyne PC
And finally , for those who have n't worked it out already - the DE box on the Level Eleven stands for Decorative Element .
Making health - care reform “ abortion neutral ” was never going to be easy .
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) was the first to demonstrate that it was possible , practically and politically .
He also showed that a prolife politician could wield power within the Democratic Party — and under the purview of the “ most radically pro-abortion president in history , ” as Barack Obama is known to a certain segment of the prolife movement .
Senators Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) and Bob Casey ( D - Pa. ) came up with another way to exclude federal funding of abortion in their chamber ’s reform bill .
But at that point the Stupak Amendment took on a life of its own .
Lobbying groups who hoped to stop “ Obamacare ” insisted that the Senate bill would be acceptable only if the House added Stupak ’s language — a process that would send the bill back to the Senate , where Republicans could filibuster it to death .
Stupak expressed reservations about the Senate bill ’s abortion language , as did the U.S. bishops and the National Right to Life Committee ( sometimes jointly ) .
His stubbornness led to Obama ’s signing an eleventh - hour executive order clarifying that the Senate bill ’s alleged ambiguities would be interpreted according to the principle embodied in the Hyde Amendment : no federal funding for elective abortions .
According to Obama ’s order , Hyde will indeed apply to all funding for community health centers , and existing conscience protections will be upheld .
For pursuing prolife measures within the Democratic Party , Stupak became a target of prochoicers , who accuse him of attempting to limit “ women ’s rights . ”
Now , having helped pass health - care reform , he is under attack from the Right .
He has been called a coward and a traitor .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , desperate to burnish his right - wing credentials in an election year , sneered that Stupak “ folded like a cardboard suit in the rain . ”
In fact , Stupak has shown consistency and courage , not only in resisting the prochoice majority in his party , but also in resisting Republican efforts to use his prolife convictions to sabotage health - care reform .
After the reform bill passed last month , House Republicans filed a motion to add the language of the Stupak Amendment — a last - ditch bid to return the bill to the Senate .
Stupak took the floor to object that their use of his name was “ nothing more than an opportunity to continue to deny 32 million Americans health care . ”
Republicans booed and jeered as he insisted , “ It is the Democrats who have stood up for the principle of no public funding for abortions ....
This motion is really to politicize life , not prioritize life . ”
Stupak meant what he said all along : he wanted to extend health - care coverage without expanding direct federal funding of abortion .
He succeeded , despite the best efforts of those who claimed to support him .
For being that rarest of creatures — a politician who can hold firm to his principles and still seek honest compromise — he deserves prolifers ’ gratitude and respect .

NEW YORK , April 19 ( UPI ) -- A 1992 survey of 5,000 U.S. librarians , long withheld by a professional journal , found one in five respondents had engaged in sexual trysts among the stacks .
Will Manly , who said the New York - based Wilson Library Bulletin withheld the results of his survey in 1992 , published results recently on his Web site indicating 51 percent of librarians in the early 90s were willing to pose nude for money and 61 percent of respondents admitting to renting an X - rated film , the New York Daily News reported Monday .

Manly said the survey questions were printed in the now - defunct journal , but bosses withheld the results and fired him for the saucy survey , which he said received 5,000 responses from librarians .
The survey also found 22 percent of respondents believed condom dispensers in library bathrooms would be a good idea and 14 percent said they had been sexually harassed by a patron .
Pope Benedict XVI has just said something extraordinary : that the second Vatican Council represented the Catholic church doing the enlightenment , and for good measure the reformation , the way they should have been done the first time round .
He does n't just mean that the Catholic has now come to terms with the reformation and the enlightenment , but that it has done so and purged them of their errors .
Given his reputation as an enemy of the enlightenment and all that the council stood for , is this remotely credible ?
At the council , he said in a speech on his visit to Portugal ,
" The church , on the basis of a renewed awareness of the Catholic tradition , took seriously and discerned , transformed and overcame the fundamental critiques that gave rise to the modern world , the Reformation and the Enlightenment .
In this way the church herself accepted and refashioned the best of the requirements of modernity by transcending them on the one hand , and on the other by avoiding their errors and dead ends . "
On one level , this is quite simply breathtaking .
The Roman Catholic church has a capacity rivalled only by the Conservative party 's for keeping the words of its formulae the same and reversing their meaning .
But to claim that 500 years of struggle against the modern world have ended with the church 's accepting all the good bits and the rest of us trapped in errors and dead ends is startling even for a pope ; and especially this one .
The Tablet , reporting this , managed in an entirely deadpan way to point out that Benedict is the pope who has done most to restore the Latin Mass , which the council had abolished , and to reach out to the Lefevrists who left the church because they would not accept the Council 's reforms .
But Benedict is a subtle thinker , and it 's always worth reading his speeches carefully .
In Portugal he talked a lot about life in a multicultural world :
" Given the reality of cultural diversity , people need not only to accept the existence of the culture of others , but also to aspire to be enriched by it and to offer to it whatever they possess that is good , true and beautiful . "
Talking to reporters on the plane which carried him to Portugal he tied the two strands of multiculturalism and enlightenment together in a most unexpected way .
In an excursus which must have given the reporters migraines , he started talking about the enlightenment concept of reason .
Instead , he said , the modern , secular idea of reason grew out of a dialectic with the church in which " unfortunately the prevailing tendency was one of opposition and mutual exclusion . "
That little word " mutual " is worth treasuring : it represents a pope admitting there was wrong on his side , too .
Dialectic does not just mean conflict .
It is a word which implies that the conflict ends , to be replaced by another , and that this conflict has productive results .
The idea of the relationship between the church and the state as dialectical is a very long way indeed from the claim that there is no salvation outside the church .
But , he argued , if Europe thought it could do without religion , it was making a very damaging mistake , just as the church had done when it thought it could do without secularism :
" In the multicultural situation in which we all find ourselves , we see that if European culture were merely rationalist , it would lack a transcendent religious dimension , and not be able to enter into dialogue with the great cultures of humanity all of which have this transcendent religious dimension – which is a dimension of man himself .
So to think that there exists a pure , anti-historical reason , solely self - existent , which is ' reason ' itself , is a mistake ; we are finding more and more that it affects only part of man , it expresses a certain historical situation but it is not reason as such . "
That was the context in which he went on to say that the church itself was to blame for the child abuse scandals , and they could not be blamed – as many cardinals have tried to do – on the outside world : " we are seeing .. . in a really terrifying way that the greatest persecution of the church comes not from her enemies without , but arises from sin within the church , and that the church thus has a deep need to relearn penance , to accept purification , to learn forgiveness on the one hand , but also the need for justice . "
And even if you find his talk of the dialectic bewildering , it 's clear what he means by " the need for justice " : there will be swift and decisive sackings .
Sure enough , when last week the German bishop Walter Mixa , whom Benedict himself had appointed in 2005 , found his resignation accepted by the Vatican less than three weeks after he had offered it after accusations of hitting children and possibly sexually abusing them .
In a church that can take 500 years to admit that Luther was right , that 's dazzling speed .
This is turning out to be a very much less conservative papacy than anyone expected .

A British man who was arrested in January after joking on Twitter that he would blow Robin Hood Airport in Doncaster , England , “ sky high ” if his flight was delayed , was found guilty on Monday of the crime of sending a menacing message over a public telecommunications network .
Paul Chambers , a 26 - year - old trainee accountant , was ordered to pay £ 1,000 ( $ 1,500 ) in fines and court costs by a judge at Doncaster Magistrates Court , who said his post was “ of a menacing nature in the context of the times in which we live , ” according to The Daily Telegraph .
Mr. Chambers , who issued his now - deleted mock threat when snow closed the airport , threatening to derail his travel plans , responded to the verdict by taking to Twitter an hour ago to sarcastically “ thank ” the Crown Prosecution Service “ for their level - best efforts ” to make a mess of “ the life of an ordinary citizen . ”
He added : “ I love Britain . ”
In the last few minutes , he posted these further updates , responding to questions from other users of the social networking service :
Currently considering an appeal .
Half of me just wants it to be over , the other half is indignant .
I took , and still take the charges seriously .
I have spent the last four months wracked with worry .
It ’s not the fine by the way , it ’s the criminal record .
It has jeopardised my career .
Punishment not befitting the “ crime . ”
The British legal blog Jack of Kent explains that Mr. Chambers “ was prosecuted under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 for sending an ‘ indecent , obscene or menacing ’ message .
An explanation of the law on the Crown Prosecution Service ’s Web site states that section 127 :
covers the sending of improper messages .
Section 127 ( 1 ) ( a ) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent , obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and e-mails .
Section 127 ( 2 ) targets false messages and persistent misuse intended to cause annoyance , inconvenience or needless anxiety ; it includes somebody who persistently makes silent phone calls ( usually covered with only one information because the gravamen is one of persistently telephoning rendering separate charges for each call unnecessary ) .
If a message sent is grossly offensive , indecent , obscene , menacing or false it is irrelevant whether it was received .
The offence is one of sending , so it is committed when the sending takes place .
After he was arrested , and questioned for seven hours for possible violations of British anti-terror laws , the self - described “ film - watching , football - loving , rubbish - talking , hyphen - using idiot , ” told The Independent in London , “ I had to explain Twitter to them in its entirety because they ’d never heard of it . ”
The newspaper reported that the joke had immediate serious consequences for Mr. Chambers .
He was suspended from work and initially told he would be banned from Robin Hood Airport for life , although that was later rescinded .
Among those broadcasting their anger at the verdict across the twitwaves on Monday was the British comedian Simon Pegg , who asked :
As I explored the captivating world of Nier , unearthing its mysteries and reveling in its characters , I could not stop thinking about Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and his brethren on the Supreme Court of the United States .
Last week the court announced that it would take up the question of whether states may regulate the sale of video games to minors in a way that has not applied to books , films , visual art , music and other media .
Put simply , the crux of the matter is whether the legal concept of obscenity , which has traditionally applied only to sexually explicit material , will be extended to cover depictions of violence .
If the court does expand the meaning of what society considers obscene , rather than merely offensive , states will be free to regulate games that include violence , as they do magazines that include nudity .
Is it too much to ask that the justices actually play some modern video games as they consider this ?
Probably .
One suspects that at least a couple of them already harbor a secret obsession with the likes of Minesweeper , Tetris , Solitaire or Bejeweled  as do so many desk jockeys  but it seems sadly unlikely that many , if any , of them will ever actually sit on a couch with controller in hand .
Yet an interactive experience can never be truly understood through noninteractive video clips .
What distinguishes an electronic game from older forms of mass entertainment is that the game must be actively participated in , rather than merely viewed , to be fully comprehended .
It is only through a player ’s sense of responsibility , direction and individual agency that the pictures on the screen come to assume real meaning .
Welcome to Batdude 's Photomanipulations !
This is something I 've just started getting into and so far , I have been relatively pleased with the results .

Of all the terrible sexual scandals the hierarchs in the Vatican find themselves tangled in , none is likely to do as much institutional damage as the astounding and still unfolding story of the Mexican priest Marcial Maciel .
The crimes committed against children by other priests and bishops may provoke rage , but they also make one want to look away .
With Father Maciel , on the other hand , one can hardly tear oneself from the ghastly drama as it unfolds , page by page , revelation by revelation , in the Mexican press .
Father Maciel , who was born in Mexico and died in 2008 at the age of eighty - seven , was known around the Catholic world .
Against ordinarily insurmountable obstacles , he founded what was to become one of the most dynamic , profitable , and conservative religious orders of the 20th century , which today has 800 priests , and approximately seventy thousand religious worldwide .
The Legion of Christ , nearly 70 years old as an order , is comparatively small , but it is influential : it operates fifteen universities , and some 140,000 students are enrolled in its schools ( In New York , its members teach in eleven parish schools ) ; and its leadership has long enjoyed remarkable access to the Vatican hierarchy .
A great achiever and close associate of John Paul II , Maciel was also a bigamist , pederast , dope fiend , and plagiarist .
Maciel came from the fervently religious state of Michoacán in the southwest of Mexico , and grew up during the years of the Cristero war ( 1926 –1929 ) , a savage conflict that pitched traditional Catholics ( Cristeros ) in provincial Mexico against the anti-clerical government in the capital .
One of his uncles was the commanding general of the Cristeros .
Another four uncles were bishops .
One of them , Rafael Guízar y Valencia , brought him into a clandestine seminary in Mexico City , where as a 21 year old who had not even taken his vows , Maciel created a new religious order that was intended to be both cosmopolitan and strict .
Given its founder ’s age and general lack of education , it is not surprising that its aims were poorly defined , although in a fascinating study of Maciel by the historian and psychoanalyst Fernando M. González we learn that one of the order ’s statutes specified that priests should be decenti sint conspectu , attractione corripiant , or graceful and attractive .
At the age of 27 the young Father Maciel had an audience with Pope Pius XII , who , according to the Legionaries ’ official history , urged him to use the order “ to form and to win for Christ the leaders of Latin America and the world . ”
This has been the order ’s unwavering mission for six decades , and with remarkable speed it emerged as a conservative force to rival even Opus Dei .
Maciel was evidently a man of some magnetism ; dozens of wealthy women contributed generous amounts for the Legionaries ’ good works , and the Mexican magazine Quién , normally known for its society pages and not for its investigative reporting , recently had a story about one of Mexico ’s wealthiest widows , Flora Barragán de Garza , who donated upwards of fifty million dollars during the years of Maciel ’s glory .
“ She gave him practically all our father ’s fortune , ” Barragán ’s daughter told the Quién interviewer , adding that the family finally had to intervene so that the by then elderly woman would not be left destitute .
Her generosity allowed Maciel to travel first - class throughout his peripatetic life , but it also provided the wherewithal for the network of private schools to which wealthy Mexican conservatives dispatched their children .
In 1997 , a Mexican woman who was living in Cuernavaca looked at the cover of the magazine Contenido — a Reader ’s Digest -y sort of publication — and saw on it the face of her common - law husband .
She had been his partner for 21 years and borne him two children , and she knew him as a private detective or “ CIA agent ” who , for understandable work - related reasons , put in only occasional appearances at home .
Now she learned that he was a priest and and that his real name was Marcial Maciel .
He was , the magazine said , the head of an order whose strictness and extreme conservatism appeared to hide some vile secrets : the article , picking up information first brought to light in an article by Jason Berry in the Hartford Courant , revealed that nine men , one a founder of the Legionaries , another still an active member , and the rest all former members of the order , had informed their superiors in Rome that Maciel had abused them sexually when they were pubescent seminarians under his care .
The accusations were not new , nor would they be the last .
In 1938 Maciel was expelled from his uncle Guízar ’s seminary , and shortly afterward from a seminary in the United States .
According to witnesses , Maciel and his uncle had a gigantic row behind closed doors , and one witness , a Legionary who had known Maciel since childhood , told the psychoanalyst González that the bishop ’s rage had to do with the fact that Maciel was locking himself up in the boarding house where he was staying with some of the younger boys at his uncle ’s seminary .
Bishop Guízar died of a massive heart attack the following day .
Later , it would become known that Maciel had his students and seminarians procure Dolantin ( morphine ) for him .
This led to Maciel ’s suspension as head of the order in 1956 .
Inexplicably , he was reinstated after two years .
Much later still , someone realized that his book , The Psalter of My Days , which was more or less required reading in Legionary institutions , and was a sort of Book of Hours , or prayer guide , was lifted virtually in its entirety from The Psalter of My Hours , an account written by a Spaniard who was sentenced to life in prison after the Spanish Civil War .
Uneducated and mendacious , Maciel nevertheless had a genius for politics , and for personal relations .
According to a former Jesuit with good knowledge of the story , one of the very first sizable donations that the Polish Solidarity movement received came from Maciel , who raised the money among the conservative Mexican elite he had so steadfastly cultivated .
No doubt the Polish Karol Wojtyla heard about this act of generosity and appreciated Maciel ’s ideological stance .
The priest was at John Paul ’s side throughout the first three of the Pope ’s five visits to Mexico : Legionary money , its priests , and its very active laypersons ’ movement , the Regnum Christi , strengthened the Polish Pope ’s campaign to remove socially radical or liberal priests from positions of power and give ascendancy to his conservative Catholicism .
It is hard not to think that these are the reasons the Vatican ignored the detailed and heartwrenching letter sent in 1998 by Maciel ’s eight accusers ( the ninth member of the group having died . )
Even as the public first became aware of the accusations through the Hartford Courant and the Mexican press , which picked up the story immediately , the Vatican refused to act .
Instead , Pope John Paul II put forward the beatification of Maciel ’s mother and of his uncle , Bishop Guízar .
( The bishop is now Saint Guízar .
Maciel ’s mother is still going through the beatification process . )
It was only in 2006 , after John Paul ’s death , that a Vatican communique announced that Maciel had been “ invited to lead a reserved life of prayer and penitence . ”
He lived out his final years quietly and died in the United States .
The Legionaries , however , have continued to grow in numbers and in wealth .
It ’s risky for a nonbeliever to try to evaluate how the Maciel narrative will affect the Church ’s standing as a whole , because an outsider can understand so little of how a faith is lived among its rank and file .
No doubt many Latin American believers know a parish priest who had a “ housekeeper ” and perhaps a “ niece ” living with him , because these things have never been uncommon here — or elsewhere , probably , although the effort to hide them may be greater .
But Paraguayans have not abandoned their cheerful president , former priest Fernando Lugo , despite the fact that he is known to have fathered at least three children ( he seems to think there may be more ) while he was still a bishop .
Homosexuality has also been tolerated and to some degree almost expected of skirt - wearing priests in this macho part of the world .
It is possible , perhaps , that for many Catholics baptism , confession , and weekly mass are almost bureaucratic procedures , like voting or getting a driver ’s licence , and that true faith is something that happens at home - made altars and through the magical pathways of ritual , leaving priests to live their own lives as long as they do a creditable job with the sermons and the burials .
The sexual abuse of children and its cover - up are a different matter entirely , one suspects .
As it turns out , Maciel ’s common - law marriage to Blanca Estela Lara Gutiérrez was not exclusive .
Some ten years after he met her , he began a long - lasting relationship with a 19 - year old waitress from Acapulco , to whom he introduced himself as an “ oil broker . ”
He had a daughter with her , and , according to a recent article in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo , several more children with other partners .
After she found out that her husband was not a CIA agent but a child - molesting priest , Blanca Estela Lara did not come forth with the news that she was married to him .
Perhaps she was terrified unawares of the man she believed “ was her God , ” as she would say a decade later .
Perhaps she was simply ashamed .
At any rate , she kept silent while some of Maciel ’s victims and a few journalists — notably the late Gerald Renner and Jason Berry , now of the National Catholic Reporter — kept producing more evidence .
And then , last March , two years after Maciel ’s death , Lara appeared with her three sons on one of Mexico ’s most well - regarded talk shows and listened quietly while her children testified that their biological father , Marcial Maciel , had made them masturbate him , and had first attempted to rape them , the older one said , when he was a boy seven years old .
( This testimony has been tarnished somewhat by the revelation that the sons had earlier demanded millions of dollars from the Legionaries of Christ in exchange for their silence .
The order has not attempted to deny the accusation , however . )
Quite apart from the damage to Maciel ’s victims , there is the pressing question of why the Catholic Church , as an institution , did not condemn him when he was ordained as a priest , or when he founded the Legionaries , or when the story of his pederasty made the cover of magazines , or when enough evidence was found to conclude that Maciel should live out the rest of his life in seclusion , or even when the rumors grew strong enough to warrant a Vatican investigation of the order as a whole .
The answer surprises no one : at a time in which churches are emptying , the Legionaries have been a rich source of conscripts , money and influence ; in Mexico everyone from Carlos Slim to Marta Sahagún , the wife of former president Vicente Fox , gave money to or asked favors from Maciel .
It was not until last year that Karol Wojtyla ’s successor , Pope Benedict XVI , at last authorized a visitation — churchspeak for investigation — of the entire order of the Legionaries of Christ .
As usual , the press and some disaffected religious have been way ahead of the Vatican .
Now we learn from the press that the order kept some 900 women under non-binding vows as consagradas , or quasi-nuns , in conditions of emotional privation and subjugation that violated even canonical law .
In the end , the scandal of Marcial Maciel , gruesome and ribald as it is , will turn out to be of much greater significance to the Catholic Church than the isolated terrors inflicted on their victims by one or another European or U.S. bishop or priest .
There is the distressing question of the Church ’s last Pope , the popular John Paul II , and his relations with the demonic priest .
There is the not unimportant fact that the Legionaries — along with Benedict XVI and indeed John Paul — represent the most morally conservative part of the Church , and that they now appear enmeshed in the most squalid moral scandal it is possible to imagine .
There is , above all , the fact that an entire , large , wealthy , international institution is now under suspicion ( what did Maciel ’s fellow Legionaries know , when did they know it , and who was complicit ? ) and that the greatest institution of all , the Roman Catholic Church , appears to have engaged in a cover - up for decades on its behalf .
Catholics who always assumed that a priest and Bing Crosby were more or less identical will need some time to adjust to this knowledge .
But there is the also the question of the future of the Church and of its priests and nuns as sexual beings .
It is not necessarily cheap psychology to speculate that extreme sexual repression of the sort imposed by the Church on its members leads to perversion , an issue that has surfaced importunately for the last millenium .
Many religious , it would seem , opt to “ obey ” rules but not comply with them , as the Spanish formulation has it ( “ obedezco , pero no cumplo ” ) .
I offer this simply as anecdotal evidence , but in my casual , friendly , and often admiring acquaintance with members of the Catholic orders — all from the social activist branch of the church , for whatever it ’s worth — a remarkable number have been involved in some sort of couple relationship .
I once attended a major church festivity in a small town at which several of the priests and nuns who arrived to concelebrate Mass were openly , and even defiantly , there with their partners , either homosexual or hetero .
In 1979 , at the time of John Paul ’s first visit to Mexico , I had a conversation with a progressive Spanish priest who lived with his partner , a middle - aged woman , about the split life he lived .
Why , I asked , did n’t he leave the Church if so many of its norms violated his own convictions and desire for honesty ?
I remember his saying , in effect , that the possibility of doing good within an institution as enormous and influential as the Church was greater that the chances for doing good outside of it .
Perhaps that equation is changing .
If you 've been waiting for official FM radio support in your Nexus One - and I know there are hundreds of you , then you will have to keep waiting , possibly forever .
One thing is certain - the official Nexus One Froyo release will not include FM radio support , told me one of the core Android engineers at the Google I /O conference a couple of days ago .
I went to Android Office Hours where everyone had a chance to ask core developers anything they wanted ( I managed to grab 2 Android dev books there too - awesome ! ) .
I was told that Google and HTC selected a chip that fit their needs , and it happened to support FM radio and Wireless N .
While the Android team realizes that support is possible and is highly requested by the users , adding it is so far down the priority list that it may simply never happen , and definitely not in Froyo .
The details are fuzzy now but I am 90 % confident the developer mentioned that 802.11n support will not be added in the official Froyo either , for similar reasons - lack of developer resources .
Glimmer Of Hope
There is a glimmer of hope though , and this made me feel proud of being part of the Android community .
After I asked the questions and received nay responses on both fronts , the Android core developer - by the way , his name was Brian Swetland - said that it was now up to the community to work out a solution and named Cyanogen as an example .
Cyanogen already baked 802.11n support into his CyanogenMod ROM , and is now looking into potential FM radio support .
A few weeks ago , Broadcom committed drivers for 802.11n into the AOSP ( Android open source project ) public code repository , which Cyanogen promptly ripped out and incorporated into CyanogenMod .
The radio situation is more complicated because nobody wrote a driver for it yet , or at least released it publicly .
I suggested to Brian that since the Droid Incredible kernel source was released a few days ago by HTC , and the Incredible supports FM radio and runs on the same chipset , that it may be possible to rip the drivers and software out of it and port to Nexus One .
Brian could not confirm that this would work but did n't deny that it would n't either .
I pinged Cyanogen about this , and it remains to be seen if he can make this all work .
How beautiful is this ?
Google does n't have enough dev bandwidth , so they suggest and actually approve the community rolling their own solution in a custom ROM , thus acknowledging and approving of rooting .
Can you imagine Apple do anything remotely similar ?
Again , I am damn proud to be an Android supporter .
Kerry called passage of the finance bill a victory for Massachusetts .
“ Our workers and our businesses took it on the chin when Wall Street melted down , ’’ Kerry said .
“ These reforms will fix what ’s most broken , and Chairman Frank , Senator Brown , and I also worked collegially to ensure that Massachusetts ’ financial firms , which did no harm , will continue to create jobs and engage in legitimate enterprise . ’’
He did so by working closely with the Massachusetts delegation and leaning on some of its most liberal members , including Frank and Kerry .
Brown came to Washington in February amid predictions by some that he would be the crucial 41st senator to join the Republican effort to stop the Democrats ’ health care agenda via filibuster , in which 60 votes are required to halt debate .
On the financial regulation bill , Brown did the opposite — providing the 60th vote that Democrats were seeking to advance one of their major initiatives .
But other Republicans expressed dismay at the bill ’s passage .
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , called the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau “ a massive expansion of the federal government ’’ and said the bill “ will do considerable damage to our competitiveness as a nation , not to mention harming job growth and our economic recovery . ’’
“ I ’m satisfied that all of our efforts — Senator Kerry and my efforts — will benefit and protect jobs in Massachusetts , ’’ Brown said yesterday .
In the hours before the final vote , much of the focus yesterday was on Brown ’s role in enabling the legislation to go forward .
A day earlier , Brown had opposed such efforts .
His change followed a day of negotiations during which he interrupted Representative Barney Frank in the House members ’ gym and discussed the bill with Senator John F. Kerry during a 40 - mile bike ride .
“ The recession we ’re emerging from was primarily caused by a lack of responsibility and accountability from Wall Street to Washington , ’’ Obama said yesterday in the Rose Garden , when it became clear final passage was imminent .
“ That ’s why I made passage of Wall Street reform one of my top priorities as president , so that a crisis like this does not happen again . ’’
The measure , which needs to be reconciled with a House version , provided Democrats with another razor - thin but significant victory on the heels of the recent passage of the health care overhaul .
President Obama , who proposed his version of the legislation in June 2009 , hailed the passage as a milestone .
Brown , the Massachusetts Republican , played a key role in its passage after he received assurances that the legislation would be altered to help a number of Bay State - based financial institutions .
He joined two other Republicans and 57 Democrats to vote to shut off debate yesterday , paving the way for a final vote on the bill .
The legislation later passed by a 59 - to - 39 tally , with Brown supporting it .
WASHINGTON — With a crucial last - minute boost from Senator Scott Brown , the Senate approved sweeping legislation last night that would restructure the nation ’s financial industry , adding new safeguards and consumer protections in an effort to prevent another economic catastrophe .
Brown ’s vote yesterday on the procedural measure to stop debate and move toward a final roll call was crucial .
Two other Republicans — Senators Susan M. Collins and Olympia J. Snowe , both of Maine — joined the Democrats in voting to shut off debate .
Two Democrats — Maria Cantwell of Washington and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin — joined Republicans in trying to block a final vote .
The financial overhaul legislation is designed to crack down on some of the risky practices that contributed to the meltdown of 2008 .
It would create a consumer protection bureau that seeks to help people avoid trouble with mortgages and credit cards they cannot afford .
It would also establish a council that would be charged with monitoring the system for potential problems .
Brown has been withholding support for the bill until he was assured that some of the insurance and mutual fund companies in Massachusetts would not fall under the so - called Volcker rule , named after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker , which could restrict the investment options of large institutions , including preventing them from owning private equity funds .
Brown also wanted to ensure that the legislation would not affect financial institutions that hold trust banks , allowing them to continue sponsoring investment funds as part of their asset management business .
Brown argued that those restrictions should be designed to curtail the risky bets placed by big Wall Street firms , not the more traditional practices of the Massachusetts - based companies .
Those concerns were aired during a lobbying effort by major firms in Massachusetts such as Fidelity , Putnam Investments , State Street Corp. , Liberty Mutual , and MassMutual .
The institutions feared they would be included in regulations that would crack down on lending and investment practices .
The firms were generally pleased with the House version of the bill , which Frank drafted , but had concerns with the Senate bill .
“ Our concern has been that some proposal would have unintended consequences and restrict well - run entities in Massachusetts , ’’ said Vin Loporchio , a spokesman for Fidelity .
“ We are hopeful that the final legislation will avoid a one - size - fits - all approach to regulation . ’’
Brown and his aides had been working on the concerns for several weeks , but activity intensified over the past several days as the bill headed toward a vote .
Brown had initially told the Democratic leadership he would vote with Democrats to cut off debate , but then backed out late Wednesday afternoon when the changes he demanded to protect Massachusetts companies were not made .
As a result , Senate majority leader Harry Reid accused Brown , though not by name , of breaking his word .
Brown called Frank on Wednesday night about the measure .
Frank , working out on an elliptical machine in the House members ’ gym , initially did n’t answer his phone .
The two Massachusetts lawmakers — one a gruff , liberal Democrat who invites scorn from conservatives ; the other a truck - driving Republican who won a surprising election with support from Tea Party movement conservatives — spoke several minutes later .
Frank assured Brown that he would protect the Massachusetts businesses in the final legislation .
Frank — chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services and the top negotiator in reconciling differences between the House and Senate — then wrote to other key players .
“ All of these measures are important to our state and none of them threaten or weaken the broad objectives of comprehensive reform that guided our work , and I will insist that they be maintained in the final bill , ’’ Frank wrote .
Then , at 6 a.m. yesterday , Brown met Kerry at his home in Georgetown , and the two senators went on a 40 - mile bike ride , literally wheeling and dealing , to Great Falls , Md. , and back .
Kerry had been asked by Reid to try to win over Brown .
Brown ’s campaign was well funded by financial interests .
In the final days before the January special election , he received $ 450,000 from donors who work at financial companies , the Globe reported in February .
Brown ’s spokeswoman , Gail Gitcho , did not dispute the figure , but said Brown raised $ 15 million , with an average donation of $ 80 .
After the final vote was recorded , Brown rushed out of the chamber to catch a flight .
Asked for comment , he responded , “ I ’m done making news today . ’’

The Pirate Bay file tracking site is currently offline - apparently forced to close by a German court injunction filed last week .
We covered the filing last week .
A district court in Hamburg heard from the Motion Picture Ass. of America , which targeted German ISP CB3ROB ( Cyberbunker ) .
Cyberbunker was ordered to unplug the site or face two years in prison or a $ 250,000 fine for each example of copyright infringement found .
The site is currently unavailable , though it has been taken out before and bounced back quickly .
For background on The Pirate Bay see this interview with one of the founders , now somewhat disinterested .

Hal Clement , Whirligig World , Whirligig World " The fun , and the material for this article , lies in treating the whole thing as a game .
I 've been playing the game since I was a child , so the rules must be quite simple .
They are : for the reader of a science - fiction story , they consist of finding as many as possible of the author 's statements or implications which conflict with the facts as science currently understands them .
For the author , the rule is to make as few such slips as he possibly can . "

Speculative Fiction fanatics are always raving about how " hard " the science is in various stories — but it's not like you can rub a story with a piece of quartz and see if it leaves a scratch on the plot .
So what is " hardness " in SF ?
Why do some people want it ?
And how do we put a number to it ?
Beginning with the first question : " Hard " Science Fiction is firmly grounded in reality , with only a few fantastic flights of fancy not justified by science , or with the technology being nonexistent in today 's world but probably scientifically possible at some point .
" Soft " Sci-Fi is more flexible on the rules .
Even the fantastical aspects of the story will show a divide — in hard SF , they operate through strict , preferably physical , laws , where in soft SF they work in whatever way suits the story best .
What this leads to for hard SF is a raised bar for the amount of scientific research the writer must put into the story , and usually this is shown quite clearly .

Example : a character is shown a time machine and asks , " How does it work ? "
In hard SF : " A good question with an interesting answer .

( CNN ) -- Israel 's attack Monday on a boat traveling in international waters and carrying humanitarian supplies for Gaza killed at least nine people and sparked a series of recriminations around the world .
Riyad Mansour , Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations , condemned the attack and called for an independent investigation " to know who gave the orders from the Israeli side to open fire against civilians and to bring those people to face justice . "
But Israeli officials described the boat 's passengers as the aggressors and said the soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces were simply defending themselves .
" They are not peace activists .
They were not messengers of goodwill , " Daniel Carmon , Israel 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , told reporters in New York .
" They cynically used the guise of humanitarian aid to send a message of hate and to implement violence . "
Independent information was scant .
The death toll and the account of what happened came from the Israelis , who did not release the names of any of the casualties .
" Free Gaza , " one of the group 's sponsors , said there were more casualties from the incident , though it did n't have an exact number .
The surviving passengers were being held incommunicado by the Israelis , who detained them after escorting the six boats that had participated in the flotilla to the Israeli port city of Ashdod .
Q&A on Israel 's Gaza blockade
Three sailors who took part in the flotilla said Israeli troops stormed the Mavi Marmara , the largest ship , well into international waters .
" The commandos were coming down from the helicopter .
No one on the ships had any weapons , " one of the sailors told CNN Turk after being flown back to Istanbul .
The Free Gaza organization , one of the organizers of the protest , posted on its Twitter page that the incident unfolded about 4:30 a.m. , when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara by helicopter .
The troops " immediately opened fire on unarmed civilians , " the group said .
Video from the Israeli military showed soldiers rappelling onto the deck of the ship from a helicopter .
The boarding of the ships took place in international waters more than 70 nautical miles ( 130 km ) outside Israeli territorial waters , according to IHH , a humanitarian relief foundation and a sponsor of the flotilla .
IHH is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood , a hard - line Islamic political movement .

But the Israel Defense Forces said its troops " were met with premeditated violence , evident by the activists ' use of clubs , metal rods , and knives , as well as the firing of two weapons stolen from the soldiers . "
It said troops responded with " defensive action on behalf of the forces who felt their lives were endangered , " and seven were wounded .
The IDF released a video shot from above the ship that it said showed soldiers being attacked , though the distance from which it was shot precluded immediate confirmation .
A senior Israeli military official , speaking on condition of anonymity in an account cleared by military censors , displayed a box containing switchblade knives , slingshots and metal balls and bats he said had been confiscated from one of the boats .
" This was not spontaneous , " he said .
" This was planned . "
Israeli military gives version of flotilla incident
A senior Israeli military official , speaking on condition of anonymity in an account cleared by military censors , displayed a box containing switchblade knives , slingshots and metal balls and bats he said had been confiscated from one of the boats .
" This was not spontaneous , " he said .
" This was planned . "
Jonathan Peled , minister - counselor for the Israeli Embassy in Washington , said the soldiers were carrying paintball pistols when they boarded the flotilla , but switched to bullets when a naval commander was stabbed and others were attacked with knives and metal bars .
Most of the dead were Turks , the Israeli senior military official said .
Twenty other people were wounded .
As many as nine Americans may have been aboard the boats , including Edward Peck , a former U.S. ambassador to Mauritania , according to Jonathan Slevin , a spokesman for the activist group Free Palestine Movement .
One American who was being treated for minor injuries after the attack , a senior State Department official said late Monday .
Israeli forces boarded the other ships in the flotilla without incident .
The Turkish sailors said they were continuously shadowed by commandos aboard their own vessel , " even when we needed to go to bathroom , " one said .
The flotilla had left European ports in a protest organized by two pro-Palestinian groups to deliver 10,000 tons of food , medicine , construction materials , wheelchairs and other aid to Gaza to break a blockade imposed by Israel in 2007 .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who canceled his trip to Washington to return to Israel to manage the crisis , said Gaza has become a base for Hamas terrorists who have fired " thousands of rockets " into Israel .
" What we want to prevent coming into Gaza are rockets , missiles , explosives and war material that could be used to attack our civilians , " he told reporters in Ottawa , Canada , with his Canadian counterpart .
The attack sparked protests in several countries ; caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Turkey , its closest Muslim ally ; and brought condemnation worldwide .
A number of nations recalled their ambassadors from Israel , while others called for a full investigation .
The Palestinian Authority said in a statement its cabinet " strongly condemned the Israeli crime against international supporters on board of the Freedom Flotilla . "

Turkey , Israel 's closest Muslim ally in the region , recalled its ambassador , while Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said the operation " will leave a bloody stain on the history of humanity . "
Israel said Sunday that Western and Turkish authorities have accused IHH of having " working relations " with terrorist organizations .
Of the hundreds of activists who were detained aboard the ships after they were escorted to the Israeli port of Ashdod , 15 were sent to Beer Sheva Prison , according to a spokesman for the Israeli prison authority .
Another 25 were slated for deportation and 50 others who refused to identify themselves were being held separately .
None was allowed to speak to the news media .
A team from the Turkish Red Crescent will fly Tuesday to Tel Aviv to help coordinate the return of the dead and wounded , the organization said in a statement .
Israel issued a " serious travel warning " for Israelis visiting Turkey .
Those planning to travel to Turkey were asked to postpone their trips , while those already in Turkey were advised to stay indoors .
A Turkish travel agent said more than 15,000 Israelis had canceled plans to visit Turkey .
In Gaza , Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called for global support of the Palestinian cause .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of mourning in the Palestinian territories to honor the lives lost .
" We have consistently advised against attempting to access Gaza in this way , because of the risks involved , " said British Foreign Secretary William Hague .
" But at the same time , there is a clear need for Israel to act with restraint and in line with international obligations . "
In Washington , White House spokesman Bill Burton said , " The United States deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained and is currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy . "
Israel instituted a blockade on Gaza in January 2006 , when Hamas won democratic elections in the Palestinian territories .
It tightened that blockade in June 2007 , when Hamas took over Gaza , but allows about 15,000 tons of humanitarian aid into the territories each week , Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said .
Since then , Israel has controlled entry of all manner of goods into Gaza , including instant coffee , chocolate and construction materials .
Israel has said the latter could be used by Hamas to build bunkers .
Since the summer of 2008 , five flotillas have gotten through the blockade to deliver humanitarian goods to Gaza .
Monday 's flotilla was the largest such mission .
CNN 's Ben Wedeman in Cairo , Egypt ; Ivan Watson in Istanbul , Turkey ; Charley Keyes in Washington ; and Niki Cook in Paris , France , contributed to this report .
Sigh :
The White House Monday said that Supreme Court nominee [ Elena Kagan ] wo n't follow her own advice from 1995 in answering questions on specific legal cases or issues , supporting Kagan 's flip flop on the issue that she first made a year ago .
Kagan wrote in 1995 that the confirmation process had become a " charade " because nominees were not answering direct questions , and said they should have to do so .
But during a briefing with reporters in the White House , Ron Klain , a top legal adviser to Vice President Joe Biden who played a key role in helping President Obama choose Kagan , said that she no longer holds this opinion .
Klain pointed to Kagan 's testimony during confirmation hearings for her current job as solicitor general , the government 's top lawyer .
" She was asked about it and said that both the passage of time and her perspective as a nominee had given her a new appreciation and respect for the difficulty of being a nominee , and the need to answer questions carefully , " Klain said , prompting laughter from a few reporters .
Update 5/15/2010 : Valve released a new patch for Portal on the 13th which resolved the blurriness issue .
Please see our update below for for the full details .
It ’s been a while since anyone treated Mac OS X as a first - tier gaming platform , so when Valve announced that they would be bringing their Steam service and the Source engine to the Mac , it was big news .
After a roughly 2 month beta period for the Mac versions of Steam and the Source engine , yesterday Valve finally released the first wave of their Mac gaming efforts .
As it stands Valve is taking a gradual approach to rolling out their back catalog to the platform .
Even though Steam is out and the Source engine has been ported , this week has seen the release of only 1 Source game for the Mac : 2007 ’s critically acclaimed Portal .
While it ’s not the most graphically intensive Source game these days ( that title belonging to Left 4 Dead ) , at this point it ’s as good as anything else for looking at the performance of the Source engine under Mac OS X , particularly considering how long it ’s been since a game ’s original developer did the Mac port .
So with that in mind , we went ahead and took a quick look at Portal ’s performance under Mac OS X .
As is the case with all of the games on the Source engine , they ’re designed to scale up and down fairly well .
With modern hardware though , we ’re hard - pressed to keep older Source games from achieving runaway frame rates .
So Portal performance is somewhat arbitrary – most Macs with a discrete GPU should be able to handle it to an acceptable degree .
The Test
For our test we loaded up our GPU test rig with Mac OS X 10.6.3 in a Hackintosh configuration .
As Mac OS
X does not currently support either the GeForce GTX 400 series or the Radeon HD 5000 series , we had to step back a bit with our video card choice , settling for a GeForce GTX 285 .
And while the use of a Hackintosh does technically invalidate our results since it ’s not a real Macintosh , based on our experiments we believe that our results do n’t suffer in any way for using a Hackintosh , and as such we believe the results to be experimentally valid .
But of course , your mileage may vary .
CPU : Intel Core i7-920 @ 3.33 GHz Motherboard : Intel DX58SO ( Intel X58 ) Chipset Drivers : Intel 9.1.1.1015 ( Intel ) Hard Disk : OCZ Summit ( 120 GB ) Memory : Patriot Viper DDR3 -1333 3 x 2GB ( 7-7-7-20 ) Video Cards : NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285 Video Drivers : NVIDIA ForceWare 197.13 OS : Windows 7 Ultimate 64 - bit
Mac OS X 10.6.3 " Snow Leopard "
Image Quality
We ’ll start quickly with a look at image quality .
Valve is traditionally a staunch Microsoft ally , having built up their services and engines around Windows and DirectX .
For the Mac OS X port of Source , Valve had to replace the DirectX backend of Source with Mac - appropriate components , the key of which is OpenGL .
Such a change can impact image quality depending on how it ’s done .
Portal - Windows .

Portal - Mac OS X. Click to enlarge .
We have a gallery of screenshots , but for our analysis we ’ll stick with comparing in a single set .
Going with 2560x1600 with the game at its highest settings and 4xAA / 16xAF , to our surprise the images are distinctly different when directly compared .
The Mac screenshot is noticeably foggier than the Windows image , and textures appear to be less sharp .
It ’s not a night & day difference , but the Windows screenshot is distinctly clearer than the Mac screenshot .
Without a Windows reference image it would be harder to tell that the Mac screenshot differs this much , but we believe that the difference is great enough that anyone with an eye for details that has ever played Portal on Windows would notice the foggier / blurrier IQ on the Mac .
Now some of this can be explained away due to gamma , since Mac OS X and Windows have different default gamma levels , but gamma could never explain the entire difference .
There ’s clearly a difference in IQ between the Windows and Mac OS X versions of Portal , and it ’s not in the Mac ’s favor .
It ’s by no means bad , but as one person put this when being shown these screenshots “ It ’s like looking at a magazine scan ” when looking at the Mac .
Performance
The other half of our quick look is at performance .
The Macintosh platform is renowned for being a graphical powerhouse , but this refers to professional / prosumer photography and the like .
For gaming , Apple has been slow to include support for new hardware and new driver features ( they are just now OpenGL 3.0 compliant ) and overall their drivers are more conservative when it comes to performance .
Portal is going to be slower , the question is by how much .
We went ahead and ran a timedemo from test chamber 18 and beyond on both the Mac OS X and Windows versions of Portal .
We kept the settings cranked up at all times , but varied the resolution between 1280x800 and 2560x1600 to look at different GPU loads .
At the worst - case of 2560 , the Mac version of Portal runs at only 54 % of the speed of the Windows version .
That moves to 63 % at 1920x1200 , and 66 % at 1280x800 .
Portal – like all Source engine games – is CPU limited when given a powerful enough GPU , and even with just a GTX 285 we can approach that under Windows .
Under Mac OS
X however , we look to be GPU limited at all times .
The framerate never suffers as we ’re always averaging more than 60 fps , but we can easily turn off MSAA and AF to improve performance if we needed to .
Closing Thoughts
For Source engine enthusaists hoping to see the Mac OS X port of the Source engine meet the high standards of the Windows version , Portal presents a mixed bag .
In our limited testing the Mac version of Portal does n’t significantly suffer for being a port , but at the same time it ca n’t quite match the image quality of the Windows version .
Feature - for - feature there is parity , but the Mac version just is n’t as sharp as the Windows version .
Performance is n’t any better .
Portal is an easy game to run and so we ’re largely being academic here , but the “ tax ” for Mac OS X is roughly a generation in hardware performance .
For the performance we ’re seeing on a GTX 285 under Mac OS X the results are similar to what we ’d see under Windows with something like a 9800GTX .
Given that at the high - end the Mac platform is also a generation behind in hardware , and you ’re looking at 2008 performance for Portal even with the best hardware you can get today for a Mac .
Ultimately having the Source engine ported to Mac OS X is going to remove the technical need to use Bootcamp to run Windows for games , but based on Portal it does n’t remove the need to boot Windows for performance reasons .
For long - time Mac users none of this should be surprising , but it means that we should n’t expect the Mac OS X version of the Source engine to be revolutionary .
: 5/15/2010
On Thursday after we published our article Valve pushed out an update for Portal that focused on fixes for the Mac version .
The big fix was the following :
Fixed screen " fuzziness " caused by color correction operation
This fixed the blurriness issue we saw with the initial version of Portal .
Texture and geometry quality is now as sharp as it is under Windows .
Performance remains unchanged , while there is still an image quality difference between the two due to lighting differences and a general degree of fogginess that still appears on the Mac OS X version .

Wisconsin 's valuable ginseng crop - a major export to China - took a devastating hit Mother 's Day weekend when deceptively mild spring weather reverted to winter before upstate growers could protect the ancient medicinal root worth $ 60,000 to $ 80,000 an acre .
" This was like the Hurricane Katrina of Wisconsin - it took out nearly all of our ginseng gardens , " said Joe Heil , president of the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin .
Wisconsin produces 95 % of the nation 's ginseng - an earthy , mildly bitter medicinal root prized in China for its health - enhancing properties .
It 's by far the state 's most lucrative crop , per acre .
Heil on Thursday estimated his own loss at " $ 1 million - plus " for 80 acres of ginseng near Edgar , 15 miles west of Wausau .
" I 've been growing ginseng for 20 years , and I do n't know that there 's been anything like this before , " he said .
Heil does not have insurance coverage because " the policy is n't desirable ; it offers completely unrealistic coverage . "
Gov. Jim Doyle late Wednesday asked U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to declare a disaster in Marathon County , including the Wausau area , where most of Wisconsin 's 600,000 pounds of ginseng , valued at about $ 18 million , is grown .
A disaster declaration would allow eligible farmers to receive emergency loans and secure crop insurance payments - assuming they have insurance .
Heil said most ginseng growers do n't carry insurance .
The loss is expected to ripple through the next three to four years , as ginseng takes several years to mature once planted , and plants at different stages of development were lost or damaged , said Butch Weege , executive director of the Ginseng Board .
It takes ginseng 18 months to go from seed to plant , and another three years for the root to mature for harvest .
Older plants that froze last weekend will go dormant and lose a year of growth , extending the investment cycle .
Seedlings with delicate structures either were killed , or may be more susceptible to future disease .
Heil estimated 80 % to 90 % of Marathon County 's ginseng was on the ground or affected by the 3 to 6 inches of heavy snow that fell May 7 through Saturday morning , instead of flurries that were in the forecast .
At least 30 % of the crop must be considered a loss before a disaster declaration can be made .
Nearly all of the state 's 200 growers , which produce roughly 1,400 acres of ginseng , are in Marathon County .
Ginseng is dormant and uncovered during the winter .
But once the plants return to life - usually in early May - they must be protected from sunlight .
This spring , early growth required that mesh shades be put up 10 days to 14 days earlier than usual to protect the plants from killing sunlight .
As the snow began to pile up , poles snapped and structures collapsed .
" Some growers were dismally aware by the time they went to bed after the 10 o'clock news Friday that things were going to be bad , and there was nothing they could do , " Weege said .
It would have taken days for growers to remove the protective structures over 60 to 100 acres , Weege said .
Mike Thompson , who grows three acres of ginseng north of Medford - about 40 miles northwest of Wausau - said he had minor losses because he was able to open shades before the snow accumulated .
His ginseng also was n't as far out of the ground as ginseng near Wausau .
Heavy May snowfalls are not unprecedented , but they have n't happened in the Wausau area since the early 1990s , when growers switched from wooden lattice structures to the plastic shade they now use because it 's less labor - intensive and less expensive to maintain , Weege said .
The wood structures held up better under the weight of snow .
The shade cloth , as it's called , can tolerate up to 2 inches of heavy , wet snow .
But the cabling that runs up and over the top of 6 - feet tall cedar posts to provide a support structure will break with more weight than that , Weege said .
Ginseng 's feel - good properties include stress relief , increased stamina and increased resistance to common illnesses such as colds .
Wisconsin ginseng growers have aggressively marketed ginseng abroad during trade missions .
Weege said he was planning a trip to Japan next week , then to Taiwan in June , and this fall to South Korea .

Solar power might be natures most plentiful and benign source of energy , but shiny black solar cells can lure water insects away from critical breeding areas , a Michigan State University scientist and colleagues warn .
Applying white grids or other methods to break up the polarized reflection of light , however , makes mayflies and other aquatic insects far less likely to deposit eggs on the panels thinking that they are water , the group discovered .
 This research demonstrates that solar panels are a strong new source of polarized light pollution that creates ecological traps for many types of insect ,  says Bruce Robertson , a research associate at MSUs Kellogg Biological Station in Hickory Corners .
 This is of significant conservation importance given the radical expansion in solar energy development and the strong negative impacts of ecological traps on animal populations . 
Using nonpolarizing white grids , he adds , demonstrates a novel approach to reducing the attractiveness of a false habitat by applying what biologists call habitat fragmentation .
That is an effect that usually is harmful to species , but in this case promises to solve a conservation problem .
Robertsons team estimates that adding white markings to solar cells might reduce their ability to collect solar energy by perhaps 1.8 percent , depending on the amount of space the strips cover .
Conventional solar cells share a problem with glass - clad buildings and other expanses of shiny dark surfaces  even vehicles .
Reflected sunlight becomes polarized , or aligned in a single , often horizontal plane , which is how at least 300 species of insect recognize the surface of water bodies to lay their eggs .
When species such as mayflies and caddis flies mistake shiny dark surfaces for water , they set themselves up for reproductive failure and often become easy targets for predators , Robertson and colleagues noted in a recent online article in the journal Conservation Biology .
Local population collapse could be a result , with cascading impacts on predators and other species up the food chain .
Humans typically recognize reflected sunlight only as glare , which polarized sunglasses overcome by filtering the horizontal waves through vertically polarized lenses .
Robertson conducted his research in Hungary with scientists associated with Eotvos University in Budapest and Szent Istvan University in Godollo , Hungary .
Their work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energys Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center and the Hungarian Science Foundation .

In a Missouri food warehouse , 150 workers load and unload trucks , lift boxes , drive fork trucks , and move endless pallets .
Each month that no one reports an injury , all workers receive prizes , such as $ 50 gift certificates .
If someone reports an injury , no prizes are given that month .
Last year , management added a new element to this “ safety incentive ” program : if a worker reported an injury , not only would co-workers forgo monthly prizes but the injured worker had to wear a fluorescent orange vest for a week .
The vest identified the worker as a safety problem , and alerted co-workers : he lost you your prizes .
Blame - the - worker programs like this are flourishing , and they are harmful for workplace health and safety .
Why are employers implementing them ?
For decades , employers have brought in work - restructuring programs such as Lean , Six Sigma , and kaizen / continuous improvement .
The result has been understaffing , work overload , long hours , job combinations — and therefore increased stress , repetitive strain , and other injuries and illnesses .
Increased injury rates brought higher workers compensation premiums and meant a higher risk of OSHA inspections .
Supervisors lost bonuses , and facilities faced the loss of safety awards that had helped them win investments and contracts .
But instead of rethinking their work restructuring , employers came up with a different plan : hide the injuries .
Enter “ behavior - based safety . ”
KNOW THE ENEMY
Behavior - based safety programs and practices focus on worker behavior rather than on workplace hazards as the cause of injuries and illnesses :
• Safety incentive programs , where workers receive prizes or rewards when they do n’t report work - related injuries
• Injury discipline policies , where workers are threatened with or receive discipline ( including termination ) when they do report injuries
• Post - injury drug testing , where workers are automatically drug - tested when they report an injury
• Workplace signs that track the number of hours or days without a lost - time or recordable injury , which encourages numbers games
• Other posters , such as those stuck to washroom mirrors stating , “ You are looking at the person most responsible for your safety . ”
• Programs where workers observe co-workers and record their “ safe behaviors ” or “ unsafe acts . ”
This focuses attention away from hazards and reinforces the myth that injuries result from bad behavior rather than hazardous conditions .
HIDING HAZARDS
In order for there to be a workplace injury or illness , there must be a hazard .
A union approach to reducing injuries and illnesses is to identify , eliminate , reduce , and prevent hazards .
A behavior - based approach , on the other hand , drives both injury reporting and hazard reporting underground .
When a job injury or illness is reported , the hazard causing it can be identified and addressed .
If injuries are n’t reported , hazards go unaddressed — and injured workers may not get the care they need .
In addition , if a worker is trained to observe and identify fellow workers ’ “ unsafe acts , ” he or she will report “ you ’re not lifting properly ” rather than “ the job needs to be redesigned . ”

It ’s hard enough to get hazards fixed that we know about ; it ’s impossible to fix hazards we do n’t know about .
Many behavioral safety programs also harm solidarity .
When workers lose prizes if a co-worker reports an injury , peer pressure comes into play .
Observing co-workers is harmful even if no discipline is attached to recorded “ unsafe acts . ”
Employers tout low injury rates as an indicator of safety , when the reality can be disastrously different .
One employer with a safety incentive program and an injury discipline policy won an award from the Massachusetts Safety Council for having zero recordable injuries ; the next year a worker was crushed to death in a machine .
Minor injuries had occurred on this machine but were never reported .
Behavioral safety programs hide injuries , but they ca n’t cover up fatalities .
In 2005 BP was touting an OSHA injury rate many times below the national average at its Texas City facility , when an explosion there took the lives of 15 workers and injured 180 .
TAKING THEM ON
The first step is educating members about these programs and building solidarity around the need to end them .
Incentive programs that promise prizes for not reporting injuries are hazards in disguise .
Unions whose employers are covered by the NLRA or similar labor law should use their bargaining rights to block unilateral implementation of these programs , as health and safety is a mandatory subject of bargaining .
See tinyurl.com / TroublemakersHandbook-h-s for a sample letter requesting to bargain and a sample letter requesting detailed information on the program .
Unions whose employers are covered by OSHA can use a provision in OSHA ’s Recordkeeping Rule : it is an OSHA violation to discriminate against workers for exercising their right to report injuries .
When workers lose prizes or receive automatic discipline for reporting injuries , this can be illegal discrimination under 29 CFR 1904.36 and Section 11 ( c ) of the OSH Act .
One example was at Alcoa : the names of everyone who did n’t report an injury went into a hat , and periodically there was a drawing for a big screen TV .
Steelworkers Local 105 filed an OSHA complaint , and OSHA made Alcoa cease and desist .
In another case , an employer called in 17 members of USW Local 880 in Massachusetts and told them they had too many injuries — one more and they were up for termination .
A call to OSHA produced a call to the company informing management that this was illegal discrimination .
HOW LONG ?
Unions can respond to the employer ’s signs announcing how long the workplace has gone without an injury with our own signs or leaflets that track how long it takes for the employer to address a particular hazard : “ It ’s been 14 days since the union asked management to fix [ a problem ] , and they still have n’t corrected it ! ”
Pictures of the CEO can be slipped under the mirror magnets that say , “ You are looking at the person most responsible for your safety . ”
Any checklist used in a behavioral observation program can be turned into its opposite : instead of recording co-workers ’ “ unsafe acts , ” observers record only hazards : “ guard missing on Machine # 3 , ” “ understaffing in the Emergency Department . ”
At the food warehouse in Missouri , the members of Steelworkers Local 11-500 approved the purchase of fluorescent orange vests for every member .
These vests would each bear the USW ’s sticker “ Fix the Hazards — Do n’t Blame the Victim . ”
Before this solidarity action was implemented , the employer “ voluntarily ” discontinued its orange - vest policy .

If you currently have early , “ Friends and Family ” access to the highly anticipated Halo : Reach multiplayer beta , you probably fall into one of three camps .
You are actually “ friends and / or family ” with someone who works at Bungie or Microsoft
You are a journalist who has a legitimate work reason to have early access .
You got a beta code in a giveaway from someone in Group No. 2 .
It ’s this third group I ’m concerned with in this post .
Or , more accurately , why the second group is being used to facilitate the third group ’s early access .
If Microsoft and / or Bungie wanted to give a limited set of lucky gamers access to this beta ( before the hordes of Halo 3 : ODST owners get their hands on it May 3 ) , they surely could have come up with a contest or random drawing of their own to facilitate it .
Instead , they ’ve handed handfuls of extra beta codes to seemingly every game journalist on god ’s green Earth and given these journalists free reign to hand out the codes in whatever manner will attract the most page views , Twitter followers , Facebook fans , etc. ( and trust me , a giveaway for access to an anticipated game like this has the potential to attract a LOT of attention ) .
Now I ’m almost positive there ’s anything so tawdry as a journalistic quid pro quo going on for access to these giveaway codes ( “ Hey , Microsoft , for every five codes you give our readers , I ’ll guarantee an extra 1/10th of a point on the final review score ” ) .
In fact , I doubt access to these extra beta codes will directly affect the impression journalists eventually make about the game in the slightest .
Of course , there is a small chance that an outlet with access to extra beta codes might be less likely to antagonize Microsoft in the future — for fear of getting cut off from the lucrative giveaway spigot .
Of course , these outlets are likely already sufficiently afraid of losing access to press preview events , live press conferences , early reviews copies and a host of other necessary information that Microsoft directly controls , so this concern is probably a bit moot .
But think for a second about the image of the game press that this journalist giveaway system conveys to the readers .
Throughout the week , anyone who pays attention to the game press has been inundated with tweets and blog posts and “ news stories ” ( note the subtle scare quotes ) featuring journalists hawking beta codes like a barker at the county fair .
Even the low - key giveaways carry with them the idea that Halo : Reach is a game worth playing — after all , you ca n’t really offer a contest for something without implicitly endorsing it as something that is desirable to win .
Is it really possible to enthusiastically push beta access to a game one day and then credibly critique that game the next ?
Appearances aside , I ca n’t help but think Microsoft knows these kinds of giveaways have a subtle effect on the way a journalist sees a game and its fanbase .
Sure , as journalists we might know abstractly that a lot of gamers are really excited about Halo : Reach .
But in giving away beta access , journalists are put directly in touch with the most rabid fans of a game , who will be clamoring for those beta keys via e-mail and comments and twitter replies and all sorts of direct appeals .
By making journalists intimately aware with how much their readers want this game , these giveaways can’t help but influence the way it gets covered in the future ( and if you think a journalist is going to ignore the directly demonstrated passion of their readers , you ’re nuts ) .
Of course none of this is new , or really much different from what game journalists do every day .
We often give up a bit of independence for access , be it to a beta code or a hard - to - get interview .
We often give up our appearance of impartiality so we can get the Google juice from being the first one to repeat a hot press release verbatim .
We often pay attention to the games we know our readers are already excited about rather than trying to expose them to hidden gems they might not even know they want to know about .
But I guess the implicit boosterism on display among journalists in these Halo : Reach beta giveaways struck me as a little less subtle than usual .
The next time you wonder why game journalism is often seen as just an extension of video game PR , remember “ events ” like this .
Posting about songs that start in one key and finish in another .
Updates every Monday .
Submissions welcomed :)
Image caption A single and two - player version of the game was available .
The Pac - Man game Google put on its home page gobbled up almost five million hours of work time , suggests a study .
The playable version of the classic video game was put on Google 's front page on 21 May to celebrate 30 years since the launch of Pac - Man in Japan .
The search giant reworked the game so the layout was arranged around letters forming its name .
The Pac - Man game proved so popular that Google has now made it permanently available on its own page .
Time delay
The statistics on how many people played and for how long were gathered by software firm Rescue Time .
It makes time - tracking software that keeps an eye on what workers do and where they go online .
On a typical day , it suggests , most people conduct about 22 searches on the Google page , each one lasting about 11 seconds .
Putting Pac - Man on the page boosted that time by an average of about 36 seconds , the firm said based on the browsing habits of 11,000 Rescue Time users .
The firm believes this is a relatively low figure because only a minority realised that the logo was playable .
To play , people had to click on the " insert coin " button which replaced the more familiar " I'm Feeling Lucky " button on 21 and 22 May .
Extrapolating this up across the 504 million unique users who visit the main Google page day - to - day , this represents an increase of 4.8 million hours - equal to about 549 years .
In dollar terms , assuming people are paid $ 25 ( £ 17.50 ) an hour , this equates to about $ 120 m in lost productivity , the firm said .
For that money , suggested Rescue Time , it would be possible to hire all Google 's employees and put them to work for about six weeks .
At first glance , the PlayStation 3's latest firmware update - which brings the system to v3.30 - seems inconsequential .
Some trophy reshuffling .
But it 's the behind - the - scenes stuff that 's more interesting , as it readies the console for 3D gaming .

Yes , while most of the release accompanying the update bangs on about how it will " make it easier to claim bragging rights among your friends " by letting you ... arrange your trophies , tucked away at the foot of the reveal is " this update preps the PS3 system for some upcoming new features , including 3D stereoscopic gaming , which is coming soon to PS3 , in time for the launch of Sony's 3D BRAVIA TVs " .
Considering half of you do n't even have a standard HDTV , this wo n't rock the majority 's socks off .
But if you 're actually planning on diving headfirst into the 3D era ?
Know that once you download this update – which is already out - your PS3 will be ready .
Are you ready to jump back into Left 4 Dead 2 ?
This Thursday the next set of downloadable content will be released .
Called " The Passing , " the content provides a new mission where the survivors from the first game meet the new set of characters from Left 4 Dead 2 .
Of course , that 's not all .
Versus is now given support for bot - controlled Infected , a new type of zombie ( the fallen survivor ) , the M60 , the golf club melee weapon , and a new co-op challenge mode .
There will be a lot to see and do .
The content pack will also add support for a new feature called " Mutations , " a weekly bit of content that changes how the game is played .
" These week - long runs of new gameplay modes range from ' Realism Versus ' mode to ' Chainsaw Massacre , ' which gives all players chainsaws with an unlimited supply of gasoline , " Valve explains .
" There are over 20 Mutations planned , each playable on all L4D2 Campaigns . "
You 'll need the content pack to access the Mutations .
The content will be free for PC gamers , but will cost 360 gamers 560 Microsoft Points ( $ 7 ) .
THE MILITARY AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER
By Michael LeMieux
May 1 , 2010

Anyone who has been watching the news or paying attention to the world around them has heard of conspiracy theory of the “ New World Order . ”
According to this theory , over the decades , a relatively small group of elite people have been manipulating events to create a global governance to usher in total control of the entire planet .
To some the evidence of this conspiracy is overwhelming and cannot be mere coincidence .
Others cannot fathom that such a thing could actually happen without everyone knowing about it .
I think it may be a little of both .
If you Google “ New World Order , ” you will return a list of over 276 million hits .
By anyone ’s standard this is quite impressive .
In contrast , if you do a similar search for “ George Washington , ” one of our nations most honored and renowned leaders , you would only come up with 74 million hits .
Obviously this is not definitive proof , but it shows that there has been a great deal of time and effort involved to both prove or disprove the theory .
As with most conspiracy theories , behind each of them lay a grain of truth upon which the theory is based .
The conclusion , however , may be something totally different or it could be spot on .
This , however , is the nature of conspiracy theories .
They are as hard to prove as they are to disprove .
Another aspect of a great conspiracy theory is the deniability factor .
If the government denies it is happening , then the supporters of the theory say they are lying to cover up what they are doing .
If the government is silent , then the theorists say they consent by their silence ( because if they were innocent , they would attempt to clear their name . )
Occasionally the target of the conspiracy theory may use the attention to their advantage , to deflect attention away from something they may not want others to know .
So you see conspiracy theories can be used by both sides .
What happens when a theory gains more and more evidence of its existence and national leaders openly admit to the theory ?
For example :
President George W. Bush ( March 6 , 1991 ) : “ Until now , the world we ’ve known has been a world divided – a world of barbed wire and concrete block , conflict and cold war .
Now , we can see a new world coming into view .
A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order .
In the words of Winston Churchill , a " world order " in which " the principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong ... "
A world where the United Nations , freed from cold war stalemate , is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders . ”
Dr. Carroll Quigley , CFR member , college mentor of President Clinton , author of " Tragedy and Hope , " stated : " The Council on Foreign Relations is the American branch of a society which originated in England ... [ and ] ... believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one - world rule established . "
Zbigniew Brzezinski was National Security Advisor to five presidents .
What was not widely known is that he was also a CFR member and founding member of the Trilateral Commission .
He stated : " In the economic - technological field , some international cooperation has already been achieved , but further progress will require greater American sacrifices .
More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken , with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position . "
He also stated that : " The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society .
Such a society would be dominated by an elite , unrestrained by traditional values .
Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up - to - date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen .
These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities . "
( Emphasis added . )
Part of this plan to implement a New World Order has already been completed in Europe with the European Union .
At first it was designed only as a “ free trade ” agreement to make Europe more competitive with the larger markets of the United States and China .
Since its original formation they have grown to include a political system to govern monetary affairs .
They adopted a new currency , a court system , imposed taxes , created a police force , and also a military .
It seems like they have all the makings of a United European States government .
Transpose that scenario across the seas to the United States – for the past few decades the federal government has been pushing more and more free trade agreements around the world .
Under President GHW
Bush we implemented the Security and Prosperity Partnership with the United States , Canada , and Mexico as partners .
Under this agreement many goals were established to build cooperation in key areas of security and business to include a single border that encompassed all three countries .
Part of this shared border would include integration of police and military command and control , training , interoperability of equipment , and standards .
Another aspect of the SPP was to have more open borders where citizens of each of the member countries would more easily be able to travel and that the flow of goods and services would be expedited .
Travel corridors would be created to ensure a smooth flow between the three countries .

The CFR produced a report entitled , “ Building the North American Community ” recommending the following :
1 . That the three nations should cooperate and share responsibility in areas of law enforcement , energy security , regulatory policy , dispute resolution , and continental defense vice national defense .
2 . That the countries should rely more on business and less on bureaucracy .
3 . To build an area where there is free movement of trade , capital and people .
( Apparently border security is out the window . )
4. Security boundaries should be around the continent not around individual nations .
5 . They recommend creating a North America security pass .
Not only will we have a national ID , we will have a continental ID , which has smart chip technology so we can be tracked wherever we go .
6 . By 2010 they wanted to have established a free flow of people across the interior borders of all three countries .
7 . They recommend development of a tri-national threat intelligence center and joint training for law enforcement officials .
8 . They recommend the development of tri-national ballistics and explosives registration .
( Second Amendment , we do n’t need any Second Amendment . )
9 . Military defense structures are to be comprised of all three countries ’ militaries .
10 .
Combine the intelligence - sharing capabilities at both the military and law enforcement levels .
11 . They also want to spread the benefits of economic development .
( This sounds a little like socialism -- entitlement rights for the poor to narrow the income gap between the three countries .
Why do n’t they have to work for a living like everyone else ? )
12 . Pour more money , resources , businesses , infrastructure , judicial reform , and governmental oversight into Mexico to allow them to grow faster than the U.S. or Canada so they can catch up to us economically .
13 .
They want to create investment funds in Canada and the U.S. to funnel more capital into Mexico .
14 . Combine national resources for all three countries to share .
15 .
They want to create common tariffs for all three nations and allow all ports to be used for all of the nations .
( This will require modification of national tax structures , port authorities , Labor Union practices , and security . )
16 . Establish a permanent tribunal for dispute resolution .
( This is the first step in creating a judicial system .
This tribunal will supersede national law and constitutions . )
17 . Open skies and open roads .
No more borders and check points , we should all trust each other .
We ’re a partnership now .
18 . Increase labor mobility .
( Sounds like open borders to me . )
19 .
They also want us to implement a Social Security Totalization Agreement between the U.S. and Mexico .
( What ?
We ca n’t make SS work for our own citizens , and they want to add more ?
It keeps sounding more like socialism . )
20 . Next , a full North American education system .
( Maybe this will fix our broken education system , NOT . )
21 . Create organizations and governmental departments to facilitate a vision - to - action framework .
( This , my friends , has already started . )
I did not go into every detail of what the CFR wants in the way of creating this integration , community , union , or whatever you want to call it ; but I think you get the picture .
Now looking over the list and comparing it to the European structure and SPP goals laid out above , do you notice the striking similarities between the two ?
President Obama stated his intent to move forward with advancing the SPP agenda under a less controversial title of “ North America Leader Summit . ”
Navy Vice Admiral James Winnefeld Jr. stated , during his April confirmation hearings to a Senate committee , that if confirmed to head U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command , he will work to build and maintain the command ’s relationships between the militaries of Canada and Mexico .
We have already integrated the Northern Command with the Canadian Command to aid in missions in support of the civil authorities .
This means that the President could call upon foreign troops to operate within the borders of our own nation and for / or against the American people .
To further entrench the New World Order conspiracy – a February 2009 U.S. Army War College paper authored by Scott G. Wuestner , entitled “ Building Partner Capacity / Security Force Assistance : A New Structural Paradigm , ” stated :
“ This paper analyzes this construct and provides a framework for identifying proponency , institutionalizing lessons learned from Operation IRAQI FREEDOM and Operation ENDURING FREEDOM , as well as providing military , police and governance structure as a tool for global engagement .
This new structural paradigm will help the United States gain access , influence , and build capacity throughout this new world order . ”
President Obama in his Berlin wall speech called for a World Order “ where the burdens of global citizenship … ” would be shared .
Yet in this very same speech he condemns the workers of America for causing global warming , which we now know is based on lies and false data .

We have changed Presidents and political parties many times over the past forty plus years , but when you look at what they have said and what they are doing , you have to wonder if the conspiracy theorists are right .
How could so many different leaders , with different backgrounds , different political platforms , different beliefs , all promote the same programs that are leading us toward a “ New World Order ? ”
Do you really think this is all a coincidence ?

I recently decided to venture into the world of lager brewing after making several successful ale recipes .
I have a top loading kegerator that I am converting to a two chamber serving and brewing configuration , but was worried about getting my 5 gallon carboy in and out of the fridge because of the lack of handles .
Last night , while buying the Edelbock , I decided to buy the Brew Hauler to help me lift it in and out .
I went home and started brewing .
After a nice afternoon of brewing ( boy that wort smelled good ) I was ready to eat a late dinner .
My roommate was pulling the steaks off the grill and I had just cooled the wort .
I picked up the carboy using my new Brew Hauler and started walking to the brewing closet .
I had n’t taken more than five careful steps when I felt a slight tearing or slipping of nylon .
Before I could react the carboy promptly exploded on our tile floor .
Pieces of glass were thrown clear across the kitchen and my delicious Edelbock rushed to every corner of the floor .
Sticky green hop - scented water filled every nook and cranny beneath my fridge , under cabinets , and slowly expanded into the dining room .
Luckily everything it touched was tile , and after a few hours of furious mopping our floor is only slightly sticky .
We went to bed exhausted .
This morning I examined the Brew Hauler .
There were no visible rips , tears , or even so much as a frayed thread .
The carboy had simply slipped out from the Brew Hauler Harness .
I think this disturbed me more than if it had broken .
I had carefully ensured that none of the straps were twisted , tightened down the clip harness , and carefully tested it when empty .
The Brew Hauler did n’t break , it is simply a faulty design .
Maybe it was the bit of wort that spilled around the neck of the carboy and moistened the straps– I do n’t know .
All I know is that now I ’m out a carboy , out a $ 40 batch of beer , and out the entire 8 hours of my day that I spent producing and then cleaning what ended up being the stickiest floor polish I ’ve ever used .
I felt cheated .
I had bought a $ 15 Brew Hauler , and it destroyed $ 75 worth of beer and equipment .
Even worse , when I asked AHS about being refunded the cost of the carboy and the beer I was told I needed to write an email to the owner .
I may not be a seasoned Austin brewer , but I do feel like AHS is my friendly neighborhood beer store .
I recognize most of the employees , and since my friends bought me a starter kit from AHS almost a year ago , I ’ve brewed 5 AHS recipes , the most recent ( besides the ill fated Edelbock ) being the Sunny Oats Ale .
I purchased all the beer lines and CO2 equipment for my four tap kegerator from AHS , and always found their advice to be accurate and helpful .
UPDATE
Austin Homebrew
Supply ’s owner replied to my email within two days and was very understanding .
He ’s generously offered to replace both the carboy and the Edelbock kit so I get get on with brewing this next weekend .
Once again all is well in the world .
I think this time I might get a plastic carboy .

Before you criticize the progamers , look at the reality !
Article by Han Yoon Hyung
The world of e-sports was engulfed in a state of shock on the 16th .
It was found that current progamers were involved in match fixing .
A lot of the fans were dismayed to learn that even a starleague champion made profit from using illegal betting sites and fixing matches .
People are criticizing the progamers involved for perverting the spirit of sports , but not that many people are pointing out why they made such decisions .
Progamers are hailed by many fans , but behind the screen , there is a very competitive system .
The problem only worsens by the fact that most people believe that " earning money through gaming is n't labor . "
We should not stop at criticizing the progamers that were involved , but also look into the " reality " behind their motives .
This article is to show the lives and the labor conditions of progamers .
Editor .
I did n't know where to start .
I was a veteran starleague fan , and a member of the progressive political party , but I did n't know how this would be taken by the progamers .
The lives of progamers were a sensitive subject .
The progamers and even fans might say " they 're talking about something they do n't even know about " if the progressive party raised the issue of rights of progamers .
2010 - 5- 15 Saturday night .
It was the day before the official statement on match fixing .
Would the interview have been harder if I tried after the statement ?
I was careful to tell them that their identity would be confidential .
The Progressive Party Representative Noh ( from here on : Noh ) , Political Researcher Hong ( from here on : Hong ) , and E - Sports Columnist Kim ( aka pain , from here on : Kim ) attended the meeting .
Starleague , Survival of the Fittest
Mr. Han ( the author , from here on : Han ) :
Have you read " Mookhyang " ( a martial art novel ) ?
Progamer " A " : Yes .
" A " answered more willingly than I thought .
Although we lived in completely different worlds , we were both young men from the same time period .
Han :
In the novel , the main character learns martial arts and develops along with other children even without a name .
One by one , his peers start to disappear , and he develops further and rises to a higer place .
I thought starleagues were kind of like that .
Since you debuted , to today , what are your views on the lives of progamers , both your life and the lives of your peers that disappeared with your success ?
The first thing that comes up when talking about the life of a progamer is the conflict with parents .
The most famous progamer , , said that his parents did not know he played StarCraft .
Back then " progamer " meant just a person looking to earn money from gaming , before games were broadcasted .
On the other hand , the top player right now , , persuaded his parents and became a progamer with parental support .
However , this is a story of a progamer who rose in the era where earning over a hundred thousand dollars a year playing games were " role models " .
" A " also could n't avoid the conflict .
His parents did not allow him to become a progamer because the future is too uncertain , and " A " also understood his parents .
" What kind of a parent would want their kid to lead a difficult life ?
The future is very dim when you become a progamer ..... "
After a few months , his parents allowed him to pursue his dreams , and after passing the test , he joined a team .
Nowadays , in order to get connections to be able to take tests for progaming teams , people spend a lot of time in clans .
Once you hit 20 , it becomes almost impossible to be tested to join a team .
When asked about this , " A " answered " You have to be at least in your 10's.
20 is the oldest you can be . "
About daily life and practice time
After he joined the team , the life with the team started .
It was before when large sponsors funded each team .
" Over ten people lived in one apartment .
There was no room to eat together .
There were about 10 computers in the living room , and there were a few bunk beds in the bedroom .
If there were not enough beds , we slept on the floor .... "
It did n't happen often , but the teammates kept changing .
Few left , and few joined .
Some went to military service , gave up , or left for education .
Of course there were a few that were kicked out for not being good enough .
Still now , B team players come and go without ever being well known .
The dorm became better and better .
The sponsors began to look at e-sports .
The large corporations took players from other teams , and others accepted a lot of practice partners to pick out new talents .
I started to wonder how it was like living with a team .
Han :
Is the hierarchy strict ?
I think it must be since only men are living together .
" A " : Nope .
There are older and younger players , but it 's not a strict hierarchy .
Hong asked about the practice time .
A daily cycle of a progamer is different from that of a normal person .
They wake up around 10 and their day starts after eating breakfast , and it continues until late night .
If you look at " Nal_rA's Oldboy " from OGN , the SPARKYZ team ate lunch at 4 PM .
I think it was to achieve the optimal condition when the leagues take place in the evening .
The practice time , not counting time for food , was 11 hours and 30 minutes for A team members , and 13 hours and 30 mnutes for B team members .
This was mandatory .
Can you skip it ?
If you want to , you must have a reason .
A progamer from some team wanted to watch a Beyonce concert and did not attend practice .
That day happened to be a bad day for the team .
He was punished and pushed down to B team , and ended up retiring trying to rise back up .
" I think there were other reasons , but he said that was the biggest reason . "
There are barely any days off .
There are matches in the weekends , so you have to practice even in the weekends .
" A " 's team gets a day and a half off starting right when the last match of the week ends .
MBCGame and OGN have very busy schedules .
In a year , there is only one month period where no leagues go on .
This became worse as time went on .
The players are dissatisfied , but have no way of speaking out .
Kim put it this way .
" KeSPA was formed by the corporations that sponsor the teams .
Because it helps them advertise , they try to increase the number of matches .
They fill up the whole year with matches .
It 's not like they have to pay more to have more matches . "
The life of a progamer through the screen is extravagant .
Behind it , however , is a restricted life with no way to speak out
The rights of a progamer that creates the content for the games ?
Hong pointed out the copyright issues of replays .
If there was such a thing , KeSPA would not simply try to increase the number of matches .
If a drama is shown again on a different channel , that channel must pay the original company a fee .
If a musician plays a piece , that music becomes the musician's .
The same should be applied to progamers and replays .
This problem is very complicated .
The VOD shown on TV is not simply the replay of a progamer , but it contains the explanation of the commentators and the views of the observer .
When we watch these games , there are many parties involved .
There are Blizzard , the gamers , and the broadcasting companies .
Right now , the games are the properties of the broadcasting companies , and the rights of the players are handled by the sponsors that pay those gamers , through KeSPA .
Blizzard is trying to claim their rights in the e-sports market with the release of StarCraft II .
These powerful organizations silence the rights of the average progamer .
If the sponsors paid the progamers as much as they took the rights away , it would be okay , but the progamers are n't even considered laborers .
Noh concentrated on the labor - like state of progaming .
He thinks that progamers should have a labor contract with their sponsors .
Think about it for a moment .
That would cause the problem with child labor .
The law prevents children under 15 from being in labor .
The famous progamers debuted when they were 15 or 16 .
Players like debuted at the age of 13 .
If we see them as laborers , it is illegal .
The gamers between 15 and 17 years of age can be in labor , but the problem is time .
The law prevents adolescents from being in labor at night .
Noh said , " There was once this situation in Europe .
There was a musical , and a child actor was needed .
However , the girl from that country was too young to be put into labor at the time of the showing .
The whole country went into debate .
It 's not a single person 's problem , but a problem for the whole society .
That 's why there was so much debate . "
Also , the minimum wage must be met with a labor contract .
The minimum wage for 2010 was 4110 wons per hour ( app. $ 3.60 ) .
For 44 hours a week , the minimum wage is 928,860 won per month ( app. $ 820 ) .
The progamers are required to practice around 60 ~ 75 hours a week , and over half of these hours are during weekends and late nights .
The weekend and late night minimum wage is 1.5 times larger , so it would be 6165 ( app. $ 5.40 ) won / hour .
If we say the progamers practice at least 60 hours a week , and if only half of them are part of the 1.5 x rate , the minimum amount they need to be paid for a week is 308,250 won ( app. $ 270 ) , for a month , 1,339,345 won ( app. $ 1,180 ) , and for a year , 16,072,155 won ( app. $ 14,000 ) .
The minimum wage for a A - team player would be 16 million won , and for B - team player , it would be 20 million ( app. $ 17,600 ) .
This shows how much these progamers are working .
If we put these regulations on progaming , the number of progamers would decrease significantly , and some corporations will give up .
The increase in pay of a progamer over time will also decrease .
However , this will greatly increase the conditions of life of progamers .
This is the reality .
B - team players are given a dorm , but they do n't get paid .
They do n't even sign a single thing , let alone a contract .
Even if they leave , there are plenty to choose from .
The bigger teams pay them 500 thousand wons a month .
What if you 're one of the players that play in proleague ?
They sign a contract .
It 's not a labor contract , but a civil contract .
Even then they get paid 10 million won a year on average and usually does n't pass 20 million .
A few " star " gamers earn over 200 million a year .
I 'm sure there are a few progamers who get paid between those two numbers , but we wo n't know exactly how much that is .
The pay is not released to the public .
Even " A " does n't know how much his teammates get paid .
Hong asked if the practice hours are mentioned in the civil contract .
" A " said no .
Hong said if they 're going to make certain hours of practice mandatory , it should be a labor contract .
Although the hours are not listed in the contract , a civil contract can be nullified by the sponsors at any time , so the players must obey the hours .
Even though StarCraft is an individual sport , a progamer can't participate in even the preliminaries without being in a progaming team .
The system is set up so that the sponsors have ultimate control over the progamers .
If it 's too much to change the contracts to labor contracts , there should be at least a guarantee of the players ' rights and futures .
The gamers get treated neither as the " creator " of game content nor the " laborers " for the gaming teams .
" What 's my plan for the future ?
That 's my # 1 problem . "
The most sensitive problem for progamers is the mandatory military service .
There are a lot of B - team gamers that worry about military service and quit .
The famous progamers attend universities to delay the time .
Boxer even went to a graduate school before joining the Air Force , forming the Air Force ACE team .
The gamers that are less famous apply for the Korean Cyber University to delay going into military service .
" We really just leave the lesson on and practice .
We only pay attention shortly before exams , and we take the test online .
We do n't listen carefully to the lecture . "
They do n't have the time to learn .
" If they gave us a few hours a day , I think I can prepare for my future ... "
" A " seemed to have thought about this problem long enough already .
He said he was worried about his own future when asked .
What happened to his retired peers ?
" It 's not like your experience as a progamer help .
Most go into coaching or show programs .
Some go abroad to study , and others attend classes at a school .
The rest do n't do well . "
I asked what " not doing well " meant .
" They do n't have a job .
There 's nothing they can do . "
Another opportunity for the progamers is to try to be a progamer for StarCraft II .
However , Blizzard made StarCraft II with e-sports in mind , unlike StarCraft .
You can't even play against each other without connecting to Battle .
net .
( In StarCraft it was possible through LAN ) .
KeSPA negotiated with Blizzard on the topic of StarCraft II as an e-sport , but it did n't go well .
They do n't allow the progamers to play StarCraft II .
Hong asked , " Does it make sense for them to be able to stop us from playing ?
It 's just a game . "
" A " answered , " I do n't know . "
StarCraft II is currently in beta testing phase .
" I think I 'll have a problem with it if they do n't let us play after the official release .
Like when StarCraft was first released , there will be few of us who change to that game if there are prize tournaments .
StarCraft II is on the same line as StarCraft .
Those who are good in StarCraft also do well in StarCraft II .
It 's only the beta but there are worldwide tournaments .
The retired progamers already participate in StarCraft II tournaments , and are doing well .
When it is officially released , those who are not getting paid will be tempted to try StarCraft II competitively .
There may be players that leave the current system of e-sports to try something new if KeSPA fails to negotiate with Blizzard .
The match fixing incident and e-sports after the release of Starcraft II
When something like match fixing happens , the media criticizes individual integrity .
Of course being forced to practice over 10 hours a day at a young age can cause problems .
I asked about the progamer knowledge training .
" There are two in one year .
You need to attend to keep your license .
They talk about improving the tenacity of being a progamer , about the spirit of sports that we should have . "
I asked if players enjoy these lectures .
" Not really ...
Games and sports are different ... "
I thought of the soldiers being mentally trained in the military .
The poor environment , the unclear future , the bad pay , and being treated like property has a far greater detrimental effect than two days of lecture can fix .
The lure of " black money " must have been tempting no matter how much they were getting paid .
It was even more heartbreaking that these players , who always put the game and the competition at the center , would get involved in match fixing .
What they needed was not a lecture , but the basic human rights .
Hong asked this .
Hong :
Do you know the term " 880 thousand won era " ?
What do you think it would be like if the minimum wage for the B - team players was 880 thousand wons ( app $ 770 ) per month ?
" A " : That would be good .
If you earn that much , would n't it be a decent job ?
We live together yet some of us get paid no money while other get paid 200 million wons .
There were a lot of players that did n't even receive spending money ....
The sponsors try to spend as least money as possible .
After a few years , the money given by the sponsors decrease .
Since we do n't have the money , we 're forced to live together .
Between 3~8 people use each room .
Hong :
Is n't it bothersome to share a room with so many people ?
" A " : It 's fine , since we do n't do anything but sleep in those rooms .
Our discussion was nearing its end .
Everyone each made a comment .
Noh : E - sports through the TV is extravagant .
A lot of teenagers dream of becoming progamers .
Although e-sports has the nation 's attention , the living conditions of a progamer is bad .
There is a " dark side " of progaming that people do n't see even though so many large corporations are involved .
It reminded me of the B - team pro baseball players .
This is a big problem since young men are involved ...
" A " : There are too many people wanted to be progamers ....
Noh :
That 's why it 's like this .
They 're using the fact that people all want to become progamers against the progamers themselves .
Kim :
For the teams , it becomes easier to restrain the players if there are more practice partners .
It 's easy because they all compete with each other .
Since they do n't even pay the practice partners , the more the better .
KeSPA themselves say that the rise of the number of progamers is the problem , but they 're not decreasing the number of semi pro licenses given through Courage .
In the end , the kids jump into a hopeless field of competition .
This is shameful .
" A " : This problem was known for a long time , but was ignored .
Hong : Did n't Boxer say something about a progamers ' union ?
" A " : That talk has been going on for a long time too but the players have too little strength .
I do n't even know how the leagues will turn out in the future .
What can a player do for himself ?
I do n't even know .
Noh : I learned about a new world today .
I can now see it from behind the scenes .
Our nation at the front of the world of e-sports and I 'm embarrassed about the truth .
In the future , I 'll be sure to think about the rights of progamers .
What is politics to them ?
Many people would say this .
" It 's so awesome to earn money playing games .
What about that is labor ?
If you think it 's that bad , just do n't do it ! "
The society and the " adults " say " You started it because you wanted to do it .
You should be able to endure it " naturally .
If you think about it that way , no person in the field of sports or arts would be able to earn as much as they work .
( Sadly , this is the truth in Korea )
The problem is that when a hobby becomes a market , nobody talks about the rights of the people that produce the content .
Some say , to solve this problem , they need to " make it bigger . "
However , as e-sports grew , the ones suffering at the bottom of the pyramid continued to suffer , and only the " star " progamers ' pays increased .
It actually had the opposite effect as kids drawn to the scene by these stars found themselves at the bottom of the pyramid , unable to climb .
The " adults " are making profits out of the children 's passion .
After the long discussion ended , we had dinner together and had a drink .
Kim and I talked about " A " 's bright moments and expressed our personal thoughts on the progamers involved in the match fixing incident .
" A " does n't know politics , but he said he has positive feeling towards former president Roh .
When asked about Noh , he responded that he knew who he was and did n't have a negative image of him .
I did n't say anything about it to " A " , but as he was leaving he told me that he would vote for Noh since he at least knows his face .
I did n't show it but my heart sank .
I wondered what politics , that I 'm interested in politics , means to them .
As I returned home , I thought to myself that no matter who he votes for , I hope " A " has time to come out and vote on June 2nd .
+ Show Spoiler [ Original Article ] + 지난 16 일 e스포츠계는 충격에 휩싸였다 .
현직 프로게이머까지 가세한 스타크래프트 경기의 승부조작 사실이 검찰에 의해 확인됐기 때문이다 .
우승 경험까지 있는 프로게이머가 승부를 조작해 불법 도박사이트의 베팅 결과를 뒤집고 수수료를 받았다는 사실에 많은 팬들은 허탈함을 감추지 못했다 .
20 대를 갓 넘은 청년들의 이같은 행위가 스포츠의 순수한 정신을 더럽혔다는 비난이 줄을 잇고 있지만 그들이 왜 그런 선택까지 하게 되었는지에 대해 주목하는 이들은 별로 없다 .
프로게이머들의 방송 경기에는 수많은 군중이 몰리지만 그 뒤에는 오랜 시간에 걸친 무한 경쟁과 착취 시스템이 존재한다 .
이를 해결하기엔 ' 게임으로 돈을 버는 것은 노동이 아니다 '라는 이중적인 인식 역시 걸림돌이다 .
승부를 조작한 프로게이머들을 비난하는 데 그칠 것이 아니라 그들의 '현 실'을 들여다봐야 하는 이유가 있는 것은 이 때문이다 .
프로게이머들의 삶과 노동조건을 보여주는 기고를 2회에 걸쳐 싣는다 .
편집자
어떻게 말을 꺼내야 할지 망설였다 .
나는 오랜 스타리그 팬이면서 또한 진보신당 당원이지만 , 진보정당이 주최하는 이런 간담회가 프로게이머에게 어떻게 받아들여질지 알 수 없었다 .
프로게이머의 생활은 민감한 주제였다 .
가령 진보신당이 ' 프 로게이머의 인권 ' 문제를 제기했을 때 e스포츠 구단이나 프로게이머 , 심지어 팬들조차도 ' 실정 모르는 이들이 판을 들쑤시는 ' 것으로 여길 수도 있었다 .
2010 년 5 월 15 일 토요일 저녁. 프로게이머 승부조작 사건에 대한 공식적인 검찰수사 발표가 나기 전 날이었다 .
검찰수사 보도가 난 이후라면 인터뷰가 더 어려웠을까 ?
소속구단과 신원을 숨기기로 했다는 점도 매우 조심스러웠다 .
진보신당 노회찬 대표 , 홍원표 정책연구위원 , e스포츠 칼럼니스트이자 팬덤의 오랜 ' 네 임드'인 김정 근 ( 필명 pain ) 씨가 함께 간담회에 참석했다 .
스타리그라는 강호 무림( 江湖武林 )
한윤형 : 혹시 < 묵향 > 보셨어요 ?
프로게이머A : 예. 봤어요 .
A는 예상보다 훨씬 선선히 대답했다 .
사는 세계는 전혀 다르지만 어쨌든 동시대를 사는 젊은이였다 .
한윤형 : <묵향>을 보면요 , 주인공이 어릴 때 이름도 없이 다른 아이들과 함께 마교에 끌려와서 무공을 배우고 성장하잖아요 .
근데 성장하면서 동료들이 어느 순간 하나둘씩 사라지는 경험을 하고 , 그러면서 자신은 성장하면서 더 높은 위치에 올라가고 ……. 프로게이머 세계가 참 강호 무림과 비슷하다는 생각을 했어요 .
데뷔할 때부터 오늘에 이르기까 지
A님의 시선으로 바라본 프로게이머의 삶 , 본인과 본인의 시선에 잡힌 사라진 동료들의 삶에 대해서 얘기해 보았으면 합니다 .
프로게이머의 삶을 얘기할 때 처음으로 나오는 주제은 ' 부모와의 갈등 '이다 .
TV 에서도 종종 소개된 가장 유명한 프로게이머 임요 환( 30 , SK텔레 콤 T1 소속 ) 의 경우 PC 방에서 스타크래프트를 하고 돌아다니는 것을 부모가 몰랐다고 한다 .
' 프 로게이머'란 것이 대회 상금을 노리는 사람이던 시절 , 즉 방송사리그가 없던 시절의 일이다 .
반면 현재 e스포츠 스타리그의 최강자로 군림하는 이영 호( 18 , KT 롤스터 소속 ) 는 부모를 끈질기게 설득했고 결국 부모의 격려를 받으며 프로게이머가 되었다 .
이미 억대연봉의 프로게이머가 '롤 모델'이 된 시대의 일이다 .
A도 갈등을 피해갈 수 없었다 .
부모님은 미래가 불확실하다는 이유로 프로게이머에 도전하는 것을 허락하지 않았고 A 역시 그런 부모를 이해했다 .
" 어느 부모가 고생길을 간다는데 좋아하겠어요 .
뒤도 잘 안 보이는 직업인데 ……. " 그렇게 아옹다옹하는 몇 개월의 시간이 흐른 후 간신히 부모의 허락을 받았고 , 입단 테스트에서 실력을 인정받아 팀에 들어가게 되었다 .
요즘은 입단테스트를 받게 해줄 인맥을 만들기 위해 클랜 생활을 거치기도 하고 스무 살이 넘으면 입단테스트를 받는 게 불가능에 가까워진다 .
최근 입단테스트를 받는 후배들의 연령에 대해 물어보 니
A는 이렇게 답변했다 .
" 최소 10 대죠 . 스무 살이 마지노선이라 할 정도에요 . "
숙소 생활환경과 연습시간을 물어보 다
입단 후엔 공동생활이 시작되었다 .
지금처럼 기업 스폰서가 제대로 붙어 있던 시절은 아니었다 .
" 아파트 한 채에 열 몇 명이 사는 거죠 .
다 같이 둘러앉아 밥을 먹을 만한 공간이 없었죠 .
거실에 컴퓨터가 열 대쯤 있고 , 방에 이층침대가 몇 개 있어요 .
침대 모자라면 바닥에서 자기도 하고 ……. " 흔하지는 않은 일이지만 종종 멤버가 바뀌었다 .
몇 명이 빠지고 몇 명이 들어왔다 .
군대를 가게 되거나 , 생활이 힘들어서 포기를 하거나 , 학업을 하겠다고 나가는 경우가 있었다 .
물론 실력이 안 된다고 해서 팀에서 내보내는 경우도 있었다 .
요즘도 2 군 선수는 대중없이 나가거나 들어오기도 한다 .
그래도 숙소는 점점 좋아졌다 .
기업 스폰서가 e스포츠 바닥에 들어오기 시작했다 .
대기업팀은 다른 팀에서 선수를 빼갔고 , 그렇지 못한 팀은 연습생을 많이 받아서 새로운 선수를 발굴하는 쪽에 주력했다 .
숙소 생활 분위기는 어땠는지 궁금해졌다 .
한윤형 : 군대 내무반 분위기는 아닌가요 ?
남자들끼리 공동생활하려면 그럴 것 같은데 .
프로게이머A : 아 그런 건 아니에요 .
나이에 따라 형 동생 하긴 하지만 그게 군대 같은 서열과는 달라요 .
홍원표 연구위원은 연습시간에 대해 물어보았다 .
프로게이머의 생활 사이클은 일반인과는 다르다 .
10 시 정도에 일어나 아침을 먹고 하루를 시작해 새벽에 일과가 마감된다 .
< 온 게임넷 >에서 방영 중인 리얼 다큐 ' 강민의 올드보 이'를 보면 하이트 스파키즈 팀의 점심식사 시간은 오후 네 시였다 .
리그가 주로 저녁시간에 진행되기 때문에 그 시간에 최상의 컨디션을 맞추기 위해서인 것 같았다 .
연습시간을 들어보니 도중에 점심 , 저녁 식사시간을 한 시간씩 계산해서 뺀다고 해도 1군의 경우 11시간30 분 , 2군의 경우 13시간30 분 이 연습시간으로 정해져 있었다 .
정해진 것이 그만큼이란 얘기다 .
빠질 수는 없을까 ?
그러려면 사유가 있어야 한단다 .
모 팀의 모 게이머는 비욘세 콘서트를 꼭 보고 싶다고 연습을 빠졌다 .
그런데 하필 당시 팀 분위기가 안 좋았다 .
결국 그는 팀의 지시에 불응했다는 이유로 징계를 받아 2군으로 강등됐고 재기하려 노력하다가 결국 은퇴했다 .
" 겹친 문제가 있었을 것 같긴 한데 제일 큰 사유가 그거라고 하더라고요 . "
경기가 많기 때문에 쉬는 날이 별로 없다 .
주말에도 경기가 있으니 당연히 주말에도 연습일정이 짜인다 .
A가 속한 팀의 경우 일주일 경기가 끝나는 순간부터 하루 반가량의 휴식이 주어진다 .
온게임넷과 MBC 게임의 경기일정은 너무 빡빡하다 .
일 년 열두 달 동안 리그가 없는 ' 스토브 기간'은 한 달 정도에 불과하다 .
리그가 커지고 프로리그 경기 숫자가 늘어나면서 이런 현상은 더 심해졌다 .
선수들도 불만은 있지만 뭐라고 할 방법이 없다 .
김정근 씨가 이렇게 논평했다 .
" 한국e스포츠협 회( KeSPA ) 는 팀 스폰서를 하는 기업들이 모여서 구성된 거죠 .
그들 입장에선 홍보에 유리하기 때문에 경기수를 늘리려고 합니다 .
1 년 내내 경기를 틀어야 합니다 .
많이 튼다고 돈을 더 주는 것도 아니니 그게 편한 거죠 . "
▲ 화면으로 보이는 프로게이머들의 삶은 화려하다 .
하지만 그 이면엔 근로계약도 없이 삶을 통제당하는 수많은 연습생들의 '강호 무림'이 있다.

게임방송이란 콘텐츠에 기여한 선수의 권리는 ?
홍원표 연구위원은 자연스레 리플레이의 저작권 문제를 지적한다 .
그런 게 있다면 무작정 경기수를 늘리려고 하지는 않을 거라는 거다 .
가령 드라마가 케이블에 넘어가서 재방송을 하면 케이블 방송국은 해당 작가에게 저작권료를 지불해야 한다 .
연주자가 악기를 연주하면 그 공연 내용은 연주자의 것이 된다 .
이처럼 리플레이의 저작권 혹은 게임시연에 대한 저작권이 프로게이머에게 있어야 한다는 것이다 .
이 문제는 매우 복잡하다 .
가령 방송중계 VOD 의 경우 단순히 게이머의 리플레이가 아니라 중계진의 해설과 옵서버의 화면구성이 덧씌워진 것이다 .
우리가 중계방송을 볼 때 이 콘텐츠 생산에 개입한 주체는 한 둘이 아니다 .
블리자드라는 게임회사가 있고 , 그 게임을 통해 자신의 기량을 발휘한 프로게이머가 있으며 , 마지막으로 게임방송국이 있다 .
지금 e스포츠에서 인정되는 권리는 게임방송국의 권리이며 프로게이머의 권리는 그들에게 연봉을 주는 구단주들의 모임인 협회가 대리행사하고 있다.
블리자드는 스타크래프 트2 출시를 계기로 e스포츠 시장에서 자신들의 권리를 주장하려 한다 .
이들의 각축 속에 한국 e스포츠의 평범한 게이머들의 권리는 묻힌다 .
구단이 '창작 자'로서의 이들의 권리를 가져간 만큼 연봉으로 대우해주면 좋겠지만 이들은 '노 동자'도 아니다 .
진보신당 노회찬 대표는 프로게이머의 노동자성에 관심을 기울였다 .
그는 프로게이머가 회사와 근로계약을 체결해야 한다고 본다 .
프로게이머가 회사와 정식으로 계약하는 노동자가 된다고 생각해보자 .
그러면 먼저 미성년자 노동의 문제가 걸린다 .
우리나라 법으로 15 세 미만이 일을 하면 아동학대다 .
요즘 유명한 프로게이머들의 경우 만 15 세에서 16 세 사이에 데뷔했다 .
하지만 전태 양 ( 16 , 위메이드 폭스 소속 ) 의 경우 만 13세에 데뷔했다 .
노동자로 본다면 아동학대다 .
만 15 세에서 17 세까지의 경우 노동을 할 수 있지만 이 경우엔 노동시간이 문제가 된다 .
이 나이의 청소년을 야간노동하게 하는 것은 불법이다 .
노회찬이 말했다 .
" 유럽 어느 국가에 이런 일이 있었어요 .
뮤지컬을 하는데 대본상 아역이 필요했고 아역배우를 썼단 말이에요 .
근데 그 나라에서 그 나이의 소녀는 그 뮤지컬이 공연하는 시간에 노동하는 게 금지되어 있었던 거예요 .
그래서 사회 전체가 그 문제로 논쟁을 했죠 .
이게 단순히 한 명의 문제가 아니라 사회의 기본 틀에 대한 합의 문제였기 때문에 그렇게 논쟁을 했던 거예요 . "
또한 근로계약을 맺을 경우엔 최저임금이 지급되어야 한다. 2010 년 최저임금은 4110 원이다. 주 44시 간 근로를 하는 20 인 미만 사업장의 경우 월급은 92만8860 원이다. 그런데 구단은 게이머에게 주당 60 ~ 75 시간 의 연습을 요구하고 있고 이 시간 중 절반 이상은 휴일근무와 야간근무다 .
휴일근무 , 야간근무 , 연장근무에 대해선 1.5배 의 시급인 6165 원이 적용된다 .
최소한 주당 60 시간 연습을 한다고 치고 그중 절반의 시간에 1.5 배 시급이 적용된다고 계산하면 주급은 30 만8250원 , 월급은 133만9345원 , 연봉으로 계산하면 1607 만 2155 원 이 된다. 쉽게 말하면 1 군선수의 최저임금은 연봉 1600 만 원 정도 , 2 군선수의 최저임금은 2000 만 원 정도가 된다. 이게 프로게이머들의 노동 강도다 .
이 기준을 적용할 경우 1,2 군 프로게이머의 숫자는 크게 줄어야 할 테고 일부 기업은 구단 운영을 포기할 것이다 .
'스타 프로게이 머'의 연봉 상한선도 낮아질 것이다 .
그래도 이렇게 할 경우 수많은 청소년과 젊은이들의 열정이 착취당하는 현실은 많이 개선될 것이다 .
현실은 이렇다 .
2 군 연습생은 숙식을 제공받되 연봉이 없다 .
그들은 계약서를 안 쓰는 것은 물론 간단한 서약서도 쓰지 않는다 .
자의로 언제든지 나올 수 있는 사람들이다 .
그들이 나와도 뽑을 사람은 얼마든지 있다 .
관대한 구단에선 이들에게 월 50 만 원 정도의 지원금을 준다 .
프로리그 엔트리에 올라가는 10 명 가량의 1 군선수에 포함되면 어떨까 .
그들은 계약서를 쓴다.
물론 근로계약서가 아닌 민사계약서다 .
1 군조차도 막 올라오면 연봉이 500 만 원인 경우가 있다고 한다.
평균적으로는 1000 만 원을 넘고 2000 만 원에 못 미친다 .
리그를 주름잡는 ' 스타 ' 게이머 몇몇의 연봉은 2억이 넘는다 .
그 사이에 우리가 이름을 익히 알만한 선수들의 연봉이 있겠지만 그것이 얼마인지는 알 수 없다. 연봉금액은 팬들에게 공개되지 않는다 .
A도 대략 자신의 팀의 연봉의 상한선과 하한선을 알고 있을 뿐이다 .
홍원표 연구위원은 계약서에 연습시간이 명시되어 있는지를 물어보았다 .
A는 그렇지 않다고 대답했다 .
홍원표는 숙소에 잡아두고 시간을 통제할 정도라면 그건 민사계약이 아니라 근로계약이 되어야 한다며 놀라워했다 .
숙소생활과 연습시간은 계약서상 강제력이 없지만 구단은 민사계약을 언제든지 파기할 수 있기 때문에 프로게이머는 이에 따를 수밖에 없다 .
스타크래프트는 개인시합임에도 불구하고 프로게이머는 구단에 소속되지 않으면 리그 예선에 참가하는 것조차 금지된다 .
구단이 선수에 대해서 절대적 우위를 가질 수밖에 없는 체제를 만들어 놓은 것이다 .
만일 민사계약을 근로계약으로 대체하는 것이 힘든 일이라 한다면 프로게이머와 그 지망생들의 최소한의 생활과 미래를 대비할 권리를 보장하는 방법이 따로 고민되어야 할 것이다 .
' 창작자 ' 대우도 못 받고 ' 노동자 ' 대우도 못 받는 청소년·청년들을 이렇게 광범위한 규모로 굴릴 수는 없다 .
" 향후 진로가 뭐냐고 ? 나도 가장 고민 되는 문 제 "
프로게이머에게 가장 민감한 것은 군대 문제다 .
군대 문제를 고민하다 떨어져나가는 2 군 게이머들이 많다.
유명 프로게이머들은 특별전형으로 대학에 입학하기도 한다.
임요환은 대학원까지 입학하며 게이머 생활을 지속하다 일종의 '상무 게임단 '에 해당하는 공군 에이스 창단 후 공군 입대했다 .
특별전형에 합격할 만큼 유명하지 않은 대부분의 선수는 한국 사이버대학에 입학하여 입대를 연기한다 .
" 사실 ( 인터넷강의 ) 틀어놓고 연습을 하거든요 .
시험 칠 때 잠시 찾아보고 시험치고 , 인터넷으로 시험 치죠. 강의 자체를 열심히 듣는다거나 이러진 않아요 . " 팀에서는 공부할 시간을 보장해 주지 않는다 .
" 하루에 몇 시간이라도 시간을 주면 자기계발하면서 미래를 대비할 수 있을 텐데…… . "
A는 이 문제에 대해 이미 많은 생각을 한 것으로 보였다 .
향후 진로를 어떻게 예상하느냐고 물으니 자신도 그 부분이 가장 고민된다고 한다 .
은퇴한 동료 선수들은 어떻게 되었을까 ?
" ( 프로게이머 생활이 ) 경력이 쌓인다거나 그런 것도 아니기 때문에 어렵죠 .
대부분이 코치로 가거나 방송 쪽으로 가요 .
유학 간 사람도 있고 학교에 가서 공부하는 사람도 있고요 .
나머지는 안 좋아요 . " 안 좋다는 게 무슨 말이냐고 물어보았다 .
" 일을 못하고 있다는 거죠 . 할 일이 없어요 . "
현행 스타리그 프로게이머들에게 남겨진 또 하나의 가능성은 올해 블리자드에서 출시하는 스타크래프 트2 게이머에 도전해 보는 것이다 .
하지만 블리자드는 스 타1 때와는 달리 애초부터 e스포츠를 염두에 두고 스 타2 를 만들었다 .
블리자드가 주관하는 베틀넷에 접속하지 않고서는 유저끼리 대전할 수조차 없다 . ( 스 타 1 의 경우 베틀넷 서버를 통하지 않고 컴퓨터끼리 네트워크망을 연결해 대전하는 일이 가능했다 )
블리자드와 협회( KeSPA ) 는 스타2 를 e스포츠화 하는 문제를 두고 저작권 협상을 벌였으나 결렬되었다 .
현재 구단에서는 선수들에게 스 타2 를 하지 못하게 한다 .
" 상식적으 로 그걸 못하게 한다는 게 말이 되요 ? 그냥 게임인데 . " 눈이 동그라져서 홍원표 위원이 묻자 A는 " 전 모르겠어 요 " 라고 대답했다 .
스 타 2 는 지금 베타테스트 서비스 중이다 .
" 그런데 스타2 정식 출시되고 나서도 금지하면 좀 그럴 것 같아요 .
예전에 스 타1 이 처음 나왔을 때처럼 상금 거는 대회가 생기면 그쪽으로 넘어갈 게이머가 있겠죠 . 스 타 2 는 스타1 의 연장선에 있어요. 스 타1 잘하던 이들이 스 타2 도 잘해요 . 스 타2 는 베타 테스트지만 벌써 세계적으로 리그가 만들어지고 있거든요 .
이미 ( 과거 스 타1 게이머였다가 ) 은퇴한 선수들이 스 타2리그에 참여 중인데 상위권이에요 .
정식 출시되면 연봉 많이 받던 애들은 스 타1 에 남아 있겠지만 , 안 그런 경우는 도전하고 싶을 거예요 . "
협회와 블리자드의 협상이 끝내 결렬되고 협회가 계속 구단 선수들을 통제한다면 , 현행 e스포츠 체제를 떠나 새로운 도전을 하게 될 선수들이 나오게 될 지도 모른다 .
승부조작 사태와 스 타2 출시 이후의 e스포츠는 ?
승부조작 사건 같은 것이 터지면 주로 언론은 개개인의 도덕성을 질타한다 .
물론 어린 나이부터 숙소에 틀어박혀 하루 10시간 넘게 게임에만 몰두한 청년들은 건강이나 가치관 형성의 면에서 문제가 생길 소지가 많다 .
프로게이머 소양교육에 관해 물어보았다 .
" 1년 에 상반기 , 하반기 두 번의 소양교육이 있어요 .
교육받아야 프로게이머의 자격이 유지가 되죠 .
주로 프로게이머의 인성강화 , 스포츠 교수를 초빙해서 얘기를 해요.
기본적으로 가져야 할 스포츠 정신에 대해 강의를 하죠 . " 호응이 있는지 물어보았다 .
" 호응은 별로 ……게임과 스포츠가 다르기도 하고…… . "
군대에서 장병들이 정신교육을 받는 장면이 연상되었다 .
협소한 환경에서 생활하고 , 미래가 불확실하고 , 노력에 걸맞은 대가를 받지 못하고 소모품 취급을 받기 일쑤인 이 청년들에 게 1년에 두 번의 소양교육이 무슨 의미를 지니리라 생각하기 어렵다 .
연봉이 높았든 낮았든 그들에게 ' 검 은돈'의 유혹은 매력적이었는지도 모른다 .
무엇보다 게임을 사랑하고 승부를 중요시했을 그들이 승부조작에 참여하게 되었다는 것은 너무나도 슬픈 일이었다 .
그들에게 필요한 건 소양교육이 아니라 최소한의 권리였다 .
홍원표 연구위원이 물었다 .
홍원표 : ' 88 만 원 세대'라는 말 알아요 ?
2 군 프로게이머 최저 월급이 88 만 원 정도라면 어떨까요 ?
프로게이머A : 88만원 받으면 다행이죠 .
그 정도면 좋은 직업이지 않을까요 ?
같이 생활하는데 2억에서 0원까지 있는 거예요 .
팀에 왔다 나갔다 하는 동생들 보면 용돈도 못 받으며 하는 애들도 많았고 ……' 빡세고'……. 기업들이 돈을 그렇게 쓰려 하지 않아요 .
창단 하고 몇 년 지나면 지원이 줄죠 .
돈이 없으니 숙소에서 생활할 수밖에 없죠.
저희는 3명~8명이 한 방에서 자요. 독방은 없고 .
홍원표 : 여럿이서 한 방 쓰면 갑갑하지 않아요 ?
프로게이머A : 괜찮아요 .
방에서 뭘 하는 게 아니라 잠만 자고 나오는 거니까요 .
간담회가 정리되어 가고 있었다 .
다들 한마디씩 소회를 나누었다 .
노회찬 : 가끔 케이블방송 채널에서 e스포츠 보면 화려하잖아요 .
그리고 게이머가 많은 청소년들의 ' 로 망 '이죠 .
그만큼 관심을 많이 가지고 있고 .
그럼에도 불구하고 사각지대라는 거잖아요 .
많은 사람의 관심이 집중된 화려한 조명의 무대 뒤에 숨겨진 비정상적인 환경이 있는 건데 , 성공에 대한 욕망 때문에 그 과정에서 일어나는 일들이 묻히죠 .
이렇게 뒷면이 허술하다니 , 능력 있는 대기업들이 관여하면서도 말이에요 .
프로야구 2 군 선수 생각이 많이 났습니다 .
자라나는 청소년들과 관련된 문제라면 그보다도 훨씬 심각한 건데…… .
프로게이머A : 하고 싶은 사람이 너무 많아서 …….
노회찬 : 그러다 보니까 어차피 뭘 보장 안 해줘도 알아서 하고 대우가 나빠도 감수하니까 그런 거겠죠 .
결과적으로는 많은 사람들이 부러워하고 하고 싶어 하는 것을 역이용하고 있다는 그런 느낌이 듭니다 .
김정근 : 팀 입장에선 연습생이 많아지면 통제하기가 쉬워요 .
서로 경쟁하게 되니까 편하죠 .
연습생에게 돈을 주는 것도 아니니까 많이 굴리면 굴릴수록 좋은 거죠 .
협회에선 스스로 프로게이머 증가율이 문제라 하면서도 커리지 매치에서 뽑는 준프로 자격 ( 드래프트를 통해 프로가 되기 위한 예비 자격. 준프로의 70 % 가 프로가 됨 ) 의 숫자를 줄이지 않고 되레 늘리고 있습니다 .
결국 수많은 아이들이 ( 스타리그의 스타를 꿈꾸지만 스타와는 상관없는 팀 프로리그 홍보를 위한 ) 대책 없는 경쟁의 현장에 뛰어들지요 .
안타깝습니다 .
프로게이머A : 사실 오랫동안 이런 문제가 알려져 있었지만 묵인되어 왔죠 .
홍원표 : 임요환 선수가 선수협 만들자는 얘기도 했잖아요 ?
프로게이머A : 그 얘기도 오래 전부터 나왔는데 선수가 힘이 너무 없어요 .
리그가 앞으로 어떻게 될지도 전혀 모르겠어요 .
선수가 자신을 위해 뭘 할 수 있을까 ?
그것도 잘 모르겠어요 .
노회찬 : 새로운 세계를 알게 되었어요 .
이제 무대 뒤 풍경이 그려집니다 .
세계적으로도 e스포츠가 가장 앞선 나라인데 현실이 이렇다는 건 부끄럽습니다 .
앞으로 선수들을 위한 권고안이나 정책대안 등을 더욱 고민해 보도록 하겠습니다 .
그들에게 정치란 무엇일까 ?
많은 사람들은 이렇게 말할 것이다 .
" 게임하면서 돈 번다니 감지덕지지 .
그게 무슨 노동이야 ?
그게 부조리하다 생각하면 그딴 거 하지마 ! " 사회와 '어 른 '들은 " 네가 원해서 시작한 일이니 이런 정도는 감내하라 " 는 말을 자연스럽게 한다 .
그렇게 따지면 모든 스포츠나 문화예술 종사자들은 노력의 대가를 받을 수가 없게 된다 .( 사실 그것이 대한민국의 현실이다 )
문제는 문화영역에서의 취미가 산업화가 되었을 때 그 콘텐츠의 생산자를 인간적으로 배려하는 방식이라는 점을 아무도 말하지 않는다 .
그 문제를 해결하기 위해 " 그래서 더더욱 파이를 키워야 한다 " 고 말하기도 한다 .
하지만 e스포츠계의 파이가 커질 동안 피라미드 아래쪽에서 고생하는 이들의 처우는 나아지지 않았고 '스타 프로게이 머 '들의 연봉만 높아졌다 .
오히려 그들을 보고 이 판에 들어온 수많은 청소년들 때문에 황당한 환경에서 고생하는 이들의 숫자는 더욱 늘어났다 .
이렇게 '어른 '들은 청년들의 열정을 착취하는 중이다 .
길지는 않았던 간담회가 끝난 후 우리는 함께 저녁식사를 하며 막걸리를 한잔씩 마셨다 .
뒤풀이 자리에서 나와 김정근 씨는 '스덕 본능'을 발휘하 여
A가 가장 빛났던 순간들과 현재의 e스포츠 , 그리고 승부조작에 참여한 게이머들에 대한 인간적인 분노를 토로했다 .
A는 정치에 대해 전혀 모르지만 노무현에 대해서는 좋은 감정을 가지고 있다고 했다 .
한명숙에 대해서는 최근의 검찰수사에 대해서만 알고 있고 유시민도 좋아한다고 했다 .
노회찬에 대해 물어봤더니 누군지 알고는 있었고 나쁜 이미지는 아니었단다 .
헤어질 때
A는 내가 아무 말도 하지 않았는데 ' 그래도 얼굴을 본 사람이니 만약 투표하러 갈 시간이 있으면 서울시장 후보 노회찬을 찍겠다 '고 약속했다 .
내색은 안 했지만 마음이 울컥했다 .
문득 그들에게 정치가 무엇인지 , 내가 정치에 관심을 가진다는 건 무슨 의미인지가 궁금해졌다 .
집으로 돌아오며 , 누구에게 투표를 하든 그도 6 월 2일 에 투표를 할 시간이 있었으면 좋겠다고 생각했다 .

The world of e-sports was engulfed in a state of shock on the 16th .
It was found that current progamers were involved in match fixing .
A lot of the fans were dismayed to learn that even a starleague champion made profit from using illegal betting sites and fixing matches .
People are criticizing the progamers involved for perverting the spirit of sports , but not that many people are pointing out why they made such decisions .
Progamers are hailed by many fans , but behind the screen , there is a very competitive system .
The problem only worsens by the fact that most people believe that " earning money through gaming is n't labor .
"
We should not stop at criticizing the progamers that were involved , but also look into the " reality " behind their motives .
This article is to show the lives and the labor conditions of progamers .
Editor .
I did n't know where to start .
I was a veteran starleague fan , and a member of the progressive political party , but I did n't know how this would be taken by the progamers .
The lives of progamers were a sensitive subject .
The progamers and even fans might say " they 're talking about something they do n't even know about " if the progressive party raised the issue of rights of progamers .
2010 - 5- 15 Saturday night .
It was the day before the official statement on match fixing .
Would the interview have been harder if I tried after the statement ?
I was careful to tell them that their identity would be confidential .
The Progressive Party Representative Noh ( from here on : Noh ) , Political Researcher Hong ( from here on : Hong ) , and E - Sports Columnist Kim ( aka pain , from here on : Kim ) attended the meeting .
Mr. Han ( the author , from here on : Han ) :
Have you read " Mookhyang " ( a martial art novel ) ?
Progamer " A " : Yes .
" A " answered more willingly than I thought .
Although we lived in completely different worlds , we were both young men from the same time period .
Han :
In the novel , the main character learns martial arts and develops along with other children even without a name .
One by one , his peers start to disappear , and he develops further and rises to a higer place .
I thought starleagues were kind of like that .
Since you debuted , to today , what are your views on the lives of progamers , both your life and the lives of your peers that disappeared with your success ?
The first thing that comes up when talking about the life of a progamer is the conflict with parents .
The most famous progamer , BoxeR , said that his parents did not know he played StarCraft .
Back then " progamer " meant just a person looking to earn money from gaming , before games were broadcasted .
On the other hand , the top player right now , Flash , persuaded his parents and became a progamer with parental support .
However , this is a story of a progamer who rose in the era where earning over a hundred thousand dollars a year playing games were " role models " .
" A " also could n't avoid the conflict .
His parents did not allow him to become a progamer because the future is too uncertain , and " A " also understood his parents .
" What kind of a parent would want their kid to lead a difficult life ?
The future is very dim when you become a progamer ..... "
After a few months , his parents allowed him to pursue his dreams , and after passing the test , he joined a team .
Nowadays , in order to get connections to be able to take tests for progaming teams , people spend a lot of time in clans .
Once you hit 20 , it becomes almost impossible to be tested to join a team .
When asked about this , " A " answered " You have to be at least in your 10's.
20 is the oldest you can be .
" After he joined the team , the life with the team started .
It was before when large sponsors funded each team .
" Over ten people lived in one apartment .
There was no room to eat together .
There were about 10 computers in the living room , and there were a few bunk beds in the bedroom .
If there were not enough beds , we slept on the floor .... "
It did n't happen often , but the teammates kept changing .
Few left , and few joined .
Some went to military service , gave up , or left for education .
Of course there were a few that were kicked out for not being good enough .
Still now , B team players come and go without ever being well known .
The dorm became better and better .
The sponsors began to look at e-sports .
The large corporations took players from other teams , and others accepted a lot of practice partners to pick out new talents .
I started to wonder how it was like living with a team .
Han :
Is the hierarchy strict ?
I think it must be since only men are living together . " A " : Nope .
There are older and younger players , but it 's not a strict hierarchy .
Hong asked about the practice time .
A daily cycle of a progamer is different from that of a normal person .
They wake up around 10 and their day starts after eating breakfast , and it continues until late night .
If you look at " Nal_rA's Oldboy " from OGN , the SPARKYZ team ate lunch at 4 PM .
I think it was to achieve the optimal condition when the leagues take place in the evening .
The practice time , not counting time for food , was 11 hours and 30 minutes for A team members , and 13 hours and 30 mnutes for B team members .
This was mandatory .
Can you skip it ?
If you want to , you must have a reason .
A progamer from some team wanted to watch a Beyonce concert and did not attend practice .
That day happened to be a bad day for the team .
He was punished and pushed down to B team , and ended up retiring trying to rise back up .
" I think there were other reasons , but he said that was the biggest reason .
" There are barely any days off .
There are matches in the weekends , so you have to practice even in the weekends .
" A " 's team gets a day and a half off starting right when the last match of the week ends .
MBCGame and OGN have very busy schedules .
In a year , there is only one month period where no leagues go on .
This became worse as time went on .
The players are dissatisfied , but have no way of speaking out .
Kim put it this way .
" KeSPA was formed by the corporations that sponsor the teams .
Because it helps them advertise , they try to increase the number of matches .
They fill up the whole year with matches .
It 's not like they have to pay more to have more matches .
" Hong pointed out the copyright issues of replays .
If there was such a thing , KeSPA would not simply try to increase the number of matches .
If a drama is shown again on a different channel , that channel must pay the original company a fee .
If a musician plays a piece , that music becomes the musician's .
The same should be applied to progamers and replays .
This problem is very complicated .
The VOD shown on TV is not simply the replay of a progamer , but it contains the explanation of the commentators and the views of the observer .
When we watch these games , there are many parties involved .
There are Blizzard , the gamers , and the broadcasting companies .
Right now , the games are the properties of the broadcasting companies , and the rights of the players are handled by the sponsors that pay those gamers , through KeSPA .
Blizzard is trying to claim their rights in the e-sports market with the release of StarCraft II .
These powerful organizations silence the rights of the average progamer .
If the sponsors paid the progamers as much as they took the rights away , it would be okay , but the progamers are n't even considered laborers .
Noh concentrated on the labor - like state of progaming .
He thinks that progamers should have a labor contract with their sponsors .
Think about it for a moment .
That would cause the problem with child labor .
The law prevents children under 15 from being in labor .
The famous progamers debuted when they were 15 or 16 .
Players like BaBy debuted at the age of 13 .
If we see them as laborers , it is illegal .
The gamers between 15 and 17 years of age can be in labor , but the problem is time .
The law prevents adolescents from being in labor at night .
Noh said , " There was once this situation in Europe .
There was a musical , and a child actor was needed .
However , the girl from that country was too young to be put into labor at the time of the showing .
The whole country went into debate .
It 's not a single person 's problem , but a problem for the whole society .
That 's why there was so much debate .
" Also , the minimum wage must be met with a labor contract .
The minimum wage for 2010 was 4110 wons per hour ( app. $ 3.60 ) .
For 44 hours a week , the minimum wage is 928,860 won per month ( app. $ 820 ) .
The progamers are required to practice around 60 ~ 75 hours a week , and over half of these hours are during weekends and late nights .
The weekend and late night minimum wage is 1.5 times larger , so it would be 6165 ( app. $ 5.40 ) won / hour .
If we say the progamers practice at least 60 hours a week , and if only half of them are part of the 1.5 x rate , the minimum amount they need to be paid for a week is 308,250 won ( app. $ 270 ) , for a month , 1,339,345 won ( app. $ 1,180 ) , and for a year , 16,072,155 won ( app. $ 14,000 ) .
The minimum wage for a A - team player would be 16 million won , and for B - team player , it would be 20 million ( app. $ 17,600 ) .
This shows how much these progamers are working .
If we put these regulations on progaming , the number of progamers would decrease significantly , and some corporations will give up .
The increase in pay of a progamer over time will also decrease .
However , this will greatly increase the conditions of life of progamers .
This is the reality .
B - team players are given a dorm , but they do n't get paid .
They do n't even sign a single thing , let alone a contract .
Even if they leave , there are plenty to choose from .
The bigger teams pay them 500 thousand wons a month .
What if you 're one of the players that play in proleague ?
They sign a contract .
It 's not a labor contract , but a civil contract .
Even then they get paid 10 million won a year on average and usually does n't pass 20 million .
A few " star " gamers earn over 200 million a year .
I 'm sure there are a few progamers who get paid between those two numbers , but we wo n't know exactly how much that is .
The pay is not released to the public .
Even " A " does n't know how much his teammates get paid .
Hong asked if the practice hours are mentioned in the civil contract .
" A " said no .
Hong said if they 're going to make certain hours of practice mandatory , it should be a labor contract .
Although the hours are not listed in the contract , a civil contract can be nullified by the sponsors at any time , so the players must obey the hours .
Even though StarCraft is an individual sport , a progamer can't participate in even the preliminaries without being in a progaming team .
The system is set up so that the sponsors have ultimate control over the progamers .
If it 's too much to change the contracts to labor contracts , there should be at least a guarantee of the players ' rights and futures .
The gamers get treated neither as the " creator " of game content nor the " laborers " for the gaming teams .
The most sensitive problem for progamers is the mandatory military service .
There are a lot of B - team gamers that worry about military service and quit .
The famous progamers attend universities to delay the time .
Boxer even went to a graduate school before joining the Air Force , forming the Air Force ACE team .
The gamers that are less famous apply for the Korean Cyber University to delay going into military service .
" We really just leave the lesson on and practice .
We only pay attention shortly before exams , and we take the test online .
We do n't listen carefully to the lecture . "
They do n't have the time to learn .
" If they gave us a few hours a day , I think I can prepare for my future ... " " A " seemed to have thought about this problem long enough already .
He said he was worried about his own future when asked .
What happened to his retired peers ?
" It 's not like your experience as a progamer help .
Most go into coaching or show programs .
Some go abroad to study , and others attend classes at a school .
The rest do n't do well . "
I asked what " not doing well " meant .
" They do n't have a job .
There 's nothing they can do .
" Another opportunity for the progamers is to try to be a progamer for StarCraft II .
However , Blizzard made StarCraft II with e-sports in mind , unlike StarCraft .
You can't even play against each other without connecting to Battle .
net .
( In StarCraft it was possible through LAN ) .
KeSPA negotiated with Blizzard on the topic of StarCraft II as an e-sport , but it did n't go well .
They do n't allow the progamers to play StarCraft II .
Hong asked , " Does it make sense for them to be able to stop us from playing ?
It 's just a game . "
" A " answered , " I do n't know . "
StarCraft II is currently in beta testing phase .
" I think I 'll have a problem with it if they do n't let us play after the official release .
Like when StarCraft was first released , there will be few of us who change to that game if there are prize tournaments .
StarCraft II is on the same line as StarCraft .
Those who are good in StarCraft also do well in StarCraft II .
It 's only the beta but there are worldwide tournaments .
The retired progamers already participate in StarCraft II tournaments , and are doing well .
When it is officially released , those who are not getting paid will be tempted to try StarCraft II competitively .
There may be players that leave the current system of e-sports to try something new if KeSPA fails to negotiate with Blizzard .
When something like match fixing happens , the media criticizes individual integrity .
Of course being forced to practice over 10 hours a day at a young age can cause problems .
I asked about the progamer knowledge training .
" There are two in one year .
You need to attend to keep your license .
They talk about improving the tenacity of being a progamer , about the spirit of sports that we should have . "
I asked if players enjoy these lectures .
" Not really ...
Games and sports are different ...
" I thought of the soldiers being mentally trained in the military .
The poor environment , the unclear future , the bad pay , and being treated like property has a far greater detrimental effect than two days of lecture can fix .
The lure of " black money " must have been tempting no matter how much they were getting paid .
It was even more heartbreaking that these players , who always put the game and the competition at the center , would get involved in match fixing .
What they needed was not a lecture , but the basic human rights .
Hong asked this .
Hong :
Do you know the term " 880 thousand won era " ?
What do you think it would be like if the minimum wage for the B - team players was 880 thousand wons ( app $ 770 ) per month ? " A " : That would be good .
If you earn that much , would n't it be a decent job ?
We live together yet some of us get paid no money while other get paid 200 million wons .
There were a lot of players that did n't even receive spending money ....
The sponsors try to spend as least money as possible .
After a few years , the money given by the sponsors decrease .
Since we do n't have the money , we 're forced to live together .
Between 3~8 people use each room .
Hong :
Is n't it bothersome to share a room with so many people ? " A " :
It 's fine , since we do n't do anything but sleep in those rooms .
Our discussion was nearing its end .
Everyone each made a comment .
Noh : E - sports through the TV is extravagant .
A lot of teenagers dream of becoming progamers .
Although e-sports has the nation 's attention , the living conditions of a progamer is bad .
There is a " dark side " of progaming that people do n't see even though so many large corporations are involved .
It reminded me of the B - team pro baseball players .
This is a big problem since young men are involved ... " A " : There are too many people wanted to be progamers .... Noh :
That 's why it 's like this .
They 're using the fact that people all want to become progamers against the progamers themselves .
Kim :
For the teams , it becomes easier to restrain the players if there are more practice partners .
It 's easy because they all compete with each other .
Since they do n't even pay the practice partners , the more the better .
KeSPA themselves say that the rise of the number of progamers is the problem , but they 're not decreasing the number of semi pro licenses given through Courage .
In the end , the kids jump into a hopeless field of competition .
This is shameful . " A " :
This problem was known for a long time , but was ignored .
Hong : Did n't Boxer say something about a progamers ' union ? " A " :
That talk has been going on for a long time too but the players have too little strength .
I do n't even know how the leagues will turn out in the future .
What can a player do for himself ?
I do n't even know .
Noh : I learned about a new world today .
I can now see it from behind the scenes .
Our nation at the front of the world of e-sports and I 'm embarrassed about the truth .
In the future , I 'll be sure to think about the rights of progamers .
Many people would say this .
" It 's so awesome to earn money playing games .
What about that is labor ?
If you think it 's that bad , just do n't do it ! "
The society and the " adults " say " You started it because you wanted to do it .
You should be able to endure it " naturally .
If you think about it that way , no person in the field of sports or arts would be able to earn as much as they work .
( Sadly , this is the truth in Korea ) The problem is that when a hobby becomes a market , nobody talks about the rights of the people that produce the content .
Some say , to solve this problem , they need to " make it bigger . "
However , as e-sports grew , the ones suffering at the bottom of the pyramid continued to suffer , and only the " star " progamers ' pays increased .
It actually had the opposite effect as kids drawn to the scene by these stars found themselves at the bottom of the pyramid , unable to climb .
The " adults " are making profits out of the children 's passion .
After the long discussion ended , we had dinner together and had a drink .
Kim and I talked about " A " 's bright moments and expressed our personal thoughts on the progamers involved in the match fixing incident .
" A " does n't know politics , but he said he has positive feeling towards former president Roh .
When asked about Noh , he responded that he knew who he was and did n't have a negative image of him .
I did n't say anything about it to " A " , but as he was leaving he told me that he would vote for Noh since he at least knows his face .
I did n't show it but my heart sank .
I wondered what politics , that I 'm interested in politics , means to them .
As I returned home , I thought to myself that no matter who he votes for , I hope " A " has time to come out and vote on June 2nd .

Hi everyone !
I 've got some messages fron Yoon - hyung Han , who 's the author of the article .
He asked me to translate his words since he can't really speak English .
LOL .
He wanted me to let you guys know some basic stuff about South - Korean media , E - sports scene , and ultimately himself .
First of all , Pressian is a web - based daily newspaper which is pretty big compared to other leftist internet journals in South Korea .
( probably the biggest among them i reckon ? ) .
Fomos is much credited in the Starcraft fandom , but in fact Pressian is a much bigger journal in the web as a general media source .
BUT , because these so - called ' progressive ' or ' leftist ' journals in South Korea were n't really dealing with / aware of the problems in E - sports scene , Han , who is a member of the New Progressive Party ( I know it 's a ridiculous name but such party does actually exist ) , decided to write an article about it and published it on Pressian .
After the release of the article , Pressian receievd a number of phone calls from unanimous readers and they protested saying that the E - sports scene does n't work like that anymore , but we are assuming that these people are actually those who work in the field .
( And of course , they are afraid that controversies regarding players ' working environment become publicised )
Becuase most South Koreans are business - inclined , their reaction to this kind of problems is usually this : " But if corporations withdraw , is n't that a greater difficulty ? " .
So corporations do not really have any reluctance in exploiting workers , and they treat the players in pretty much the same manner .
Han and his friends see that the fandom as a whole should take some sort of actions after the release of SCII .
( read the article thoroughly again please if u r puzzled why choose not to take actions immediately )
And if such action does really take place , Han says that he would really appreciate it if Team Liquid guyz can do something like a petition then ( regardless of the form ) , coz many Koreans do really care about what foreigners say .

Bishop Richard Williamson stayed away from his German trial A renegade British bishop was fined 10,000 euros ( £ 8,750 ) on Friday for denying the Holocaust in a case that has acutely embarrassed the Vatican .
The case went ahead in a German court without Richard Williamson , whose breakaway Catholic fraternity told him not to testify , his lawyer said .
Denying that the Holocaust took place , or questioning key elements , is illegal in Germany .
The bishop acknowledged the offending comments in a statement read in court .
Williamson , 70 , was convicted by the court in the southern German city of Regensburg of inciting racial hatred for stating in a TV interview aired in January 2009 that only " 200,000 to 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps " .
Bishop Williamson would gladly have come , but the Saint Pius X Society suggested he did not
Matthias Lossmann Bishop Williamson 's lawyer
He also denied the Nazis had used gas chambers .
Imposing the fine in the high - profile proceedings on Friday , presiding judge Karin Frahm said : " The statements by the accused represent a denial of the actions taken under the National Socialist regime .
" Bishop Williamson must have assumed that his remarks would draw attention .
Williamson knowingly accepted that attention . "
Williamson was fined 12,000 euros ( £ 12,500 ) earlier this year for giving the interview in Germany to a Swedish broadcaster .
The latest trial was ordered after Mr Williamson , who lives in London , refused to pay .
He faced a sentence ranging from a fine to up to five years in prison .
Williamson 's lawyer , Matthias Lossmann told the court : " Bishop Williamson would gladly have come , but the Saint Pius X Society suggested he did not - to be precise , they forbade him from coming . "
' Remarks are unacceptable '
The court on Friday heard an excerpt of the interview , in which Williamson is heard telling the interviewer : " Be careful , this is against the law in Germany . "
The bishop was told the interview would be aired only in Sweden , Mr Lossmann told the court .
He said Williamson could not be held criminally responsible for its release in Germany .
" That will be the crux of the case here , " he said .
" We do not even need to discuss the fact that these remarks are unacceptable , that is completely beside the point . "
Mr Lossmann read a statement by Williamson in which the cleric acknowledged casting doubt on the Holocaust .
" I was aware that it is against German law to express such doubts , so I expressed these doubts for exclusive broadcast on Swedish television " where such remarks are legal , he said .
The Saint Pius X Society , an ultra-conservative , Swiss - based Catholic fraternity , appointed Williamson a bishop without the pope 's blessing after it broke away from Rome over the Vatican II reforms of 1965 .
Among the reforms rejected by the organisation was a declaration , Nostra Aetate , which states that " God holds the Jews most dear " ; condemns any form of anti-Semitism ; and specifically repudiates the idea that the Jews as a whole should be held responsible for killing Jesus Christ .
The trial comes at a difficult time for Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican as a sexual abuse scandal rocks the Catholic church .
Hundreds of people have come forward in Germany and other countries around the world , saying they were molested by predatory priests .
Bishop Williamson 's case prompted a rare comment on religious matters by the German chancellor .
Angela Merkel called on Pope Benedict to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " that the Nazis killed six million Jews .
Williamson has said he wished to apologise to anyone offended by his comments but has refused to retract his assertions , saying only that he would re-examine the historical evidence .
But the Vatican immediately rejected the apology and told him to " unequivocally and publicly " withdraw his remarks .
Although this story took place on Friday , 16 April 2010 , it was updated on Wednesday , 21 April to clarify the changes made by the Vatican 's Nostra Aetate declaration .

Fire crews worked to clear debris from the explosion
Suspected robbers in Germany appear to have miscalculated the quantity of explosives needed to blow their way into a rural bank .
The building housing the bank in the northern village of Malliss was largely destroyed by an overnight explosion .
The bank 's cash machine survived intact and the suspected thieves are not thought to have made away with any money , Germany 's Welt Online reported .
No -one was injured , though the blast damaged nearby cars and buildings .
Investigators were working on the assumption that robbers had placed their explosives , possibly made from petrol or acetylene , at the entrance to the bank , German broadcaster NDR said .
The presence of a delivery van near the site of the explosion indicated that the suspected thieves may have intended to drive off with the cash dispenser , local media reported .

Sparkly ! [ AP , Awl ]
The number of drivers slapped with speeding fines in Scotland fell more than 60 per cent , official figures showed .
The number of speeding fines issued to drivers caught by cameras dropped from more than 114,000 in 2006 to below 50,000 in 2009 .
But according to some experts , the fall in the number of speeding fines was not just due to safety messages and tougher penalties .
They claim the fall is the result of camera - detecting satnav systems , which tells drivers where cameras are placed and provide audible warning on approach .
Currently , almost half of the British drivers own camera - detecting satnav systems .
Moreover , regular drivers become aware of camera locations .
Commenting on the topic , the RAC road safety chief Andrew Howard said , " As a speed camera spends longer at one spot on the road , regular users have to be quite daft to be caught . ”
Meanwhile , a speeding charge against a 37 - year - old driver , Graham Lee , dropped due to flawed camera .
Mr. Lee was caught driving at a speed of 40 mph on the North Orbital Road at Denham , where the speed limit is 30 mph , but later it was found that he was caught despite not breaking the speed limit because of a fault in the camera .
Offensive Cartoons of the 1940's : Racist & Patriotic Fun !
Featuring Popeye the Sailor , Bugs Bunny , Superman , Daffy & Donald Duck , and the most screwed up thing Dr. Seuss ever made .
Disclaimer :
The subject of the following review is a bunch of offensive stuff ... some of it 's racist , some of it 's just terrible .
All of it 's freaking hilarious and bizarre .
Just so we 're clear , I am not a racist , it 's just hard to talk about something " serious " in the context of children 's characters .
What the hell am I talking about ?
Let 's have a look :
You are not prepared for what you 're about to see .
My faith in all things holy ( and Bugs Bunny ) has been forever shattered and may never return .
You have been warned .
Cartoons and politics have always been a weird mix with me .
Then again , depending on what culture you 're looking at , cartoons are always handled a little differently .
Japan takes the animated medium a bit more seriously ... they 've been making adult animation for decades now .... and I 'm not just talking about little Japanese gir ls being violated by demon squid or ninjas flipping out and stabbing other ninjas in the face ( who are flipping out ) .
America , excluding this weird movement in the 1970's ( think Fritz the Cat ) , has almost always looked at cartoons as something for children .
America 's been fluctuating lately on how it looks at animation , but for the most part , it 's for making products for children / teens that some adults might enjoy .
There 's nothing wrong with that ... it's just the way it usually is .
However , it 's hella fun to take a look back and see what animation USED to be .
Film 's just a little over a hundred years old , and today it 's pretty easy to look back and see what was going on culturally speaking by just sitting back and watching a few cartoons .
What kind of cartoons ?
Horrible , frighteningly politically incorrect cartoons .
Watching some of the crap that Warner Brothers , Disney , and Fox put out during World War II , you can see why it 's never a good idea to go digging into the past .
No one of my generation was ever meant to see any of this .
In the 1940s , America 's population was about 120 million .
90 million of those people went to the movies every week .
Hollywood WISHES so many people still went to the movies .
So , of course the government and the patriots of America wanted to get their message out ( Many of the people who ran the film studios were at least Colonels in the U.S. Army , so this is n't that big a surprise ) .
What was their message ?
I 'm not completely sure beyond the whole " America is the best country ever , and Hitler is bad , and the Japanese are nothing but buck - toothed morons " thing , but what it ended up being was pure propaganda in cartoon form .
Which is horribly awesome .
You have n't lived until you 've seen Donald Duck saluting Hitler or Bugs Bunny dropping bombs on the Japanese .
It 's so very messed up and WRONG , you can't help but laugh .
What the hell were they thinking ?
This article has a handful of examples as well as a bit more information than usual , because this article was actually researched , at least a little bit .
The weird thing about researching crap like this is it takes all the fun out of it .
It 's hard to be a completely irreverent bastard while at the same time spewing out random tidbits of information .
It 's kind of like why all educational video games suck absolute sack .
It 's hard to entertain AND inform .
: shrug : Chuck Jones calls World War 2 the " last great drama , " because there was a good side and a side that was unquestionably evil ( unlike , as Chuck puts it , the Korean & Vietnam wars ) .
Now , I 'm not going to go into explaining why Germany and Japan were NOT completely unholy countries led by demons ... because that 's all been established in any college - level history book .
( Far too short version : Germany was so crippled by World War 1 reparations that it was in a bad place and Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor w as only retaliation to the forced occupation of Japan by the Americans forty or so years earlier .
That 's not completely correct or correctly complete but that 'll have to do for the sake of this article . )
With so many people going to the movies , the United States Army started pouring lots of money into animation studios to get their message across .
The point of these cartoons were to show people how bad the Nazis or the Japanese were and to get folks to give money / join the Army .
It 's a fact .
It 's just really creepy watching Donald Duck wander through a jungle with knife waiting to stab the first Japanese person he sees .
I guess in context that 's not so bad ... but if I was Japanese I might have nightmares about Donald Duckaru hunting me down .
Trivia Time : Walt Disney and his company were actually hired to p aint the designs on the sides of American bombers during the war .
I guess any product placement is good , but I really wonder if putting it on the sides of machines built to kill lots of people was really a good idea .
Hell , I can just imagine survivors of the American bombings being forever terrified of the face of Mickey Mouse , since that 's what appeared in the sky when the death came .
Gah .
Let 's walk through some cartoons and issues .
We 'll start with the least fouled up and work our way onward .
Super man :
Sweet mother of Christ .
I know it 's no surprise that they made Superman cartoons filled with propaganda ... since the character was designed pretty much with " the Mightiest American " in mind , but I was NOT expecting to see the Nazis dressing as members of the KKK to lead a tribe of African people with huge lips , bones through their noses , and spears against the Allied forces .
In " Jungle Drums " we have Superman rescuing Lois Lane from being burned at the stake by Nazi dressing as ANOTHER hate group leading a racist stereotype .
Wow .
The only thing they 're not doing is eating watermelon .
So check out this cartoon if you want to see Superman beating up Nazis while black monkeys dance around with spears .
God damn , is that messed up .
Luckily , Superman does n't say anything , since anything he COULD say would end up being freaking horrible by today 's standards : Lois Lane : " Thank you for saving me , Superman .
I do n't know what I would have done without you . "
Superman : " Never fear Lois , I 'll never let spear - chucking Negroes get you . "
What 's interesting about the " Cartoons go to War " documentary ( where I got a lot of this info ) is the fact that everyone they interview does n't even address how screwed up these things are by today 's standards .
The closest they get to covering their own asses is stating that the cartoons were n't for kids ... they were meant for adults ... as such , they could get away with being " bold , " as one animator put it .
So if that 's the case , why the hell does this exist ? :
I 'm really touched that Superman himself wants me to " Slap a Jap . "
Apparently , cartoons and comic books were NOT intended for children , since that would be wrong .
Only HITLER uses propaganda on children ( see Disney entry below ) .
: sigh :
It makes me wonder if kids wore " Slap a Jap " t- shirts to school or something .
While it's not the main focus of this article , you really do n't want me to go into how horribly black people are depicted in old cartoons .... so I will anyway .
( Should I say African American ?
I 'm not even sure how to write it any more , since technically , I 'm talking about African Africans ... and the only person I know who 's African is as white as they come .
Is he a British African ? )
I do n't know why , but African Americans and African Africans just were n't represented in cartoons that well ( and still are n't , sometimes ) , besides being painted as lazy big - lipped savages .
Most of the " anti- black " cartoons were done in the 1930 's before the war .
The infamous Amos & Andy cartoons were there , but also strange things like Warner Brother 's " Jungle Jitters " surfaced from time to time .
The cartoon's not that interesting except for how the Warners draw Africans and how the only African who speaks is given a terrible Japanese accent .
One minority talking like another minority .
Let 's reverse it .... just imagine a Chinese guy talking in broken " I just jumped the Mexican border " Spanglish and you 'll get what 's going on here .
Do n't forget to check out the only African Ameri can -centric cartoon I got to see ... called " Coal Black & the Seven Dwarves . "
Yes .
It 's Snow White only ..... black .
From the picture to the left , you might notice that the spelling has been " Racified " to refer to the African American demographic .
Was n't that " nice " of Warner Brothers ?
Prince Charmin ' ( spelled " Chawmin " in this cartoon , because , apparently , minorities not spell no good ) is a pimp and Coal Black gets rescued by 7 black midgets who are also serving in the military .
The only person they end up fighting is an overweight black woman .
Lord knows , if I ever joined the army , my unit would be nothing but tiny black midgets and we'd fight ... um , obesity together .
Sure .
Speaking of men in uniform , Warner Brothers was paid by the US Army to make a bunch of educational / inspirational cartoons for the soldiers to watch during the war .
They were called SNAFU ( which is a military term for Situation Normal : All Fucked Up ...
There must be another , cleaner meaning , but I 've never heard it . ) and featured a goofy soldier of that name .
Chuck Jones made a few of them , and they were all written by Ted Geisel .
... also known as DR .
SEUSS .
The influence is really obvious because a ) the cartoons are filled with all sort of Dr-Seuss like inventions and b ) almost all of the dialogue is spoken in super - cute rhyme .
The subject matter would vary from " make sure to wear pants while in the malaria swamp " to " take care of your gun " to " do n't tell your prostitute any military secrets . "
Since they were n't for public consumption there 's more than a little female nudity ( all women wear thigh - high stockings and miniskirts and often no shirt ) .
Btw , that prostitute joke you just read ?
I was n't kidding .
Pointing out how the Japanese are still being drawn as little slant - eyed monkeys is me just being repetitive , but well , I 've already pointed it out , have n't I ?
Did I mention how it 's obvious that no WOMAN was meant to see these films ?
Here , Snafu is about to learn that the Nazis have deployed explosive sex dolls to confound the American troops .
While it 's only sort of implied that there 's a hooker involved , here Snafu lies behind a bush with some woman in the middle of the night ( telling military secrets ) .
Personally , I think the " censor bush " is a dead giveaway to something being wrong here .
I 'm starting to get the idea that the American troops might have been horny or something .
The above pictures are of Snafu 's girlfriend reading a letter .
That 's the only point of the scene .
Before you mock it , this is about as justified as that topless scene in " Open Water . "
Men like boobs , I guess .
Speaking of breasts : Agent Microphone
Tits has go to be the coolest secret agent ever .
" Excuse me , but could you speak a little more clearly into my nipples ? "
What really freaks me out is all this stuff was written by Dr. Seuss .
( Must I remind you that most of these cartoons are spoken only in rhyme ? )
What 's actually most interesting here is why the government decided to use cartoons to explain thing to its troops .
The government felt ( as confirmed by Chuck Jones and others ) that the level of the troop 's education meant that cartoons would be the best way of approaching them with important information .
Christ .
People = dumb , so let the cartoon character tell them how they can save their lives .
I do n't know .... it's really hard to convey how weird it is for the government to use a kid 's medium to educate " grown men " or young soldiers .
Then again , a couple of years ago , the Army made a video game with the intent to make kids want to join the Army .
: shrug :
My favorite SNAFU cartoon is one that explains fear .
It tell us that because the body produces adrenalin and our liver gives us energy when we 're afraid , the US Army wants us to be filled with fear before battle .
It 's kind of inspirational , but the way the cartoon works , it makes it look like if you 're afraid you 're invincible and should charge right into combat before the adrenalin wears off .
It 's very manipulative and scary , particularly when you realize they were showing this to grown men who would be dying in battle soon thereafter .
That 's not funny , but it kept going around in my head as I was watching it .
Fear makes you strong ... so go ahead , Shit Your Pants in Terror !
Yay !
By the way , did I mention Dr. Seuss was behind this whole mess ?
Oh , yeah .
I did .
Daffy
Duck also helped the war effort by running a scrap yard where you were supposed to donate all your tin , rubber , or whatever the hell the government needed .
There were a lot of cartoons back then about how Americans were supposed to help the Army , even if they were n't a soldier .
Invariably , this would show old people building tanks and housewives saving cooking grease and then smelting gold for Jesus or something ( I never said these cartoons were realistic ) .
Apparently , Daffy's " garbage dump of Freedom " was the key to the Allies ' victory as Hitler retaliates by sending over a NAZI GOAT to eat all the Allied garbage that Daffy 's protecting .
You see , animals have political views that match whatever country they 're from , since both Daffy and " Nazi Goat " have pretty strong views .
So does that mean the American Army could start releasing " Wild Dogs of Democracy " into Iraq ?
Cartoon logic is so funny sometimes .
Oh , and Daffy smashes Hitler 's skull in with a mallet .
Of course .
Bugs Bunny also played a part in the war effort ... but we 'll save the best for last .
And by " best " I mean the most painful .
Popeye the Sailor : Now I 'm not really surprised that there was some propaganda here because , well , he 's a sailor .
He 's already in the Navy , so it makes sense .
The two toons I got to have a look at were entitled : " Seeing Red , White , & Blue " and " You 're a Sap , Mr. Jap " .
One 's pretty straightforward , with Popeye beating the ever loving crap out of the Japanese Navy because that 's his job .
The other features Bluto not wanting to go to war , and Popeye 's his draft officer .
Man , that 's got to be shitty .
Your long - time r ival decides to get rid of you by sending you to war .
It 's not quite that bad , since this may be the only cartoon where Popeye and Bluto both eat spinach and help each other ( and join the Army in the end ) .
Of course , they fight Japanese spies .
Apparently , the Japanese are best depicted as short buck - toothed monkeys with squinty eyes and glasses .
If I was n't laughing so hard I 'd be offended .
This wo n't be the last time we see this kind of portrayal of a people ... trust me .
What 's also interesting about the Po peye cartoons is that whenever they show Hitler , he 's got the same voice as Popeye .
I do n't know what that means , but whenever Hitler speaks it 's just Popeye talking about body odor ( You do n't want me to explain this more clearly ... because I can 't . ) .
Here 's also a good place to point out that jokes about how people in the Navy are gay are officially AT LEAST 65 years old .
So many of these cartoons feature sailors being , well , more than a little .... off . I 'm not going to say much more , but it 's really really odd how many times sailors ( excluding Popeye ) end up putting on make - up and groping each other in these things .
" In the Navy , " indeed .
Tex Avery made a pretty classic cartoon called " Blitz Wolf " which is a pretty cute / clever telling of the Nazi situation as per the three little pigs .
" This little pig built his house of straw ... This little pig built his house of sticks ... and this little pig built his house of WAR !!! " ( as pictured to the left ) .
The pigs represent countries foolish enough to not be worried about Hitler until it was too late .
The whole thing 's really about Germany , but that does n't stop Tex Avery from getting one tiny dig in against the Japanese .
Thanks ,
Tex .
Very clever .
Instead of dogs , it 's the Japanese .
Nice .
Disney :
There 're a couple of interesting things that Disney made during the war ... all of them being a little " off " .
These include cartoons where Donald Duck is being told to save for his taxes , since they help support the war instead of spending his money on hookers ( seriously ) .
Now , obviously , I have to wonder how many " kids " filed their income tax returns during the 1940's ... so maybe that whole " the cartoons were n't just for kids " thing was true ( how many kids spent their money on whores is also up in the air ) .
That kind of frightens me , considering the logic behind using cartoons for that whole SNAFU thing ... you know , cartoons = education for adults .
There 's also a great " Donald Duck as a Nazi " cartoon called " In the Fuehrer 's Face , " where Donald Duck is a Nazi making munitions for Hitler .
It 's not that bad , and it 's satirical , but it does have some strange stuff in it .
For example : Donald Duck makes one scary nazi .
Of course it was all a dream , as shown by the " dream Nazis " descending into the ass of a sleeping Donald .
There 's also a cartoon called " Commando Duck , " where Donald has to go behind enemy lines and destroy an airport .
He ends up doing it with a giant water balloon by complete accident , but not before we get to hear a Japanese character say " Japanese tradition say we only shoot them in the back . " : sigh : I know the times we live in are so much more politically correct , but really :
Is n't being " politically correct " another way of saying " much less tolerant of blatantly horrible things to say ? "
Anyway , Donald the " Commando " ends the cartoon by writing a letter about how he met the enemy and wiped them all out .
I guess if normal people are allowed to kill folks during times of war , I should n't be surprised when Disney characters start making tactical strikes .
To be fair , most of what Disney made was of pretty high quality , even if they did make a cartoon that depicted how children were brainwashed in school to be good Nazis that did n't think for themselves .
Of course , this message is kind of off in itself , because as you watch this cartoon you 're WATCHING PROPAGANDA AIMED AT CHILDREN ABOUT GERMAN PROPAGANDA CARTOONS AIMED AT CHILDREN .
Sheesh .
Oddly enough , one of the " fascist practices " of Nazi Germany mentioned in this cartoon is still in use today :
If you have a child in Germany , you can only name it a German name .
It 's some sort of tradition more recently explained by the fact that Germany is n't reproducing fast enough and needs to hold onto its heritage .
While I think it 's kind of crappy that you have to name your kids off a list of German names , at least there 's no one named Nokia , Pepsi , or Moonbeam here in Berlin .
Bugs Bunny : I 've always been a huge Bugs Bunny fan , which is why some of the stuff he does in the war shocks the hell out of me .
I 'm going to discuss only one of his war - time cartoons at length , but which one ?
I COULD talk about the cartoon where he pretends to be Hitler and Stalin .
I COULD talk about the cartoon where he sings about buying Defense Bonds while pretending to be a big fat - lipped black man ( asking for money ) .
But I 'm NOT going to talk about that .
What , pray tell , will I discuss at length ?
How about the cartoon where Bugs Bunny gleefully feeds explosive ice cream to a whole island of Japanese soldiers ?
From the moment I saw the cartoon " Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips , " I knew I had to do an article about messed - up war - time cartoons .
There 's not much to it , but what 's there melts ever neuron in my brain .
Bugs Bunny ( voiced by Mel Blanc as usual ) washes up on a tropical island and a Japanese soldier starts shooting at him .
If you look at the picture to the right you can see that Warner Brothers was very respectful to the Japanese people , portraying them as squinting midgets with bad teeth just like everyone else did .
Gah .
Bugs Bunny 's traditional " I play practical jokes on you while I escape " shtick plays out until Bugs sabotages the soldier 's plane and hands him a bomb .
Then Bugs Bunny does something strange .
He paints a Japanese flag on a palm tree .
It took me a moment to figure out what this meant .
" What are you doing , Bugs ?
No , say it ai n't so ! "
Bugs Bunny paints a Japanese flag to mark his " kill . "
Apparently , once he 's tasted blood , his lust is not to be sated as he proceeds to attack every person of Japanese descent he sees .
This is n't like a normal cartoon .
Bugs Bunny is playing for keeps .
Jesus .
Bugs ends up fighting a sumo wrestler ( and has to dress as a Geisha to beat him ) and yes , marks the kill like any good soldier would .
The island suddenly become completely invaded and hundreds of Japanese soldiers show up ( they of COURSE all look the same and you can't tell the difference between them ) .
Bugs Bunny has a brilliant idea on how to get all of them for an all - time new high score : Dress as an ice cream man and give them grenades disguised as ice cream .
The lesson : Do n't ever shoot at Bugs Bunny .
He 'll hunt down everyone one you ever knew and loved and make them explode .
We 're about to hit upon the truly bizarre thing now .
So why does this part make me slightly sick ?
Its what Bugs Bunny says as he 's handing out ice cream : " Here you go , Slant Eyes ! " Bugs freaking Bunny SHOULD NOT be using ethnic slurs .
Ever. Sweet Jesus .
It 's like hearing the Pope say " I could eat a hamburger out of Britney Spear 's crotch .
Amen . "
You just should n't hear it .
EVER .
When I heard Bugs say that , I think I lost a little part of my childhood .
I do n't know what else to say except the cartoon ends with Bugs Bunny marking ALL his kills .
Do n't believe me ?
Every one of those painted flags represents a dead Japanese soldier .
God damn it Bugs , what the HELL happened to you ?
Did they do LSD tests or something ?
Where 's the character I know and love ?
Did war do this to you ?
It 's one thing to blow up Yosemite Sam .... we all know he 'll be back .
But marking the deaths of random Japanese soldiers that you called racist names before feeding them ice cream loaded with TNT is nothing short of F'd up .
Gah .
So , in summary :
It sucks to be black in old cartoons .
It sucks to be Japanese because you 'll be short , need glasses , and a lot of orthodontic work .
Germany has bad leaders .
Wait a second .
Why is it that in these cartoons they depict the Japanese as being evil down to the last man , while when it comes to Germany they only depict the country 's leaders as being goofy morons ?
Is it because you could n't demonize people of Germanic descent because that would include a large chunk of America 's population ?
Did they show any of these cartoons inside the Japanese concentration ( internment ) camps that America put together ?
Nevermind .
I really should n't be asking these questions .
Enjoy yourself and please :
If you know anyone Japanese .... Give them a hug from me .
They might need it , especially with Bugs Bunny still at large .

What do you mean , " The End " ?!
A Gainax Ending is an ending that does n't make any sense , or does make sense but is hidden under enough Mind Screw to not have an easy explanation .
This is usually a deliberate form of Mind Screw or intended as a Sequel Hook to a sequel that was never made .
If it 's not done intentionally , it 's often the result of the creators rushing to meet a Cosmic Deadline .
For whatever reason , after watching a Gainax Ending , you wo n't have any idea what happened .
After rewatching it , rewatching the entire series , discussing it with other fans , looking up the meaning of the symbolism , and subjecting the entire thing to a comprehensive literary analysis , you still might not have any idea what happened .
If you 're lucky , then there will be some kind of emotional or symbolic resolution even if it does n't actually explain what happened to the characters , and you 'll be left with the sense that the series as a whole was more deeply thought out than it seemed before .
If you 're unlucky , then you 'll be left with more questions than when you started and the sense that the series as a whole has been voided of the meaning you once read in it .

A Gainax Ending frequently involves bizarre and nonsensical Genre Shifts , Fauxlosophic Narration , and / or Faux Symbolism , and may very well cause Ending Aversion .
For an aborted Sequel Hook , you might encounter a Diabolus ex Nihilo ( where a new villain appears from nowhere , does something villainous , and then disappears again ) or No Ending in the form of an ambiguous Cliffhanger .
Either way , it would have been addressed in the sequel ... had there been one .
In many cases , a Gainax Ending is merely an attempt to Take a Third Option , rather than resolve a story with a Happy Ending or a Downer Ending ; this ending steps out of the narrative entirely and implicates or invites the viewer to make sense of it .
From a creator 's standpoint , this makes the work , when done right , something that has far reaching consequences rather than merely something seen and consumed and discarded .

The Trope Namer is Studio Gainax , who became associated with this trope after the infamous ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion .
Compare No Ending and Ambiguous Ending , which also contain an at least partial lack of resolution , Trippy Finale Syndrome , which has similar imagery but actually makes sense ( it 's explicitly a Dream Sequence , a Battle in the Center of the Mind , takes place in Another Dimension , etc ) , Esoteric Happy Ending , an ending that is considered happy despite all the evidence to the contrary , and Mind Screw ( and associated tropes ) , or a Widget Series , where it 's not simply the ending but the work overall that evades explanation .
For when the ending ends up changing the entire scenario , see The Ending Changes Everything .
Not to be confused with Gainaxing .
And , as a last word for this entry , we 'd just like to say that the parrot has been squawking for hours and it is annoying the neighbors , so please feed him his cracker and be done with .
As this is an Ending Trope , expect unmarked major spoilers from here on but do n't expect them to make any sense !

At least two episodes of Simple Samosa have endings that come off as surreal , even by the usual standards of the show .
In " Comic Book " , Dhokla , Jalebi , and Vada all laugh at the story about Samosa they worked on when , out of the blue , a warning is given to the town of Chatpata Nagar and the townspeople discover a samosa dinosaur who wants four people for some unexplained reason .
The dino turns out to be Samosa himself , and just to reiterate , this is n't in Samosa 's friends ' story and is n't even real in - universe because it turns out to be the result of Samosa writing the episode .
The scene ends with the show 's theme song playing as if nothing weird just happened .
" Kasturi Khushbu " ends with Samosa visiting a United Nations meeting where everyone gives him a ton of consecutive farts .
This collection of toots turns out to be the scent Samosa was looking for throughout the episode .
Suddenly , Samosa winds up almost completely naked on the grass , and his friends see him sniff his own fart before Jalebi says Samosa did n't need to spend so much effort looking for an aroma he had with him the whole time .

Invisible Games is a rather straightforward presentation of various fictional games that have supposedly been created over the course of the last century or so .
The final entry , however , is an abrupt departure in style .
Presented as a follow - up to a non-existent previous entry , the last entry is a surreal first - person tale filled with tantalizing hints about a mysterious sect of women who appear at the homes of the terminally ill .
The artifacts they bear are in fact the components of a seemingly supernatural virtual reality machine in which the patients immerse themselves completely in the days prior to their death .
The author eagerly anticipates death for the chance to experience the wonders of such a machine and considers dying without access to one to be a tragic fate akin to martyrdom .
But the author laments that there is still work to be done and that a storm that has gone on for years is now raging outside .
No other updates were ever made .

In one series of Peanuts strips , Charlie Brown watches the sun rise , and it looks like a baseball .
Then the moon does too , and he starts seeing baseballs everywhere .
Then he gets a rash on the back of his head that makes it look like a baseball .
His pediatrician suggests going to summer camp to take his mind off baseball ; because he 's embarrassed by the rash , he puts a paper sack over his head .
At camp , someone half - jokingly suggests nominating " the kid in the sack " for camp president , and before he knows it , Charlie Brown is practically running the place , everyone following his advice and looking up to him .
Eventually , though , he decides to take off the sack - becoming his old self again - and watch the sun rise to see if he 's back to normal ...
And it looks like Alfred E. Newman 's head with the words " What me worry ? " under it .
" Good grief ! " cries Charlie Brown at the ending that made no sense .

Higher Learning : Inverted .
The prologue makes no sense after reading the story .
Shinji , Asuka , Rei and Misato are gathered around a dying Kaoru , who reflects about each one of them and wonders if he has been successful and Shinji will not have to do the same thing he did .
That scene feels like foreshadowing , but it is not foreshadowing anything .
That scene never happens .
Those characters never are together in the same scene , Kaoru does not die , and his thoughts make no sense given what happened .
. Darker and Edgier Disney fanfic Her Haunted Mansion : Emily 's Journey ( a prequel of sorts to a previous , completely mindscrew - less fanfic by the same author , Her Haunted Mansion ) has four chapters be totally believable backstories for the character we met in Her Haunted Mansion .
Our main character is Emily ( the name commonly assigned to the Haunted Mansion Attic Bride ghost , although she does n't become a bride until Chapter 5 ) , who had all the characters in question as love ones before Master Mickey apparently took them away from her ( although we know or are supposed to know from Her Haunted Mansion that he 's actually saving them ) ; she always tries to stop him , and always he enigmatically replies ' You 're a little early , Emily ' with a wide grin .
When Chapter 5 came , everyone expected all these mysteries would be solved and Emily would understand her mistakes about Master Mickey .
But no .
Ooooh , no .
Emily wakes up after having been murdered , and goes inside Mickey 's mansion .
In the attic , she meets a doppelgänger of herself , ready to be married , whom she brutally murders with an axe .
She then climbs down into the ballroom where Minnie and Mickey 's wedding is about to be celebrated .
Everyone calls Narrator !
Emily " Constance " ( the name of another , axe - wielding ghost bride character in The Haunted Mansion ) .
The whole chapter is told Through the Eyes of Madness ( specifically , those of Constance ) , and she 's getting battier and battier as the chapter progresses ; from the mess of the last paragraphs , it appears Emily murdered everyone in the ballroom ( even her best friends ) because they would n't call her Emily .
'' All that had been foreshadowed is never explained ( Mickey flat - out denies having ever said ' You 're a little early , Emily ! ' in the first place ) and why Emily - going - mad / Constance - believing - herself - to - be - Emily / whatever - the - heck - happened happened is never explained .

The , admittedly already pretty weird , MLP fanfic The Many Secret Origins of Scootaloo at first seems to end on a relatively normal note that more or less raps up the story ... then for no reason what so ever , we cut to an alternate universe where the whole story was a dream Nightmare Moon was having , she 's married to Discord , Twilight is their infant daughter , and Scootaloo is Twilight 's doll .
The Half Life 1 mod Half - Life : Residual Life has two endings as it may be , both of which are more than a bit confusing .
No matter what route you choose to get to the ending , the game seems to restart right as player character Sora Kim is on the Black Mesa tram ( complete with the first chapter title appearing , Impossibility Dream ) , implying that the whole game was All Just a Dream ... until the tram takes a different route than before , taking Sora to a previously unseen location , and after it stops a guard appears out of nowhere and tells her ( using audio of the G - Man's ) that she 's " not supposed to be here " .
After the credits , it opens back up to Sora in a some sort of abandoned building in the middle of nowhere devoid of anyone aside from a scant few monsters .
Then she finds and boards a mysterious alien ship and leaves .

Untitled Displaced Fanfiction has a Gainax Ending in both part one and part three .
Part one suddenly transitions from the main character Jonah presumably dying because Fluttershy kicked him to a future in which the mane six all have human bodies .
Fluttershy then beheads a man implied to be Jonah .
The second entry tries to do a Mind Screwdriver but elements such as Rainbow Dash saying " What have you done ? " and the place everyone meets in being called " Shibuya " are retconned .
The third part of the trilogy also has a Gainax Ending were Jonah goes back in time using Discord 's magic , fights Samson ( the Biblical character ) and then laughs at Delilah for being thin .
The story then abruptly ends .
Films — Animated
The Twelve Tasks of Asterix delivers a pretty jarring example of this trope , considering the movie is based on a comic book series that 's usually at least roughly historically accurate ( it is a parodistic / satirical series after all ) .
The movie ends with a group of Gauls from a small village ending up being considered gods , thereby overthrowing Caesar note who is actually both an anachronistic figure ( there WASN'T yet an emperor during the time Caesar conquered Gaul ) and a mashup of Caius Julius Caesar and his adoptive son Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus ( short : Caesar Augustus ) and gaining rulership over the entire Roman Empire .
After his companion Obelix leans on the fourth wall by pointing out the historical inaccuracy of this turn of events , Asterix proceeds to break it , explaining to Obelix that everything is possible in animation .
Upon hearing this , Obelix magically teleports to the island of pleasure , which the pair had visited earlier in the movie .
Oh my ...

In the South Korean animated film Dino Time , one of the rocks in the kids ' town has a mysterious carving on it , dating back to Cretaceous period .
Mysterious because no humans were around then .
The kids end up going back in time and at one point the main kid decides to make a carving to tell their parents in the future how to get the time machine to work , but he gets distracted when his sister is kidnapped and ends up not making the carving .
At the end of the film , his mom explains they got to them in the time machine by looking at the carving , leaving the main kid to wonder how the carving got there in the first place .
The last twenty minutes of The Three Caballeros consist of Donald Duck entering Panchito 's final birthday gift , a photograph of Mexico City at night .
There he encounters singer Dora Luz 's floating head and becomes smitten with her , before being accosted by flashing lights and images of women in bathing suits , while Panchito occasionally pops up to sing the title song with Jose Carioca and another Donald .
He then finds himself in a flower patch and meets Carmen Molina , before being transported to a desert where he sees Molina using a baton to bring cacti to life .
This scene abruptly ends and the film moves into the final " bullfighting " scene , with Panchito as the matador , Jose as the audience members ( all of them ) , and Donald in a bull costume studded with fireworks .
The filmmakers later claimed that the section ( referred to as " Donald 's Surreal Reverie " ) was intended to represent the idea that " love is a drug " .

P.D.Q. Bach : Einstein on the Fritz :
The supposedly - lost musical is a parody of Einstein on the Beach , an opera by Philip Glass and Robert Wilson , which is notorious for lasting four and a half hours without plot .
Summarized thusly : Einstein feels a sneeze coming on , and takes his handkerchief from his pocket .
In Act II , he realizes that he is not going to sneeze after all , and he puts his handkerchief back in his pocket in Act III .
This is the summary of the epilogue supposedly tacked on by PDQ Bach : Einstein goes down to Hades to bring back his cousin Sophie , avenge the murder of his brother at the hands of Tsar Ivan the Inside Trader , slays the dragon guarding the entrance to the Golden Cave , seduces the Count 's daughter on the eve of her wedding , and unites Italy .
Puppet Show
Radio
Most The Goon Show episodes have no clear ending , unless everyone dies .
The grand finale actually dissolves into random gibberish as the entire show comes to a crashing halt , and it does n't seem atypical .
As the announcer often observed , " It 's all in the mind , you know . "
This is mainly seen in later episodes , probably because Spike Milligan himself had no idea how to end them .
Earlier surviving episodes tend to have fairly logical plot resolutions , for a certain definition of logic .
Theatre
The grand finale of the musical Celebration involves the old villain ( and the audience ) being bombarded with portentous symbolism until he collapses , though not before revealing that he and his youthful rival are one and the same .
The Threepenny Opera ends with Macheath ( " Mack the Knife " ) about to be hanged for his many crimes .
As he mounts the gallows , Peachum , who has orchestrated his execution because Macheath has married his daughter against her parents ' will , suddenly shouts " Stop ! " and addresses the audience .
In order that the audience not have to face a sad ending , a happy one has been arranged .
The chorus breaks into the song " The Mounted Messenger " , as police commissioner Tiger Brown ( Macheath 's old army buddy and his OTHER father - in - law ) , in full uniform , comes in riding a stick horse , and reads a proclamation from Queen Victoria , in honor of her coronation , ordering Macheath freed , awarded membership in the Order of the Garter , a castle ( at " Mucking on the Creek , Sussex " ) and an annual income for life ... and extending " her royal felicitations " to all " the lovely wedding couples here assembled " ( the thieves , beggars and whores )
The Pirates of Penzance :
The climactic scene culminates with the pirates convincing the authorities not to punish them by declaring how much they love Queen Victoria .
This leads to the entire cast singing the Queen 's praises .
Very similar with Rossini's Il viaggio a Reims .
For two hours we watch Loads and Loads of Characters , and we seem to finally figure out that , right , the French lady is in love with the Frenchman who flirts with the Italian lady who 's secretly loved by the Englishman , while the Polish widow is torn between her two admirers when the plot cuts off for the whole lot to arrange a concert in King Charles X's honor .

US President Barack Obama will ask Congress to provide $ 205 million to Israel to spur production and deployment of a new short - range rocket defense system , administration officials said on Thursday .
" The president recognizes the threat missiles and rockets fired by Hamas and Hezbollah pose to Israelis , and has therefore decided to seek funding from Congress to support the production of Israel 's short range rocket defense system called Iron Dome , " White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
( Reuters )
Israel was maintaining a diplomatic silence Tuesday amid reports from the UK that the Liberal - Democrats , a rising force in British politics whose leader has taken highly critical positions on Israel , would seek control of the Foreign Office and several other senior positions if Thursday ’s general elections give the party the balance of power in a hung parliament .
Government officials said it would be inappropriate for Israel to make any comment at all on the British elections , in which Labor Prime Minister Gordon Brown is battling both the traditional rival Conservative Party , led by David Cameron , and an unexpected third - party challenge from the Lib - Dems under Nick Clegg .
Privately , however , the view in Jerusalem is that it would be deeply problematic for Israel were Clegg ’s party to unexpectedly prevail in the elections or , more realistically , fare well enough to deny Labor or the Conservatives an outright majority in the House of Commons .
Clegg has repeatedly lambasted Israel for using “ disproportionate ” force in Operation Cast Lead , slammed the blockade of Gaza and , in an op - ed article last year , demanded that Britain and the EU halt arms sales to Israel .
According to reports in the British press on Tuesday , the Lib - Dems would demand at least six senior ministerial positions as its price for joining a coalition , including the post of foreign secretary , as well as the title of deputy prime minister for Clegg .
Clegg ’s well - regarded performance over a series of three live TV debates in the run-up to polling day has been the surprise of the election campaign .
It has helped lift the Lib - Dems above Brown ’s troubled Labor in several opinion polls , to just a few percentage points behind Cameron ’s leading Conservatives , prompting Clegg to assert that he is a genuine contender for the prime ministership .
The nature of the British constituency system makes it extremely unlikely that the Lib - Dems could take power , but many polls in recent days have indicated that a hung parliament is likely , which would leave Clegg as the kingmaker , well - placed to demand a high price in return for joining a Conservative - or Labor - led coalition as junior partner .
Clegg ’s criticisms of Israel , notably since Cast Lead , have been noted with dismay in Jerusalem , where eyebrows are also raised over his reported connections with certain Arab figures who hold to problematic ideologies .
His stance on Iran in the TV debates has also prompted concern , since he was seen to underestimate the dangers posed by Teheran ’s nuclear program – in contrast to both Brown and Cameron .
The current British foreign secretary , David Miliband , is not regardedby Jerusalem as the most supportive such figure in recent memory , butIsrael , runs the view here , would be looking back fondly at Miliband asa font of pro-Israel empathy were Clegg to succeed him .
Clegg ’s most trenchant public criticism of Israel came in an opinionpiece he wrote for The Guardian in January 2009 , at the height of Operation Cast Lead , headlined “ We must stop arming Israel .
” “ Israel ’s approach is self - defeating , ” he argued .
“ The overwhelming useof force , the unacceptable loss of civilian lives , is radicalizingmoderate opinion among Palestinians and throughout the Arab world .
” Consequently , he urged Brown to “ condemn unambiguously Israel ’stactics , just as he has rightly condemned Hamas ’s rocket attacks . ”
Andhe called both to “ immediately suspend the proposed new [ EU ] cooperation agreement with Israel until things change in Gaza , ” and “ halt Britain ’s arms exports to Israel , and persuade our EUcounterparts to do the same . ”

An American judge , concerned about the " staggering volume of infringement " taking place at BitTorrent search site isoHunt , has issued a permanent injunction against the site and its owner , Canadian Gary Fung .
Movie studios now have the green light to submit long lists of movie titles to isoHunt , and those titles must not be hosted , indexed , or linked to by the site .
In addition , is oHunt is barred from allowing search terms that " are widely known to be associated with copyright infringement . "
These include , but are not limited to , " Warez , " Axxo , " " Jaybob , " " DVD rips , " " Cam , " Telesync , " and " Telecine . "
In addition to the limits on search functionality , isoHunt cannot operate a tracker server that " assists users in locating , identifying , or obtaining files from other users offering any of the Copyrighted Works for transmission . "
Finally , the judge regulated is oHunt 's webpage metadata ( it can not include " infringement - related terms " ) and forbade the site from offering lists of " top downloads " that include copyrighted works .
IsoHunt tried to head off this ruling after the judge found the site liable for inducing copyright infringement in late 2009 .
Fung hoped to create a " lite " version of the site with restricted search features that would be available to the American market .
The site was rolled out in April with a welcome note :
US users , welcome to the lighter and lightning fast is oHunt !
Although we bring this new search engine to you with a burden from the lawsuit brought by the MPAA , we hope you understand the reason why we are making this change .
It is to address concerns Judge Wilson has over inducing copyright infringement in the US .
Though inducement is never our intention and we have evidence to support it , with is oHunt Lite we want to affirm publicly that is oHunt 's essential function is nothing more than a search engine and a public utility with all the net neutrality it affords and should be afforded .
The judge was not impressed .
As he noted in his permanent injunction , isoHunt still contains " all of the same indexing and searching functions as the original websites , only with a different interface for the users to operate . "
The " lite " site also included lists of the most popular downloads by category , almost all of which were commercial content .
A current list of top TV torrents
In an April message on isoHunt , site operators wrote , " There is much non-infringing uses [ sic ] of BitTorrent technology and we hope you will be able to continue to use isoHunt for these uses , free of constraints by large holes in the english dictionary because your search triggered a keyword in a title of one of the million movies that have been produced . "
But when your " very business model , at its core , depends upon copyright infringement " — as the judge wrote about is oHunt — it 's hard to scare up too much sympathy from federal judges .
Because the servers are based in Canada , though , it 's not yet clear how the ruling will affect is oHunt 's worldwide operations .
IsoHunt last week was placed on a six - website blacklist by numerous members of Congress and the RIAA .

The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless .
There are as many definitions of philosophy as there are philosophers – perhaps there are even more .
After three millennia of philosophical activity and disagreement , it is unlikely that we ’ll reach consensus , and I certainly do n’t want to add more hot air to the volcanic cloud of unknowing .
What I ’d like to do in the opening column in this new venture —
The Stone — is to kick things off by asking a slightly different question : what is a philosopher ?
As Alfred North Whitehead said , philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato .
Let me risk adding a footnote by looking at Plato ’s provocative definition of the philosopher that appears in the middle of his dialogue , “ Theaetetus , ” in a passage that some scholars consider a “ digression . ”
But far from being a footnote to a digression , I think this moment in Plato tells us something hugely important about what a philosopher is and what philosophy does .
Socrates tells the story of Thales , who was by some accounts the first philosopher .
He was looking so intently at the stars that he fell into a well .
Some witty Thracian servant girl is said to have made a joke at Thales ’ expense — that in his eagerness to know what went on in the sky he was unaware of the things in front of him and at his feet .
Socrates adds , in Seth Benardete ’s translation , “ The same jest suffices for all those who engage in philosophy . ”
What is a philosopher , then ?
The answer is clear : a laughing stock , an absent - minded buffoon , the butt of countless jokes from Aristophanes ’
“ The Clouds ” to Mel Brooks ’s “ History of the World , part one . ”
Whenever the philosopher is compelled to talk about the things at his feet , he gives not only the Thracian girl but the rest of the crowd a belly laugh .
The philosopher ’s clumsiness in worldly affairs makes him appear stupid or , “ gives the impression of plain silliness . ”
We are left with a rather Monty Pythonesque definition of the philosopher : the one who is silly .
Erin Schell
But as always with Plato , things are not necessarily as they first appear , and Socrates is the greatest of ironists .
First , we should recall that Thales believed that water was the universal substance out of which all things were composed .
Water was Thales ’ philosophers ’ stone , as it were .
Therefore , by falling into a well , he inadvertently presses his basic philosophical claim .
But there is a deeper and more troubling layer of irony here that I would like to peel off more slowly .
Socrates introduces the “ digression ” by making a distinction between the philosopher and the lawyer , or what Benardete nicely renders as the “ pettifogger . ”
The lawyer is compelled to present a case in court and time is of the essence .
In Greek legal proceedings , a strictly limited amount of time was allotted for the presentation of cases .
Time was measured with a water clock or clepsydra , which literally steals time , as in the Greek kleptes , a thief or embezzler .
The pettifogger , the jury , and by implication the whole society , live with the constant pressure of time .
The water of time ’s flow is constantly threatening to drown them .
The freedom of the philosopher consists in either moving freely from topic to topic or simply spending years returning to the same topic out of perplexity , fascination and curiosity .
By contrast , we might say , the philosopher is the person who has time or who takes time .
Theodorus , Socrates ’ interlocutor , introduces the “ digression ” with the words , “ Are n’t we at leisure , Socrates ? ”
The latter ’s response is interesting .
He says , “ It appears we are . ”
As we know , in philosophy appearances can be deceptive .
But the basic contrast here is that between the lawyer , who has no time , or for whom time is money , and the philosopher , who takes time .
The freedom of the philosopher consists in either moving freely from topic to topic or simply spending years returning to the same topic out of perplexity , fascination and curiosity .
Pushing this a little further , we might say that to philosophize is to take your time , even when you have no time , when time is constantly pressing at your back .
The busy readers of The New York Times will doubtless understand this sentiment .
It is our hope that some of them will make the time to read The Stone .
As Wittgenstein says , “ This is how philosophers should salute each other : ‘ Take your time . ’ ” Indeed , it might tell you something about the nature of philosophical dialogue to confess that my attention was recently drawn to this passage from Theaetetus in leisurely discussions with a doctoral student at the New School , Charles Snyder .
Socrates says that those in the constant press of business , like lawyers , policy - makers , mortgage brokers and hedge fund managers , become ” bent and stunted ” and they are compelled “ to do crooked things . ”
The pettifogger is undoubtedly successful , wealthy and extraordinarily honey - tongued , but , Socrates adds , “ small in his soul and shrewd and a shyster . ”
The philosopher , by contrast , is free by virtue of his or her otherworldliness , by their capacity to fall into wells and appear silly .
Socrates adds that the philosopher neither sees nor hears the so - called unwritten laws of the city , that is , the mores and conventions that govern public life .
The philosopher shows no respect for rank and inherited privilege and is unaware of anyone ’s high or low birth .
It also does not occur to the philosopher to join a political club or a private party .
As Socrates concludes , the philosopher ’s body alone dwells within the city ’s walls .
In thought , they are elsewhere .
This all sounds dreamy , but it is n’t .
Philosophy should come with the kind of health warning one finds on packs of European cigarettes : PHILOSOPHY KILLS .
Here we approach the deep irony of Plato ’s words .
Plato ’s dialogues were written after Socrates ’ death .
Socrates was charged with impiety towards the gods of the city and with corrupting the youth of Athens .
He was obliged to speak in court in defense of these charges , to speak against the water - clock , that thief of time .
He ran out of time and suffered the consequences : he was condemned to death and forced to take his own life .
A couple of generations later , during the uprisings against Macedonian rule that followed the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C.E. , Alexander ’s former tutor , Aristotle , escaped Athens saying , “ I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy . ”
From the ancient Greeks to Giordano Bruno , Spinoza , Hume and right up to the shameful lawsuit that prevented Bertrand Russell from teaching at the City College of New York in 1940 on the charge of sexual immorality and atheism , philosophy has repeatedly and persistently been identified with blasphemy against the gods , whichever gods they might be .
Nothing is more common in the history of philosophy than the accusation of impiety .
Because of their laughable otherworldliness and lack of respect for social convention , rank and privilege , philosophers refuse to honor the old gods and this makes them politically suspicious , even dangerous .
Might such dismal things still happen in our happily enlightened age ?
That depends where one casts one ’s eyes and how closely one looks .
Perhaps the last laugh is with the philosopher .
Although the philosopher will always look ridiculous in the eyes of pettifoggers and those obsessed with maintaining the status quo , the opposite happens when the non-philosopher is obliged to give an account of justice in itself or happiness and misery in general .
Far from eloquent , Socrates insists , the pettifogger is “ perplexed and stutters . ”
Of course , one might object , that ridiculing someone ’s stammer is n’t a very nice thing to do .
Benardete rightly points out that Socrates assigns every kind of virtue to the philosopher apart from moderation .
Nurtured in freedom and taking their time , there is something dreadfully uncanny about the philosopher , something either monstrous or god - like or indeed both at once .
This is why many sensible people continue to think the Athenians had a point in condemning Socrates to death .
I leave it for you to decide .
I could n’t possibly judge .

Android has officially hit the big time now that sales of its devices exceeded the Apple iPhone over the past quarter .
The definitive Android smartphone guide
Android 's rise is fairly remarkable for an operating system that only just launched in the fall of 2007 .
The open - source operating system 's success is even more impressive when you consider that when it debuted it was already facing a crowded field of OS heavyweights such as the iPhone , BlackBerry , Windows Mobile and Symbian .
Briefly , a look at the numbers :
Over the span of a mere quarter last year , Android saw its share of the U.S. smartphone market more than double , as the platform was used on more than 7 % of all U.S. smartphones at the end of 2009 .
The most recent research released by the NPD Group showed that Android - based phones in the first quarter of 2010 accounted for 28 % of all smartphone shipments , trailing only Research in Motion 's BlackBerry operating system , which accounted for 36 % of all smartphone shipments in the quarter .
And finally , Android - based phones are now available on all four major U.S. wireless carriers , with the million - selling Motorola Droid so far serving as the platform 's flagship device .
So how did this all come together so quickly ?
Looking back over the past three years , it seems that Google had a very simple but effective plan to push its way into a crowded market .
Using a combination of free software , design simplicity and brand clout , Google has succeeded in making an operating system that , in just a couple of years , has grown to rival the most popular mobile platforms in the business .
Let 's take a look at each element piece by piece :
* First , make it free .
One of the most enticing aspects of Android from both a software developer and a device manufacturer perspective is that it 's completely free to use , as Google charges no licensing fees for anyone who wants to base their device or application on Android .
This is a distinctly different path than the ones taken by Apple and Research in Motion , which both only allow use of their operating systems on their own devices , and by Microsoft , which only allows devices to use Windows Mobile through a licensing agreement .
* Second , keep it simple .
When Google went about attracting application developers to its new platform , it made a big deal about the Android software development kit 's ease of use .
And since Android is Linux platform that uses Java as its programming language , most software developers on the market have n't had much difficulty in writing programs for the operating system .
Google has also gone out of its way to make posting a new application on the Android Market a snap , as the company does not screen any applications sent to the store and will only remove applications if it has received legitimate customer complaints about them .
" We created an account , uploaded our apps and then hit submit , " said Ilya Eliashevsky , the product manager for app developer DataViz 's Android product line , last year .
" Then the app just started showing up on devices and we saw sales immediately starting to roll in . "
* Finally , be Google .
There have been ambitious platform developers in the past who have tried to mainstream open source in the mobile OS market , but none of them so far have had the market clout of Google .
Google 's brand recognition not only helps it attract media attention to its initiatives but also helps it more quickly develop relationships with device manufacturers , carriers and app developers .
In other words , while you obviously need to develop a strong mobile platform that device manufacturers , software developers and consumers want to use , it does n't hurt to be the world 's No.1 search engine either .

For the first time in five years , the Cannes Film Festival has chosen an American film to be featured in the International Critics ’
Week section !
The Myth of the American Sleepover comes from first time writer / director , David Robert Mitchell and tells the story of a group of teenagers whose lives collide and overlap during their last night of freedom before school starts and summer ends .
While a description of yet another coming of age story about rebellious teens who have some kind of meaningful end - of - summer revelation might make you want to yawn just thinking about it , the preview is exceptionally promising .
The Myth of the American Sleepover takes place in suburban Detroit , with kids that most of us can relate to ( me especially , since I ’m a mid-west gal myself ) instead of being some drop dead gorgeous Hollywood types .
It does n’t feel too gritty the way something like Kids would , but it ’s also lacking in the cheesy / flowery vibe that made me love movies like Now and Then .
My favorite quote from the preview is this : “ They trick you into giving up your childhood with all these promises of adventure .
Once you realize what you ’ve lost , it ’s too late .
You ca n’t get it back . ”
Color me curious .

“ Our greatest fear is that when we die we will become nothing .
We believe we are born from nothing and that when we die we become nothing .
And so we are filled with fear of annihilation .
The Buddha has a very different understanding , that birth and death are notions .
They are not real . ” ~ Thich Nhat Hanh
In 2002 , I had the privilege of participating on a week - long retreat with Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh at Stonehill College in Massachusetts .
To say that it changed my life would be an understatement .
I think it saved my life .
Being in the presence of dear
Thây ( his students ’ affectionate name for him ) was , for me , like being in the presence of a living Buddha .
Here was a man who literally walked the walk of the Buddha .
His teachings sank deep into my heart , and at the end of the retreat I took the took the Three Refuges and the Five Mindfulness Training Oaths .
The same year of this retreat , Thây released another book in a long list of dharma books he ’s written .
It is titled No Death No Fear - Comforting Wisdom for Life .
No Death , No Fear is one of those books that challenge you , inspire you , humble you , frustrate you , puzzle you , and awaken you .
The book has been an enormous help in my life , and yet , I honestly admit that there are parts I still do n’t get , and even do n’t agree with .
( I think this confession would make Thây smile that wonderful smile of his .
He is never dogmatic ; he always urges students and seekers to look into things for themselves , not just accept dogma . )
To help give you a taste of the book , which I hope you will investigate for yourself , I want to share a small portion of it in audio form .
This passage is part of a marvelous reading of the book produced by Audio Renaissance as an audio CD / audio book .
The reader is Ken McLeod , who is himself a remarkable dharma teacher in the Tibetan tradition .
His Unfettered Mind website is a treasure trove of powerful , helpful teachings .
I highly recommend his book Wake Up To Your Life - Discovering the Buddhist Path of Attention as one of the most helpful books on meditation I ’ve ever read .
http://www.unfetteredmind.org/
And so , without further explanation , I invite you listen to the opening pages of No Death , No Fear : Comforting Wisdom for Life as read by Ken McLeod .
May this audio excerpt help you , and comfort you , and inspire to investigate the book , and the teachings of the Buddha on life and death for yourself .

This frightening tangle of tentacles / intestines with its tips curled into what looks like elf boots was created by former Maxis intern Michael " Flux " Chang , supposedly for testing Spore 's gait systems .
It does n't actually appear in the final game , but Maxis ' senior art director Ocean Quigley recently posted media of the " Intestisaur " .
" The thing was fascinating to watch , but disturbing and creepy , " says Quigley .
" It became our unofficial mascot .
... I was never sure about Intestisaur 's gender , but I 'll settle on " him " .
...
The animation system handled him just fine , and it was fun to watch him saunter around . "
If you think your stomach or nerves can handle it , I 've embedded a video of the Intestisaur " walking " around , trying to make its way across the screen before it jumps out to attach itself to your face , after the break .

Look , no one but Beck himself -- who 's made a career out of gaining trust from his listeners only to sell them a bad investment that also enriches him through endorsement fees -- and Goldline International are to blame for this mess .
But of course , Beck is doing what he does best and blaming the messengers , accusing them of " McCarthyism " by going after his sponsors .
That has nothing to do with this -- it 's about consumer protection .
If Beck endorsed companies that did n't use questionable sales tactics , there would be no story .
And frankly , Weiner would n't even be involved if the SEC and the FTC had been doing their jobs in the first place .
Image caption Tom Welling has starred in the series for a decade
US television series Smallville is coming to an end after 10 years , broadcaster CW has confirmed .
The drama , which charts the early years of Superman 's alter ego Clark Kent , is said to be the longest - running serial based on a comic book character .
Network chiefs have promised the final series will be nostalgic and feature the return of various characters who have appeared over the years .
Actor Tom Welling has played the lead role since the show first aired .
Tights
CW 's president of entertainment , Dawn Ostroff , said : " The fans want to see the show go out in a big way and we will give it to them . "
Since the fifth season , Smallville has veered towards more adult themes , and Clark Kent 's burgeoning newspaper career at the Daily Planet .
Its focus has been on the Kansas town - which forms the title of the show - where he spent his formative years .
In an interview with MTV , Welling speculated on whether he would finally don the costume which Superman has become so famous for .
" We 've seen glimpses of it with the cape and Martha [ Kent ] presenting it to Clark and saying ' this was in the ship when you got here ' , " he said .
" I 'm sure we 're going to see it , I just do n't know in what capacity . "
" I do n't know if you 're going to see me in tights , if that 's what you 're asking , " added the actor .
When we set up Project Ayatana to improve the usability of the whole desktop , we called it Ayatana because we were focused on the “ sphere of consciousness ” , one ’s awareness of what ’s going on outside of the current application .
There are two key aspects to the work :
Notifications are “ awareness distilled ” in the sense that you cannot interact with them at all .
We designed them as ephemeral “ click - transparent ” messages , implemented in Notify - OSD .
Their sole purpose is to notify you of transient events .
Indicator Menus combine persistent awareness of a state with a set of options for modifying that state .
In this blog I ’ll outline the arc of our work on indicator menus to date , and the trajectory we expect it to follow .
We ’re about a year into the effort , all told , and I think it will take another 18 months before we can consider it baked .
It should be done by 12.04 LTS .
This is an iterative process , and things are in flux right now .
I hope , when we are happy that we can commit to ABI stability , that Gnome and KDE will adopt the work too .
For the moment , the rapid pace of evolution has meant that we ’re depending on fantastic upstreams to keep up with us as things move .
Goals of the Ayatana Indicators
The indicators are designed to create a persistent awareness of state , or an awareness of a persistent state .
They complement notifications : they are persistent , when notifications are ephemeral .
You might miss a notification , but you should always be able to check your indicators .
You can interact with indicators , using their menus , in contrast with the un-clickable notifications .
We value :
Support for both GNOME and KDE .
Both desktop environments are important in Ubuntu .
We encourage the teams to reflect a pure vision of each , but it ’s also the case that users will want to run a GNOME application on Kubuntu occasionally , or vice versa .
So we have to make sure the work is considered from the perspectives of developers on either side , and we have to provide APIs and libraries that work in both environments .

Accessibility .
Indicators are critical elements of awareness .
Whether you are connected , what the time is , whether you are online , whether your battery will last long enough for you to finish your work , whether you have messages … these are all vital to a complete computing experience .
We have to make sure that visual and other disabilities can be addressed .

Familiarity and Innovation .
As always , these are in tension with one another .
Innovation helps us put free software at the front of the curve , but it creates the risk of breaking people ’s habits and expectations .

Consistency and Usability .
We want the end result to be more usable in the whole , and we are willing to lose individual nuggets if that helps make the whole more valuable .
.

Streamlining .
There are too many indicators , that are n’t clear enough about their intent .
There are also many indicators from different applications which do roughly the same thing , but in slightly different ways .
The value of all the indicators is enhanced if there are fewer of them , and they are more obvious to discover and use .
Some firm decisions
Those values lead us to some anchor decisions :
D -Bus for communications .
A messaging approach makes it straightforward to adopt consistent patterns across different desktop environments .
We will provide wrapper libraries for both Gtk and Qt applications to access the indicator capabilities .
A Qt application running on Ubuntu should “ feel native ” when it ’s using indicators correctly .
And vice - versa .
The messaging approach also lets us handle accessibility in a better way : we do n’t have to accommodate every possible disability visually , because we can have agents that interpret the indicator messages and handle it in ways that are appropriate for a particular disability .
Opinionated placement .
We will place all indicators at the top right of the screen on GNOME .
We ’ll place them in a particular order , too , with the “ most fundamental ” indicator , which controls the overall session , in the top right .
The order will not be random , but predictable between sessions and screen sizes .
There will be no GUI support for users to reorder the indicators .
Constrained behaviour .
All the indicators will take the form of an indicator ( icon or text ) , and a menu .
Clicking on an indicator will open its menu .
Keyboard navigation will always work , and left and right arrows will translate either into submenu navigation or flipping from indicator to indicator .
The whole set of indicators on the panel will be navigable as a single menu , in essence .
We wo n’t support “ right click ” on indicators differently from “ left click ” , and there ’ll be no ability for arbitrary applications to define arbitrary behaviours to arbitrary events on indicators .
Symbolic visuals .
We want to pare back the visual representation of status presented by the icons .
We do n’t believe that visual accessibility for the disabled need drive the design of the standard icon set , as there will be both alternative icons , renderings , and entirely different options such as speech or custom devices to handle those .
Colors on the indicators should have semantic purpose and be used mainly for alerts and awareness , while the shape of the icon should define its purpose .
The first part of our work was pure housekeeping .
The panel in Ubuntu is very generic , it lets you put all sorts of different gadgets in all sorts of different places , and those gadgets can behave in all sorts of different ways .
The result has been to stimulate innovation , but it has also made the panel very inconsistent and ultimately less useful .
We reviewed the way Ubuntu - specific applications were using the panel , and set out to clean them up .
Update - manager lost its persistent notification in favour of the more direct popup window .
Others will follow .
We decided to introduce a new gadget on the panel which would be a container for all the indicators which follow our new Ubuntu Ayatana pattern .
And we started work on a set of indicators that would fit inside that container .
Thus far , we ’ve done the session , “ me ” , and sound indicators .
We also created a framework for applications which want to display their own indicator .
That ’s the AppIndicators work , which has been fantastically lead in 10.04 LTS by Jorge Castro , coordinating with many upstreams to ensure that their applications feel tightly integrated into the panel .
The icon visual design turned into a conversation about “ - symbolic ” icons at UDS in Dallas , and is now being realised in the ubuntu - mono icon theme in 10.04 LTS .
There is work under way to make symbolic icons a more formal and rigorous construct that can be themed , and we ’ll participate in that effort or offer an alternative implementation .
9 parts perspiration , 1 part innovation
The detailed design of a large set of systemic indicators , together with the work to make them all look , feel and behave in a consistent fashion , has been substantial effort involving MPT , Ted Gould , Cody Russell and many others .
There ’s still a lot of work to do .
Conor Curran and Kalle Valo joined the team in this latest cycle .
There is a great deal that remains to be done .
We also aspire to introduce some new and innovative concepts .
Category Indicators
In order to reduce the number of indicators and improve the persistence and usefulness of the indicators that remain , we ’ve introduced the idea of “ category indicators ” .
These are indicators into which multiple , similar applications can embed themselves .
Instead of having a different indicator each application , we have one indicator for the whole category .
The messaging indicator , which aggregates awareness about many different types of messages from real people , is an example .
Instead of having three different icons for email , IM and Identi.ca or Twitter , Ubuntu has just one messaging indicator , which can make you aware of important messages in any of those applications .
The three default applications for those lines of communication all share the same indicator .
They are part of the same category .
There are custom API ’s for messaging applications which let them :
Insert entries in the messaging menu which are displayed even when the application is not running .
Useful for helping people go straight to the activity .
Instead of having to check if the email client is running , then switching to it or launching it , then going to the message composition window , I should * always * be able to compose a new message with just two clicks , regardless of whether or not the mail client is running initially .
Add custom menu entries to the messaging menu that are relevant to them .
Each applications gets a “ section ” in the category indicator menu , and they can add custom menu entries to their section .
Register themselves as applications that should be shown in the messaging menu , or remove themselves from that menu .
The default applications will show up there unless they are uninstalled or expressly configured not to use the messaging menu .
Other applications will put themselves there by default when they are run by that user , who can also configure them not to display there .
Show whether they are running , a state which is indicated with a small “ play ” style triangle next to the application icon in the menu .
There are also some behaviours which are collective across all the applications in the category .
For example , any of the applications can set the messaging indicator to an alert state , signalling that it ’s worth clicking on .
Each category indicator supports a unique API that ’s relevant for that category .
There are some common features , for example the ability of applications to register and de-register for the indicators and the ability to add menu entries , but the details might vary substantially from one category to another .
The underlying goal is to make it clearer to users “ what all of those icons are about ” .
There are fewer of them , and the ones that are there are more persistent – they are always there , and they always do the same sort of thing .
“ You ’ve got a message ” is useful no matter which channel the message came through .
The net result is that the whole set of indicators feels tighter and better defined .
The session indicator , which displays the shutdown / restart menu , has a similar capability that replaced the “ restart required ” panel icon in 10.04 LTS .
Since the session menu already contains the “ restart ” menu option , the session menu will now be set into an alert state when you need to restart .
The “ Restart … ” menu option is changed to “ Restart Required … ” ( though I would now prefer something like “ Restart , completing updates … ” ) .
The battery indicator shows the status of all of your batteries , from laptop to UPS to mouse and wireless keyboard .
Other applications and devices which have battery information should be able to insert themselves there appropriately .
Similarly , all the calendar and alarm applications might fit into the Clock Indicator .
And perhaps all the applications which have downloads might use a single category for that – there ’s some discussion along those lines on the Ayatana list at the moment .
Timelines and iterations
The basic “ add an indicator with a menu ” capability is there now , and was used for Application Indicators in 10.04 LTS .
What complicates the picture from a delivery perspective is our evolving understanding of how best to organise the category indicators .
For example , at the moment we are aggregating received messages in the messaging indicator , but the send or broadcast elements of those same communications channels are accessed through the Me menu , where we track presence .
That has been controversial – sensible folks think we should perhaps restructure that to bring the elements together .
Each arrangement of category indicators involves shaping the API ’s in new ways , because the categories are fundamentally different from one another , and we want to design custom indicators for each category .
Not only are the individual category indicator designs changing , but the arrangement of categories themselves is subject to active debate and experimentation , which is important to getting a crisp final result .
We ca n’t be certain that the current configuration is the best one , and want the flexibility to continue to evolve and reshape the APIs accordingly .
We expect it will take at least three iterations of Ubuntu to be certain , and that we can commit to ABI stability for 12.04 LTS onwards .

Greenwood High School is the place where students voted to have a graduation prayer , a judge said no , and then the school told speakers they would not screen their speeches beforehand .
The class president invoked the Christian god ( which she had a legal right to do ) .
The valedictorian , Eric Workman , talked about the importance of church / state separation .
Many of you have asked for a transcript of his speech .
I spoke with Eric and got a copy of it .
Damn …
This kid has body parts made of brass .
This is impressive :
Hello , everyone .
Tonight is a rather auspicious occasion , marking the closing of one door and the opening of several others .
The Greenwood Community High School Class of 2010 has experienced much together — our journey has encompassed seven years , four of which have established a foundation for the rest of our lives .
During these four years , some of us have found our niche in English , Foreign Language , Social Studies , Business , Physical Education , The Fine Arts , Mathematics , and / or The Sciences .
For me , I found my place in the latter .
Science never stops asking “ why ” until it has uncovered “ how ” and never stops asking “ how ” until it has determined “ why . ”
Science uses both logic and reason to assess the world around us — to explain and improve our relative universe .
Science is a product manifested from secular humanism ; it is devoid of delusion , ideological zealotry , and blind ignorance .
Science is , in essence , the purest form of intellect .
In addition to finding a passion for science , though , I also learned that taking a stand for principles far surpasses the respect , the acceptance , or the repudiation of anyone .
Thomas Jefferson once said , “ In matters of principle , stand like a rock . ”
I have never fallen short of President Jefferson ’s credo in this respect , as I am sure you are aware .
You may not agree with my decision to fight for civil liberties , but I expect you to respectfully listen while I elucidate .
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states , in part , that “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . ”
This implies that no entity , agent , or facet ( however subsidiary ) of the government is to ever endorse , promote , or encourage any form of religion or religious doctrine .
This , as you may or may not know , includes school - sponsored prayer .
In September of last year , our remarkably doltish administration called upon us all to vote in deciding whether or not we wanted the Constitution of the United States to be flagrantly violated .
Understanding the law and knowing right from wrong , I vehemently opposed such an atrocious act from ever taking place .
However , my one voice and the voices of others were shouted - down by most of you .
Our rights and the law were disregarded .
You see , subjecting government - endorsed prayer to a majority rule is , in and of itself , unconstitutional , let alone the government approbation of said prayer .
Founding Father Thomas Jefferson is quoted as having said , “ All , too , will bear in mind this sacred principle , that though the will of the majority is in [ most ] cases to prevail , that will to be rightful must be reasonable ; that the minority possess their equal rights , which equal law must protect , and to violate [ them ] would be oppression . ”
Individual freedoms were subjugated , the United States Constitution was omitted , and most of you were unfazed .
I , however , was fazed — I , however , took action to redress this grievance .
On March 11th , the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a lawsuit on my behalf to legally halt any and all school - sanctioned prayer at tonight ’s commencement ceremony .
On April 30th , Federal District Judge Sarah Evans Barker issued an injunction to do just that .
In her ruling , Judge Barker stated that “ the degree of school involvement ma[de ] it clear that [ any graduation ] prayer [ would ] ‘ bear the mark of the state , ’ and accordingly [ transgress ] the Constitution . ”
I solemnly hope that you all do understand that the Greenwood Community School Corporation had its hand in this from the beginning , that the Greenwood Community School Corporation thought ( and still likely thinks ) it was and is above the law , and that neither the Greenwood Community School Corporation nor any other government entity is above the law .
In challenging my lawsuit , the Greenwood Community School Corporation accrued a debt of legal fees and court costs to the ACLU , totaling approximately $ 18,000 .
For the School Corporation ’s legal representation , you can expect the debt to be exorbitantly greater .
It is rather unfortunate that Joe Farley and his Milquetoast myrmidons chose to allocate funds to battle , in futility , a precedent that has held firmly in law since its issuance from the United States Supreme Court .
These tens of thousands of dollars could have been better used to maintain the teaching positions being cut in the coming academic year due to a lack and administrative mismanagement of funds .
Nonetheless , $ 18,000 will be spent appropriately , helping the ACLU to further its mission to protect and defend freedom .
Now , before I leave you with your thoughts , I would like to thank and acknowledge those who have , above all , influenced and inspired me for the better .
Firstly and foremost , I thank my mother , Kathy , for believing in me and my abilities .
Her love , care , and guidance have been immeasurable assets in my journey through life thus far .
Secondly , I thank my sister , Tiffany , for being my rock in times of hardship .
She will never know how grateful I am to have her in my life .
Thirdly , I thank my grandparents , Richard and Betty , for providing me with the love and encouragement that enriches me , my life , and my future .
Their hearts have touched mine more than they know .
Fourthly , I thank Becky Kehler for shaping me into the scientist I am today — an individual who does not stop asking “ why ” until he has uncovered “ how ” and who does not stop asking “ how ” until he has determined “ why . ”
It was she who gave me both the unparalleled opportunity and vast resources necessary to thrive and prosper as a research scientist in High School .
Fifthly and finally , I thank Suzanne Schulz for teaching me to never compromise myself or my principles for anyone or anything .
Her candor and unyielding disposition have been hallmarks in shaping me and my outlook on the world .
Thank you for permitting me the chance to speak with you tonight .
It has been a pleasure for me and , hopefully , a teaching moment for you .
Before we part , though , I leave you with these words :
“ One ought never to turn one ’s back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it .
If you do that , you will double your danger .
But if you meet it promptly and without flinching , you will reduce the danger by half .
Never run away from anything .
Never ! ” — Sir Winston Churchill
Congratulations , Class of 2010 ; the best is about to begin !

Mobile phone use remains a cause of concern for some Using a mobile phone does not appear to increase the risk of developing certain types of brain cancer , the largest study of its kind has concluded .
Analysis of more than 10,000 people by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) found no relationship between years of use and risk .
There is no known biological mechanism by which mobiles could cause cancer , but there has been public concern .
It is hoped this study will allay some anxieties , as research continues .
The overall rate of brain cancer has not risen in countries where use has long been prevalent - like Sweden , and studies have mostly found no evidence of an increased risk .
This latest research is consistent with this .
The 20 m euro ( £ 17 m ) Interphone study , which received some funding from the mobile industry , involved more than 5,000 men and women from 13 countries who had been diagnosed with one of two types of brain cancer - glioma and meningioma - between 2000 and 2004 .
These cancers , both rare , were judged to be among the most likely to be influenced by phone use .
The patients were asked to record their mobile phone usage , and then the results were compared with adults of similar age , sex and background who did not have the disease .
Some had been using their phones for more than a decade , making this one of the longest - ranging studies to date .
Extreme results
In fact , most regular users - defined as people who made use of their phone at least once a week - appeared to have a lower risk of brain cancer than those who rarely used a phone .
The report authors stressed however this was unlikely to be down to any protective effect of phone use , and more a quirk of the study .
This is consistent with published biological studies , which have not established any effect of exposure to radiation from mobile phones at a cellular level nor found a mechanism by which cancer could be caused

But they also dismissed as problematic the finding that at the other extreme end of the spectrum those using the phone for the longest cumulative periods , more than 1,640 hours , appeared to have a higher risk , regardless of over what period of time this was spread .
This was as much as 40 % higher for glioma , and 15 % higher for meningioma .
Nearly 50 cancer patients reported using their phone more than five hours every day of the week , with 10 recalling that they had used it for 12 hours each day .
" It 's not impossible that people were using their phones for this long , but it is highly unlikely , " said Professor Anthony Swerdlow of the Institute of Cancer Research , which carried out one of the two UK arms of the study .
The report noted that people with brain tumours were more likely to overestimate the role of a potential risk factor , and that the disease interferes with memory and cognition , undermining the accuracy of the recollections of such extreme use .
Unlike lung cancer , where the risk rises the more cigarettes are smoked , this mobile phone data shows no increased risk until the very heaviest use begins .
This was also seen as casting doubt on the reliability of the reports .
" This study cannot answer whether there are long - term risks beyond fifteen years , nor would it have been able to pick up much , much smaller risks , " says Professor Swerdlow .
" But if there was a large and immediate risk we would have seen it .
" Whether it is worth doing more research , that is a question for society .
These are expensive studies , and there are many other things in the world that should be investigated .
" It is society which has to answer the question of how long you continue to investigate something that does not have a biological basis . "
There were however reports of some differences within the research team as to how best to interpret the data , and the authors do say that further analysis of long - term , heavy use is in order .
A prospective study was in fact launched last month to examine the long term effects of mobile phone use .
Cosmos , the cohort study on mobile communications , will recruit 250,000 and follow them for as long as 30 years .
The lobby group Mast was not assuaged by the Interphone findings , arguing that it wanted to see results for other cancers including salivary gland tumours and acoustic neuromas .

Photographers Holly Norris and Jes Sachse have collaborated to create ‘ American Able ’ , a searing satire of fashion photography and brand management .
Using the white backdrop , helvetica captioned kneester - hipsock formula of American Apparel ads , Norris and Sachse replaced the “ highly sexualized and generally thin [ models ] , and who appear to be able - bodied ” with Sachse herself .
Sachse is differently - abled .
The seriousness of the message is only matched by the sheer enjoyment Sachse has in front of the camera .
And why would n’t she be having fun as she plays actor , advocate , comedian and social commentator ?
Norris and Sachse point out that people with disabilities are usually cast as “ asexual ” and we routinely fail to examine the pervasive influence of imagery in mass media .
The ease with which Norris and Sachse strip away the facade of fashion photography is alarming .
If the use of the same playful and suggestive captions put alongside images of a woman – who is not the commonly seen shape – jolt us , could it be we harbor only expectations for the blandly - repeated female form ?

Following the remarkably high 60 percent back - end debt - to - income ratio for homeowners whose loans have been made “ permanent ” via the government ’s HAMP program as noted here a couple days ago come more scary statistics on the nation ’s housing market .
From Diana Olick ’s Loans Going Bad Faster
Than the Fixes comes word of how long the foreclosure process is being dragged out :
More than 31 percent of loans that have been delinquent for six months are not yet in foreclosure , while 22.8 percent of loans delinquent for 12 months have not been moved to foreclosure status …
More evidence of banks being hopelessly behind or not wanting to take market prices for REOs comes in California foreclosure starts rise nearly 20 % in February from the LA Times :
The number of properties scheduled for foreclosure sale also remained near record levels .
However , actual sales of foreclosure properties , whether back to the bank or those sold to third parties , dropped 11.9 % in February from the month prior .
Lastly , Paul Jackson at Housing Wire concludes that Housing Recovery is Spelled R-E - O after culling through yesterday ’s report from Lender Processing Services :
On average , severely delinquent borrowers have gone more than 9 months without making a mortgage payment — and yet foreclosure has not yet started for them .
For those borrowers who are in the foreclosure process , it ’s been an average of 13.6 months — more than one full year — since they last made any payment on their mortgage .
With this kind of data piling up , it ’s hard to get excited about the prospects for any sort of a near - term recovery .
Based on how the banks and the government are handling the problem , we ’re probably in for a housing market bottom that will take years to form .
Spanish climber Edurne Pasaban has just one more tough climb to make
Two of the world 's top female climbers are vying to become the first woman to conquer the world 's 14 highest mountains .
The rivals and their teams are each preparing to make an assault on their final peaks - and either could win .
Spanish climber Edurne Pasaban has just one more climb to make after scaling a deadly Himalayan peak on Saturday .
But her chief rival , South Korea 's Oh Eun-sun , is also on the slopes of her 14th mountain .
Competition between the two climbers is mounting in the final weeks of the race to scale all the world 's peaks higher than 8,000 m ( 26,250ft ) .
Climbing into history Pasaban climbed one of the most lethal Himalayan peaks , Annapurna , on Saturday , leaving her with just one more to scale to become the first woman to bag all the world 's 14 " eight - thousanders " .
The 36 - year - old Basque from northern Spain reached the top of the 8,091 m mountain alongside several other Spanish climbers , a spokesman for her team told AFP news agency .
Only Tibet 's daunting 8,027 m Shisha Pangma stands between her and a place in climbing history .
FIVE OF THE TOUGHEST Everest 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) K2 8,611 m ( 28,251ft ) Kangchenjunga 8,586 m ( 28,169ft ) Lhotse 8,516 m ( 27,940 ft ) Makalu 8,463 m ( 27,766ft )
However ,
Oh is now on the slopes of Annapurna , which would be her 14th and last summit .
But the 8,091 m peak is particularly dangerous , being both technically difficult and avalanche - prone .
It has a much higher death rate than Everest , the world 's highest peak .
Oh , 44 , is acclimatising at Base Camp Two on the mountain and expects to make an attempt on the summit on Saturday .
Oh currently seems to hold the advantage , although Annapurna , in Nepal , is the tougher climb .
It has claimed 130 lives and has already defeated the South Korean , when she was forced to turn back in fog and blizzards last year .
Pasaban , who is single and has no children , also knows all about Annapurna : she was defeated once before , in 2007 , when bad weather forced her and her team to turn back 1,000 m from the summit .
Oh Eun-sun ( L ) and Edurne Pasaban are neck - and - neck If Pasaban wants to seal her place in the record books , she must hurry back down Annapurna and across the border into Tibet to begin her assault on Shisha Pangma early next month .
She will travel to Tibet to make her attempt " over the coming days " , her spokesman said .
A third contender , Austria 's Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner , is to begin her climb of the world 's highest summit , Mount Everest , next week .
But she would still have to climb K2 , the world 's second highest peak , regarded as the most difficult and dangerous of the 14 summits , which all lie in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges in Asia .
Italy 's Reinhold Messner became the first man to climb all 14 mountains in 1986 .

" Connections . "
It 's an innocent - sounding word .
But it 's at the heart of some of the worst of Facebook 's recent changes .
Facebook first announced Connections a few weeks ago , and EFF quickly wrote at length about the problems they created .
Basically , Facebook has transformed substantial personal information — including your hometown , education , work history , interests , and activities — into " Connections . "
This allows far more people than ever before to see this information , regardless of whether you want them to .
Since then , our email inbox has been flooded with confused questions and reports about these changes .
We 've learned lots more about everyone 's concerns and experiences .
Drawing from this , here are six things you need to know about Connections :
Facebook will not let you share any of this information without using Connections .
You can not opt - out of Connections .
If you refuse to play ball , Facebook will remove all unlinked information from your profile .
Facebook will not respect your old privacy settings in this transition .
For example , if you had previously sought to share your Interests with " Only Friends , " Facebook will now ignore this and share your Connections with " Everyone . "
Facebook has removed your ability to restrict its use of this information .
The new privacy controls only affect your information 's " Visibility , " not whether it is " publicly available . "
Explaining what " publicly available " means , Facebook writes : " Such information may , for example , be accessed by everyone on the Internet ( including people not logged into Facebook ) , be indexed by third party search engines , and be imported , exported , distributed , and redistributed by us and others without privacy limitations . "
Facebook will continue to store and use your Connections even after you delete them .
Just because you can't see them does n't mean they 're not there .
Even after you " delete " profile information , Facebook will remember it .
We 've also received reports that Facebook continues to use deleted profile information to help people find you through Facebook 's search engine .
Facebook sometimes creates a Connection when you " Like " something .
That " Like " button you see all over Facebook , and now all over the web ?
It too can sometimes add a Connection to your profile , without you even knowing it .
Your posts may show up on a Connection page even if you do not opt in to the Connection .
If you use the name of a Connection in a post on your wall , it may show up on the Connection page , without you even knowing it .
( For example , if you use the word " FBI " in a post ) .
You can send Facebook your comments on the new Connections here .
Updated , May 5 : We changed Item # 6 to clarify how Facebook uses your post .
Is enough being done to protect the public from chemical pollutants ?
Watch " Toxic America , " a special two - night investigative report with Dr. Sanjay Gupta , Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN .
Washington ( CNN ) -- Rep. Edward Markey on Monday challenged the assertion by oil giant BP 's chief executive that no underwater oil plumes have formed because of the Gulf of Mexico spill .
Markey , D - Massachusetts , said in a letter to BP that scientific evidence showed such plumes have formed , and he asked for BP CEO Tony Hayward to provide evidence to back up Hayward 's claim Sunday that the oil had gone to the surface .
On Sunday , Markey , who heads the House Energy and Environment subcommittee , accused BP of issuing false statements about the spill .
" BP in this instance means ' Blind to Plumes , ' " Markey said in a statement Monday .
There was no immediate response from BP .
Full coverage of oil spill
In other developments , BP 's latest plan to cap the undersea well has been modified to collect more crude and to prepare for a possible hurricane , the company said late Monday night .
Also , the federal government ordered another 1,200 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico closed to fishing Monday , extending the restricted zone off Louisiana toward the coasts of Alabama and Mississippi .
The latest order from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration means about 26 percent of the Gulf is closed to fishing , up only slightly from 25 percent last week .
But it comes on the eve of the opening of the recreational fishing season for red snapper , a strong draw for sport fishing in the region .
The closure extends from north of Louisiana 's Chandeleur Islands , east along the three - mile offshore border between federal waters and Alabama and Mississippi state waters to just west of Gulf Shores , Alabama .
It follows NOAA forecasts that showed oil from the massive Deepwater Horizon spill spreading toward those states ' coasts later this week .
" Closing fishing in these areas is a precautionary measure to ensure that seafood from the Gulf will remain safe for consumers , " NOAA said in a statement announcing the decision .
The move is likely to be another blow to an already beleaguered fishing industry , which brings in billions of dollars to the Gulf states .
Early studies have estimated the economic damage from the spill could run as high as $ 1.6 billion .
i Report : Track the oil spill
Markey 's letter to BP said " the confirmation of the presence of large quantities of oil sub - surface could help to inform clean - up and response efforts , and it is vital that there is unfettered access to all relevant data or analysis . "
The letter noted that University of South Florida researchers recently reported finding a 22 - mile - long plume of dispersed oil .
In a separate letter Monday to BP , Markey called for complete transparency regarding video feeds of the company 's underwater operations .
BP is launching an effort to cut an opening to the leaking equipment so that a containment dome can be lowered on it .
" There can not be any delay or gaps in our understanding of this situation , given that thousands of barrels of oil are spewing forth each day into the Gulf , with catastrophic long - term consequences , " said Markey 's letter to BP America head Lamar McKay , adding : " BP should not be controlling the view the American public has of this disaster in our ocean . "
As the oil spill entered its 42nd day Monday , efforts to clean up coastal areas and develop a new plan of attack continued .
BP could try to cap a massive oil gusher again this week in an attempt to solve what the Obama administration has called " probably the biggest environmental disaster we 've ever faced in this country . "
All attempts at containing the crude gushing from BP 's undersea well have failed , including a " top kill " approach on which many had pinned their hopes .
BP said Sunday that it would strengthen its efforts to stop the flow and protect the coastline .
" As far as I 'm concerned , a cup of oil on the beach is a failure , " Hayward said in Venice , Louisiana .
Hayward said he was sorry for the spill and the " massive disruption " it has caused the Gulf Coast .
" There 's no one who wants this over more than I do .
I would like my life back , " Hayward said .
But he said the company has about 30 aircraft searching for signs of oil and has moved more than 300 people to offshore " floatels " to speed up its response time .
Up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil a day have been spewing out of the BP - owned undersea well since the late April sinking of the drill rig Deepwater Horizon .
BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. and oilfield services company Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster , which left 11 workers dead , but BP is responsible for cleanup under federal law .
" We 're disappointed the oil is going to flow for a while , and we 're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches , " BP Managing Director Robert Dudley said on CNN 's " State of the Union . "
Glossary of oil terms
Dudley said the next effort will involve placing a custom - built cap to fit over a piece of equipment called the " lower marine riser package . "
The process will involve cutting the riser package to create a clean surface to cap , Dudley said , and warm water will be circulated around the cap to prevent the freezing that hindered a previous dome - cap effort .
If successful , the procedure will allow BP to collect most -- but not all -- of the oil spewing from the well .
The long - term solution is the drilling of a relief well that will be in place by August .
" If we can contain the flow of the well between now and August and keep it out of the ocean , that 's also a good outcome as well , " Dudley said .
" And then , if we can shut it off completely with a relief well , that 's not a bad outcome compared to where we are today . "
On Sunday , the Obama administration questioned BP 's oil spill numbers .
Read more about numbers dispute
On NBC's " Meet the Press , " Carol Browner , Obama 's assistant on energy and climate change , said BP may have had an ulterior motive for underestimating the amount of oil leaking .
" BP has a financial interest in these numbers .
They will pay a penalty based on the number of barrels per day , " she said .
BP had originally said that about 5,000 barrels of oil per day were leaking .
The latest estimate , Browner said , is between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels per day .
More oil is leaking into the Gulf of Mexico than during any other spill in U.S. history , including the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska , according to the government .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
By fabricating ridges coated with silicon dioxide ( SiO 2 ) on the surface of a semiconductor , scientists from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST ) in Japan have shown how to extract light from a semiconductor with an extremely high efficiency .
The new technique could lead to the development of low - cost , ultra - high efficiency LEDs for lighting and display applications .
With the widespread use of LEDs , researchers estimate that global electricity consumption could be reduced by 10 % or more , which could save about $ 120 billion over the next 20 years .
As the researchers explain , the key to improving an LED ’s energy - conversion efficiency lies in extracting the light generated in the semiconductor with the highest efficiency possible .
However , the strong internal reflection in the semiconductor makes efficient light extraction very difficult , since light tends to remain inside the semiconductor .
Most techniques to improve the light extraction efficiency have high production costs , but finding a highly efficient , low - cost light extraction technique is essential for popularizing LED lighting .
The AIST researchers , XueLun Wang and Mutsuo Ogura , were able to design a semiconductor to take advantage of the effects of evanescent waves for improving light extraction efficiency .
As the scientists explain , evanescent waves are a special kind of light existing only near a reflection interface .
When two evanescent waves meet , they are efficiently transformed into light .
In their experiments , the researchers fabricated a GaAs / AlGaAs nanostructure with V - shaped grooves and even smaller ridges between the grooves .
They then deposited a 150 - nm - thick layer of SiO 2 onto the nanostructure .
This design enabled evanescent waves to form and couple at the semiconductor - SiO 2 and SiO 2 - air interfaces on flat planes at the tops of the ridges , resulting in an increase of the amount of light that could be extracted .
Photoluminescence studies revealed that the SiO 2 - coated semiconductor ’s light - emitting layer at the ridges was enhanced by a factor of 1.7 .
According to a press release , the light - extraction efficiency builds upon and exceeds the 50 % efficiency of a similar technique , although the exact efficiency of the current design is not mentioned .
In contrast , uncoated light - emitting semiconductor materials deposited on flat substrates only enable a few percent of the light generated in the semiconductor to be extracted ; for example , GaAs has only a 2 % efficiency .
One advantage of the new design is that it does n’t require any significant changes to the conventional LED fabrication process , which should keep fabrication costs low .
The method could also be used with other materials , such as indium tin oxide or zinc oxide as the coating , and AlGaInP - based and GaN - based semiconductor materials , which can be used to develop visible LEDs with ultra- high light extraction efficiency .

Apple 's new iPad reached one million sales last Friday , the day the iPad 3G launched , and just 28 days after the hardware was introduced on April 3 .
" One million iPads in 28 days — that 's less than half of the 74 days it took to achieve this milestone with iPhone , " said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO , in a statement released Monday .
" Demand continues to exceed supply and we 're working hard to get this magical product into the hands of even more customers . "
The company revealed that iPad users have already downloaded over 12 million apps from the App Store and over 1.5 million e-books from the new iBookstore .
There are also more than 5,000 new applications created specifically for the iPad , in addition to more than 200,000 applications on the App Store written for the iPhone and iPod touch .
The normally tight - lipped company has given numerous updates on sales figures for the iPad in its first month of availability .
The Wi-Fi-only model , released on April 3 , sold more than 300,000 in its first day alone .
Just 5 days after the iPad launched , Apple revealed that more than 450,000 were sold , and users had downloaded more than 3.5 million applications for the device .
In less than a week , the iPad sold more than a half - million in the U.S. alone .
Sales have been so strong that Apple was forced to delay the international launch of the device until late May .
Apple officials have said that they were caught off guard by unexpectedly strong sales of the iPad.
Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook said during the company 's quarterly earnings conference call that initial sales of the multi - touch device had " far exceeded " the company 's expectations .
Apple did not provide a breakdown of Wi -Fi-only vs. 3G sales , but one analyst revealed on Sunday that a survey of 50 stores revealed most were sold out of both models .
The poll found that the newly released iPad 3G was sold out at 49 of 50 surveyed retail stores by Sunday .
That led analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray to accurately predict that Apple sold more than a million iPads , and admit that his previous forecast of 1.3 million sales in the June quarter may be conservative .
Munster has forecast that the Wi-Fi iPad will be the best - selling model , taking 60 percent of sales , with the 3G - capable hardware and its $ 130 premium carrying 40 percent of overall sales .
COLOGNE , Germany -- Evgeni Malkin scored twice , and Russia beat Canada again at the world ice hockey championship , eliminating the Olympic champion with a convincing 5 - 2 win Thursday night .
Russia beat Canada in the last two world finals .
Together , they have won the title 49 times , and unbeaten Russia has an excellent chance at a record 26th this weekend .
In the semifinals , Russia will face host Germany , which beat Switzerland 1 - 0 thanks to Philip Gogulla 's goal midway through the second period .
" The way we play , only the best team will win , " Russia captain Ilya Kovalchuk said .
" But we feel good about ourselves and we have to be ready for the next game . "
The other semifinal on Saturday in Cologne will be Sweden against the Czech Republic .
Sweden beat Denmark 4 - 2 and the Czechs held off Finland 2 - 1 in a shootout .
Maxim Afinogenov , Pavel Datsyuk and Sergei Fedorov added the others for Russia in a showdown with Canada that featured big hits and a fair share of bad blood .
" They took some bad penalties and we took advantage of it , " Kovalchuk said .
Russia lost to Canada 7 - 3 in the Vancouver Olympics quarterfinals and retained 14 from that side .
Canada , however , had only Corey Perry from the gold - medal winners .
The Russians grabbed the lead with 57.6 seconds left in the first period .
Afinogenov 's slapshot was slowed by Canada goalie Chris Mason but not stopped .
Russia doubled its lead less than two minutes into the second on a power play with Datsyuk poking home from the right side after some fine passing .
The Canadians increased the pressure offensively in the second period but could not beat Russia goalie Semyon Varlamov .
The Russians finished off Canada with another power - play goal with 2:29 remaining in the second as Dmitri Kalinin fed Malkin for a shot through Mason 's legs .
Fedorov joined the scoring parade midway through the third , deflecting home Vitaly Atyushov 's slapshot from the blue line .
Canada finally got a consolation goal on a breakaway through John Tavares .
Malkin added an empty net goal with three minutes remaining and Matt Duchene hit one in with 14.1 seconds left .
In another rematch of the Olympic quarterfinals , and another reversal , goalie Tomas Vokoun saved 29 shots and forced two misses in a penalty shootout to lead the Czechs past Finland .
" It was a tough game , there were times when I was very nervous , " said Jaromir Jagr , who helped to lift the Czechs into their first semis since 2006 .
Sweden 's only loss in the tournament came against the Czechs .
Finland opened the scoring just 55 seconds in when Petri Kontiola streaked down the center of the Czech defense and beat Vokoun .
The Czechs were more dangerous in the second period but did not beat Finnish netminder Pekka Rinne until 1:12 into the third as Jakub Klepis blasted home from just inside the blue line .
Finland was unable to take advantage of a four - on - three power play midway through the 10 - minute overtime .
Lukas Kaspar and Jan Marek converted in the shootout for the Czechs but Jussi Jokinen missed right and Kontiola missed high to send the Czechs into the last four .
" The shootout is lots of times a matter of luck , " Vokoun said .
" I get some , and I miss some .
It 's a fun way to win , but a tough way to lose . "
In Mannheim , Marcus Nilson scored on the power play in the first period , Jonas Andersson made it 2 - 0 seven minutes into the second , and Rickard Wallin gave Sweden a 3 - 0 advantage with a short - handed goal five minutes later .
Jesper Damgaard trimmed the deficit to 3 - 1 50 seconds later for Denmark .
Late in the game , Linus Omark scored for Sweden and Morten Madsen added a goal for Denmark , both on the power play .
Same Interface , Different Strategies
StarCraft was released for the PC more than 10 years ago , at the end of March 1998 .
One of the Terran tutorial levels involved a simple survival objective of staying alive for several minutes against endless swarms of Zergling attackers .
The first time I played the game , it drew inevitable comparisons to Starship Troopers , a movie that had been released a few months earlier .
It sounds ridiculous today , but watching all of those Zerglings onscreen in the mandatory 640x480 glory looked fantastic .
Despite its graphical limitations , StarCraft has endured as a staple of the real - time strategy ( RTS ) , genre and is arguably the most important RTS of all time .
The game has sold about 10 million copies and has been outsold only by World of Warcraft and The Sims .
Can you even imagine spending serious time with any other game made over 10 years ago ?
Indeed , StarCraft endures .
The title spits in the face of the normal PC game life - cycle .
It has become a professional spectator sport in South Korea , with top players pulling in well over six figure annual earnings .
Somehow , this classic has transcended what a game is expected to be , and its developer ( Blizzard Entertainment ) has paid homage to the title with many updates over the years .
What makes StarCraft so popular ?
Is it the perfect balance of three incredibly different factions ?
Is the game some freak of nature , just complex enough to engage your interest , but not so involved that it turns off the masses ?
Can the game 's success even be duplicated in a sequel ?
There are too many variables for us to guess at this point , but there 's no doubt that StarCraft II has some very big shoes to fill .
Frankly , I 'd be happy with a graphical update of the old game and maybe some new single - player missions .
I 'm not even sure I 'd add new units , at the risk of messing with the magic .
But I 'm not Blizzard Entertainment , and Blizzard Entertainment is not content to merely duplicate the original .
StarCraft II is a very different game from its progenitor , and despite the similarities in the basics , you better scrap your old strategies because they 're probably not going to work .
For example , Terran Wraiths are gone and there are no more Terran air - to - air units that can cloak .
Protoss Dragoons are gone as well , and Zerg creep no longer grows out of most buildings and must be constantly replenished by overlords .
Also , an overlord is no longer able to see cloaked units .
There are a ton of new units with unique strengths and weaknesses .
Strategically , there are probably more differences compared to the original than there are similarities , and play styles will be affected to the core .
Nevertheless , the interface is the same and the title is unmistakably StarCraft .
If you walk into a room and glance at someone playing StarCraft II at the lowest resolution , you will probably assume they are playing the original and wo n't look twice .
However , as different as it is , StarCraft II feels so very comfortable .
The basics remain the same .
Terran players need supply depots and barracks , Zerg live in creep and spawn their units , and Protoss warp in their structures with drones .
Yes , there are some updates to the interface , but they serve only to make life easier and do not change the game .
StarCraft II shows you idle workers so you can direct them , and hallelujah , you can select much larger groups of units than the original game allowed you to select .
What about the graphics ?
Well , the game can handle 4:3 to 16:9 monitor aspect ratios .
Playing it at 2560x1600 is surreal if you have spent countless hours with the original at 640x480 .
Heck , the minimum available resolution is 1024x768 now .
Just do n't plan on zooming out to see massive sections of the map , because that 's not allowed .
The resolution has increased , but the size of the player 's view has not .
One window fits all , but players with a wide - screen monitor will see a little bit more of the periphery than someone playing on an older 4:3 screen .
You can zoom in to see the new units closer in glorious 3D , but you can't zoom out to have a look at the map as a whole .
The fidelity is beautiful and there are a lot of attractive effects .
Like the interface , though , the art direction was preserved intact .
Anyone who 's played the original is going to immediately know what a Terran , Zerg , or Protoss unit looks like , even if they 've never seen that unit before .
To summarize , you can expect StarCraft II to deliver a near - identical interface and art style compared to the original , with updated graphics .
On the other hand , the strategy has changed far more than I ever assumed it would .
Instead of adding a couple of new units to each faction , the developers have really changed the way StarCraft II is played compared to its predecessor .
Is that good or is that bad ?
As a player who relied on the simplicity of the original , I admit I 'm a little frightened of change .
But the game is undeniably fun , even in its beta form , and Blizzard Entertainment is treating the game with the respect and reverence it deserves .
What about performance -- that 's what you 're here for , is n't it ?
Blizzard Entertainment 's games are famous for their ability to work on older hardware .
Let 's see if StarCraft II fits in the same category .
I think you might find the results surprising .
Authorities have shut down a global social networking - like site where members traded child porn , talked about their fantasies and traded tips about not getting caught , according to the Department of Justice .
The investigation into the site is ongoing , the agency said , and it is working with police officials from several countries to try to find members who have n't been identified .
More than 50 people have been arrested around the world and 35 convicted since the 2008 start of the investigation , dubbed Operation Nest Egg , the Department of Justice said .
The members " participated in a sophisticated , password - protected Internet bulletin board group , which existed to allow members to meet like - minded individuals with a sexualized interest in children , to discuss that interest and to trade images of child pornography , " according to court documents .
At one point , the site had more than 1,000 active members .
" The individuals who participated in this Internet - based bulletin board exploited the most innocent and vulnerable in our society , " Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said .
The Department of Justice said the operation began by targeting 26 defendants who were charged in the Southern District of Indiana and then expanded to about 500 other individuals around the globe who were a part of the online group that was " dedicated to trading images of child pornography . "
Most of the people charged are accused of conspiring to advertise and distribute child pornography , along with substantive counts of advertising and distributing child pornography .
Officials said the inquiry led them to further investigate some people for sexual abuse of children .
" Numerous members of the Internet - based bulletin board were found to have been personally sexually abusing children , sometimes producing images of the sexual abuse , " the Department of Justice said in a statement .
The agency said the site 's lead administrator , Delwyn Savigar of the United Kingdom , was among them .
After his arrest , Savigar 's DNA led police to an unsolved sexual assault against a minor , the agency said .
Savigar eventually pleaded guilty to the charge .
The department said that after the one instance of assault was discovered , Savigar was linked to several other sexual assaults .
In total , Savigar pleaded guilty to abusing or attempting to abuse three minors .
He was sentenced to 14 years in prison .
Most Americans believe in a God who answers prayers but some say those prayers wo n't work unless you pray regularly and believe " certain things . "
Those were among the findings in a new USA TODAY / Gallup survey on prayer , timed to Thursday 's National Day of Prayer .
This year the NDP is a headliner due to a legal challenge and to lightening - rod - for - critics Rev. Franklin Graham , honorary chairman of the private evangelical National Day of Prayer Task Force .
Graham , booted off the prayer event platform planned for the Pentagon for insulting non-Christians , called out President Obama today .
He essentially dared the president to get Graham back on the Pentagon program or be seen as insulting Christians .
The White House did n't bite -- at least not yet .
Political and theological controversies aside , prayer is a deeply treasured practice for many believers .
The survey of 1049 adults , conducted last weekend , also asked some questions about what kinds of prayers are effective .
For some it only works if it's a regular practice : 19 % say " Prayer is effective only if a person prays regularly . "
Others say does n't have to be regular ( 14 % ) .
But most ( 60.8 % ) say how often you pray " has no impact " on whether your prayers will be effective .
The web site for the private " Task Force , " which is sponsoring National Day of Prayer events nationwide , claims that while God hears all prayers , you have to be a child of God -- a believer in salvation through Jesus -- for your prayers to be answered .
But most Americans do n't agree .
About 80 % say " prayer can be effective no matter what a person believes in " while only 14.5 % say it just works for " people who hold certain religious beliefs . "
In an interview Tuesday , Graham mocked Muslims and Hindus and said they " do not worship the same God I worship . "
Non-Christians are still very welcome to join in the Christian - only prayers at Task Force events or sponsor their own services , he said .
But he does n't think their prayers are heading the same place as his .
Do you agree ?
If you pray from the heart , does it matter what religion -- if any -- you claim ?
Choosing Your Government Service Provider
Tyler Cowen linked to an interesting Middle East peace proposal :
An even more radical idea has been put forward by Swedish diplomat Mathias Mossberg and UC - Irvine professor Mark LeVine .
They do not believe giving settlers Palestinian passports would solve anything .
The two propose creating overlapping states between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea , delinking the concept of state sovereignty from a specific territory .
There would be an Israel and a Palestine , but rather than divide the land , the two states would be superimposed on top of one another .
The plan would permit individuals to live where they wish and choose their political allegiance .
This , they argue , would resolve the seemingly intractable questions of how to divide the holy city of Jerusalem and whether to allow Palestinian refugees “ the right of return ” to their old communities .
Tyler thinks this polycentric order will deteriorate for lack of any credible means of resolving disputes .
For any law firm or arbitrator specializing in adjudicating these conflicts , it ’d be a tough market to enter .
Prejudice , bias , culture and a history of vengance–it ’s hard to see how an arbitrator could build trust on this foundation .
On a related note about overlapping jurisdictions in general , Arnold Kling writes :
The key , I think , is to transfer people ’s emotional attachment from their government to something else , like a religious sect , ethnic identity , or a sports team .
You can have Yankee fans and Red Sox fans living next door to one another without infringing on each others ’ rights .
It ’s when people give their emotional loyalty to government that you get friction .
For all sorts of reasons , it ’s very difficult to disentangle this emotional attachment , particularly when a perceived moral authority is tied to specific territory .
To separate church and state , it took a bloody century or two of reformation and counter - reformation in Europe , plus a mass migration of persecuted sects to North America .
Still , despite these difficulties , freedom of religion was established .
We now take it for granted that the moral authority of religion is non-territorial .
It took a little rule innovation by William Penn to get there , but the upshot is a workable polycentric religious order .
By analogy , I think a feasible polycentric legal order will only emerge in a market for governance .
People who migrate to a new place are much more likely to accept the rules of their destination than stationary folk who have long labored under the tired old ways .

Get Your Copy
As our 2010 Draft Prospects series winds up , it 's time to take a look at the other big story dominating the horizon for Columbus Blue Jackets fans - the ongoing search for a new head coach .
Since beginning interviews with current Maintoba Moose head coach Scott Arniel last Wednesday , GM Scott Howson has worked his way through the available candidates , getting a good look at four of the five men who might take over the bench .
Interestingly , the one who many CBJ faithful feel is the man with the inside track , former CBJ winger ( and current Portland Pirates head coach ) Kevin Dineen , seems to be the one man who has spoken the least about his look behind the curtain .
It may simply be that Dineen is the type who prefers to keep his cards close to the vest , but I do have to wonder about the situation when every other candidate interviewed to this point has been willing to give the Columbus media a few words on their experience , and what they hope to bring to the franchise , but Dineen was a simple " No comment . "
Howson 's other interviews this past week included current Red Wings assistant coach Paul MacLean on Tuesday , the 11th , and current interim head coach Claude Noel today .
The final candidate , Hamilton Bulldogs coach Guy Boucher , could be the hardest to get a hold of - with Montreal pushing their way into the Eastern Conference Finals after a dramatic game 7 stomping of the defending cup champions , and Hamilton kicking off the AHL's Western Conference finals tonight - even if Texas were to Sweep Hamilton , it 's doubtful that Boucher would be available to talk before the 24th at the earliest , assuming that Montreal did n't ask him to come up to assist with their push to the Stanley Cup finals before interviewing .
Howson has admitted to the Dispatch that he might well be looking for a coach into Late May - possibly even into early June .
Though there is the risk that other coaching vacancies might lure away other candidates the longer Howson waits on a decision , there is also the possibility that the delay could lead to the revelation of additional candidates , such as Montreal 's Kirk Muller .
In my personal opinion , I suspect that Boucher is a strong candidate , or GMSH would n't be admitting that the search will stretch out longer than he originally predicted .
Like most of the hockey world , he probably expected Montreal and Hamilton to both suffer early exits from the playoffs , allowing Boucher to be one of his first interviews .
( If anything , he probably expected to be waiting on MacLean . )
I 'm also not sold on the fan theories that it was Dineen 's job all along .
If that was the case , Howson would have interviewed Dineen , perhaps Arniel , and given Noel a show trial before holding the press conference and diving into the work of preparing for the upcoming draft .
Howson is really trying to search for the best man , and while his choices of candidates are excellent , they also make his job that much more difficult .
Every candidate he has interviewed brings success to the table - the only candidate to have not won a coach of the year award in the AHL , ECHL , or both would be MacLean , and he 's been the guy helping Mike Babcock take Anaheim and Detroit to the Stanley Cup Finals .
Every candidate has a wealth of experience in dealing with the pressures and struggles of a head coaching position at one level or another , and each has experience coaching a team to a championship series , if not a championship .
( The odd man out here is Arniel , who has yet to meet that milestone .
MacLean coached the UHL's Quad City Mallards to the Colonial Cup before joining Anaheim 's staff . )
The only real question is who will do the best job of taking the young talented core of the Blue Jackets and refine them into a true playoff contender ?
From that standpoint , I think Dineen and Boucher are the ones to watch .
Players like Ryan Getzlaf , Bobby Ryan , Jaroslav Halak , and P. K. Subban are demonstrations of how each can help a player achieve his potential .
Though Noel did a solid job clearing the decks and righting the ship after he stepped into the coaching position in February , it 's hard to say how much was his approach to the game , and how much was simply telling the team to relax .
Even Noel himself admits he will change things up if given the chance :
" When I took over , I wanted to provide clarity , " he said .
" I did n't want to add to the confusion .
It was n't a situation to go into and change things immediately .
" We needed to get certain guys going .
We needed to get the team back on the right path .
It was more about giving clarity to the group . "
If I'm Scott Howson , I 'd look at that quote with a mix of interest and concern - just what would he like to change ?
How would he be adjusting from the approach that he used in 2010 ?
Where does he see possible additions like Filatov or Matt Calvert in those changes ?
But at the same time , Noel 's strongest card going into these interviews is the work he delivered from behind the bench - and now he says that was n't really what he wanted to do , and now he can really show you something .
It 's certainly a gutsy move , but only time will tell if it pays off .
In the meantime , here 's a few other perspectives on the search to check out :

Some of the videos have developed a YouTube following .
The popular favorite is probably Amelia Downs , with more than 6,000 views for her video combining “ two of my favorite things : being a nerd and dancing , ” in which she performs a bar graph , a scatter plot , a pie chart , and a sine and cosine graph .
Image Matt Golden ’s YouTube video for Tufts University .
“ I tried tap dancing at first , because that ’s what I do most , but we only have a cheap digital camera , and the sound came out badly , ” said Ms. Downs , who is from Charlotte , N.C. “ My best friend filmed me , and we did each shot once or twice .
I did the editing in about an hour , and the computer crashed five times while I was doing it . ”
Still , Ms. Downs said she thought it was “ very cool ” that Tufts invited videos .
For a number of colleges , this is the year of the video , what with Yale ’s 16 - minute YouTube offering , “ That ’s Why I Chose Yale , ” a spoof of “ High School Musical , ” and “ Reading Season , ” a musical by admissions counselors at the University of Delaware .
Even without prompting , admissions officials say , a growing number of students submit videos .
Maria Laskaris , the dean of admissions at Dartmouth , noticed the trend last year , and said this year had brought even more videos , mostly showcasing music , theater or dance talents .
For Tufts , the videos have been a delightful way to get to know the applicants .
“ At heart , this is all about a conversation between a kid and an admissions officer , ” Mr. Coffin said .
“ You see their floppy hair and their messy bedrooms , and you get a sense of who they are .
We have a lot of information about applicants , but the videos let them share their voice . ”
Videos are genuinely optional , he said , so not having one does not count against a student — and a bad video would not hurt an applicant ’s admission chances “ unless there was something really disgusting . ”

Part 1 : Making Your Bomb
The heart of the successful H - bomb is the successful A - bomb .
Once you 've got your A - bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake .
All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they 'll start off a hydrogen - fusion reaction .
Step 1 : Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A - bomb .
When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart , it releases a tremendous amount of energy ( for its size ) , and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei , releasing more energy , in what is called a " chain reaction . "
( When atoms split , matter is converted into energy according to Einstein 's equation E=MC2 .
What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks ? )
There are two kinds ( isotopes ) of uranium : the rare U - 235 , used in bombs , and the more common , heavier , but useless U - 238 .
Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U - 235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be " enriched " to 90 percent U - 235 and only 10 percent U -238 .
Plutonium - 239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U - 235 .
Ten pounds of U - 235 ( or slightly less plutonium ) is all that is necessary for a bomb .
Less than ten pounds wo n't give you a critical mass .
So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle .
It is infinitely easy to steal ready - to - use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself .
And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds .
There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium ...
Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth , Ohio .
From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal .
Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U - 235 , and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment .
Conversion facilities exist at Hematite , Missouri ; Apollo , Pennsylvania ; and Erwin , Tennessee .
The Kerr - McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma -- where Karen Silkwood worked -- was a conversion plant that " lost " 40 lbs of plutonium .
Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel - fabricating plants like those in New Haven , San Diego ; or Lynchburg , Virginia .
( A former Kerr - McGee supervisor , James V. Smith , when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft , testified that " There were none of any kind , no guards , no fences , no nothing . " )
Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling , New York ; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin , Tennessee ; General Electric in Pleasanton , California ; Westinghouse in Cheswick , Pennsylvania ; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation ( NUMEC ) in Leechburg , Pennsylvania ; and plants in Hanfford , Washington and Morris , Illinois .
According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC .
Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it 's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants .
It is usually transported ( by air or truck ) in the form of uranium oxide , a brownish powder resembling instant coffee , or as a metal , coming in small chunks called " broken buttons . "
Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5 - inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums .
The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked " Fissible Material " or " Danger , Plutonium . "
A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth , Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego .
The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington .
A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public .
If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you 'll have to settle for commercial grade ( 20 percent U - 235 ) .
This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II , where security is even more casual than at commercial plants .
If stealing uranium seems too tacky , you can buy it .
Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $ 23 a pound .
Commercial grade ( 3 to 20 percent enriched ) is available for $ 40 a pound from Gulf Atomic .
You 'll have to enrich it further yourself .
Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass .
You 'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial - grade uranium .
( It 's only 20 percent U - 235 at best , and you need 10 pounds of U - 235 so ... )
But with a little kitchen - table chemistry you 'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you 've purchased into a liquid form .
Once you 've done that , you 'll be able to separate the U - 235 that you 'll need from the U - 238 .
First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide , converting it to uranium tetrafluoride .
( Safety note : Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass , so store it only in plastic .
Used 1 - gallon plastic milk containers will do . )
Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride , the gaseous form of uranium , which is convenient for separating out the isotope U - 235 from U - 238 .
To get the hexafluoride form , bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride .
Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical - supply firms .
Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine , the classic World War I poison gas .
Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood ( the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors ) .
If you 've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching .
In the old horse - and - buggy days of A - bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes , tubes , and membranes , until the U - 235 was eventually separated from the U - 238 .
This gaseous - diffusion process , as it was called is difficult , time - consuming , and expensive .
Gaseous - diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $ 2 - billion each .
So forget it .
There are easier , and cheaper , ways to enrich your uranium .
First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure .
You can use a bicycle pump for this .
Then make a simple home centrifuge .
Fill a standard - size bucket one - quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride .
Attach a six - foot rope to the bucket handle .
Now swing the rope ( and attached bucket ) around your head as fast as possible .
Keep this up for about 45 minutes .
Slow down gradually , and very gently put the bucket on the floor .
The U - 235 , which is lighter , will have risen to the top , where it can be skimmed off like cream .
Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium .
( Safety note :
Do n't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket .
Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room .
This will prevent the premature build - up of a critical mass . )
Now it 's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form .
This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium ( available in tablet form from your drugstore ) into each bucket of uranium .
The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride , a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal .
( Safety note :
Even though it is a salt , keep it away from your kitchen 's spice rack . )
A few precautions :
While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you 'll be handling , if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron , the kind you can buy in dental supply stores .
Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known .
If inhaled , a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs , a painful way to go .
Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer .
If eaten , plutonium is metabolized like calcium .
It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells .
The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it .
If this is too difficult , wear a mask .
To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule : never make an A - bomb on an empty stomach .
If you find yourself dozing off while you 're working , or if you begin to glow in the dark , it might be wise to take a blood count .
Prick your finger with a sterile pin , place a drop of blood on a microscope slide , cover it with a cover slip , and examine under a microscope .
( Best results are obtained in the early morning . )
When you get leukemia , immature cells are released into the bloodstream , and usually the number of white cells increases ( though this increase might take almost 2 weeks ) .
Red blood cells look kind of like donuts ( without the hole ) , and are slightly smaller than the white cells , each of which has a nucleus .
Immature red cells look similar to white cells ( i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus ) .
If you have more than about 1 white cell ( including immature ones ) to 400 red cells then start to worry .
But , depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb , a short life expectancy might not be a problem .
The State is Illegal By Its Own Standards
A number of recent news items point to a disturbing trend : the Prussianization of American culture .
One of the peculiarities of the increasingly militarized culture of Prussia / Germany under Bismarck ’s reich was that civilians became second - class citizens .
It was common practice for citizens to step off the sidewalk and into the gutter to make way for anyone in uniform .
We ’re seeing the same tendency in the United States , as the respective rights of officials and ordinary citizens becomes increasingly a matter of status or caste rather than universal law .
For example , the state ’s functionaries expect us to live under non -stop video surveillance .
But they bristle ( to say the least ) when their own misbehavior is recorded by people like us who are supposed to be taking the orders and liking it .
Although they meet with uneven success ( at least on the occasions when someone actually has the nerve and resources to fight it out in the judicial system ) , the reflexive impulse of functionaries everywhere is to criminalize any recording of their actions .
In one school system , students who recorded a teacher going ballistic and yanking a desk out from under a kid who refused to stand for the national anthem were suspended for ten days .
In another , where students managed to capture a gym coach via cell phone camera stealing money out of lockers , the coach was eventually arrested .
But the school administrators ’ immeidate reaction was , not to apologize for the thieving coach , but to wring their hands over the violation of school policy involved in recording him .
Now consider that in Pennsylvania ’s Lower Merion school district , school adminstrators were able to remotely activate webcams built into laptops issued to students and spy on them ; one student was actually disciplined for “ inappropriate behavior in his home ” !
In another illustration of the “ one law for the lion and one for the lamb ” principle , RateMyCop.com , a sort of Angie ’s List for local police , attracts a lot of ire from police forces around the country .
You know , the same people who ’re always reassuring us that “ if you ’ve done nothing wrong , you ’ve got nothing to fear . ”
It ’s been met with particular hostility and even official investigation by prosecutors in some local jurisdictions , like Tempe , Arizona , because it ’s supposedly a violation of the cops ’ privacy rights — even though no addresses , phone numbers , or other identifying information besides name and serial number is listed .
After all , you know how seriously the folks in Arizona take personal privacy issues , right ?
Finally , a federal judge has ruled that RateMyCop is protected by the First Amendment , upholding a lawsuit by someone who was prosecuted in a Florida jurisdiction for posting comments to the site .
But while it ’s an uphill battle to subject these alleged public servants to any kind of transparency , oddly enough it ’s quite common for newspapers to print the names of people arrested by the local police .
That ’s arrested — not convicted of a crime .
Apparently the privacy and safety of an ordinary citizen count for nothing .
Final example : a video of a drug raid in Missouri ( courtesy of Radley Balko ) , in which the SWAT team terrorized a family , fired their weapons repeatedly in front of their screaming children , and killed the family pets — all over possession of a small amount of marijuana .
The parents were charged with — wait for it — endangering their children .
This sort of thing is nothing new .
If the law were consistently enforced , for example , it would be impossible to carry out sting operations .
After all , it ’s illegal for an ordinary citizen to solicit illegal acts from another citizen .
If the law applied to everyone equally , it would be illegal for a cop to attempt to buy drugs or solicit a prostitute .
Interestingly , when the first professional police forces were created ( Robert Peel ’s eponymous “ bobbies ” ) , they were understood simply to be salaried functionaries exercising the same posse comitatus rights possessed by the ordinary citizen .
Some vestigial remnant of the concept is preserved in the almost nonexistent practice of citizen ’s arrest .
But that was then .
We ’ve had 150 years of Prussianization since then .
P.J. Proudhon wrote “ What is Property ? ” to demonstrate that , among other things , “ property is impossible . ”
In other words , the statist version of property — artificial property rights — was rendered absurd and untenable by its own internal contradictions .
By the same token , we may say that statist legality is impossible .
It can not be consistently enforced without destroying itself .

Thus begins the ancient parable :
If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it , does it make a sound ?
One says , “ Yes it does , for it makes vibrations in the air . ”
Another says , “ No it does not , for there is no auditory processing in any brain . ”
If there ’s a foundational skill in the martial art of rationality , a mental stance on which all other technique rests , it might be this one : the ability to spot , inside your own head , psychological signs that you have a mental map of something , and signs that you do n’t .
Suppose that , after a tree falls , the two arguers walk into the forest together .
Will one expect to see the tree fallen to the right , and the other expect to see the tree fallen to the left ?
Suppose that before the tree falls , the two leave a sound recorder next to the tree .
Would one , playing back the recorder , expect to hear something different from the other ?
Suppose they attach an electroencephalograph to any brain in the world ; would one expect to see a different trace than the other ?
Though the two argue , one saying “ No , ” and the other saying “ Yes , ” they do not anticipate any different experiences .
The two think they have different models of the world , but they have no difference with respect to what they expect will happen to them ; their maps of the world do not diverge in any sensory detail .
It ’s tempting to try to eliminate this mistake class by insisting that the only legitimate kind of belief is an anticipation of sensory experience .
But the world does , in fact , contain much that is not sensed directly .
We do n’t see the atoms underlying the brick , but the atoms are in fact there .
There is a floor beneath your feet , but you do n’t experience the floor directly ; you see the light reflected from the floor , or rather , you see what your retina and visual cortex have processed of that light .
To infer the floor from seeing the floor is to step back into the unseen causes of experience .
It may seem like a very short and direct step , but it is still a step .
You stand on top of a tall building , next to a grandfather clock with an hour , minute , and ticking second hand .
In your hand is a bowling ball , and you drop it off the roof .
On which tick of the clock will you hear the crash of the bowling ball hitting the ground ?
To answer precisely , you must use beliefs like Earth ’s gravity is 9.8 meters per second per second , and This building is around 120 meters tall .
These beliefs are not wordless anticipations of a sensory experience ; they are verbal - ish , propositional .
It probably does not exaggerate much to describe these two beliefs as sentences made out of words .
But these two beliefs have an inferential consequence that is a direct sensory anticipation — if the clock ’s second hand is on the 12 numeral when you drop the ball , you anticipate seeing it on the 1 numeral when you hear the crash five seconds later .
To anticipate sensory experiences as precisely as possible , we must process beliefs that are not anticipations of sensory experience .
It is a great strength of Homo sapiens that we can , better than any other species in the world , learn to model the unseen .
It is also one of our great weak points .
Humans often believe in things that are not only unseen but unreal .
The same brain that builds a network of inferred causes behind sensory experience can also build a network of causes that is not connected to sensory experience , or poorly connected .
Alchemists believed that phlogiston caused fire — we could simplistically model their minds by drawing a little node labeled “ Phlogiston , ” and an arrow from this node to their sensory experience of a crackling campfire — but this belief yielded no advance predictions ; the link from phlogiston to experience was always configured after the experience , rather than constraining the experience in advance .
Or suppose your English professor teaches you that the famous writer Wulky Wilkinsen is actually a “ retropositional author , ” which you can tell because his books exhibit “ alienated resublimation . ”
And perhaps your professor knows all this because their professor told them ; but all theyre able to say about resublimation is that its characteristic of retropositional thought , and of retropositionality that its marked by alienated resublimation .
What does this mean you should expect from Wulky Wilkinsen ’s books ?
Nothing .
The belief , if you can call it that , does n’t connect to sensory experience at all .
But you had better remember the propositional assertions that “ Wulky Wilkinsen ” has the “ retropositionality ” attribute and also the “ alienated resublimation ” attribute , so you can regurgitate them on the upcoming quiz .
The two beliefs are connected to each other , though still not connected to any anticipated experience .
We can build up whole networks of beliefs that are connected only to each other — call these “ floating ” beliefs .
It is a uniquely human flaw among animal species , a perversion of Homo sapiens ’s ability to build more general and flexible belief networks .
The rationalist virtue of empiricism consists of constantly asking which experiences our beliefs predict — or better yet , prohibit .
Do you believe that phlogiston is the cause of fire ?
Then what do you expect to see happen , because of that ?
Do you believe that Wulky Wilkinsen is a retropositional author ?
Then what do you expect to see because of that ?
No , not “ alienated resublimation ” ; what experience will happen to you ?
Do you believe that if a tree falls in the forest , and no one hears it , it still makes a sound ?
Then what experience must therefore befall you ?
It is even better to ask : what experience must not happen to you ?
Do you believe that Élan vital explains the mysterious aliveness of living beings ?
Then what does this belief not allow to happen — what would definitely falsify this belief ?
A null answer means that your belief does not constrain experience ; it permits anything to happen to you .
It floats .
When you argue a seemingly factual question , always keep in mind which difference of anticipation you are arguing about .
If you ca n’t find the difference of anticipation , you ’re probably arguing about labels in your belief network — or even worse , floating beliefs , barnacles on your network .
If you do n’t know what experiences are implied by Wulky Wilkinsens writing being retropositional , you can go on arguing forever .
Above all , do n’t ask what to believe — ask what to anticipate .
Every question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation , and that question of anticipation should be the center of the inquiry .
Every guess of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation , and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations .
If a belief turns deadbeat , evict it .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Scientists in China have demonstrated how arsenic -- a favorite murder weapon in the Middle Ages -- destroys deadly blood cancer by targeting and killing specific proteins that keep the cancer alive .
Blood samples are pictured in a French laboratory in this July 15 , 2008 file photo .

“ Our study showed how arsenic directly targets these proteins and kills them , ” lead researcher Zhang Xiaowei at the State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics in Shanghai , China , told Reuters .
“ Unlike chemotherapy , the side effects of arsenic ( in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia ) are very low .
There is no hair loss or suppression of bone marrow ( function ) .
We are interested in finding out how arsenic can be used in other cancers , ” Zhang said by telephone .
Well known for its toxicity , arsenic was regarded in the past as the king among poisons because its symptoms are like those of cholera and can often go undetected .
In China , however , it has long served a dual purpose .
Apart from intentional poisoning , it has been used for at least 2,000 years in traditional Chinese medicine .
In 1992 , a group of Chinese doctors reported how they used arsenic to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , a blood and bone marrow cancer that has surprisingly high cure rates of over 90 percent in China .
However , the actual workings of arsenic and how it interacts with cancer tissues has never been clear -- until Zhang and his colleagues used modern technology to find out .
In a paper published in the journal Science , Zhang and his team , which includes Health Minister Chen Zhu , described how they used modern equipment and saw how arsenic attacked specific proteins that would otherwise be keeping the cancer alive and well .
“ This shows how Western technology can be used to find out about the mysteries of Chinese medicine , ” Zhang said .
“ Although many countries are now using arsenic to treat APL , some countries are resistant to the idea .
It depends a lot on whether doctors recommend it and whether patients accept it . ”
In APL , there is a drop in the production of normal red blood cells and platelets , resulting in anemia and thrombocytopenia .
The bone marrow is unable to produce healthy red blood cells .
Until the 1970s , APL was 100 percent fatal and there was no effective treatment .
“ The clinical result of arsenic in treating APL is well - established .
More than 90 percent of APL patients in China have ( at least ) five years of disease - free survival , ” Zhang said .
In a separate commentary in Science , Scott Kogan at the University of California San Francisco Cancer Center wrote that proper case selection and combination therapy with arsenic may lead to improved outcomes for treating not only promyelocytic leukemia , but other diseases as well .
“ If so , an ancient medicine , revived through careful clinical and biological studies in modern times , will have an even greater impact on human health , ” wrote Kogan , who was not linked to the Chinese study .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) on Monday issued the first congressional subpoena of the Obama administration .
It ’s rare for Congress to subpoena an administration controlled by the same party and , in doing so , Lieberman followed through on a threat he made last week .
The senator , an Independent who caucuses with Democrats , has increasingly become a thorn in the side of the administration .
He has accused the administration of stalling a congressional probe into the November shootings at Fort Hood , Texas , saying the departments of Defense and Justice have turned down four requests for documents over the course of five months .

Last week Lieberman said he would take the White House to court over the issue of whether to share information about the murders , allegedly committed by Maj.
Nidal Hasan .
“ We regret there was no change in position , ” Lieberman said on a conference call with reporters .
“ We have signed and are serving subpoenas today . ”
Acting as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , Lieberman issued the subpoenas after a noon deadline came and went with no resolution .
The subpoenas were issued to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton Holder The Hill 's Campaign Report : Biden on Trump : ' He 'll leave ' l GOP laywers brush off Trump 's election remarks l Obama 's endorsements Obama endorses Warnock in crowded Georgia Senate race The Hill 's Campaign Report : Trump 's rally risk | Biden ramps up legal team | Biden hits Trump over climate policy MORE .

“ Unfortunately , it is impossible for us to avoid reaching the conclusion that the departments simply do not want to cooperate with our investigation .
It is with great disappointment and reluctance that we have directed service of subpoenas to you which demand disclosure of the requested information . …
We fully expect that your departments will fulfill their legal obligation under these subpoenas and comply by the appointed time . ”
“ Obviously , we ’re open to discussions before then , but we think our request is quite reasonable , ” Lieberman told reporters on Monday .
Senate Democratic leaders had hoped Lieberman and White House officials would be able to resolve the dispute without legal action , but neither side backed down over the weekend .
The Pentagon has been concerned that releasing the information requested by Lieberman ’s committee would jeopardize the integrity of the military justice process and the criminal prosecution of Hasan .
Instead , senior Pentagon legal experts indicated that the Department of Defense has tried to offer the panel alternatives , particularly with regard to Hasan ’s personnel file and potential witnesses in his trial .
Pentagon officials said they tried to provide the committee with the names of people in the chain of command , who would not be potential witnesses , but would have pertinent information .
The panel rejected that .
Additionally , because of privacy concerns , the panel that traditionally has jurisdiction to look into military personnel files is the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Eight members of the Homeland Security Committee are also on that committee , including Lieberman and Collins .
The Pentagon made the offer to view the personnel files through Armed Services , but Lieberman and Collins have not requested to view the documents as part of their Armed Services membership , the Pentagon officials said .
“ We will continue to cooperate with the committee in every way , with that single caveat that whatever we provide does not impact our ability to prosecute , ” said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman .
“ The Department has and continues to cooperate with Congress while ensuring the integrity of both our own investigation as well as the criminal investigation and prosecution of Nidal Hasan . ”
The Pentagon can say no to the subpoena , but would likely try to engage Congress in trying to work out alternatives , officials said .
If the Pentagon does not comply with the subpoena , Congress can ultimately issue articles of contempt , the officials noted .
Lieberman and Collins notified the Pentagon on March 23 of their subpoena threat .

Lieberman has described the murders as a potential act of terrorism because Hasan had been in contact with Islamic clerics and may have acted out of opposition to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
The administration has maintained that a congressional inquiry into the shootings would jeopardize the criminal case against Hasan , and has launched its own review of the incident .
Lieberman on Monday rejected that claim anew , saying that he and Collins plan no specific hearings to publicize the information .
He also repeated his claim that the committee has held previous oversight hearings that did not affect a criminal prosecution .
Lieberman , who left the Democratic Party after losing a Senate primary in 2006 , has had a tempestuous relationship with his former party .

Asked last week if his subpoena threat exemplifies a further rift with Democrats , or if his chairmanship could be jeopardized anew , Lieberman said he simply felt responsible to push the administration into compliance with his committee .
“ This is so different in the sense that this is really about carrying out what I see as my responsibility as a committee chair to obtain information to complete an investigation , ” he said .
“ To me , that ’s different from taking a position on an issue on which I may disagree with the Democratic Party .

A local college student was shot in the ankle over the weekend after she refused to give her phone number to a guy on the street .
The student was leaving a party with a group of friends on early Sunday morning when the man shot her for rebuffing his sexual harassment .
As she told Fox 5 :
He told my cousin that he was gonna shoot at us if i did n’t give him my number , and then he started shooting . . .
I thought somebody kicked me in my leg , like , it was a lot of us running , so I thought somebody kicked me .
I did n’t know it was a gunshot .
The bullet is still lodged in her ankle .
Women who are harassed on the street have two options :
1 . Be nice .
Do what they want .
Laugh nervously at their jokes .
Surrender your phone number .
Endure an increasing amount of sexual harassment .
Get labeled a tease when you eventually turn down a date / refuse sex / do n’t answer the phone call / otherwise fail to please the stranger who is harassing you .
2 . Be dismissive .
Ignore the stranger ’s advances .
Refuse to surrender your phone number .
Tell him you ’re not interested .
Endure an increasing amount of vitriol for turning the guy down .
Get labeled a bitch immediately .
Which path do you choose ?
The college student chose to be dismissive ; she got shot .
But remember what can happen to you when you choose to be nice :
After being stalked and then cornered in an empty Metro parking garage early in the morning , Emily Ruskowski eventually agreed to give the man her phone number .
Then he groped her breast and attempted to enter her car .
The bitch - or - tease decision is made necessary by the pervasiveness of casual street harassment that can quickly escalate into a serious threat .
I would talk about how easily unwanted sexual advances can turn into angry , violent advances , but in reality , the two scenarios are often indistinguishable from one another .
When a man demands the phone number of a woman who is obviously uninterested in him , or when he propositions a lesbian couple that is obviously uninterested in him , or when he reaches out to grope a woman who is obviously uninterested in him , he is just as threatening as the man who intimidates a person into surrendering her wallet , or screams homophobic slurs at a lesbian couple , or exerts physical violence over his victim .
The difference is that the first category of advances is explained away as innocent consequences of a runaway libido and the victims ’ mixed messages ; the second category is recognized as unacceptable violence .
Sexual harassment is harassment ; sexual assault is assault .
If you do n’t want to contribute to a culture of street harassment the moves a man to shoot a woman who wo n’t go out with him , then do n’t cat - call , do n’t ogle , do n’t ask for a number , do n’t grab , and do n’t follow .
Stop tasking women with the potentially dangerous decision of how to let a guy down easy .
What 's right with this picture ?
One week ago : Chelsea FC celebrates in style with the Premier League Trophy they Earned by virtue of being the Premiership 's top squad over the 38 - game regular season .
Picapp
Both scenes shown here see the best team over a long season being recognized for its performance .
Other than that they do n't seem to have much in common .
In the NHL the captain of the best team receives the President 's Trophy from the Vice President ( go figure ) in what amounts to a glorified photo op , but nobody seems to give much of a shit about it .
In football ( soccer to heathens in the readership :) the trophy gets awarded directly after the clinching game and celebrated in grand style by players and fans alike .
This scene at Stamford Bridge was / will be repeated in numerous countries across Europe and around the world , whereas the empty ceremony in the Verizon Centre is pretty much unique to the NHL and the marketing genii who run it .
There are a lot of lessons which hockey could draw from the Beautiful Game .
One of these is the heavy emphasis put on their regular season .
The teams in the Football Association do play off for the FA Cup which is somewhat equivalent to the Stanley Cup , and it's a big deal ...
Saturday 's FA Cup Final is the last " fixture " of the season , and will be played in front of a packed house at Wembley Stadium .
But the Cup is not the Only big deal ; in fact , it 's not even the biggest deal .
Winning the league over a gruelling ~ 9 - month schedule is the ultimate prize , at least within one 's own country .
" The table does n't lie " is how the Brit announcer put it with the usual economy of words as Chelsea was nailing down the title with a comprehensive 8 - 0 thrashing of Wigan last Sunday .
The table does n't lie .
The standings reveal who has been the best over the long season .
Is n't that worth at least a small celebration , Alex ?
You guys done good .
Instead , you wo n't even look at the darn thing because it 's " not the one we want " , and in the process heap the pressure of expectations that much higher on the postseason .
The NHL was n't always like this .
In the Original Six the regular season champion received the Prince of Wales Trophy , and teams really tried to win it .
There were two , sequential prizes at stake , one for the season , one for the postseason .
For one thing there was money on the line , meaningful money given the salaries of the day .
But more than that , there was honour in winning the league as well as the playoffs .
After 1967 the Prince of Wales was still awarded for regular season excellence but only to the winner of the Eastern Conference , while the Clarence Campbell Bowl was awarded to the equivalent in the west .
There was no trophy for first overall .
Then in 1982 the two existing trophies were suddenly awarded for winning the conference finals , making three postseason trophies and none at all for the regular season .
In 1985 , perhaps in response to the suggestion of at least one activist fan ;) , John Ziegler introduced the President 's Trophy to again recognize the first overall team as the Prince of Wales had decades earlier .
For whatever reason it has not regained anywhere near the same mystique .
The players , the teams , the league itself downplay the darn thing as if the regular season does n't really matter that much .
( These guys pride themselves on their marketing acumen , but on some issues it 's hard to imagine them stuffing their heads any further up their holes . )
In soccer the ultimate goal within the national leagues is to win " The Double " , copping both the League and the Cup , as Chelsea will try to do for the first time in their long history tomorrow .
Surely in hockey the objective should be the exact same ?
In fact there is a long history of teams doing just that .
Regardless of the name , or even the presence , of the trophy , regardless of the emphasis placed on winning it , the cream will rise to the top of the standings many more years than not .
One has to accept that sometimes the standings do lie , especially in Gary Bettman 's NHL with its " free lunch " points system and its unbalanced schedule ( although nobody seems to mind that the playoffs are entirely unbalanced , with no two teams ever facing a common opponent ! )
No matter the small inequalities , it takes a very good team to win ~⅔ of its games over the long season and finish atop the standing .
It takes a different sort of very good team to win four consecutive playoff series over two months .
It takes a great team to do both .
Whatever flaws in the recognition system , the results of every season are a matter of record .
So for the purpose of discussion let 's recognize the first overall team as champions in their own right and see what we can find out .
In the 84 years and 83 seasons - thanks again , Gary !
- that have been played since the NHL assumed control of the Stanley Cup , the same team has won both the League ( first overall - tiebreaker rules applied as necessary ) and the Cup on 37 occasions .
Almost half of those seasons ended with absolutely no argument as to who was the best team in the league , cuz they had both titles .
To me that is the sign of a dominant team .
Moreover , multiple championships of both types over a series of years are a sure sign of a dynasty team ; the process of including President 's Trophies and equivalent effectively doubles the database for assessing such matters .
Details after the jump .
One might suppose it was more common for a team to win both back in the days of the Original Six .
That 's true , but barely .
In the 41 seasons before expansion , 19 teams completed the double ; in the 41 full seasons since , 18 more teams have done the same .
The distribution by decade shows the feat is gradually becoming more rare over the past 20 years as the league has swollen to 30 members :
( Late 1920s - 1 - Ottawa )
1930s - 3 - Detroit 2 , Boston
1940s - 5 - Boston , Detroit , Montreal 2 , Toronto
1950s - 7 - Detroit 4 , Montreal 3
1960s - 5 - Montreal 4 , Toronto
1970s - 6 - Boston , Montreal 4 , Philadelphia
1980s - 5 - NY Islanders 2 , Edmonton 2 , Calgary
1990s - 2 - NY Rangers , Dallas
2000s - 3 - Colorado , Detroit 2
Every major dynasty in the NHL is represented , most of them with multiple entries .
The Montreal Canadiens achieved the double an astonishing 13 times , all in a 36 - year span from 1943 - 79 , with a distinct dynasty in each decade .
Detroit Red Wings have 9 doubles over an interval twice as long - 72 years - featuring 3 different , widely - spaced powerhouses .
The Bruins have done it three times , the Leafs , Islanders and Oilers twice each , 6 other teams once .
Two teams have achieved the double in 3 consecutive seasons , or more accurately only one franchise has done it , two separate times .
The Habs of 1957 - 60 and 1975 - 78 both dominated the regular season and playoffs for three years running .
The Red Wings of the early 50s won two in a row , three in 4 years , four in 6 .
Only two other teams - the 1935 - 37 Red Wings and the 1980 - 82 Islanders - have ever posted double doubles .
Of course doubles are just one proxy for dominance .
The two doubles by the recent Wings represent just a fraction of their overall winnings : over the great career of Nick Lidstrom the Wings have won 10 major championships , including 6 President 's Trophies and 4 Stanley Cups .
The combination of the two numbers reveal the Wings ' true dominance over the past decade and a half ; no other team has won more than 4 titles in the same span ( Colorado , with two of each ) .
Because it effectively doubles the data set I like to include regular season championships when considering the great teams .
To me they are more revealing than Lowetide 's eminently - interesting " pennants " , because my method includes both regular season and playoffs , with both open to the entire league .
A super team can win both , whereas no matter how dominant , it can win just one conference title in a year .
There are therefore always two different pennant winners , each winning their half of the league , and only in the playoffs .
A dynasty team will win one title or the other in years they are not sweeping both .
By coincidence most of the super teams seemed to have about a 7 - year run atop the NHL , so let 's use that interval as our standard :
Team Period 1st OV Cups Titles Detroit 1948 -55 7 4 11 Montreal 1955 -62 6 5 11 Montreal 1972-79 4 5 9 Montreal 1964-71 3 5 8 Edmonton 1983-90 3 5 8 NY Islanders 1978 - 83 * 3 4 7 Toronto 1944-51 1 5 6 Detroit 2001-08** 4 2 6
This list includes every team that 's won 5 Cups in 7 years , as well as those remarkable Red Wing squads that won 7 straight Prince of Wales Trophies .
Montreal fans might cry foul that their squad of the late 50s actually won 5 Cups in a row , not " just " 5 in 7 , but fear not , those Habs carried on winning first place for two more years and wind up in a dead heat with the Detroit powerhouse that immediately preceded them with 11 titles over a 7 - year span .
*
The Islanders did all their winning in just 5 years but won enough to get included on this list .
**
The modern Red Wings , meanwhile , lost one season to lockout in the midst of their run .
Other impressive runs over shorter spans include these :
1950s Canadiens - 9 in 5 years
1950s Red Wings - 7 in 4 years
1970s Canadiens - 7 in 4 years
1980s Islanders - 7 in 5 years
1980s Oilers - 7 in 5 years
1930s /40s Bruins - 6 in 4 years
1940s Canadiens - 6 in 4 years
1920/30s Canadiens - 5 in 5 years
1940s Leafs - 4 in 3 years
1960s Leafs - 4 in 3 years
1990s Red Wings - 4 in 4 years
1990s Penguins - 3 in 3 years
In each case the team won at least one title in each year of the string .
The Habs of 1927 - 32 are a good example of a team that was likely better than people realize : they won back to back Cups in ' 30 and ' 31 , but won first place for the two years preceding that and again the year following for a very nice little streak of 5 years with a title .
Meanwhile , both the Bruins and Habs of the 1940s won a couple of Cups apiece , but in each case those titles were mounted on a rock - solid foundation of 4 consecutive Prince of Wales Trophies leaving little doubt they were by far the best teams of those short eras .
A couple of first place finishes add a little credence to even temporarily strong teams like the Flames of the late 80s or the Stars of the late 90s .
Both won the President 's Trophy two years running , then added the Stanley Cup the second year .
Which in my view makes them more impressive teams than one - off Stanley Cup champs like the '06 Hurricanes * spits * or the '07 Ducks * spits again * .
I was no big fan of the Flames or Stars either , but both teams earned my respect by being dominant for a couple of years as opposed to a couple of months .
There 'll be no double champion in 2009 - 10 , as the President 's Trophy winners from Washington were shocked in the first round of the playoffs .
Only the awesome Red Wings of 2007 - 08 have accomplished the feat in the last 8 years , er , 7 seasons .
It 's an open book as to whether this is a temporary variation from the norm or whether the divergence is real because each of the two championships is becoming more of a crapshoot every year .
But dammit , Alex , you and your team ( and your league ) should have celebrated the one title you did win , without it diminishing in any way your desire for the other .
Would n't the best possible outcome be Two parties ?

The Supernova Cosmology Project ’s Union2 compilation and reanalysis of decades of supernova surveys from the world ’s leading researchers , with the addition of six high - redshift supernovae , puts new bounds on possible values for the nature of dark energy .
Einstein ’s cosmological constant comfortably fits the data , but there ’s still plenty of room at the top for dynamical theories .
The international Supernova Cosmology Project ( SCP ) , based at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , has announced the Union2 compilation of hundreds of Type Ia supernovae , the largest collection ever of high - quality data from numerous surveys .
Analysis of the new compilation significantly narrows the possible values that dark energy might take — but not enough to decide among fundamentally different theories of its nature .
“ We ’ve used the world ’s best - yet dataset of Type Ia supernovae to determine the world ’s best - yet constraints on dark energy , ” says Saul Perlmutter , leader of the SCP .
“ We ’ve tightened in on dark energy out to redshifts of one ” — when the universe was only about six billion years old , less than half its present age — “ but while at lower redshifts the values are perfectly consistent with a cosmological constant , the most important questions remain . ”
That ’s because possible values of dark energy from supernovae data become increasingly uncertain at redshifts greater than one - half , the range where dark energy ’s effects on the expansion of the universe are most apparent as we look farther back in time .
Says Perlmutter of the widening error bars at higher redshifts , “ Right now , you could drive a truck through them . ”
As its name implies , the cosmological constant fills space with constant pressure , counteracting the mutual gravitational attraction of all the matter in the universe ; it is often identified with the energy of the vacuum .
If indeed dark energy turns out to be the cosmological constant , however , even more questions will arise .
“ There is a huge discrepancy between the theoretical prediction for vacuum energy and what we measure as dark energy , ” says Rahman Amanullah , who led SCP ’s Union2 analysis ; Amanullah is presently with the Oskar Klein Center at Stockholm University and was a postdoctoral fellow in Berkeley Lab ’s Physics Division from 2006 to 2008 .
“ If it turns out in the future that dark energy is consistent with a cosmological constant also at early times of the universe , it will be an enormous challenge to explain this at a fundamental theoretical level . ”
A major group of competing theories posit a dynamical form of dark energy that varies in time .
Choosing among theories means comparing what they predict about the dark energy equation of state , a value written w .
While the new analysis has detected no change in w , there is much room for possibly significant differences in w with increasing redshift ( written z ) .
“ Most dark - energy theories are not far from the cosmological constant at z less than one , ” Perlmutter says .
“ We ’re looking for deviations in w at high z , but there the values are very poorly constrained . ”
In their new analysis to be published in the Astrophysical Journal , “ Spectra and HST light curves of six Type Ia supernovae at 0.511 < z < 1.12 and the Union2 compilation , ” the Supernova Cosmology Project reports on the addition of several well - measured , very distant supernovae to the Union2 compilation .
The paper is now available online at http://arxiv4.library.cornell.edu/abs/1004.1711.
Dark energy fills the universe , but what is it ?
Dark energy was discovered in the late 1990s by the Supernova Cosmology Project and the competing High - Z Supernova Search Team , both using distant Type Ia supernovae as “ standard candles ” to measure the expansion history of the universe .
To their surprise , both teams found that expansion is not slowing due to gravity but accelerating .
Other methods for measuring the history of cosmic expansion have been developed , including baryon acoustic oscillation and weak gravitational lensing , but supernovae remain the most advanced technique .
Indeed , in the years since dark energy was discovered using only a few dozen Type Ia supernovae , many new searches have been mounted with ground - based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope ; many hundreds of Type Ia ’s have been discovered ; techniques for measuring and comparing them have continually improved .
In 2008 the SCP , led by the work of team member Marek Kowalski of the Humboldt University of Berlin , created a way to cross-correlate and analyze datasets from different surveys made with different instruments , resulting in the SCP ’s first Union compilation .
In 2009 a number of new surveys were added .
The inclusion of six new high - redshift supernovae found by the SCP in 2001 , including two with z greater than one , is the first in a series of very high - redshift additions to the Union2 compilation now being announced , and brings the current number of supernovae in the whole compilation to 557 .
“ Even with the world ’s premier astronomical observatories , obtaining good quality , time - critical data of supernovae that are beyond a redshift of one is a difficult task , ” says SCP member Chris Lidman of the Anglo - Australian Observatory near Sydney , a major contributor to the analysis .
“ It requires close collaboration between astronomers who are spread over several continents and several time zones .
Good team work is essential . ”
Union2 has not only added many new supernovae to the Union compilation but has refined the methods of analysis and in some cases improved the observations .
The latest high -z supernovae in Union2 include the most distant supernovae for which ground - based near - infrared observations are available , a valuable opportunity to compare ground - based and Hubble Space Telescope observations of very distant supernovae .
Type Ia supernovae are the best standard candles ever found for measuring cosmic distances because the great majority are so bright and so similar in brightness .
Light - curve fitting is the basic method for standardizing what variations in brightness remain : supernova light curves ( their rising and falling brightness over time ) are compared and uniformly adjusted to yield comparative intrinsic brightness .
The light curves of all the hundreds of supernova in the Union2 collection have been consistently reanalyzed .
The upshot of these efforts is improved handling of systematic errors and improved constraints on the value of the dark energy equation of state with increasing redshift , although with greater uncertainty at very high redshifts .
When combined with data from cosmic microwave background and baryon oscillation surveys , the “ best fit cosmology ” remains the so - called Lambda Cold Dark Matter model , or ΛCDM .
ΛCDM has become the standard model of our universe , which began with a big bang , underwent a brief period of inflation , and has continued to expand , although at first retarded by the mutual gravitational attraction of matter .
As matter spread and grew less dense , dark energy overcame gravity , and expansion has been accelerating ever since .
To learn just what dark energy is , however , will first require scientists to capture many more supernovae at high redshifts and thoroughly study their light curves and spectra .

SAN JOSE , Calif . --
Rather than complain about getting shafted by the schedule maker , the Detroit Red Wings were eager to start the next round of the playoffs .
The feeling is that momentum compensates for short rest , so playing San Jose on Thursday , just two days after
, was not a concern .
" I like the quick turnaround .
Let 's get at it right away , '' forward Todd Bertuzzi said .
" Obviously , they 're a tough opponent .
We 've had some really good games against them .
It 's going to be another tough task . ''
The NHL was forced to start the series Thursday because HP Pavilion is hosting concerts by the Eagles on Friday and Saturday .
Asked about the challenge of making a quick turnaround , Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said , " It 's way better than the challenge of not playing . ''
He also noted that having two days off before Game 2 on Sunday will help his team re-energize .
The Sharks will have had three days off after eliminating Colorado on Sunday .
" They 're well - rested , '' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" Hopefully , the emotion of Game 7 carries over for us . ''
Another day or two off would have been more important if the Red Wings had any injuries .
" Against Pittsburgh last year ( in the Stanley Cup finals ) , we were n't that healthy ( going in ) , we could have used a few extra days , '' Dan Cleary said .
" It 's the playoffs , we 're going to be ready , we got momentum .
" ( Tuesday ) was n't a hard game .
For a period and a half , it was hard .
The rest of it was pretty easy for a playoff game . ''
That enabled Babcock to trim the minutes of some top players in the third period .
" It helped late in the game not to be forced to protect the lead and play your top players , '' Lidstrom said .
" They had a chance to rest .
That 's good when you 're moving on . ''
But eagle - eyed Brian Lear , 77 , has finally put an end to the mystery after he noticed a striking similarity between the spooky shot and a girl in a postcard which appeared in his local paper .
Three people have suffocated to death as a result of a fire in Marfin Bank during ongoing battles between anti-measure protesters and police in Athens .
The Athens protest march marking the zenith of the general strike called for the 5th of May was attended by an approximate 200,000 ( 20,000 which is the foreign broadcast number referring to the PAME march alone ) , although because of lack of media coverage due to the media participation in the general strike no concrete estimates can be made .
After the PAME ( Communist Party union ) protesters left Syntagma square , the first lines of the main march started arriving before the Parliament with the first clashes erupting at the end of Stadiou street .
The march then walked on the Unknown Soldier grounds leading the Presidential Guard to retreat , and attempted to storm the Parliament but was pushed back by riot police forces which today demonstrated a particularly staunch attitude and resolve against the demonstrators .
Soon battles erupted around the Parliament with protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks , with one riot police armored van torched , and the police responding by extended use of tear gas that soon made Athens ’ atmosphere unbearably acrid .
As more blocks reached Syntagma square , the battles spread across the city center and lasted for more than five hours .
During the clashes several state buildings were set ablaze including the County Headquarters of Attika .
At the time of writing the Ministry of Finance is reported to be on fire , and vital tax documents as destroyed by the raging fire .
However the strange thing is that it is the fourth floor of the building that is burning , at a height inapproachable to petrol bombs .
The building is in danger of total collapse .
According to news reports that began at 14:00 Greek time after , under pressure by the events , most radio and TV stations decided to break their strike , claim that the fire at Marfin Bank ’s Stadiou street branch that has led to the death of three workers ( one a pregnant woman ) was started by protesters .
However this remains an unsubstantiated claim .
A similar case three decades ago had originally put the blame for the fire at Kappa - Marousi building on Panepistimiou street , leading to the death of several people inside , to anarchists , while its was later proved the fire was caused by tear gas fired by the police .
A video of the fire - brigade trying to evacuate the building can be seen in http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8661385.stm
After the tragic death of the three workers made the round of Athens , new clashes started to spread in the Greek capital , with a large crowd gathered outside the burned bank when Marfin 's boss tried to visit the site .
Clashes broke out between the crowd and police when the former attacked the bank magnate accusing him of forcing the dead workers to scab on a general strike and locking them in the building despite them demanding to evacuate it since 12:00 .
In Parliament the Communist Party of Greece has accused the government for the deaths , claiming it was a result of agents provocateur fascist groups .
The claims of the Communist Party are based on the fact that 50 fascists tried to enter the PAME demo bearing the flags of the union earlier in the morning .
The fascists were spotted , chased and sought refuge behind riot police lines .
Accusing the extreme - right as being behind the deaths , the Coalition of Radical Left has declared in Parliament that the government cannot pretend to be in grief for the loss of life , as it has been attacking human life by all means possible .
Meanwhile , extended clashes broke out in Salonika where approximately 50,000 people marched destroying dozens of banks and corporate shops in Greece ’s second largest city .
Clashes with the police continued for several hours .
According to news broadcasts anarchist have occupied the Labour Center of the city .
In Patras , around 20,000 protesters were joined by tractor drivers and garbage truck drivers on their vehicles , as flaming barricades were erected along central streets of the city and clashes developed between protestors and the police .
In Ioannina the protesters attacked banks and corporate shops leading to extended use of chemicals by the police .
In Heraklion , 10,000 people are reported as marching against the measures .
In Corfu , protesters taking part in the anti-measures march occupied the County Headquarters .
Protesters have occupied the Administrative Headquarters of Naxos and the City Hall of Naoussa .
As a result of the Athens riots , the police have cordoned off the entire center of the city , erecting check points of entry and exit , while all police work permits have been recalled .
At the time of writing battles continue to rage in the inner city , while news broadcasts claim the police is mobilising its forces to storm an anarchist squat in Exarcheia .
I understand that there might be a good reason for Intel to add virtualization extensions to their CPU architecture .
Instead of fixing the x86 architecture to ( optionally ) make it Popek - Goldberg compliant and have all critial instructions trap if not run in Ring 0 , they added non -root mode , a very big hammer that allows me to switch my CPU state completely to that of the guest and switches back to my original host state on a certain event in the guest .
Well , it ’s a great toy for people who want to play with CPU internals .
Therefore Intel had to add the VMCS , a 4 KB block in memory that holds the complete CPU state of both the host and the guest ( segment registers , GDT and IDT pointer , certain MSRs etc. ) as well as some control bits ( for example , when to exit ) .
I also understand that Intel does n’t allow me to just read and write memory in the VMCS , but abstracts accessing the virtualization state using a vmread / vmwrite interface .
This way , the actual layout of this 4 KB page is an implementation detail and can be changed on later CPUs .
It also allows for field indexes that are more spread out and encode what kind of field it is .
So I understand very well why Intel encodes into the VMCS field index whether it ’s a control field ( 0 ) , a read - only field ( 1 ) , part of the guest state ( 2 ) or part of the host state ( 3 ) , and whether it ’s a 16 bit ( 0 ) , 32 bit ( 2 ) , 64 bit ( 1 ) or native - sized ( 3 ) field .
This way , for example , all 16 bit guest state fields ( like the guest ’s CS ) have indexes starting at 0x0800 , and all 64 bit host state fields ( like the hosts ’s EFER MSR ) start at 0x2C00 .
Now what I do n’t understand is what is so hard to be consistent with this convention ( Intel Manual 3B , Appendix H ) .
VMCS Link Pointer ( 0x2800 ) :
In the first revision of VT , it had already been already decided that there should be a mechanism for having a second 4 KB page in case later versions of VT need more than 4 KB of state .
For this , there is there “ VMCS Link Pointer ” , which is a 64 bit physical address .
Guess what category this belongs to ?
Guest state .
( 0x2800 ) : In the first revision of VT , it had already been already decided that there should be a mechanism for having a second 4 KB page in case later versions of VT need more than 4 KB of state .
For this , there is there “ VMCS Link Pointer ” , which is a 64 bit physical address .
Guess what category this belongs to ?
Guest state .
“ Guest Address Space Size ” bit in the “ VM Entry Controls ” Field ( 0x4012 ) :
This is clearly guest state and not a control field .
( 0x4012 ) : This is clearly guest state and not a control field .
“ Host Address Space Size ” bit in the “ VM Exit Controls ” Field ( 0x400C ) :
This is clearly host state and not a control field .
( 0x400C ) :
This is clearly host state and not a control field .
VMX - preemption timer value ( 0x482E ) :
This timer controls after how many ticks execution of the guest should end and control should be returned to the hypervisor .
Intel put this into the “ guest state ” bucket :
All other guest state fields are properties of the i386/x86_64 architecture that need to be switched , but not this one .
This should really be a control field .
And here is another favorite of mine : the “ Primary Execution Controls ” field .
The 32 bits specify which events in the guest will exit guest execution and trap into the hypervisor ( Table 21 - 6 ) .
These events are , among others :
exit on HLT
exit on INVLPG
exit on MOV CR3
exit on PAUSE
Setting these bits to 1 enables the traps .
So if you set all bits to 0 , you basically have an unrestricted guest , and if you set all bits to 1 , you have the most controlled guest , and you get a notification about every event in the guest .
Or so you might think .
Actually , there are two bits in the field that do n’t work like this :
Use MSR bitmaps
Use I/O bitmaps
If these bits are set to 1 , it checks a whitelist whether a certain MSR or I/O access is possible .
If they are set to 0 , all MSR and I /O accesses trap .
Compared to all other bits , that ’s backwards .
Oh great .

The six - foot - long babies of the world 's biggest shark species , Carcharocles megalodon , frolicked in the warm shallow waters of an ancient shark nursery in what is now Panama , report paleontologists working at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the University of Florida .
" Adult giant sharks , at 60 - 70 feet in length , faced few predators , but young sharks faced predation from larger sharks , " said Catalina Pimiento , visiting scientist at STRI and graduate student at the University of Florida .
" As in several modern shark species , juvenile giant sharks probably spent this vulnerable stage of their lives in shallow water where food was plentiful and large predators had difficulty maneuvering . "
Paleontologists from the Smithsonian and the University of Florida collected more than 400 fossil shark teeth from Panama´s 10 - million - year - old Gatun Formation as part of ongoing work to reveal the origins of this narrow land - bridge that rose to connect North and South America about 3 million years ago .
" The 28 teeth that we identified as C. megalodon were mostly from neonates and juveniles , " said Pimiento .
Researchers used reference collections at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History and the Florida Museum of Natural History to characterize the teeth .
" Very little is known about the life cycle of this giant shark that ruled the oceans not so long ago .
Now we think that the young spent their first years close to the coast among mangroves , " said STRI staff scientist Carlos Jaramillo , who heads the Canal excavation project .
The team discarded several other explanations for the concentration of small teeth at the site .
Before their discovery in Panama , two other fossil beds have been proposed as paleo - shark nurseries : the Williamsburg Formation from the Paleocene and the Oligocene Chandler Bridge Formation , both in the U.S. state of South Carolina .
The sandy soils of the Gatun Formation have been used for years to make cement .
Soon these outcrops will be exhausted .
Scientists continue to race against the clock to find out more about the ancient inhabitants of the region .
These results , generated with funds from the U.S. National Science Foundation , are published online in the journal PLoS ONE .
Your Cincinnati Reds have qualified for the 2020 Major League Baseball playoffs .
Go ahead , read that sentence again .
Read it aloud .
Savor it .
Enjoy it .
It has been seven long years since the Reds had an opportunity to play for post - season glory .
Seven years filled with letdowns and disappointments and tears and , well , you get the picture .
It has n’t been much fun , right ?
But when the Reds take the field in Atlanta on Wednesday , they will have the opportunity to exercise some demons .
And not just seven years worth , either .
It ’s been a full quarter - century since the Reds advanced in the playoffs .
Many of my devoted readers are n’t old enough to remember the last time a Reds team won a playoff series , a sweep of the Dodgers in the 1995 NL Division Series .
That many years of futility ca n’t be erased just by finishing two games over .500 and grabbing the seventh seed in a funky new playoff system .
No , the Reds have to advance in the playoffs if they hope to get that particular monkey off their collective backs .
But as I told you last week , there is every reason to believe that the Reds will finally break the curse and win some games that actually mean something .
In order to advance to this year ’s Division Series , the Reds will have to get past the Braves , NL East champions and the No. 2 overall seed in the National League .
Atlanta is an excellent baseball team , but if I could hand - pick which of the top - four seeds I wanted the Reds to play , it ’d be the Braves .
And not entirely for baseball - related reasons .
The 1995 Reds might well have been the best team of my lifetime .
Barry Larkin was at the height of his powers , winning the NL Most Valuable Player award .
Reggie Sanders might even have been better that year ( .306/.397/.579 , 28 HR , 99 RBI ) .
The Reds had the best offense in baseball , Pete Schourek almost won a Cy Young Award , and Davey Johnson was the best skipper in the league .
Why am I discussing a team from 25 years ago ?
Because a sweep at the hands of the Braves in the 1995 NLCS sent this Cincinnati franchise into a tailspin from which they ’ve never recovered .
Would n’t it be perfect symmetry for the Reds to finally win another post - season series by defeating Atlanta ?
As we begin to analyze the 2020 series against Atlanta , I detect yet another note of symmetry .
In 1995 , the Reds had the best offense in the league but were ushered out of the post - season by a brilliant Atlanta rotation , featuring Greg Maddux , Tom Glavine , and John Smoltz .
As Michael Scott might say , “ Well , well , well .
How the turn tables … ”
You already know about Cincinnati ’s dominant rotation , led by Trevor Bauer , Luis Castillo , and Sonny Gray .
Permit me to introduce you to Atlanta ’s offense that may very well be the best in all of baseball .
First baseman Freddie Freeman just might win the NL MVP award after a season in which he hit .341/.462/.640 with 13 homers and 23 doubles .
But he may not even be the best hitter on his own team !
Ronald Acuña Jr. , possibly the most exciting young player in baseball , has been outstanding this year ( .250/.406./581 with 14 home runs ) , and Marcell Ozuna ( .338/.431/.636 , 18 home runs ) is making the case that he should be one of the premier free agents available after this season .
Let ’s not forget our old friend Adam Duvall , who has crushed 16 homers of his own in a comeback season .
On the pitching side , well , the picture for Atlanta is n’t quite so rosy .
The bullpen led by Mark Melancon , Tyler Matzek , and Shane Greene has been rock solid .
Among the starters , Max Fried is a 26 - year - old future star and , though he suffered an ankle injury in early September , expect him to be as good as any pitcher the Reds have faced this year .
Rookie Ian Anderson has been very good in six starts but , well , he ’s a rookie and it ’s only been six starts .
Otherwise , the rotation has been plagued by injury and inconsistency .
Mike Soroka and Cole Hamels are on the injured list and wo n’t return .
No other Atlanta starter has an ERA below 5.21 .
One thing to watch :
The Braves gave up fewer runs via the home run than any team in baseball .
As you are no doubt aware , the Reds are extraordinarily reliant on the home run ; no team in baseball scored fewer runs on hits other than longballs .
These are two teams that do n’t have a lot of similarities , which should result in an entertaining best - of - 3 series .
You have to like Cincinnati ’s chances .
Look at it from the Braves perspective .
If the Reds can win game one behind NL Cy Young - favorite Bauer , the Braves will have to win back - to - back games that will be started by two pitchers ( Anderson and Wright ) who both qualify as rookies this year .
And those youngsters will be facing two 2019 All - Stars , Luis Castillo and Sonny Gray .
Also note that Bauer and Gray have made 11 post - season starts in their careers .
None of the Braves pitchers have started even one .
But there ’s another reason why Reds fans should be confident about this opening series .
After the Reds clinched a spot in the post - season , Joey Votto was asked about this team .
He began by saying that he likes this team better than the previous playoff teams on which he played .
But then he said this : “ I think we ’re a f-ing nightmare , and I think everybody knows that .
I ca n’t wait . ”
This team has struggled through tough times .
They kept the faith when everyone around them doubted , and they seem to have come out the other side stronger for it .
They appear to be peaking at the right time , and they also have more swagger than I ’ve seen from a Reds team in many , many years .
Maybe that ’s just a convenient narrative .
There are certainly a boat - load of likable players on this Reds roster , and they definitely seem to enjoy playing with each other .
But none of that will matter if the Reds pull a classic Cincinnati flameout in the first round .
On the other hand , this is still the team that was expected to be among the best in the league before the season , except now they ’ve gone through the wars together .
The Reds have a lot going for them , as noted by one analyst who said , “ This team should terrify the National League . ”
The Reds have been giving their fans nightmares at this time of the year for a quarter of a century now .
Would n’t it be nice if , just this once , the Reds gave those bad dreams to the rest of the league ?
ICC World Twenty20 semi-final , St Lucia :
Australia 197-7 ( 19.5 ovs ) bt Pakistan 191 -6 ( 20 ovs ) by three wickets
Match scorecard Hussey rescued Australia with one of the greatest Twenty20 innings ever seen
By Jamie Lillywhite
Mike Hussey hit an exceptional unbeaten 60 from 24 balls as Australia beat Pakistan by three wickets to set up an ICC World Twenty20 final with England .
Pakistan made a huge total of 191 - 6 in St Lucia , with Kamran Akmal making 50 and his brother Umar blasting four sixes in an unbeaten 56 from 35 balls .
Cameron
White hit five sixes in 43 from 31 balls but Australia seemed out of it needing 70 from the final five overs .
Yet Hussey 's three sixes in the last over sealed it with a ball to spare .
It was the third highest winning run chase in Twenty20 internationals and arguably one of the greatest finishes to any match .
Few sides would have got close to the defending champions ' total , which was the joint second - highest of the tournament , having lost so many wickets .
606 : DEBATE Australia , how did they do that ?
Never write off the green and gold .
See you in the final , England .
It should be a cracker !
Linebreaker Michael Clarke 's side must have thought the match had slipped from their grasp when Steve Smith was the seventh wicket to fall and 48 was still needed from 17 balls .
But , as has happened so often before , the Australians found a saviour in the hour of their greatest need .
The 34 - year - old Hussey , known as Mr Cricket to his team - mates , hit six sixes in all to steer his side to an amazing victory and set up a mouthwatering final against their Ashes rivals on Sunday .
The Australians will look to improve their performance in the field , which had been unusually ragged having won the toss and put Pakistan into bat .
They were knocked out of kilter by the stunning strokeplay of the Akmal brothers and seemed unable to fathom a way of stemming the runs as Pakistan , who had won only two of their five matches going into the semi-final , rose to the occasion .
Dirk Nannes began with eight dot balls to Kamran as only two singles and a wide came from the first two overs before the Pakistan openers , and Akmal in particular , cut loose superbly .
Kamran hit over cover for four then drove the next ball drown the ground for another boundary , while in the next over Salman Butt fizzed successive boundaries as the runs started to flow .
Umar led Pakistan to the joint second highest score of the tournament Butt was on 10 when he appeared to edge Mitchell Johnson but there was no significant appeal , and when leg - spinner Smith was brought into the attack after the powerplays his first over went for 15 as Kamran launched a six over long - off .
A disgruntled Shane Watson , after one over for eight , switched ends but was dispatched for 18 as Kamran hit a mammoth six down the ground that landed in the lap of ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat and added successive fours to reach his fifth T20 fifty from 32 balls .
His impressive innings ended when Warner dived forward in the deep to hold a superb low catch , ending an opening stand of 82 from 59 balls .
Warner was soon in the action again as Butt swept Smith aerially and the outfielder moved swiftly across to take a neat catch .
There was a relative lull with 29 runs coming from the next four overs , Shahid Afridi top-edging straight up to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin , but Khalid Latif swept Clarke onto the roof at mid-wicket then hammered the next ball down the ground for four .
Umar then thumped Nannes for six over long - on before deftly flicking the next ball over short fine leg for four .
The 19 - year - old raced to fifty with even more alacrity than his brother , reaching the half century from 29 balls after three sixes in the 18th over from Johnson that saw 24 added to the total .
With Australia beginning to feel the pressure and allowing byes , wides and overthrows that were unthinkable in their previous matches , Razzaq smashed David Hussey over long - on for six and the momentum just kept flowing for Afridi 's team as Warner was caught at point for a duck in the first over of the reply .
Mohammad Aamer gave Pakistan a great start with the ball Watson and Haddin briefly revived the Australians by taking 15 from the next over from Razzaq , but Watson then hit teenage left - armer Mohammad Aamer straight to long - on .
Haddin and Clarke took their side to 53 - 2 after the six powerplay overs but Haddin was drawn out of his crease expertly by slow left - armer Abdur Rehman and easily stumped , leaving the required rate at almost 11 per over .
Kamran 's outstanding match continued as he smartly whipped off the bails when Clarke lunged at one from Afridi in the next over .
White then struck three sixes in four balls off Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez as the requirement became 100 from 49 balls , promptly reduced by six as David Hussey launched Hafeez over long - off .
Australia 's unlucky number struck as with 87 needed Hussey got a leading edge to give Rehman a simple return catch but a 90 - metre six from White gave Australia a glimmer of hope with 70 needed from the final five overs .
Mike Hussey then hit successive sixes as Afridi dropped short and astonishingly the pressure appeared to be back on Pakistan .
But
White hit a low full toss from Aamer straight to long - off in the 17th over and four balls later , the wily spinner Saaed Ajmal drew Smith out of his crease to allow Kamran another stumping .
The indefatigable Mike Hussey pulled his third six to leave 34 from the final 12 balls then managed to flick the final ball of the penultimate over for four , leaving 18 from the last six , bowled by Ajmal .
After Johnson gave
Hussey the strike with a single , however , victory seemed inevitable as the next two balls were thumped into the legside for six and Hussey won the match with his sixth maximum .
