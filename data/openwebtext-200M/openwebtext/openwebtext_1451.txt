DETROIT --
The Detroit Red Wings have lost players with alarming regularity this season , but soon they will have more than they can keep .
Good news came in bunches Monday for a team that has been decimated by injuries : Hard - hitting defenseman Niklas Kronwall will return to the lineup Tuesday against Phoenix .
He had missed 91/2 weeks with a sprained knee .
Forwards Jason Williams and Tomas Holmstrom said they could return as early as Friday , or shortly thereafter .
Gritty , defensive defenseman Andreas Lilja , who has n't played in 11 months because of a concussion , has been headache - free for 13 days , just short of the two - week minimum doctors had mandated before any discussions can take place about a potential return .
" We 've played a long time without a lot of these guys , and our players have done a tremendous job hanging in the ( playoff ) race , " general manager Ken Holland said .
" We 're anxious to get players back .
It will take some time to gel , but the first step is getting guys back in the lineup . "
Kronwall will have the biggest impact .
The team has missed his puck - moving ability , his shot from the point on the second power - play unit , his penalty - killing , his open - ice hits and his overall defensive play .
" That 's huge , " forward Dan Cleary said .
" Words ca n't describe how important he is to our team .
He does everything great . "
Kronwall will be reunited with defense partner Brad Stuart , whose workload should be slightly reduced .
" We need a boost right now , " coach Mike Babcock said .
" ( Kronwall ) gives you a dynamic guy on the back end , whether that be physical , defending , on the rush offensively , on the power play , on the penalty - kill . "
Kronwall was injured Nov. 21 on a knee - on - knee hit by Montreal 's Georges Laraque .
" It 's been a long time , and I can't wait to get back out there , " Kronwall said .
" Feels good to be out there skating full power again .
Everything feels good . "
He has a lot of experience returning from long - term injuries ( broken leg , torn knee ligament , fractured sacrum ) .
" Anytime you get back , you got to keep it simple and try not to get caught out there for too long , so you have some fuel left in the tank , especially now with a lot of games coming up , " Kronwall said .
Williams , out since Nov. 7 with a fractured fibula , said he feels no pain , only slightly " wobbly . "
" I just want to make sure I come back and be effective , " Williams said .
" I do n't want to be a liability .
I just would like to do some more battling drills to strengthen it up and see where I am . "
Holmstrom , out since Jan. 6 with a hairline fracture in his foot , has n't resumed practicing but skated by himself on Monday and said he felt much better than he did a couple of days ago .
Once Williams and Holmstrom are cleared to play , the Red Wings will be one player over the 23 - man roster limit .
One option is assigning center Justin Abdelkader to Grand Rapids ( AHL ) , since he does not need to clear waivers .
The Red Wings will not have any salary cap issues until forward Johan Franzen is ready to return , which could be in early February or on March 1 , the first game following the Olympic break .
At that point , they would need to have cleared $ 1.5 million from their payroll .
That includes the salary of the player they trim after Williams and Holmstrom return .
Wings cautious with Lilja
Lilja said he is feeling much better , but there is no time frame for his return .
“ My plan from the start was to go 14 days without headaches and I ’m hitting 13 today , so we ’ll see what happens , ” Lilja said .
“ I ’ll stick to that plan and negotiate after that . ”
By negotiate , he means discuss with doctors and management when he can be activated .
Just because Lilja is symptom - free for two weeks , however , does n’t mean he is close to returning .
Holland is taking a cautious approach until he receives more information from doctors this week .
“ He ’s had concussion - like symptoms for 11 months and has been symptom - free for two weeks ; to all the sudden throw him in the lineup is a bit of a stretch , ” Holland said .
“ But I ’ll meet with ( team doctors ) and go by their guidelines . ”
Holland believes there likely are other hurdles Lilja must clear before he is ready .
“ Is the next step to give him the green light or further tests and evaluation ? ” Holland said .
“ We ’ll be conservative and move slow .
I have to get other people ’s opinions -- expert opinions .
“ We do n’t want to put the player in a position where he comes back and all the sudden has a setback . ”
Zetterberg , Datsyuk need spark
Babcock flip - flopped Cleary and Todd Bertuzzi .
Cleary will play with Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg .
Bertuzzi will skate with Valtteri Filppula and Drew Miller .
“ For us to be successful , your best players got to be your best players , ” Babcock said .
“ They got to generate offense .
So we ’re doing everything we can to put Pav and Z in a position to be successful .
That ’s nothing against what Bert was doing .
It ’s just that ( Datsyuk and Zetterberg ) are n’t scoring enough , so we ’ll move them around and see what happens . ”
Datsyuk has no goals and three assists in his past seven games .
Zetterberg has two goals and three assists in his past 12 games .
Here are the line combinations Detroit skated with Tuesday at practice :
Zetterberg - Datsyuk - Cleary
Bertuzzi-Filppula - Miller ( Franzen working in )
Draper - Helm - Eaves ( Williams working in )
Leino - Abdelkader - Maltby ( May working in )
Lidstrom - Rafalski
Kronwall - Stuart

Israel ’s leading columnist , Nahum Barnea , published a column this week about an academic war game exercise conducted at Bar Ilan University ’s Begin - Sadat Center Strategic Studies .
In a paper published last September ( Hebrew pdf here ) , Prof .
Moshe Vered considered under what conditions the two nations might enter a war , how long it might last and how it might end .
The results were alarming even to the Israeli intelligence community .
Here is how Barnea summarizes the research ( thanks to Didi Remez for translating the article ) :
“ The war could be long , ” Vered warns , “ its length could be measured in years . ”
The cost that the war will exact from Israel raises a question mark as to the decision to go to war .
The relatively light scenario speaks about an Israeli bombing , after which Iran will fire several volleys of surface - to - surface missiles at Israel .
Due to the limited number of missiles and their high cost , the war will end within a short time .
The missiles may run out , the study states , but the war will only be getting started .
“ The means that may be most effective for the Iranians is war by proxies — Syria , Hizbullah and Hamas , ” Vered writes .
“ ( There will be ) ongoing and massive rocket fire ( and in the Syrian case , also various types of Scud missiles ) , which will cover most of the area of the country , disrupt the course of everyday life and cause casualties and property damage .
The effect of such fire will greatly increase if the enemy fires chemical , biological or radiological ordnance … massive Iranian support , by money and weapons , will help the organizations continue the fire over a period of indeterminate length … due to the long - range of the rockets held by Hizbullah , Israel will have to occupy most of the territory of Lebanon , and hold the territory for a long time .
But then the IDF will enter a guerrilla war , a war the end of which is hard to predict , unless we evacuate the territory , and then the rocket fire will return … ”
This is not all .
“ Another possibility , ” Vered writes , “ is the activation of Iranian expeditionary forces that will be located in Syria as part of a defense pact between the two countries , or sending large amounts of infantry forces to participate in the war alongside Hizbullah or Syria .
Iran ’s ability to do so will increase after the United States evacuates its troops from Iraq .
If the current tension between Turkey and Israel rises , Turkey may also permit , or turn a blind eye to , arms shipments and Iranian volunteers that will pass to Syria through its territory and airspace .
Israel will find it very difficult , politically and militarily , to intercept the passage of forces through Iraq or Turkey .
The participation of Iranian forces will make it very difficult for the IDF to occupy areas from which rockets are being fired .
“ Along with these steps , Iran may launch a massive terror campaign against Israeli targets within Israel and abroad ( diplomatic missions , El Al planes and more ) and against Jewish targets . ”
Iran will not attack immediately , Vered ’s scenario states .
First it will launch intensive diplomatic activity , which could lead to an American embargo on spare parts to Israel .
Along with this , the Iranians will secretly move troops to Syria .
Israel will not attack the troops , for fear of international pressure .
The IDF will have to mobilize a large reserve force to defend the Golan Heights .
After the Iranians complete the buildup of their force , Hizbullah and Hamas will launch massive rocket fire against all population centers .
The IDF will try to occupy Lebanon and will engage in a guerrilla war with multiple casualties .
Hamas will renew the suicide bombings and Iran will target Israel ’s sea and air routes by terrorism .
The Iranians will fire missiles at population centers in Israel , and will rebuild the nuclear facilities that were bombed , in such a way that will make it very difficult to bomb them again .
Vered bases his assessment mainly on the regime ’s ideology and on the lessons of the Iran - Iraq War , which lasted from 1980 to 1988 .
He writes : “ Half a million dead , a million wounded , two million refugees and displaced persons , economic damage estimated by the Iranian government at about $ 1 - trillion — more than twice the value of all Iranian oil production in 70 years of pumping oil — none of this was sufficient to persuade Iran to stop the war .
Only the fear of the regime ’s fall led the leadership to accept the cease - fire .
“ The ramifications are clear and harsh — like the war against Iraq , the war against Israel will also be perceived by the Iranians as a war intended to right a wrong and bring justice to the world by destroying the State of Israel .
Only a threat to the regime will be able to make the Iranian leadership stop .
It is difficult to see how Israel could create such a threat . ”
The United States would be able to shorten the war if it were to join it alongside Israel .
Vered does not observe American willingness to do so .
He predicts the possibility of pressure in the opposite direction , by the US on Israel … .
The military card … The game is now approaching the critical stage , the “ money time . ” Netanyahu and Barak are waving the military card .
“ All the options are on the table , ” they say , accompanying the sentence with a meaningful look .
There are Israelis , in uniform and civilian clothes , who take them seriously …
The following is perhaps the most important portion of this column since Barnea posits a startling theory to explain Bibi ’s posturing and bellicosity concerning Iran .
If he is right then I would feel a whole lot more confident that war is not in the offing .
But if he is wrong …
I find it difficult to believe that Netanyahu will undertake such a weighty and dangerous decision .
It is more reasonable to assume that he and Barak are playing “ hold me back . ”
On the day they will be called upon to explain why Iran attained nuclear weapons , they will say , each on his own , what do you want from me , I prepared a daring , deadly , amazing operation , but they — the US administration , the top IDF brass , the forum of three , the forum of seven , the forum of ten — tripped me up .
They are to blame .
Netanyahu and Barak know : there is no military operation more successful , more perfect , than an operation that did not take place .
Netanyahu has upgraded Ahmadinejad to the dimensions of a Hitler .
Against Hitler , one fights to the last bunker .
This is what Churchill did , and Netanyahu wants so badly to be like Churchill .
His credibility — a sensitive issue — is on the table .
If he retreats , the voters will turn their back on him .
Where will he go ?
In his distress , he may run forward .
Below , Barnea continues with his entirely reasonable , pragmatic and even cynical theories that the Israeli public neither believes , nor wants Bibi to go to war .
While he may be right , I ’m afraid that many polls of Israeli opinion show a population resigned to confrontation and possible war .
So who do you believe ?
The fascinating side of this story is that very few Israelis would appear to believe their prime minister .
If they believed him , they would not run in a frenzy to buy apartments in the towers sprouting like mushrooms around the Kirya .
In the event that Iran should be bombed , the residents of the towers would be the first to get it .
If they believed [ Netanyahu ] , the real estate prices in Tel Aviv would drop to a quarter of their current value , and long lines of people applying for passports would extend outside the foreign embassies .
What do the Israelis know about Netanyahu that Ahmadinejad does not know , what is it that they know .
Of course , this eminently reasonable interpretation omits the fact that many other pragmatic Israeli leaders , equally cynical in their way , have been sucked into disastrous wars for far less reason .
Most recently Ehud Olmert in Lebanon and Gaza .
Menachem Begin in Lebanon .
Do we really believe that even if he does n’t mean to go to war that something could not suck him into it against his better judgment ?
History is full of examples of precisely such things , World War I being perhaps the foremost example .
Returning to Vered ’s war game , there will be Iran haters in Israel who read this who pooh - pooh this scenario claiming it overstates the negatives and overlooks Israel ’s prowess and past success in similar ventures like Osirak and the alleged Syrian nuclear reactor .
But I say if even 1/10 of the complications Vered outlines happen , that disaster may be in the offing for Israel .
Israelis tend to have a “ can do ” attitude towards wars with their Arab neighbors .
As such , they often overestimate themselves and underestimate their adversary .
Iran , once provoked , will make a much more formidable adversary than most Israelis imagine .
Israelis should remember , but wo n’t , that the IDF is no longer the vaunted invincible force it was after the 1967 War .
It can not work miracles .
Think Lebanon , 2006 .
Think Gaza , 2008 .
To delude yourself that bombing Iranian nuclear plants will be a surgical operation with short - term consequences alone is beyond foolish .
That is why Vered ’s exercise , no matter how accurate it turns out to be , is salient .

AntiPolygraph.org has obtained a copy of an NSA leaflet ( 1.7 mb PDF ) titled , “ Your Polygraph Examination : An Important Appointment to Keep . ”
This leaflet , which has blanks for filling in the time , date , and place of an appointment , merits some discussion .
The leaflet begins with a section on what to do before the polygraph :
Prior to Your Appointment
Get a good night ’s sleep
Follow your usual routine
Take your regular medications
Do n’t skip any meals
Come in with an open mind
It ’s a unique experience each time
Allow enough time in your schedule
This much is fairly uncontroversial .
But while the NSA urges keeping an “ open mind ” about the polygraph , we should also heed evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins ’ wise counsel : “ By all means let ’s be open - minded , but not so open - minded that our brains drop out . ”
The National Academy of Sciences in 2002 found polygraph screening to be completely invalid , concluding that “ its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies . ”
Test Requirements Questions are directly related to counterintelligence and suitability
Examinee must be in good physical and mental health
Test is voluntary and can be terminated at any time
Examinee must sign an interview consent form
All questions are reviewed prior to testing
While the leaflet states that “ questions are directly related to counterintelligence and suitablity , ” those facing NSA polygraph screening need to know that they face a wide - ranging interrogation that may delve into any facet of their personal lives .
For example , you may be asked if you ’ve viewed Internet pornography .
If the answer is “ yes , ” you may then be interrogated about whether you ’ve ever viewed explicit images of minors .
In addition , the polygraph is not truly voluntary .
It ’s mandatory for NSA employees and contractors .
The polygraph is only “ voluntary ” in the sense that choosing to work for the NSA is voluntary .
The following section attempts to reassure examinees about the qualifications of the NSA ’s polygraph operators :
Examiner Training Graduates of Defense Academy for Credibility Assessment
Federally Certified examiners
All Special Agents
Bachelor ’s Degree ( minimum )
80 hours of continuing education biennually
What the leaflet does n’t mention is that the Defense Academy for Credibility Assessment ( the polygraph school that trains all federal polygraphers ) churns out newly minted polygraph operators after just 14 weeks of training .
No science background is required .
Indeed , critical thinking about polygraphy is discouraged at DACA , which at one time had ( and which may yet have ) a tradition whereby students who violate norms ( for example , by referring to a polygraph instrument as a “ machine ” ) are required to put money into a coffee can , with amounts collected going toward a party at graduation time .
Most importantly , it should be borne in mind that lie detection , at it ’s core , is an exercise in mind reading .
And polygraph operators cannot read minds .
They ’re interrogators who use the polygraph instrument as an adjunct to interrogation .
Health Considerations
The polygraph components are not invasive .
The polygraph instrument uses sensors placed on an individual to monitor and record their physiology during the testing phase .
It is highly unusual for any medical condition , past or present , to interfere with the polygraph test or polygraph results .
In the event an individual does have a concern in this regard , it is recommended that they consult with their physician before their examination is scheduled .
Unfortunately , physicians who consult the medical literature for the contraindications of polygraph testing will come up short .
There is scant peer - reviewed research on the effects of any medical conditions or medications on polygraph results .
For more on the ethical questions that arise when physicians are consulted regarding a person ’s suitability for polygraph “ testing , ” see Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff ’s 2001 letter to the secretary of the New Mexico Board of Medical Examiners .
Before we proceed to the flip side of the brochure , we should note here that nowhere on this leaflet is there any mention of the National Security Agency .
Instead , the leaflet bears a strange coat of arms with a shield , torch , crossed swords , and a banner with the motto “ Semper Caveo ” ( Always Beware ) , plus the slogan : “ Security Awareness : Your Best Defense . ”
A Google search turns up nothing connecting these words to any federal agency .
Turning now the reverse side of the leaflet , we read :
Question Areas Counterintelligence : Espionage
Sabotage
Terrorist Activity
Deliberate damage of U.S. Government Information Systems
Intentional compromise of U.S. Government Classified Information or Material
Secret contact with a foreign national or representative Suitability : Involvement in a serious crime
Personal involvement with illegal drugs during the last seven years
Deliberate falsification of the security forms
These are legitimate areas of inquiry for those who are to be entrusted with sensitive national security information .
Unfortunately , the polygraph is not a legitimate means of determining whether such persons have spoken the truth .
The leaflet continues :
Confidentiality : Your polygraph is held in the strictest confidence .
We ask that you maintain confidentiality regarding your polygraph examination and do not discuss it with acquaintances , friends , family , or co-workers .
Unfortunately , the NSA ’s promise of confidentiality cannot be taken at face value .
Information disclosed to NSA polygraphers may be shared with other federal agencies as well as with local law enforcement agencies .
For an example , see the public statement of “ Frustrated . ”
The NSA ’s request that examinees not discuss their experience with others is also noteworthy .
While classified information might be discussed in the polygraph suite , the procedure itself is not classified .
Indeed , there is little that is secret about polygraphy .
It ’s methods have been around for decades , and the federal polygraph handbook ( 964 kb PDF ) may be freely downloaded from AntiPolygraph.org .
Yet the NSA polygraph unit seeks to preserve the “ mystique ” of the lie detector by discouraging examinees from talking about it .
Next , the NSA polygraph unit provides a FAQ :
Frequently Asked Questions
Will nervousness affect my test ?
Nervousness is expected and accounted for during the test .
While nervousness is indeed expected , it is not truly “ accounted for . ”
The polygraph operator has no way of differentiating the nervousness that goes with having one ’s career riding on the outcome of such a pseudoscientific procedure as polygraphy from the nervousness of a liar who fears being caught .
How long will the test take ?
The average test length falls between two and four hours .
Everyone ’s life experience is different and the test length relates directly to those experiences .
Leave enough time in your schedule for your test .
This much is true .
How can I be successful on my polygraph examination ?
Speak candidly about your life experineces , ask questions , follow your examiner ’s instructions , and maintain your focus throughout the process .
Actually , there is no clear correlation between candor and passing the polygraph .
The polygraph does not detect lies .
It ’s used by the NSA as an interrogational prop to elicit admissions .
What about the information I read on the Internet about the polygraph process ?
There is a great deal of unverified information on the Internet about polygraph .
Talk to your examiner about the information you read .
Not a very satisfactory answer .
The scientific shortcomings of polygraphy are well documented , and the kind of people the NSA wants to hire ( mathematicians , scientists , engineers , computer programmers , etc. ) can easily learn about these shortcomings via the Google .
( AntiPolygraph.org is currently the 2nd result returned when one searches Google for “ polygraph . ” )
Polygraph operators tend to be suspicious and untrusting of those who question what they do for a living .
Unfortunately , telling your polygrapher that you ’ve read sites like AntiPolygraph.org will have the predictable result of biasing your polygrapher against you , inviting an arbitrary accusation of deception and / or countermeasure use .
What about the things my co-workers told me ?
Everyone ’s polygraph interview is different .
Do n’t let what they tell you color your experience .
Why not ?
Is n’t it foolish to dismiss out of hand the experiences of others ?
In addition to the public statement of “ Frustrated ” mentioned earlier , see also the statements of Nate B. , “ NSA Reject , ” “ An Anonymous Applicant , ” and the pseudonymous Ralph J. Perro ’s essay , “ Interviewing with an Intelligence Agency , ( Or , a Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Fort Meade ) ” ( PDF ) .
Will I feel the components during testing ?
Yes , the components are attached snugly to the body .
If you feel any discomfort , inform your examiner .
Fair enough .
Sometimes , polygraphers inflate the blood pressure cuff to the point where it causes physical pain .
Will my examiner tell me the test results ?
No .
Every test we conduct goes through a quality control process .
Only after that quality control process is completed can we provide official results .
This answer is not entirely true .
Those facing NSA polygraph screening should not expect to hear the words , “ Congratulations , you passed ! ”
But if they do n’t pass , they can expect to be accused of deception and to be badgered for admissions .
It is common for NSA applicants to be subjected to as many as three polygraph sessions before being “ cleared . ”
What should I do if I do n’t understand something ?
Do n’t be afraid to ask questions .
Your examiner has in - depth knowledge about the testing process .
It is vital to your success that you understand the process and the questions .
If you do n’t understand why the NSA relies on polygraph screening despite the longstanding scientific consensus that polygraphy has no scientific basis , and if you have the audacity to ask your polygraph operator about this matter , we ’d be interested to know the answer you receive .

David Cameron is struggling to ease voters ' concerns that there is a hidden side to him and his party , a poll for The Independent on Sunday reveals today .
With an election looming , 56 per cent of people believe the Tory leader is a " slick salesman , but I worry about what he is like underneath " , the ComRes survey found .
Thirty - six per cent disagree with this .
Mr Cameron , in a webcameron broadcast yesterday , took the step of appealing to Labour voters to have an " open mind " at the election , even if they have never voted Tory before .
His plea underscored fears in the Conservative leadership that doubts remain among the public about the party 's plans for government , despite expectations that the Tories will win the election .
Today 's poll puts the Conservatives on 40 per cent , 11 points clear of Labour .
The last ComRes survey for The Independent showed a seven - point gap .
The Liberal Democrats are up two points , on 21 per cent .
Outside the South - east , those who are concerned about another side to Mr Cameron outnumber those who are not concerned by a factor of two to one .
The poll also reveals that 50 per cent of people believe Gordon Brown has a " warm , human side " .
Seven out of 10 voters believe the outcome of the election , expected on 6 May , will be close .
In an attempt to broaden his party 's appeal after a negative reaction to Tory plans for spending cuts , Mr Cameron said : " The hopes you had with Labour – that Britain would become a stronger , fairer society – those hopes do n't just die because Labour have n't achieved them .
They 're alive with us in the modern Conservative Party .
" So , please , have an open mind at the next election .
Even if you 've never voted Conservative before , think about voting for us this time ...
We 're winning the argument on the economy and on building a fairer society .
So come and join us . "
The plea mirrors that made by Tony Blair to Tory voters in 1997 .
In his weekly podcast yesterday , the Prime Minister stepped up pressure on banks to curb bonuses , due this week , after reports that awards have increased by 40 per cent .
Mr Brown also made clear that the UK is close to agreement on a new tax in the form of a global bank levy – either a financial transaction tax or an annual insurance fee , favoured by the United States .
Mr Brown said : " I 'm sure you share my anger with some of the banks ... it is only fair that those who contributed to the recession and have now benefited from taxpayers ' support give something to society in return . "
In a separate development , Labour failed to rule out plans for a 10 per cent tax on estates to pay for free social care for the elderly .
Claims yesterday that the polling company Ipsos Mori was canvasing voters with the plan were seized on by the Conservatives .
The Tories warned last week that Labour was planning a £ 20,000 " death tax " to pay for free social care .
A U.S. comic book collector is being sentenced to six months in prison after pleading guilty to importing and possessing Japanese manga books depicting illustrations of child sex and bestiality .
Christopher Handley was sentenced in Iowa on Thursday , ( .pdf ) almost a year after pleading guilty to charges of possessing " obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children . "
The 40 - year - old was charged under the 2003 Protect Act , which outlaws cartoons , drawings , sculptures or paintings depicting minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct , and which lack " serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . "
Handley was the nation 's first to be convicted under that law for possessing cartoon art , without any evidence that he also collected or viewed genuine child pornography .
Without a plea deal with federal authorities , he faced a maximum 15 - year sentence .
Comic fans were outraged , saying jailing someone over manga does not protect children from sexual abuse .
" I 'd say the anime community 's reaction to this , since day one , has been almost exclusively one of support for Handley and disgust with the U.S. courts and legal system , " Christopher MacDonald , editor of Anime News Network , said in an e-mail .
Congress passed the Protect Act after the Supreme Court struck down a broader law prohibiting any visual depictions of minors engaged in sexual activity , including computer - generated imagery and other fakes .
The high court ruled that the ban was too broad , and could cover legitimate speech , including Hollywood productions .
In response , the Protect Act narrows the prohibition to cover only depictions that the defendant ’s community would consider " obscene . "
The case began in 2006 , when customs officials intercepted and opened a package from Japan addressed to Handley .
Seven books of manga inside contained cartoon drawings of minors engaged in sexually explicit acts and bestiality .

The Anime News Network says the seven books are :
* Mikansei Seifuku Shōjo ( Unfinished School Girl ) by Yuki Tamachi ( LE Comics )
* I [ Heart ] Doll by Makafusigi ( Seraphim Comics )
* Kemono for ESSENTIAL 3 ( THE ANIMAL SEX ANTHOLOGY Vol.3 ) by Masato Tsukimori et al ( Izumi Comics )
* Otonari Kazoku ( Neighboring House Family ) by Nekogen ( MD Comics )
* Eromon by Makafusigi ( Seraphim Comics )
* Kono Man_ ga Sugoi !

Purchasing a preinstalled Linux system may have gotten a little harder , as one Gripe Line reader and loyal Dell customer recently found out .
" I 've always supported Dell and enjoyed the availability of the company 's Linux systems , " writes Cal .
" But I was recently appalled when a Dell sales rep hung up on me when I tried to order some Linux systems for my business .
The Dell rep made it clear that unless I wanted Windows , Dell did n't want my money .
Linux has been a blessing to my company .
And we have paid Dell to supply us with those systems in the past .
But now I guess Dell does n't want to sell Linux / Ubuntu machines in an effort to kill off that product line . "
[ Linux naysayers take note : Desktop Linux is ready to go mainstream | Frustrated by tech support ?
Get answers in InfoWorld 's Gripe Line newsletter . ]
Could this be so ?
I headed to Dell.com to find out .
I browsed to the Business section and ticked the FreeDOS and Linux button to filter out all but these open source systems .
The site returned only a handful of laptops and no desktops , so I called the sales line to see whether they could set me up .
My sales representative hunted around for a bit , then told me , " Nope .
We do n't have any . "
So I contacted Dell representative Anne Camden to find out if there is any merit to Cal 's suspicion that Ubuntu systems have been dropped from the Dell product roster .
" I suspect that what is going on here is that we recently refreshed most of our consumer desktop portfolio , and unfortunately the Linux model is lagging and is not currently available , " she says .
" We will offer Ubuntu pre-installed again in the future , but it will not be for several weeks .
We offer systems with FreeDOS installed , which allows users to install their preferred Linux distribution .
If Cal called the customer consumer sales department , though , they may not know this and obviously would try to sell him a Windows - based PC .
The majority of purchasing for these systems happens online -- and are made by Linux enthusiasts , not by mainstream users . "
Anne had a sales rep who was well - versed in Dell 's open source offerings contact Cal directly to help him get the open source systems he needed .

The measurement that probably gets the most attention from personal finance books and news outlets is the personal balance sheet , or net worth statement .
Knowing your net worth can be important , but keep in mind that it is a snapshot in time and not necessarily a true indicator of financial health .
There are many other factors that affect your financial health , one of which is your cash flow statement , which is a representation of your net monthly cash flow .
You can use your cash flow statement in conjunction with your net worth statement to get a better idea of your overall financial health .
Later we will show you how to combine your net worth statement and cash flow statement with a financial risk test and debt analysis which will help you get a more clear picture of your financial health .
Positive Cash Flow is the Building Block of Wealth
One of the fundamental building blocks of becoming wealthy is spending less than you earn .
It is one of the core concepts of achieving wealth .
Your cash flow statement wo n’t tell you if you will become a millionaire or not , but it can tell you if you are on the right path – hint : you ca n’t build wealth if you are running on a deficit .
This is why it ’s essential to know where your money is coming from , and where it is going .
You should also know when all of this is happening .
Cash flow management in your personal finances is important since it keeps you from overdrawing your account and helps you plan ahead for larger expenses .
When you know how money flows through your personal economy , you are in control .
How to Create a Personal Cash Flow Statement
Creating a cash flow statement may remind you of creating a budget .
You will need to record all sources of income and all your expenses .
Then you will add the final amounts for income and expenses .
Just like your net worth statement , a positive number is positive cash flow ( good ! ) and a negative number is negative cash flow ( bad ! ) .
Understanding Your Cash Flow – the When , Where , and Why
If you want to get an idea of how money is moving in your personal finances , the first thing you need to do is keep track of everything :
Note your income .
Find out when you are paid .
This is about more than just recognizing your monthly income .
You should know when each payday is ( the first of the month , or every other Friday , etc. ) , and how much you will receive each time you are paid .

Track your expenses .
Next , you should know where your money is going , and when it needs to get there .
Figure out how much is going into your retirement account , emergency savings and for bills .
Check to see when your regular bills are due , so you know when that money will be needed .
Knowing where your money is coming from , how much of it is spoken for , and when it needs to be taken care of , is very important .
If you do not have an idea of how your money is moving through your personal economy , it is much easier to make mistakes — and you could find yourself overdrawing your account and perhaps not having the money you need to meet your obligations .

Factors to Consider in Personal Cash Flow Statement
Account for regular and irregular income .
A cash flow statement is designed to list all sources of income that affect your cash flow , not just your salary from your day job .
Below this section is a list of income streams to consider adding to your cash flow statement .
However , you should only add the income sources that are available for spending .
For example , investment income and dividends are listed as forms of income , but you would n’t list those on your cash flow statement if they are in retirement accounts or are automatically reinvested .
Dividends are also unique , in that many pay out quarterly or semi-annually .
So you will want to note that on your projections if you rely upon dividend investments for cash flow .
Track both regular and irregular expenses .
On the same token , you need to record all expenses , including regular and irregular expenses .
For example , some of your expenses , such as insurance , may come quarterly , semi-annually , or annually .
You may wish to break those down into a monthly approximation ( examples could include insurance premiums , taxes , homeowner ’s association fees , investment contributions , etc. ) .
Groceries and utilities are also expenses that can be approximated to smooth out your cash flow statement .
The following is a list of income sources and expenses that you may wish to include in your personal cash flow statement .
You will need to tailor it to your needs .
Common Types of Income
Earned Income
Salary 1
Salary 2
Bonuses / tips / commissions
Other Income
Self - employment income
Freelance / consulting income
Government benefits ( unemployment , Social Security Disability benefits , VA disability benefits , welfare , etc. ) .
Child support / alimony
Investment Income
Interest income
Dividends
Capital gains
Distributions
Retirement Income
Pension
Social Security Retirement Benefits
Annuity payments
Retirement plan distributions ( 401 K , IRA , withdrawals )
Common Expenses
Fixed Expenses :
Mortgage / Rent
Car payments
Insurance premiums
Property Taxes
Alimony / Child Support
Investment contributions
Estimated taxes
Variable expenses :
Groceries
Utilities
Medical care
Entertainment / hobbies
Dining out

Calculate the Net Cash Flow and Adjust Your Budget
Add total income and expenses and you have a personal cash flow statement .
If your cash flow statement is positive , then you have some additional cash each month that you can use to help you reach your financial goals ( build emergency fund , pay down debt , invest , etc. ) .
If your cash flow statement is negative , then it is time to look for ways to right the ship and turn things around .
Look for areas you can trim back on expenses , and ways to increase income .
You may be able to project your income and expenses for several months .
Take care to notice any upcoming big ticket items or irregular expenses , and plan accordingly .
Once you understand how your money is moving through your personal finances , you can begin to make changes to the way things are done .
For example , you may find that most of your income is irregular .
This is common when first starting a career in freelancing , starting a small business , and in certain types of jobs .
It ’s important to pay your bills when they are due , and not try to get too far ahead of yourself if things are tight .
That way you do n’t spend all the money you need for living expenses for the next couple weeks on a bill that is n’t due for another month .
It can take a balancing act , but it ’s worth going through this exercise to avoid overdraft fees , bounced checks , late payment penalties , or cutting back in other areas .
Creating a cash flow statement , and using it , can do wonders for your financial health .

Toxic Overload
Part I : Toxic Overload
The Modern Day Lifestyle
Warning : Toxic Overload
Cell phones , high tech devices , fast food , microwaves , plastics ;
These are just a few of the many modern day lifestyle conveniences we use every day .
Our lives have changed dramatically over the past 100 years .
Science and technology have advanced in such a way as to be able to create some amazing products that have enhanced our lives in many beneficial ways .
But all these advances and conveniences have not come without a cost .
Due to the technological advances since the Industrial Revolution , industries have continued to pour dangerous chemicals and pollutants into our waterways , soil and into the air we breathe .
Science has continually discovered cheaper and better ways to create synthetic materials that mimic what we could get from nature .
And while all this seems great , it has created a toxic home for us to live in .
We are surrounded by hundreds of thousands of new synthetic materials many of which are highly toxic .
Much of our water , food and air is polluted by chemicals that are not biodegradable or take many years to break down .
Every day we are exposed to thousands of toxins that slowly accumulate in our bodies .
The scary part is we do n't have to work in a factory or live next to a landfill to be exposed to these toxins .
We get exposed to thousands of toxins everyday in our own homes and just by going about our modern daily lives .
All this has created the toxic overload we are now dealing with .
Where do these toxins come from ?
Many of the chemicals are ingested through our food and food containers .
Pesticides have become a staple for the modern day farmer .
They are continually sprayed onto our land and subsequently make it into our food supply .
Pesticides can hang around in our environment for decades .
For example , DDT , which was banned in the 1970's , can still be found in foods such as our dairy products .
These pesticides not only do n't break down in the environment , they do n't break down within our bodies .
They get stored in our fatty tissues and in the tissues of animal fat .
So the chicken , beef and pork we eat is supplying us with even more toxins .
( Most animals are also given lots of other chemicals like antibiotics during the time they are being raised . )
And do n't forget our brains are about 60 % lipid ( fat ) material so the toxins within our body are affecting us mentally as well as physically .
Our modern processed foods have so much added to them .
These food additives include preservatives , bleaching agents , emulsifiers , texturizers , humectants and ripening agents .
And scarier still many of these additives are made from petroleum or coal tar !
We also ingest toxins through the water we drink .
Pretty much anything sprayed on our land or in the air ends up in the water supply .
Municipal water treatment plants do n't detoxify water from most the chemical pollutants .
In fact they add chemicals , like chlorine , to try to kill dangerous bacteria and parasites but that also form toxins for our bodies .
We breathe in toxins from the air .
Solvents are everywhere .
In 1993 alone more than 1,672,127,735 pounds of toxic chemicals were released into the air we breathe .
( EPA Toxic Release Inventory of 1993 )
They are used in almost all cleaning products and in materials we use every day .
Formaldehyde can be found in building materials , carpets , curtains and even make - up ( cosmetics ) .
You can even absorb all these toxins through your skin .
The solvents that do n't out gas into the air can be absorbed when you come in contact with them in the solid form .
Every time your baby crawls across the floor they are absorbing toxins from the carpet and the cleaners you sprayed around the house .
Every time you use lotion , hand sanitizer , perfume , shampoo and put on your clothes you are absorbing toxins .
And for many women , the morning routine of putting on make - up is a routine of applying toxins to their bodies .
Cosmetics are some of the worst and most toxic products you can use .
Most of us now live in a toxic home and we have achieved toxic overload ...
Continue to Part II : Toxic Life
Jump ahead to Part III : Detoxify
Go to end , Part IV : Toxic Home
Our contemporary culture , primed by population growth and driven by technology , has created problems of environmental degradation that directly affect all of our senses : noise , odors and toxins which bring physical pain and suffering , and ugliness , barrenness , and homogeneity of experience which bring emotional and psychological suffering and emptiness .
In short , we are jeopardizing our human qualities by pursuing technology as an end rather than a means .
Too often we have failed to ask two necessary questions :
First , what human purpose will a given technology or development serve ?
Second , what human and environmental effects will it have ?
From a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Legal Document about toxic overload
SAN DIEGO : Science fiction movies should be allowed only one major transgression of the laws of physics , says a US professor who has won backing from a number of his peers after creating a set of guidelines for Hollywood .
The proposals are intended to curb the film industry 's worst abuses of science by confining scriptwriters to plotlines that embrace the suspension of disbelief but stop short of demanding it in every scene .
The guidelines are by Sidney Perkowitz , a professor of physics at Emory University and a member of the Science and Entertainment Exchange , an advisory body run by the US National Academy of Sciences .
Limerick publicans have been granted a special exemption to open for business on Good Friday .
They had sought the exemption to accommodate over 26,000 people who will attend the Munster and Leinster rugby match at Thomond Park .
Judge Tom O'Donnell noted in his judgment today that the publicans only made the application as a last resort .
He also noted that Thomond Park had a special stadium licence and they would be allowed to serve drinks from when they open their doors until after the match .
Judge O'Donnell said it seemed absurd to him that pubs in the locality could not open for business as well .
He said he was also making the ruling for health and safety reasons when 26,000 people would be spilling out of Thomond Park immediately after the match .
He said the pubs could stay open from 6 pm until 11.30 pm that night .
The State had opposed the application by the publicans .
END OF THE HIGH LIFE : Stephen Versalko is sentenced in Auckland District Court to six years ' jail for defrauding ASB Bank customers of nearly $ 18 million .
A prostitute has walked away with $ 2.5 million spent by a banker stealing clients ' money to fuel an extravagant lifestyle of sex , booze and luxury property .
Stephen Gerard Versalko , 52 , married with three children , lived the high life for nine years after siphoning $ 17,763,110.19 off 30 wealthy clients from ASB Bank , where he worked .
Outside of buying property , his biggest spend was on sex – including $ 3.34 m on just two Auckland prostitutes with whom he had long - term relationships .
One received $ 2.5 m , the other $ 791,181 .
The Serious Fraud Office said both women also say they received further " large cash payments " estimated at $ 800,000 .
Still more was spent at a variety of escort agencies around Auckland .
The SFO could not track all the payments because they included cash taken out using seven credit cards that Versalko had .
Yesterday he was jailed for six years on three fraud charges by Judge Chris Field in Auckland District Court .
He will be eligible for parole in four years .
His fraud was the biggest employee theft the SFO has dealt with in its 20 - year history .
Versalko's lawyer , Stuart Grieve , QC , claimed that one of the prostitutes was blackmailing Versalko over a lengthy period for $ 1.2 m , but the SFO said it had no information to prove that .
One of the prostitutes bought property with the proceeds and the ASB is suing to try to recover it – her name and more details are suppressed by the courts while that case proceeds .
A clutch of other civil cases are also under way as ASB attempts to recover money , including $ 4.75 m held in trusts set up by Versalko .
His biggest splurge was $ 4 m on property , towards a $ 3.2 m mansion in Remuera 's plush Seaview Rd and a $ 1.8 m beachfront holiday home at Whangapoua in Coromandel .
Neither had mortgages , but not all the money used was stolen .
In addition , extensive renovations costing $ 558,000 were carried out and he owned a range of other properties through a series of family trusts or jointly with his wife .
He racked up $ 2.2 m on credit cards , including $ 313,000 for wine bought on an American Express card between 2002 and 2009 , and personal travel .
Versalko , a slim , unremarkable man who suffers from Crohn 's disease , an inflammation of the digestive tract , was an investment adviser with ASB .
He started his fraud after he was made redundant from a $ 200,000 job – plus bonuses – and racked up $ 40,000 on credit cards .
He was then hired by ASB in 1997 , but on a far lesser salary .
He was an expert in futures , options trading and the money markets , but he tried to make extra money by dabbling in property investment .
In 1999 he ran into difficulties , needing $ 70,000 to bail himself out .
He lined up an ASB client with $ 400,000 in a long - term deposit and carried out his first fraud , convincing her to invest in a scheme promising higher interest rates with no tax , no administration fees and the funds on call .
In total , he looted $ 528,340 from that one client .
From there , 30 others were sucked into his fake investment schemes , largely targeting elderly women living overseas who were unsophisticated about money and did not monitor their accounts online , SFO prosecutor Patrick McCann said .
All their names , and details of how much he rorted from each , were permanently suppressed yesterday .
Mr McCann described Versalko as " clever and charming " .
He explained away his wealth as profits from personal trading on an online site that dealt with complex derivatives .
Mike Harper , the real estate agent who sold Versalko his Whangapoua house , said he was personable and came across as a man of substance .
He used to give an expensive bottle of wine to local shop owners each year .
He was a master of using ASB 's computer system to transfer money leaving no trace of the transactions .
He also forged account statements which he signed and sent to the victims to fool them into believing their investments were safe .
Of the $ 18 m he stole , $ 4.6 m was used to repay fake interest and principal to clients , with $ 13.1 m raked off for himself .
In 2008 alone , he took about $ 4 m for himself .
The gravy train finally came to a halt in August last year , when one of his elderly clients with $ 3 m invested with Versalko saw a documentary about US fraudster Bernie Madoff and spotted similarities in the schemes they both ran .
When she contacted ASB Bank Securities to check , she found no record of her $ 3 m .
It triggered an urgent investigation and , on August 25 , Versalko was confronted , admitted the fraud and was later sacked .
Putting his hand up so early shaved three years off his sentence , Judge Field said .
Mr Grieve said his client had shown " exceptional remorse " .
But Mr McCann said Versalko was not fully frank – he tried to hide his relationships with the prostitutes , describing the payments as handouts to two ASB clients down on their luck , on whom he took pity .
The SFO traced the prostitutes through Versalko 's phone records .
Given his long - term marriage , " I can understand Versalko was reluctant to admit it " , Mr McCann said .
Mrs Versalko was not in court yesterday and is understood not to have attended any of his appearances .
The ASB said it had since introduced " additional processes and practices to further strengthen our security and protect our customers so that this situation does not happen again " .
It had reimbursed $ 15.5 m to all the clients Versalko had defrauded and would honour a further $ 1 m in promised interest payments .
The fraud contributed to ASB 's first loss in 20 years , for the first half of the current financial year .
SEX WORKERS ORGANISATION TAKEN ABACK BY HUGE SPENDING
Stephen Versalko's money would have been a great source of intrigue for the working girls he spent it on , Prostitutes Collective president Catherine Healy says .
Sex workers were " usually incredibly discreet " but there was sometimes " chat " about well - heeled regular clients .
" The chat around them is how is this happening ?
How are they sustaining this amount of spending ?
Usually when clients become regulars people get to know a bit about their circumstances .
Sometimes people would think , ` This does n't feel right – is this guy embezzling ? " '
It was very rare for prostitutes to become tangled up in legal cases , but she warned sex industry workers to be on their guard .
" Sometimes there are clients who may be doing something illegal .
While it's not [ prostitutes ' ] responsibility , it 's something to be aware of because there could be repercussions . "
She was taken aback by how much Versalko had spent , though it was not uncommon for prostitutes to have long - standing business relationships with clients .
" The sex workers very often do n't regard it as being in a relationship ... but it 's also true that some become very attached to their clients . "

Get your skiing in now ; global warming could shrink Utah 's winter season
PARK CITY , UTAH ( AP ) 
Another winter storm headed to Utah could bring two feet of snow and frigid temperatures to the Wasatch mountains .
But do n't let that fool you .
Utah 's trademark Greatest Snow on Earth could be a memory by 2075 , say a pair of Colorado climatologists , who warn that global warming could shrink the ski season to a mere two months a year .
It means that Utah 's dry , fluffy snow could turn into a hard , wet pack .
And that 's if Utah gets snow .
Already the Rocky Mountains are seeing more rain than snow , especially at the start and finish of winter .
Those scenarios were laid out in Utah 's premier ski town Tuesday by University of Colorado researcher Mark Williams and Brian Lazar , a senior associate with the environment and energy research firm Stratus Consulting Inc. of Boulder .
Stratus Consulting and the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research did a study of the best - and worst - case scenarios for Utah 's winter for the years 2030 , 2075 and 2100 .
Even the best - case scenarios are bad .
They show that average mountain temperatures will increase by 10 degrees by 2075 , shortening winter and bringing variable snow conditions .
Skiing could be found only at the top of mountains if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase at current rates .
And by 2100 , Utah 's ski season could extend only from Christmas to Presidents Day .
" To be honest , if in 100 years we do n't have a ski resort , that 's the least of our problems , " said Brent Giles , director of operations at Park City Mountain Resort .
" Global warming is big , and it's scary . "
There is still a " window of opportunity for all of us to help save our snow , " said John Cumming , chief executive of Powdr Corp. , parent company of Park City Mountain Resort .
But to some extent , the experts say the damage already has been done .
" One thing to keep in mind is , when we emit CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) , it stays in the atmosphere for 50 years , " Williams said .
" Regardless of what we do today , there 's a 50 - year lag time .
If there 's one message I want you guys to take home today , it 's that 50 - year lag time .
That has a huge effect on the ski conditions . "
The Rockies , however , are expected to handle the changes better than New England , where low - elevation ski areas are more vulnerable to dwindling snowpacks , a pattern already showing itself there .
The storm headed to Utah starting Thursday will bring snow lingering through midday Friday , weather forecasters say .
They expect six inches or more in mountain valleys and a foot or two in the mountains , with the possibility of even more in some areas .
That kind of storm could be a rarity a half - century from now , but " the good news is the more we control emissions , the more snow we 'll see , " Lazar said .
A 10 - degree reduction in Park City 's average temperature would yield a climate similar to Salt Lake City's , which could see its mountain water supply shrink by a third under the scenarios .
It does n't look good to Park City resident and skier Leah Corey , 14 .
" I 'm afraid that when I get older , I wo n't be able to ski , " she said .

In the 1868 case of Texas v. White , 74 U.S. ( 7 Wall . ) 700 , a case dealing with the title to some U.S. bonds , the Supreme Court ruled that Texas ' , and hence the South 's , attempted secession in 1861 was unconstitutional .
But the opinion also contained some wording that might give secessionists a way around White .
It 's unfortunate that the Court used White as the vehicle to address the constitutionality of secession .
The Court reached the constitutionality issue only because of a jurisdictional question ; and it was virtually impossible for the Court not to hold secession unconstitutional a mere three years after the end of the War Between the States .
A finding of constitutionality would have rendered unnecessary all the death and misery of that war .
Of course , it was unnecessary .
But the point is that the Court was under tremendous pressure to uphold the result of the war as if constitutional issues are settled on the battlefield .
( For an excellent overview of why secession was constitutional , Lincoln 's arguments against it , and various other aspects of the secession issue , see u201CWas the Union Army 's Invasion of the Confederate States a Lawful Act?u201D by James Ostrowski . )
No , this was certainly not the optimum test , or a fair test , for a decision on such a vital constitutional matter .
Nevertheless , the case , wrongly decided as it probably was , is out there and serves as a significant hurdle for secessionists if we hope to secede lawfully .
If we look at secession as a matter of political will and are not concerned with secession 's constitutionality , White is not particularly important .
But let 's assume for now that the goal is lawful , constitutional secession .

So what is the potentially helpful language the Court used ?
After noting that it was u201 Cneedless to discuss at length whether the right of a State to withdraw from the Union for any cause , regarded by herself as sufficient , is consistent with the Constitution of the United States [ , ] u201D the Court then determined that the Union was intended to be perpetual and then stated that after Texas entered into u201 Can indissoluble relationu201D with the Union : u201CThere was no place for reconsideration , or revocation , except through revolution or through the consent of the States .
u201D ( Emphasis added . )
Consent of the states .
What does that mean ?
We know it does n't mean a constitutional amendment .
That is a term of art , and there is no logical explanation as to why learned justices would use the phrase u201 Cconsent of the statesu201D if they meant constitutional amendment .
Does this phrase tell secessionists that there is another way to secede other than constitutional amendment ?
Does it mean the consent of a majority of states ?
Opponents of secession will no doubt say that the phrase is mere dicta and has no controlling effect .
Dicta are , basically , a comment that is n't essential to the case 's outcome .
( The full term is obiter dicta : dead words .
Dictum is singular . )
Dicta are n't part of the holding .
But lawyers and judges argue all the time about whether a phrase is dicta or holding .
Richard Posner , judge and legal scholar , once noted that the distinction between the two concepts u201 Cis fuzzy not only at the level of application but also at the conceptual level .
u201D Posner , u201CThe Federal Courts : Crisis and Reformu201D ( 1985 ) .
Some have said calling something dicta merely means : I do n't want to follow this decision .
So dismissing the phrase as dicta , while a predictable tactic , is n't necessarily fatal to the use of the phrase by secessionists .
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Complicating matters more there 's a concept called judicial dicta .
These are dicta that deal with an issue that was briefed and argued and was directly involved in the decision but is n't essential to the decision in the case .
Judicial dicta , also difficult to define , are given more weight than dicta .
The u201 Cconsent of the statesu201D phrase is , at worst , judicial dicta , as the issue of constitutionality was briefed and argued .
The Court 's comment must be given some weight .
It has some meaning .
And it helps secessionists .
Constitutional amendment requires 38 states .
And getting the Court to overturn
White is highly unlikely .
So this consent concept provides a third , possibly somewhat easier , option than either amendment or overturning of the case .

Michael C. Dorf , a law professor at Columbia and a constitutional scholar , is one of the few commentators who has addressed this language in White .
In an article about secession , Dorf , after saying that White held secession unconstitutional , looked to the u201 Cconsent of the statesu201D language and said , essentially , that we do n't know what it means but it may provide an argument for states that want to secede .
The article , interestingly , was addressed to a question about whether blue states could secede after the 2004 election .
The title of the article , in fact , was u201CDoes the Constitution Permit the Blue States to Secede ?
With Permission , Perhaps ; Unilaterally , Nou201D FindLaw ( Wednesday Nov. 24 , 2004 ) .
If the White language does allow secession on the approval of the states ( however that approval is given ) , how likely is it that secessionists could get 26 states ?
Well , the original 11 Confederate states would be a good start .
Vermont has one of the most active secessionists movements in the U.S. , so it might join in .
North and South Dakota , Montana and Idaho are possibilities .
Oklahoma is a likely candidate .
Missouri and Kentucky are possibilities .
That 's a total of 19 .
Approval by these states wo n't happen immediately , but if the federal government continues to trample on the rights of the people who thinks it wo n't ?
And if the secessionist movement can effectively educate the public , especially in states that might agree to secede , maybe getting 26 states is n't out of the question in the foreseeable future .
And it 's always possible that a few blue states will approve of secession just to get rid of us .

A Harris County sheriff 's deputy was arrested Wednesday on a charge he sold restricted criminal background information for cash .
Kurt Douglas Green , 42 , of Hockley , was arrested by federal authorities on a sealed indictment accusing him of disclosing confidential law enforcement information from the National Crime Information Center database for profit .
The Sheriff 's Office has computer access to the database with criminal background information on individuals from law enforcement agencies all over the country .
The database is restricted for law enforcement purposes only .
The indictment alleges that on Jan. 19 , Green accessed the database “ for disclosure to a non-law enforcement person for financial gain . ”
Green was hired in 1996 by the Harris County Sheriff 's Office .
Sheriff 's spokesman Alan Bernstein said Green 's employment is under review .
Green was assigned to the jail at 701 San Jacinto and was taken into custody without incident Wednesday morning .
He was released by U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Johnson on a $ 75,000 personal recognizance bond Wednesday afternoon .
Neither U.S. Attorney José Angel Moreno nor Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia would answer questions about the case Wednesday .
They issued only a written statement .
Bernstein said once the sheriff learned of the federal investigation , “ he chose not to learn any more details , for multiple reasons , while the case was pending . ”
Bernstein said the sheriff would not say whether he knows the identity of the person who allegedly paid for the information or the reason the person wanted it .
In his written statement , Garcia said : “ The stated core values of the Harris County Sheriff 's Office include meriting and maintaining the public 's trust . ”

CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla. , March 15 ( UPI ) -- NASA scientists discussed options Monday following a problem that occurred during the weekend when space shuttle Discovery 's aft fuel tanks were being vented .
" The Right Reaction Control System … fuel helium tank pressure unexpectedly decreased in unison with the … fuel propellant tank when the fuel tank was vented , " NASA said in a statement .
" This indicates that at least one of the two parallel helium isolation valves is leaking or is remaining in the open position when it is expected to be closed . "

The two helium system regulators , a primary and a secondary , will be tested to verify they are functioning correctly .
Scientists said both regulators are " downstream " of the isolation valves , and help to maintain helium pressure to the fuel tank .
Knowing whether the regulators are operating correctly is a key factor for managers who must decide whether to proceed with launch preparations .
The test is expected to occur late this week .
NASA said managers now expect to move Discovery 's STS - 131's payload to Launch Pad 39A starting at 12:01 a.m. EDT Friday .
Officials said the launch -- the 33rd shuttle mission to the International Space Station -- is still set for April 5 at 6:21 a.m. EDT , with a few days of contingency left in the schedule to make that liftoff date .

Much of the debate over legalizing gay marriage has focused on God and Scripture , the Constitution and equal protection .
But we see the world through the prism of money .
And for years , we ’ve heard from gay couples about all the extra health , legal and other costs they bear .
So we set out to determine what they were and to come up with a round number  a couple ’s lifetime cost of being gay .
It was much more complicated than we initially imagined , and that ’s probably why we ’ve never seen similar efforts .
We looked at benefits that routinely go to married heterosexual couples but not to gay couples , like certain Social Security payments .
We plotted out the cost of health insurance for couples whose employers do n’t offer it to domestic partners .
Even tax preparation can cost more , since gay couples have to file two sets of returns .
Still , many couples may come out ahead in one area : they owe less in income taxes because they ’re not hit with the so - called marriage penalty .
Our goal was to create a hypothetical gay couple whose situation would be similar to a heterosexual couple ’s .
So we gave the couple two children and assumed that one partner would stay home for five years to take care of them .
We also considered the taxes in the three states that have the highest estimated gay populations 
New York , California and Florida .
We gave our couple an income of $ 140,000 , which is about the average income in those three states for unmarried same - sex partners who are college - educated , 30 to 40 years old and raising children under the age of 18 .
Here is what we came up with .
In our worst case , the couple ’s lifetime cost of being gay was $ 467,562 .
But the number fell to $ 41,196 in the best case for a couple with significantly better health insurance , plus lower taxes and other costs .
These numbers will vary , depending on a couple ’s income and circumstance .
Gay couples earning , say , $ 80,000 , could have health insurance costs similar to our hypothetical higher - earning couple , but they might well owe more in income taxes than their heterosexual counterparts .
For wealthy couples with a lot of assets , on the other hand , the cost of being gay could easily spiral into the millions .
Nearly all the extra costs that gay couples face would be erased if the federal government legalized same - sex marriage .
One exception is the cost of having biological children , but we felt it was appropriate to include this given our goal of outlining every cost gay couples incur that heterosexual couples may not .
Our analysis is not exact science .
Not every couple would get married if they could , and others would not want to have children .
We also made a number of assumptions based on average costs , life spans , state of residence and gender .
Our gay family is made up of two women living in New York State in a committed partnership that lasts 46 years , until the first partner dies at age 81 .
We ran two sets of calculations : in the one that turned out to be our worst case financially , one woman earned $ 110,000 and the other $ 30,000 .
In our second couple , both partners earned $ 70,000 .
We started running the numbers when both were age 35 .
We received assistance from Roberton Williams , a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center , who performed our tax analysis , which required simulating more than 900 income tax returns , in part because we followed the partners for 50 years .
We also decided to run all scenarios across the three states so that the results would not be skewed by different state taxes .
We ’ve outlined all the detail in a workbook linked to the online version of this column .
As for the emotional costs of living with these added complexities , they ca n’t be quantified .
Frederick Hertz , a lawyer in Oakland , Calif. , who works with same - sex couples , likens heterosexual marriage to being in the car pool lane .
“ Being part of a same - sex couple , it ’s always stop .
Wait .
Pay a toll , ” he said .
Harvey Hurdle , who lives in Philadelphia with his partner and their young son , said he was reminded of the disparities every time his Social Security statement arrived in the mail .
“ It ’s pretty insulting , ” he said .
“ It says your spouse would get this much .
And it ’s like , ‘ Oh no he wo n’t ! ’ ”
Health Insurance
In our worst case , the lower earner ’s employer did not provide health insurance and her partner ’s employer did n’t cover domestic partners .
So the lower earner had to buy coverage on the private market , while the higher - earning partner provided coverage for herself and the two children .
All this cost the gay couple $ 211,993 more than their heterosexual married counterparts , who were able to take advantage of the higher - earner ’s family coverage .
In our best case , health coverage cost the gay couple $ 28,595 more .
We assumed both gay partners were eligible for employer - provided coverage .
The higher - earner ’s employer also provided domestic partner coverage , which covered her partner for the five years she stayed at home .
When she returned to work , she used her own employer ’s insurance .
Even though the couple paid nearly $ 29,000 more in premiums than an identical heterosexual married couple , it was cheaper than using domestic partnership coverage throughout because of the onerous tax implications , according to Mr. Williams of the Tax Policy Center .
A nondependent partner ’s coverage is taxable income , and she ca n’t use pretax dollars to pay the premiums , according to Todd A. Solomon , a partner in the employee benefits department of McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago .
Social Security
All our hypothetical individuals started collecting Social Security when they were 66 .
Same - sex couples are not entitled to a variety of Social Security benefits , including spousal benefits ( heterosexual spouses can receive up to 50 percent of a spouse ’s benefits while the spouse is alive , if they are higher than their own ) ; survivor benefits ( surviving spouses can receive their deceased spouse ’s benefits in lieu of their own , if they are higher ) ; and a flat death benefit of $ 255 .
In the worst case , the gay partner who earned $ 30,000 could not receive higher spousal benefits or survivor benefits from her partner ’s much higher earnings record .
Nor was she entitled to the death benefit .
In total , the gay women collected $ 88,511 less in Social Security than a similar heterosexual couple .
Some couples might try to buy life insurance in an attempt to replace the benefit .

In our best case , when the gay partners had largely identical incomes , neither was at a huge disadvantage because they ended up with about the same monthly benefits .
So the only extra benefit a heterosexual married couple received was the $ 255 death benefit .
Estate Taxes
Heterosexual married couples can transfer an unlimited amount of assets to each other during their lives and at death without paying estate taxes .
Everyone else , including married same - sex couples , must pay federal estate taxes on amounts that exceed the 2009 exemption of $ 3.5 million .
Many states also levy their own estate or inheritance taxes , though same - sex couples may be shielded from those in states that recognize their unions .
Our couple lived in New York , where the estate tax exemption is $ 1 million .
And though New York recognizes marriages performed elsewhere , that recognition does not extend to state income or estate taxes .
In our worst case , the gay partner who died first in 2055 left an estate that exceeded the state ’s threshold by $ 171,528 .
That meant a tax bill of $ 43,378 , according to Ron L. Meyers , an estate - planning lawyer with a significant same - sex clientele at Cane , Boniface & Meyers in Nyack , N.Y .
Meanwhile , their identical heterosexual counterparts owed nothing .
The gay couple in our best case had a smaller estate , in part because they were careful to title their home as tenants - in - common , so only the deceased partner ’s half of the home was taxable .
The estate did n’t exceed the federal or state threshold .
So they owed nothing .
Childbearing
Two women who want to have a biological child together need sperm to do it .
They may need to purchase sperm from a bank and use a medical professional to inseminate one of the partners .
There are also adoption costs .
The worst case here totaled $ 40,000 .
It included 12 months of sperm and insemination costs , but the big wild card was the possible need to move to a state where same - sex second - parent adoptions were legal .
While this may seem extreme , couples often do it , according to Joyce Kauffman , a lawyer in Cambridge , Mass. , who has worked with many of them .
We estimated a minimum of $ 20,000 for this cost , including real estate brokerage fees to sell a home and moving costs .
In the best case , there might be no cost at all : the couple could use sperm from a relative of the partner who is n’t bearing the child or from a friend , inseminate at home and take their chances with free legal forms on the Web .
Ms. Kaufman does not recommend such a cavalier approach to vital documents .
The cost for men to have a biological child would be much higher if they used a surrogate .
Pension
We assumed that one partner , in both best and worst cases , received a small pension .
In both cases , the partner with the pension plan died first .
Employers do not have to provide survivor pension benefits to a same - sex spouse , but many do anyway ( which would put our best case at $ 0 ) .
In our worst case , however , the higher - earning partner died first and did not work for such a company .
So the surviving partner got nothing .
A similarly situated heterosexual surviving spouse would receive $ 32,253 before dying herself several years later .
Spousal I.R.A .
You generally need to earn income to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account .
But heterosexual married couples can contribute up to $ 5,000 annually to a spousal I.R.A. for a nonworking spouse .
Stay - at - home gay partners , however , cannot make these contributions .
So they end up with smaller retirement accounts .
We assumed that all the couples would have either saved 7 percent of the stay - at - home parent ’s previous year ’s salary , or $ 5,000 , the maximum contribution .
So the gay couple with one partner who started out earning just $ 30,000 would have saved less ( had she been legally able to ) than someone earning $ 70,000 .
In both cases , that five - year gap in savings early on in the partners ’ lives haunted them later because they were n’t able to benefit from decades of compounding returns .
The couple with the lower - earning partner at home ended up $ 48,654 behind by the time that partner died , assuming she invested in a portfolio mixed equally between stocks and bonds that returned 5.94 percent annually .
The surviving spouse from the gay couple with equal incomes ended up $ 112,192 behind .
Tax Preparation
Instead of filing one joint federal tax return and one state income tax return , same - sex couples must file two sets of returns .
In both best and worst cases , those couples paid an additional $ 12,300 in tax preparation fees over the 46 years they are together .
Financial Planning
Even married same - sex couples are encouraged to create a number of documents that try to replicate the protections and rights of heterosexual marriage because their unions are not universally recognized .
In the worst case , our gay couple spent $ 5,500 more than their heterosexual counterparts on their additional paperwork .
That included a revocable living trust , which is more difficult to contest than a will , and what is known as a pour - over will , which ensured that anything left out of the trust would be included .
They also each set up financial powers of attorney , health care proxies , living wills and a domestic partnership agreement .
In the best case , our couple did n’t spend any more than a prudent heterosexual couple would .
Both couples created two wills , financial powers of attorney , health care proxies and living wills .
Income Taxes
Married heterosexual couples with two working spouses with similar incomes often pay more in federal taxes than if they remained single because of the so - called marriage penalty .
This occurs when a couple ’s combined income pushes them into a higher tax bracket than they would have been in if they filed as singles .
But some couples  especially those with a wide disparity in income or with a stay - at - home parent  usually pay less when they file jointly .
They benefit from what ’s known as a marriage bonus .
In our worst case , where one gay partner earned $ 110,000 and one earned $ 30,000 , the couple paid $ 15,027 less in taxes over their lifetimes than their heterosexual counterparts .
Though the gay and heterosexual married couple had identical salaries , the married couple collected more income in retirement  a direct result of their marriage status  and thus owed more in taxes ( though they still benefited from the marriage bonus ) .
For instance , the married couple collected higher Social Security spousal benefits and survivor benefits , pension income and income derived from a spousal I.R.A .
The gay couples were n’t entitled to any of these benefits .
In our best case , where the partners each earned $ 70,000 , the gay couple paid $ 112,146 less in income taxes .
“ That is the marriage penalty rearing its ugly head , ” Mr. Williams said .

​ U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers on Wednesday found 30 pounds of marijuana stuffed into framed pictures of Jesus Christ at the border with Mexico , reports CNN .
“ This is not the first time we have seen smugglers attempt to use religious figures and articles of faith to further their criminal enterprise , ” said William Molaski , port director of the agency ’s office in El Paso , Texas .
​ Molaski then pulled out all the stops and went for the gold .
Evidently he wants you to rrrrreally dislike these pot-smuggler guys .
“ What some might find offensive or sacrilegious has unfortunately become a standard operating procedure for drug smugglers , ” Molaski sniffed .
“ This would include using religious symbols , children and senior citizens in their attempts to defeat the CBP inspection process . ”
Agents said a 22 - year - old female in a Jeep from Juarez , Mexico told border patrol officers she had nothing to declare besides the framed art .
The border patrol officers checked out the vehicle while Cesar , a federal drug - sniffing dog who probably just vaulted to the top of some Mexican cartel ’s hit list , alerted them to three framed pictures of the Son of God in the vehicle .
The officers pulled the backing off the portraits and found numerous bundles , upon which the woman was arrested .
The bust was one of three marijuana confiscations made Tuesday at the El Paso border crossing .
Agents said they grabbed 214 pounds of pot in the other two busts .

Last week , an Australian federal judge issued a major ruling — the first of its kind worldwide — saying that ISPs are n't required to take action against subscribers after receiving letters alleging copyright infringement .
But lost in most of the discussion of the ruling is another hot topic , net neutrality .
If you want a good look at what a non-neutral ' Net looks like , take a gander at Australia .
The judge 's ruling discussed the business practices of Australia 's third - largest ISP , iiNet , and in doing so reminded non-Aussie readers about a defining feature of Internet life Down Under : bandwidth caps .
Such caps are common around the world , but Australian ISPs take the idea one step further by setting up partnerships with entertainment services and music download companies .
Any data usage directed at one of these favored services does n't count against the monthly bandwidth cap .
Here 's how the judge described iiNet 's version of this service : " When an iiNet user exceeds this quota they are ‘ shaped ’ which means the speed of their connection is slowed to reduce their ability to download because the process of downloading data takes longer .
[ iiNet CEO ]
Mr. Malone deposed that the respondent was the first ISP in Australia to introduce ‘ shaping ’ to control excessive downloading instead of imposing excess usage charges , whereby any downloads over quota would incur a fee per megabyte .
Life in the Freezone
" However , any data downloaded from the Freezone is not included in the monthly quota of a subscriber .
In this sense , an iiNet user can consume unlimited amounts of data from the Freezone per month .
Further , an iiNet user is still able to use as much data at maximum speed as is desired per month in the Freezone , even if that subscriber is otherwise shaped for that month .
The respondent has made a number of agreements with various content providers to make their content available on the Freezone .
For example , the respondent has made an agreement with Apple iTunes . "
Telstra , one of the largest ISPs in the country , has a similar service at its BigPond ISP .
" Get a huge range of entertainment which is Too Big for TV including NRL , AFL , V8 Supercars , Movies , Games , Music and more , " says the company .
" Plus , downloads wo n't count towards your usage allowance . "
Such strategies are n't limited to Australia .
New Zealand ISP
Orcon offers customers access to the O Zone , where downloads do n't count against caps .
And , in a special offer that expired at the end of January 2010 , YouTube content did n't count towards the quota .
The Internet with YouTube ( free for a limited time )
Network nonneutrality
This is quite clearly nonneutral behavior in any sense of the term .
ISPs like iiNet shape traffic when the quota is reached , meaning that all traffic to nonpartner sites is slowed dramatically , while the favored services continue at full speed .
This is n't an outright " blocking " of other websites , which can be freely accessed until the cap is reached , but the effect is quite similar .
How are high - bandwidth services like video streaming going to compete against those services favored by an ISP ?
How will new players ever gain market share ?
Part of Australia 's problem is that many desirable websites exist outside the country ( often in the US or Europe ) , and transit costs over trans - Pacific cables can quickly become ruinous .
Obviously , there are neutral ways to handle this situation .
Straight data caps ( with no exemption for partnered services ) would be one .
Another might be the model seen in South Africa , where ISP Imagine faces the same issue and solves it by offering a two - tier cap : the first 2GB of data can be national or international ; after that , the remaining 28 GB of data on a 30 GB / month plan must all be national .
International traffic is hardcapped .
While the debates may seem esoteric and international , they have an obvious parallel here in the US .
Companies like AT&T are no longer just providers of communications services ; AT&T also offers a full IPTV offering called U - Verse that is delivered over the same line as Internet access .
Both services are IP - based , but AT&T runs them over separate backend networks and prioritizes U - verse traffic on the last - mile journey to the home .
The result : AT&T's own IP video offering looks terrific and can handle multiple HD streams without stuttering , but competing " over - the - top " IP video services like Hulu and YouTube and Netflix are at the mercy of the Internet .
In some ways , this is much like the Australian situation in the sense that an ISP 's preferred service will work much better than some service launched at the edge of the network without the ISP 's blessing .
The FCC 's network neutrality rule - making is now trying to decide how to handle such " managed services " on US networks , and the question is hugely controversial .
Less controversial is the idea that ISPs should not be able to apply this sort of partnership prioritization on the actual Internet part of the connection ( as services like voice and TV migrate to all - IP systems , this increasingly becomes a merely semantic distinction ) .
That 's why American ISPs , even those with bandwidth caps , do n't have " free download " partnerships and why Comcast moved to a protocol - agnostic method for dealing with congestion .
But this is quite clearly not because ISPs prefer such an open world ; as examples from around the world show , unless they are forced to open up due to competition or regulation , ISPs like creating walled gardens and striking up content partnerships .
US ISPs like AT&T have been explicit about this in the past , and have only backed off based on huge public pressure and clear FCC guidance .
As the rule - making moves toward completion , it 's worth remembering what a nonneutral ' Net really looks like .
To those who say that net neutrality is simply a solution in search of a problem , we say : look to countries like Australia and New Zealand .
Recently , a colleague was reviewing an article whose key justification rested on some statistics that seemed dodgy to him , so he came to me for advice .
( I guess my boss , the resident statistician , was out of his office . )
Now , I 'm no expert in frequentist statistics .
My formal schooling in frequentist statistics comes from my undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum -- I would n't rely on it for consulting .
But I 've been working for someone who is essentially a frequentist for a year and a half , so I 've had some hands - on experience .
My boss hired me on the strength of my experience with Bayesian statistics , which I taught myself in grad school , and one thing reading the Bayesian literature voraciously will equip you for is critiquing frequentist statistics .
So I felt competent enough to take a look .
1
The article compared an old , trusted experimental method with the authors ' new method ; the authors sought to show that the new method gave the same results on average as the trusted method .
They performed three replicates using the trusted method and three replicates using the new method ; each replicate generated a real - valued data point .
They did this in nine different conditions , and for each condition , they did a statistical hypothesis test .
( I 'm going to lean heavily on Wikipedia for explanations of the jargon terms I 'm using , so this post is actually a lot longer than it appears on the page .
If you do n't feel like following along , the punch line is three paragraphs down , last sentence . )
The authors used what 's called a Mann - Whitney U test , which , in simplified terms , aims to determine if two sets of data come from different distributions .
The essential thing to know about this test is that it does n't depend on the actual data except insofar as those data determine the ranks of the data points when the two data sets are combined .
That is , it throws away most of the data , in the sense that data sets that generate the same ranking are equivalent under the test .
The rationale for doing this is that it makes the test " non-parametric " -- you do n't need to assume a particular form for the probability density when all you look at are the ranks .
The output of a statistical hypothesis test is a p-value ; one pre-establishes a threshold for statistical significance , and if the the p-value is lower than the threshold , one draws a certain conclusion called " rejecting the null hypothesis " .
In the present case , the null hypothesis is that the old method and the new method produce data from the same distribution ; the authors would like to see data that do not lead to rejection of the null hypothesis .
They established the conventional threshold of 0.05 , and for each of the nine conditions , they reported either " p > 0.05 " or " p = 0.05 " 2 .
Thus they did not reject the null hypothesis , and argued that the analysis supported their thesis .
Now even from a frequentist perspective , this is wacky .
Hypothesis testing can reject a null hypothesis , but cannot confirm it , as discussed in the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article on null hypotheses .
But this is not the real WTF , as they say .
There are twenty ways to choose three objects out of six , so there are only twenty possible p-values , and these can be computed even when the original data are not available , since they only depend on ranks .
I put these facts together within a day of being presented with the analysis and quickly computed all twenty p-values .
Here I only need discuss the most extreme case , where all three of the data points for the new method are to one side ( either higher or lower ) of the three data points for the trusted method .
This case provides the most evidence against the notion that the two methods produce data from the same distribution , resulting in the smallest possible p-value3 : p = 0.05 .
In other words , even before the data were collected it could have been known that this analysis would give the result the authors wanted .

When I canvassed the Open Thread for interest in this article , Douglas Knight wrote : " If it 's really frequentism that caused the problem , please spell this out . "
Frequentism per se is not the proximate cause of this problem , that being that the authors either never noticed that their analysis could not falsify their hypothesis , or they tried to pull a fast one .
But it is a distal cause , in the sense that it forbids the Bayesian approach , and thus requires practitioners to become familiar with a grab - bag of unrelated methods for statistical inference5 , leaving plenty of room for confusion and malfeasance .
Technologos 's reply to Douglas Knight got it exactly right ; I almost jokingly requested a spoiler warning .
1 I do n't mind that it would n't be too hard to figure out who I am based on this paragraph .
I just use a pseudonym to keep Google from indexing all my blog comments to my actual name .
2 It 's rather odd to report a p-value that is exactly equal to the significance threshold , one of many suspicious things about this analysis ( the rest of which I 've left out as they are not directly germane ) .
3 For those anxious to check my math , I 've omitted some blah blah blah about one - and two - sides tests and alternative hypotheses .
4 I quickly emailed the reviewer ; it did n't make much difference , because when we initially talked about the analysis we had noticed enough other flaws that he had decided to recommend rejection .
This was just the icing on the coffin .
5 ... none of which actually address the question OF DIRECT INTEREST ! ... phew .

A new report has preservationists scrambling .
The Independent reports that an international coalition claims that as much as 48 percent of the world ’s 634 primate species are threatened with extinction .
The group just released a list of the top 25 most endangered primates .
How has this happened ?
Destruction of tropical forests , illegal hunting and poachers have contributed to the rapid decline of indigenous primate populations around the globe .
The report calls on governments around the world to take serious action against mass extinction .
Otherwise , our closest relatives in nature will soon be gone .

Close , but no cigar
What 's the meaning of the phrase ' Close , but no cigar ' ?
The expression ' close but no cigar ' is used to indicate that someone has fallen just short of a successful outcome and failed to secure any reward .
What 's the origin of the phrase ' Close , but no cigar ' ?
The phrase , and its variant ' nice try , but no cigar ' , are of US origin and date from the mid-20th century .
Fairground stalls gave out cigars as prizes , and this is the most likely source , although there 's no definitive evidence to prove that .
One of the undoubtedly American phrases that is now used worldwide .
It is very much an American expression and is little used elsewhere in the English - speaking world .
The first recorded use of ' close but no cigar ' in print is in Sayre and Twist 's publishing of the script of the 1935 film version of Annie Oakley :
" Close , Colonel , but no cigar ! "
It appears in U. S. newspapers widely from around 1949 onwards ; for example , a story from The Lima News , Lima , Ohio , November 1949 , where The Lima House Cigar and Sporting Goods Store narrowly avoided being burned down in a fire , was titled ' Close But No Cigar ' .

Picking Up Courtney
by Tim Waggoner " On the q.t. - was I staring at you when the incident occurred ? "
Brent looked at the old woman for a moment , trying to decide if he'd heard her right .
He chose to play it safe and shook his head .
She smiled , relieved .
" Good . "
They stood on the sidewalk in front of Haven Falls Elementary .
Cars zipped by only a few feet from where they stood , drivers ignoring the SLOW : SCHOOL ZONE signs .
For the thousandth time , Brent wondered what genius had decided to build a school on one of the busiest streets in town .
" We bring her here to get her used to the noise . "
The woman had an accent that he could n't place .
He recognized it as European , but that did n't narrow it down much .
She was alone , so Brent was n't sure who the " we " she referred to was , but the " her " was plain enough .
The woman held a thin leash attached to the collar of a tiny tan dachshund .
The animal 's tail was between its legs and it was shivering as if it were the dead of winter instead of early October .
Its eyes were moist , and Brent thought the dog might start crying any second .
" She 's afraid of loud sounds , " the woman said .
" Every day I come to get my granddaughter , and I bring Peanut .
The cars , the children , they make plenty of noise , and we hope she 'll become . . . inoculated ?
No , acclimated , yes , that 's it . "
The dog did n't seem to be doing much " acclimating " to him .
The way it was shivering , it looked like its tiny heart was close to bursting .
Brent glanced at his watch .
2:24 .
Six minutes until the bell rang .
He wished they lived on the bus line .
Dropping off their daughter in the afternoon for half - day kindergarten and picking her up again every school day was getting to be a real drag .
Not to mention cutting into his work .
" Each day , she seems to be a bit better , I think . "
The dog pressed against the woman 's leg and started to whine .
This was better ?
Better than what ?
" I 'm sure she 'll do fine .
It 'll just take a little time is all . "
He did n't pay attention to his own words .
He 'd been a realtor for seven years , and in that time the small talk portion of his brain had become so developed it operated on autopilot .
The woman grinned , displaying slightly crooked teeth that were yellow at the edges .
" Yes , exactly so ! "
Brent had never seen the woman or her dog before .
He was usually five minutes late to pick up Courtney , sometimes ten .
This was the first day he 'd managed to get here early .
At first , he 'd congratulated himself on being a Good Daddy , but now that he was stuck talking with Frau Non Sequitur and the Amazing Vibrating Wiener Dog , he regretted it .
Brent replayed the woman 's strange question in his mind :
On the q.t. - was I staring at you when the incident occurred ?
They 'd been talking about the school 's open house last week .
It had been crowded and hot as hell , far too many glassy - eyed parents trying to cram themselves into closet - sized classrooms to stare at enigmatic creations of construction paper and glue .
It had been so stifling that Sandi , Courtney and he had ducked out early after making a token appearance in Ms. Watson 's class .
Had something happened after they 'd left ?
Perhaps the old woman had fainted from the heat .
Naturally , she would 've been embarrassed by such an incident , and confused as well .
She might have seen him in the hall earlier and later could n't recall whether or not he'd been there when she 'd fainted .
Then again , maybe she suffered from Alzheimer 's or something .
Or maybe she simply was a loon .
It did n't matter .
A few more minutes - three , to be precise - and Courtney would come running through the school 's glass front doors , and he'd hustle her into their mini-van and get the hell out of here .
The dachshund 's whining grew louder , it pushed harder against the old woman 's leg , as if it hoped it might be able to slip its molecules in between its owner 's and vanish into her flesh .
Brent wondered if he were making it more nervous , if he should excuse himself and walk away .
But the little dog yapped then and nipped at the old woman 's leg .
Not hard enough to draw blood through the woman 's slacks , probably not even hard enough to make a dent in her skin .
Still , the old woman scowled , her lips contracting into a tight ring of flesh that made him think of a puckered anus .
" Bad Peanut .
Nasty Peanut . "
Her tone was calm , but her eyes glittered with anger .
She began wrapping the leash around her hand , taking up the slack until the black leather strand was taut .
Brent thought she would stop there , but she did n't .
She continued winding the leash around her hand , pulling Peanut 's head upward , baggy skin wrinkling around the collar .
The dog 's front paws lifted off the ground , dangling almost daintily before it rose onto its haunches , sitting the way dachshunds do when they beg .
Brent thought she would finally stop there , but she kept wrapping , her fingers now starting to redden and swell .
Peanut rose onto her feet , then her tiptoes , and then there was space between her hind feet and the concrete of the sidewalk .
Not much , maybe just enough to slide a child 's construction paper drawing under , but it did n't matter how much space was between Peanut and the ground , did it ?
When you 're at the end of a noose - and that 's what the leash had become - a few inches is the same as a hundred feet .
Peanut hung slack , not struggling , oddly calm after her earlier display of terror .
The only sign that she was strangling was the way her wet black eyes bulged forth from their sockets .
Dark streaks rolled from the corners of those eyes , and Brent realized that the dog was crying at last .
The bell rang then , snapping him out of his daze .
He reached for the old woman 's wrist , intending to make her drop the dog .
But before he could close his fingers around her arm , she opened her hand , releasing the coils she 'd gathered , and Peanut fell back to the ground , back paws first , then front .
She did n't gasp , did n't pant for air .
But she started shivering again .
He looked up at the old woman .
She smiled at him as if she had n't just tried to strangle her dog .
" What the hell -" he started .
" Daddy ! "
He turned at the sound of his daughter 's voice , saw her running down the school 's front walk toward him , so beautiful she shone like a star among the crowd of awkward , mussed - haired kids around her .
" Lovely child , " the old woman said , then she turned and walked off , heading away from the school .
A girl with long black hair broke out of the pack of running , laughing children and jogged in her direction .
She caught up with the old woman and fell in step beside her , but neither of them spoke .
And , Brent noticed , the girl did n't reach down to give the dog a hello pat , did n't so much as acknowledge the animal 's presence .
A tug on his sleeve .
" Daddy , what 's wrong ?
Are n't you glad to see me ? "
Courtney gave him the pout which he always called her monkey face .
He knelt down and kissed his daughter on the cheek , grateful she had n't seen the old woman abusing her dog .
" Course I am , Pumpkin .
You have a good day at school ? "
" I sure did ! "
He stood , held out his hand .
She took it and they started toward the car .
" What did you do today ? " he asked .
" I do n't know .
I do n't remember . "
It was her stock answer , one he usually teased her about , but today he said , " That 's nice . "
He watched the old woman , her granddaughter , and Peanut continue down the sidewalk , and again he heard the strange question she asked , saw Peanut 's tear - slick bulging eyes , and without realizing it , he gripped his daughter 's hand tighter .
The next morning , Brent told his wife he was getting backed up at work and asked if she could pick up Courtney after school .
Sandi said she could n't take off in the middle of the day , he knew that .
She 'd just started back to work at the doctor 's office full time only a month and a half ago .
She could n't start asking off yet .
They 'd argued a little , but it did n't go far .
Brent could n't tell his wife the real reason he wanted her to get Courtney was because he did n't want to see the old woman and her dog again .
He knew he would n't be able to make her understand ; hell , he did n't understand it himself .
That afternoon , Brent arrived at the school ten minutes early .
He wanted to pick up Courtney and get the hell out of there before the old woman showed up and did something else disturbing - something his daughter might see this time .
He parked at the curb and sat in his van , thinking about why his encounter with the old woman yesterday had so unsettled him .
He supposed it had something to do with the death of his uncle .
When Brent was nine , his Uncle Larry -- or " Red " as everyone called him - was like a father to him .
More so than his real father , who was a salesman and always on the road .
His dad never had time to play catch with Brent , teach him how to throw a football , take him fishing .
But Uncle Red had time , and even when he did n't , he still found a way to make it .
Brent had loved Red , practically to the point of worship .
And then one day Red went to the doctor 's for a check - up .
The physician saw Red , gave him a clean bill of health , and then Red went out into the reception area , sat down and waited for his name to be called so he could pay his bill .
He never got up again .
His heart gave out , the doctor said , and he died instantly , probably did n't feel a thing .
As if that were any consolation .
Red had seemed so healthy , so full of life .
His death struck Brent as so unfair , so damn absurd that he had himself a nine - year - old 's version of an existential crisis .
He questioned whether life had any meaning , if there was any design in the universe , or if existence was nothing more than raw , blind chance .
Eventually , he 'd come to uneasy terms with his grief , and as he got older , he came to believe that life did have meaning , even if people had to make that meaning for themselves .
But something about the old woman 's crazy behavior had dredged up feelings he thought dead and buried long ago - feelings that life was utterly random and without purpose .
Now here he was , hiding in his van like a frightened child .
He kept an eye out for the old woman - how could he not ?
But he did n't see her .
Others parents got out of their cars , walked toward the school 's main entrance with the steady , deliberate paces of adults who'd rather not be here but could n't be anywhere else .
He looked at the digital clock on the dashboard .
2:29 .
He turned off the engine , removed the key from the ignition , and got out of the van .
He stayed close to the vehicle for a moment , watching traffic , scowling at the drivers who sped by .
Idiots .
Did n't they know that in less than a minute the sidewalk was going to be full of kids ?
Did n't they care ?
He walked around the van and started toward the entrance , looking around for the old woman and Peanut without trying to look like he was looking .
He did n't see them , and let out a relieved breath of air that he had n't realized he'd been holding .
He reached the front doors , nodded to the other parents - mostly moms - standing outside .
He did n't know any of them well enough to start a conversation , and he did n't feel like trying , especially not after what had happened yesterday .
He just wanted to get Courtney and take her back to daycare .
There was a sign on one of the glass doors .
WE'D APPRECIATE IT IF PARENTS COULD REMAIN OUTSIDE UNTIL THE BELL .
TEACHERS ARE CONDUCTING CLASS UNTIL 2:30 AND HAVING VISITORS IN THE HALL ARE DISTRACTING .
He frowned .
He 'd noticed the sign before but had never paid much attention to it .
The grammar error annoyed him .
He expected better from the school his daughter attended .
The bell rang .
Several seconds passed and then the doors banged open .
Kids wearing and carrying backpacks came flooding out , faces beaming with a tired joy at being free again .
Courtney came though the doorway , her Barbie backpack slung over her shoulder at a sassy angle .
She looked so grown up .
Brent had no trouble imagining her looking much the same when she was in college , sass and all .
She saw him , smiled .
" Hi , Daddy ! " " Hi , Pumpkin . "
He reached out to tousle her hair , but she gave him a look that said , I 'm not a baby , and he withdrew .
Five years old , and already she does n't want me touching her , he thought .
He started to ask her how class had gone ( though he knew darn well how she 'd answer ) but before he could , she dropped her backpack at his feet and ran off after a red - haired girl calling , " Kristie ! Kristie ! "
The girl turned , grinned , shucked off her backpack , shouted , " You 're it ! " and took off running across the school 's front lawn .
Courtney followed close behind , both girls alternately shrieking and giggling .
They did n't have time for this , Brent thought .
He did n't have time .
But then again , he did n't want to tear Courtney away from her friend .
He hesitated , unsure what to do .
He reached up , scratched the dry skin at the side of his nose , an old nervous habit .
Three minutes , he decided , no more .
He checked his watch to mark the time .
He watched the girls play , sometimes following the rules of tag , other times abandoning them entirely just to run and make noise .
He envied their ability to be so alive , so wholly in the moment .
Courtney , who'd been about to tag Kristie on the elbow , stopped and looked to her right .
" Doggie ! " she squealed , and started running , Kristie right behind .
Brent looked in the direction they were headed , saw Peanut , saw the old woman .
They stood in roughly the same spot as yesterday , Peanut shivering against her owner 's leg , the old woman smiling as the girls came pounding across the grass toward her .
Brent started moving before the girls reached Peanut .
He felt an urge to run , but he checked it .
He did n't want to alarm the other parents or startle the old woman .
It was a cliché - do n't make any sudden moves - but that 's exactly what his instincts were telling him now , so he walked across the lawn at a measured Goldilocks ' pace : not too fast , not too slow , keeping his gaze firmly fixed on the old woman the entire time .
Courtney fell to her knees before Peanut , making the poor dog jump , and began rubbing its side .
" Good dog , you 're a good dog , are n't you , you cutey - wooty - wooty . "
Kristie started petting the dog's other side , adding her own variations to Courtney 's baby - talk patter .
The old woman looked down at them , still smiling , but there was something about her expression that made Brent 's spine go cold and tingly .
Nothing overt - it was n't as if her eyes were wild , her teeth bared in a snarl , froth bubbling forth over her lips .
There was just something wrong about it .
She said something to the girls , but Brent was n't in earshot yet .
Whatever it was - and it might be any crazy thing , might n't it ?
Another non sequitur , or perhaps a bark of profanity ala a tourette 's sufferer - the girls did n't hear or chose not to respond , so caught up were they in their doggie love fest .
The old woman looked up as he approached and smiled .
Brent had no idea what to say to her , but Courtney saved him from having to think of something .
" Daddy , I want a dog , can we have a dog , pleeeeeeeeeease ? "
" We 'll see , Pumpkin . "
His reply was as automatic and unthinking as the outgoing message tape on an answering machine .
Brent found himself staring at the dachshund 's neck , scrutinizing the hide around and beneath the collar .
The skin looked fine , but then it was covered with fur , was n't it ?
" Peanut seems to like you girls , " the woman said .
" Maybe you could come over to my house sometime and help to give her some exercise , yes ?
Chase her in the backyard , throw the ball for her to fetch , put sharp little sticks into her behind .
Would n't that be fun ? "
Brent was shocked .
He looked at the girls , but they still did n't seem to be paying any attention to the old woman , thank Christ .
" That 's enough now . "
Brent leaned down , took each girl by an arm and pulled them away from Peanut .
" Aw , Dad - dee ! " " We need to get going , Sweetie , and I 'm sure your friend does , too . "
He spoke to his daughter , but he kept his eyes on the old woman as they backed away .
" And this nice lady has come to pick up her granddaughter , and we should let her be about her business . "
He kept backing away , towing the girls with him .
The old woman continued smiling .
It was as if her face were made of wax and permanently molded into that expression .
" The mirror 's cracked , you know . "
" That 's nice . "
He kept moving , kept hold of the girls , who were starting to squirm .
" It always has been , " the old woman continued .
" But now the cracks are spreading .
Growing wider and deeper , yes ?
It 's only a matter of time before the glass breaks . "
" I really had n't noticed .
Bye now . "
He turned and led the girls back toward the school .
Kristie 's ride evidently had n't gotten here yet , and he could n't bring himself to leave the girl alone with that crazy bitch .
He decided that Courtney and he could wait inside with Kristie until her mom , dad or whoever came .
Besides , he wanted to be near other people .
Other people were safe , other people were sane .
" Daddy !
You 're hurting my arm ! "
Courtney whined .
Brent did n't loosen his grip , was afraid the girls would take off if he did .
He kept his hold until they had passed through the front doors and stood inside the lobby .
He turned and peered through the glass , saw the woman looking at him , smiling her wrong smile .
Her granddaughter now stood at her side , and there was something odd about her face : the skin was yellow - tinged , and the girl 's expression was slack .
Peanut was squirming , as if in pain , and then Brent saw why .
The old woman was grinding the dog's tail beneath her shoe .
A little after eleven that night , Courtney woke up , complaining that her tummy hurt .
They 'd eaten fast food that night , and the greasy glop had made Courtney constipated .
Sandi marched straight for the medicine chest only to find they were out of laxative .
So Brent threw on his windbreaker , hopped into the min-van , and headed for the grocery in search of gentle , soothing relief for his daughter .
While Bellwether was n't huge - few towns were in southwestern
Ohio - it was big enough to have a twenty - four hour grocery .
He parked as close as he could and crossed to the entrance , looking right , then left , keeping an eye out .
For what , he was n't sure .
Once inside , he got a cart and steered it into the produce section .
He was here for laxative , but Sandi figured why waste a grocery trip ?
She 'd given him a list of a dozen must - have items that they could n't get along without for another day .
He got bananas , a bag of gala apples , and a single lemon - he had no idea why just one , but he put it in the cart .
As he made his way toward the bread , he passed a middle - aged woman whose face looked as if someone had grabbed the corners of her eyes from behind and pulled backward .
It was like her picture had been scanned into a computer , then stretched horizontally a few clicks .
It could n't be some sort of deformity , could it ?
Plastic surgery , maybe a botched face lift ?
The woman noticed Brent staring and scowled , the expression making the distorted , taut flesh of her face bend and twist as if she were her own funhouse mirror .
Brent looked away and moved on .
In the dairy aisle , he saw a bearded man with a gauze bandage over his left eye .
There was a wet patch in the middle of the bandage , and as Brent watched , it widened , as if the eye - or whatever was behind the bandage - was seeping something fierce .
And it appeared the gauze pulsated slightly , like the skin on top of a newborn 's head where the skull has n't grown together yet .
The man looked at Brent , opened his mouth to speak , but Brent hurried on before he could hear what the man had to say .
In the pharmacy section , he got a bottle of Philips Milk of Magnesia ( cherry flavored ) and put it into the cart with his other groceries .
He reached into his coat pocket and took out Sandi 's list .
He double - checked to make sure he 'd gotten everything .
Without thinking , he reached up to scratch the dry skin on the side of his nose and was rewarded with a sharp pain .
" Damn it ! "
He pulled his hand away , examined the finger , saw it was dotted with blood .
Perfect .
Just perfect .
Keeping one finger pressed against his nose , he tried pushing his cart one - handed toward the front of the store where the restroom was .
But the cart , though far from full , was too awkward to steer , and he said fuck it and left it where it was .
He 'd come back and get it after he 'd tended to his scratch .
In the men 's room , he stepped up to the sink , tore a brown paper towel from the dispenser on the wall , and pressed it to his nose .
The paper was coarse , and his scratch stung , but at least the towel absorbed the blood .
He removed the towel , turned it around to a dry patch , and pressed it against his cut once more .
He pressed harder this time , hoping to force the blood to clot faster .
He looked at his reflection in the mirror over the sink , thought of the old woman 's parting words today .
But the cracks are spreading .
Wider and deeper , yes ?
It 's only a matter of time before the glass breaks .
He half expected to find a crack in the glass somewhere , but its surface was unmarred and surprisingly clean for a public restroom .
He could n't shake the feeling that the old woman had tried to impart some manner of vital knowledge to him this afternoon .
He thought of Stretch - Face and Mr. Eye Patch .
In a way , they were like the old woman : a glimpse into something that lay beyond the seeming normalcy of the everyday and into . . .
Whatever was on the other side of the mirror .
Brent hoped they'd have to keep Courtney home from school the next day .
At this point , he'd be glad to take the time off from work , and to hell with the effect on his sales percentage , just so long as he did n't have to go near that school .
But come dawn , the laxative had done its job , and Courtney felt fine .
Brent dropped her off at daycare , and then spent the rest of the morning chauffeuring a couple around to look at some houses .
They talked to each other , mostly ignoring him .
After a while , he became aware of a strange , almost inaudible sound that accompanied their voices when they spoke , like the hiss and crackle of radio static , or the electronic noise of a modem trying to connect .
He had the sense that this secondary sound he was hearing was their true voices , that they were n't really saying anything at all , just exchanging bursts of white noise .
By the time he parted ways with the couple , they still had n't settled on a house , but he 'd picked up a throbbing headache .
He 'd worked through lunch without realizing it , and now he did n't have time to grab anything eat , not if wanted to be on time to pick up Courtney .
He drove to the school , doing five miles under the speed limit without being aware of it .
He pulled up to the curb , parked , and sat , gripping the wheel so tight his knuckles bulged white .
He experienced an urge to put the key back in the ignition , turn it , put the van in gear , and roar away from the curb , leaving Courtney behind .
He 'd pick a direction - it did n't matter which one - and keep driving until he ran out of gas .
He reached up and rubbed the scab alongside his nose , and tried to ignore the pounding in his head as he thought .
He was n't going to abandon his daughter , of course .
If he did , he would be a Bad Daddy , and he could n't bear that .
He got out of the van and closed the door .
There was the normal chunk !
Of the door shutting , but beneath it was the sound of fingernails raking a chalkboard .
Another crack , another glimpse ?
Stop it , he told himself .
Just goddamn stop it .
An old lady says a couple weird things , abuses her shivery little mutt , and he ends up doubting his own sanity .
Hell , doubting the nature of reality itself .
That was the insane part .
He lived in a world of rules and structure , of mathematics , of laws , regulations , statutes , custom and convention .
The alphabet had twenty - six letters , there were 365 days in a year , and thirty days hath September . . .
September . . . and several other goddamned months .
The mirror was n't cracked because there was n't any dumbass mirror in the first place .
The world was the world and what you saw was what you got .
If you wanted meaning , you had to make your own , simple as that .
But by God , once you made it , it was real .
Right now , his meaning was Courtney , and he was here to pick her up .
He headed up the walkway to the front door of the school .
He did n't see the old woman around , and he was more grateful for that than he liked .
There were no other parents standing outside today .
It was a bit nippy out , and he supposed the others had decided to wait in their cars .
He glanced at the faded print - out he had noticed yesterday , saw it now read : INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AUTOPSY AND POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION OF THE AVERAGE KINDERGARTENER .
What followed were simple step - by - step instructions accompanied by appropriate full - color diagrams .
Brent stared at the poster , willed it to return to normal , but it did n't .
He looked away , shivering like Peanut .
The bell rang .
On one level , it sounded the same as always , but on another it sounded like jackhammers biting into ancient , brittle bone .
Along the curb , parents and caregivers got out to meet their little ones .
At the same time , as if on cue , the school doors banged open and children poured forth .
He watched for Courtney , afraid to see her , afraid of what she might look like to him in his present state .
But there she was , looking as beautiful and happy as always , eyes bright , smile wide .
She ran over and hugged him , and she felt so good , so normal that he hugged her back too hard .
She made an oof !
sound and pulled back .
She grinned , smacked him lightly on the back of his hand .
She said , " You 're it ! " and ran off .
He called after her , shouted that he did n't want to play , not today , but she kept running across the lawn , crunching leaves , hair flying behind her .
He hesitated , unsure what to do .
If he gave chase , she 'd just run all the faster .
But if he did n't go after her , she 'd keep running and laughing until she grew tired of the game , and he wanted to get out of here right now , before - The old woman came strolling up the walkway , Peanut plodding along at her side .
She held the dog's leash gently and the dachshund seemed in good spirits , was even wagging her tail a little , turning her head this way and that to look at all the children gabbing , playing and laughing as they slowly dispersed .
He wanted to run , wanted to hide .
Instead , he started walking toward the old woman .
He managed to keep from shaking , but his forehead was slick with sweat , and he could feel it trickling down his face .
He met her in the middle of the walkway .
She smiled pleasantly and Peanut kept wagging her tail .
" Look , I do n't know what hell is wrong with you , and I do n't care .
But I 'd appreciate it if you 'd stay the fuck away from me and especially from my daughter .
You got that , you crazy bitch ? "
He looked for Courtney , saw she 'd hooked up with Kristie and they were playing tag now , her slow - poke Daddy forgotten for the moment .
The woman did n't reply ; she just kept smiling .
Her granddaughter walked up , backpack slung over her shoulder .
The old woman looked down at her .
" Ready to go , dear ? "
The girl did n't respond .
Her face was slack , her skin yellow - pale , eyes roiling circles of darkness .
He had the impression he could poke his finger into the churning inkwells of her eye sockets if he wished .
" I think Peanut might like to run a little .
Should we let her off the leash for some exercise ? "
" Sure , Grammy , that 'd be fun ! "
The girl was normal now .
Face animated , eyes a rich brown .
" Go ahead , " the old woman said .
The girl unhooked the dachshund from the leash .
For a second , Peanut just stood there , not realizing she was free .
Then she took off , tiny legs pumping as she flew across the grass .
The granddaughter squealed and ran after the dog .
Other kids noticed , shouted , laughed and also took up the chase .
Peanut wove between their legs , avoiding little hands desperate to grab hold of dog fur .
Courtney had joined the pack , was at the head of it .
" Stop , Doggie !
I want to pet you ! " she pleaded .
She got close , reached out , her fingertips brushed fur , but then Peanut put on a burst of speed .
She zigged left , and squealing with delight , Courtney followed .
Peanut dashed between two parked cars and out into the street .
Brent shouted something .
It might have been " No ! " or " Look out ! " but it just as easily might have been an inarticulate cry of horror .
Tires squealed , there was a sickening , muffled thump !
and Peanut came trotting back between the parked cars and onto the sidewalk , looking pleased with herself .
Horns honking , kids screaming , parents running into the street .
Traffic stopped , and drivers got out of their cars , faces frozen in shock .
Brent ran into the street , knelt beside the wet red thing that had been his daughter , cradled it in his arms .
The old woman was standing beside him .
" You lied to me , did n't you ? " she said softly .
" You were staring at me when the incident occurred . "
In his mind , Brent answered yes , but what came out of his mouth instead was the sound of shattering glass .
Marc Thiessen Truly Has No Idea What He ’s Talking About on Interrogation
Created : February 22 , 2010 11:59 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Watch the former Bush speechwriter and torture enthusiast on “ Morning Joe ” today .
His first point is that President Obama is endangering the country because the Pakistanis are n’t getting intelligence from captured Taliban deputy commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar .
What he does n’t mention is that intelligence from Baradar , reportedly , directly led to the capture of Mulvi Kabir , one of the ten most wanted Taliban leaders .
This was reported yesterday and Thiessen just ignores it .
Then he avers that Obama ’s rejection of torture has cost U.S. interrogators “ any tools at our disposal ” to “ compel ” information out of terrorist captures .
Except that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the would - be bomber of Northwest Flight 253 , is cooperating with his interrogators after they used pressure from his family to compel that cooperation .
Also , the elite interrogators of the High - Value Detainee Interrogation Group will surely be surprised to hear they have no available tools for interrogating a resistant detainee .
Then he says that torture stopped an attempted attack on the Los Angeles library tower , a misstatement that has been so thoroughly debunked it raises questions about Thiessen ’s honesty .
Then Daniel Freedman — a former Rudy Giuliani aide , aide to ex-FBI counterterrorist agent Ali Soufan and torture opponent , more than ably points out that despite the torture of senior al - Qaeda captives like Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , several attacks in Europe and throughout the Middle East nevertheless occurred .
To say nothing of al - Qaeda ’s demonstrable reconstitution in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
And Thiessen — a former speechwriter — wants to credibly contend that torture is the difference between security and insecurity .
“ The problem Marc has is that he takes things out of context and does n’t read the full documents , ” Freedman observes .
Yet he ’s your newest Washington Post columnist .
Watch the whole thing — especially when Marc Thiessen implies that he knows more about interrogation than Gen. David Petraeus .
And shame on Joe Scarborough for portraying Soufan , a man who has actually broken up al - Qaeda cells , as a “ guy who writes a lot ” and not one of the most experienced counterterrorists in American history :
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
I ’m sorry , just one more thing .
Thiessen objects to the use of the non-torture techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual on Interrogation against the highest - value detainees because the manual is “ on the Internet ” and terrorists can train against it .
That ’s just a flat - out misunderstanding of the field manual in particular and the interrogations process itself .
The field manual does not and never has required only the use of those techniques it lists , but it proscribes physical and psychological abuse .
That ’s why people like Abdulmutallab can , say , have their parents ’ opprobrium be used against them , a technique not explicitly listed in the field manual but still legally and morally kosher — and proven to be effective .
1 ) House and Senate leadership have nearly finished negotiating a new compromise version of their legislation .
The text the administration plans to post will reflect that compromise .
2 ) House and Senate leadership are still struggling to come to an agreement , if not over what to pass then in what sequence to pass it .
The administration hopes this promise will force them to wrap things up .
Actually , conversations with various sources over the weekend make me think the truth is some combination , although I 'm relying on people who , in many cases , admit they 're not entirely sure themselves .
( That could be because not very many people know - - or because I 'm just not talking to the right people . )
But it seems to me that either interpretation would constitute progress of a sort .
If it 's ( 1 ) , the House and Senate have finally worked out most of their differences .
If it 's ( 2 ) , President Obama is starting to give them the shove they need .
Many insiders , including quite a few Hill staffers , have been saying for a while that it will take White House intervention to break the impasse .
And , until now , that intervention has n't been evident .
While I 'm busy playing both Bioshock 2 and Heavy Rain for future reviews , forum - goer and Ars Riot Squad member Casey Crouch has been playing the hell out of the PlayStation 3 exclusive MAG and has shared this thoughts on the final product .
At Sony 's 2008 E3 press conference , the company unveiled a new game from veteran developer Zipper , simply titled MAG .
The game 's selling point is its 256 - player capacity , where every gunshot and every explosion on the battlefield that you hear is the direct action of another player .
After a long wait , Zipper 's freshman effort for the PlayStation 3 is on store shelves , and the war among global private military contractors is about to begin .
The game takes place in the not - too - distant - future , when nations are tired of funding very expensive militaries and decide it 's time to outsource .
Through corporate consolidation , mergers , and buyouts , we 're left with three dominate PMCs who are engaging in a global shadow war to damage each other 's reputations , operations , and technology , all in the name of increasing their own share price .
The whole endeavor obviously goes afoul , open warfare begins , and gamers cry out a collective " I told you so ! "
Granted , the story may not be the most unique in recent years , but it does its job of providing a backdrop for pitting three warring factions against one another .
Unfortunately , the game does n't quite deliver on its promise of an online persistent war , at least from what we 've seen thus far .
MAG 's presentation is absolutely standard fare for a modern FPS .
The engine 's rendering prowess is competent by today 's standards but is hardly a standout ; its art direction is lackluster .
The important thing is that the game handles draw distances well , though the lighting model has a tendency to break down at longer distances .
This is most noticeable when looking out from most spawn cameras at the distant structures and trees , or when looking down a sniper scope at a distant target and seeing shadows pop in and out .
In many ways , MAG shows itself as a development studio's first effort on the current hardware .
Previous - generation annoyances rear their ugly heads : unreasonable invisible barriers to terrain that seems most certainly accessible , and static terrain that cannot be moved , bent , or broken .
Do n't try to break through a small wooden fence with an APC , or shoot an enemy through a sheet of plywood with a rocket launcher .
This is in stark contrast to the living and destructible world of Bad Company 2 , an upcoming title that has its own share of buzz .
The game is not without its glitches as well .
I 've fallen through the map while crawling prone over a ridge , and have taken damage and been killed after having bumped into another player .
Though these were one - time events , it is entirely possible that their causes will be identified , isolated , made repeatable , and used for nefarious means before being patched .
MAG is a strictly an online shooter ; if the servers are down , you wo n't have access to your stats , armory , or even the anemic single player tutorial .
The mechanics are all functional , though it should be noted that the controls are a little weightier , closer to Killzone 2 than Modern Warfare 2 .
Other than the previously mentioned basic training level where you learn simple things like crouching , jumping , aiming , and running , every deployment option will pit you against online opponents .
Killing enemies , healing and resurrecting allies , repairing structures , and accomplishing objectives will reward experience points to level your character .
Standard fare thus far , but where MAG differs from current offerings is that when you gain a level you are given a skill point which you are then free to spend anywhere accessible in your skill tree .
The skill tree is basic , but offers a wide variety of options with which to equip your five loadouts .
Another nice touch is that you can easily earn more XP through support actions and objectives , which almost always advance the battle in your side 's favor , instead of outright combat .
Support roles are very important , as a high KDR alone will not win matches .
The first few hours of MAG are truly a grind , you 'll need to rank up to level 8 to open all the modes and get enough weapons and skills to start adding real variance to your loadouts .
There is also a bit of a learning curve to the controls , which can often feel borderline unresponsive in an intense firefight .
After leveling up , however , the game really begins and you start to see the importance of teamwork .
Zipper did a good job of building a HUD and corresponding command system that facilitates good teamwork .
Of course , these tools are only as good as the players using them .
When leaders fail to set target objectives or call in support , the match often ends very quickly .
Playing with people that you know , with headsets , can make for a very effective squad , which adds a lot of fun to the game , but it 's often not enough to make up for ineffective upper management to turn the tide of the larger 256 - player battles .
MAG offers a fairly basic clan system , though it functions more as a party system than a true clan system .
The strong emphasis on teamwork has attracted a lot of SOCOM players to the title , as evidenced by the squad banter about the recently released SOCOM Confrontation map pack .
MAG is likely to pull more players away from SOCOM than Modern Warfare 2 .
MAG is a flawed experience , which is unfortunate considering the stiff competition it is already facing from Modern Warfare 2 and will soon face from Battlefield Bad Company 2 .
It 's hard to overlook the inconvenience of being kicked back out to the main menu at the end of every match , or not to notice the way your gun skips a few frames of animation to seemingly teleport to the iron sights view .
That does n't mean the game is not fun .
It 's hard not to smile the first time you airdrop back into a match , gliding your parachute towards an objective while hundreds of people scurry below you , or feel a smug sense of self - satisfaction as your squad quickly takes an objective .
MAG is also surprising addictive because of the combination of its skill tree and loadout mechanics .
MAG has been compared to many other games , but it 's the feeling of being just one soldier in a greater conflict , just trying to complete your objectives and stay alive , that truly makes it special .
news Snap of Napping TTC Collector Causes Kerfuffle
Photo by Jason Wieler .
Jason Wieler snapped the photo above — of an apparently sleeping TTC ticket collector — on January 9 at 9:46 p.m. at McCowan Station .
Wieler , sick for the past few weeks , but eager to share “ with a few buddies ” who follow him on Twitter , “ finally got around to posting it ” today , tweeting it before noon with the caption “ Yup , love how my TTC dollars R being spent … ”
From there and then , you can guess what happened next .
Reached over the phone on Thursday night as he headed towards the subway downtown , Wieler explained what happened : “ I actually was coming home .
I was actually doing some work for my website ” — OGLE Toronto — ” and , lo and behold , I got off the train … and there ’s this dude just conked out .
And I said , ‘ you gotta be kidding me . ’
I thought I was on Candid Camera or something like that .
So I snapped a pic [ and ] got a few laughs out of it . ”
The collector , Wieler guesses , was asleep for at least a “ solid five minutes ” while he was at the station .
“ When you look at the photo , his mouth was wide open .
You only get that way when you ’re totally conked out , right ? ”
When asked what the impulse was to share the pic to a limitless audience , Wieler explained that it was originally intended for his friends , though he shared it with the recent fare hike in mind , which he says “ a lot of people are a bit upset ” about .
“ And , of course , in today ’s age , ” he adds , “ hey , whatever you put out there , who knows how fast it spreads and how quickly it catches on ?
[ On ] second thought , looking back on how crazy this thing took off I should have knew better , because obviously people have some high feelings about what ’s going on right now ….
but originally I just wanted to share with a few buddies , ‘ what gives ? ’ that type of thing . ”
Reached for comment , TTC director of communications Brad Ross said that he had seen the photo .
“ It is of great concern to us , ” Ross wrote in an email .
“ We ’re looking into it …. the matter will be addressed .
I ca n’t say any more than that right now . ”
Wieler says that this is the first time he ’s seen a TTC worker “ totally out of it , ” but that he hopes that whatever the outcome of his photo is , it ’s not a job lost for the conductor he photographed .
“ I did n’t want to get the dude in trouble … that was n’t my intent of course ; I know that this guy ’s probably got a mortgage and kids .
No one wants to take away someone else ’s work .
But on the flip side , I ’m still rubbed a bit the wrong way when it comes to the fare hike and I thought we got a raw deal on that .
It ’s a fine line : you do n’t want to get the guy in trouble — that was n’t my intent originally to do that . ”
But , he adds , “ I was n’t the one sleeping . ”
Goaltending .
It 's always the problem .
We know this , and there 's no reason to look back at all the goaltending failures we 've seen over the last ... 23 or so years .
( For the record and on the subject , we 've changed the slogan on the site for the first time this season ! )
On Tuesday night in Nashville , though , our little three - ring goalie circus got a little more absurd when Michael Leighton left the game in the first period with what 's being reported as a high - ankle sprain .
As Brian Boucher came into the game with nobody to back him up , word first got out via the Daily News that Johan Backlund was injured up in Glens Falls .
We had just spoken with Tim McManus at the Post - Star for 40 minutes in an interview for BSH Radio and he had n't mentioned a word about Backlund 's injury , so things were questionable .
As it turns out , it appears Backlund did indeed look a little injured in overtime on Sunday and after an off day on Monday , he missed practice on Tuesday .
So then , everybody scrambled to figure out who would be the emergency call up instead of Backlund .
It appears now that it 'll be AHL backup Jeremy Duchesne instead of the other possibility , an emergency call up of QMJHL goalie Nic Riopel .
His team , Moncton , is set to make a lot of noise and run at the Memorial Cup .
With the playoffs starting on Friday , that would 've been less than ideal for Moncton and likely for Riopel 's development .
Also , as was pointed out in the game thread last night , signing Riopel to a deal with the Flyers may not have even been possible .
Because of this , Duchesne seems to be the ideal choice .
He 's not going to be playing anyway unless Boucher gets injured , and since he 's been backing up Backlund in Glens Falls for a while now , I 'm sure his door opening abilities are top notch .
As this carousel continues to spin around the Flyers in Philadelphia , Glens Falls , Nashville and Dallas , one of our scouts is across the pond in Europe on the look out for the next goaltending prospect to add to the system .
His name is Jussi Rynnäs , he 's 22 , and Flyers scout Neil Little is in Finland for the rest of the week watching him play .
As reported by the reliable Teemu H , also known as @euroflyers on Twitter , Little confirmed that the Flyers are interested in his services .
" We are interested in Rynnäs " , Little confirms .
" Several NHL teams are .
I believe he 'll get an NHL contract but he 's not NHL ready yet . "
So who is Jussi Rynnäs ?
We 'll try to answer that question after the jump .
Rynnäs a rookie of the year candidate in SM - liiga , the top league in Finland .
He plays for
a poor Ässät club , where in 31 games he 's compiled a 2.50 goals against average and a .929 save percentage .
He 's 6 ' 4 " , 203 pounds .
HFBoards can be an unreliable source of information at times , but in a lot of cases , you can tell when somebody has watched a player play the game .
That seems to be the case here with an HF member named Tormentor .
Here 's a little scouting report on Rynnäs .
NHL teams are noticing , and there are also reports that the Stars have interest .
The Dallas report says that Rynnäs will be available to become a free agent this upcoming summer , and we should probably expect him to get a lot of looks .
It 's nice to see that the Flyers are showing a bit of interest as well .
Besides , with Mika Pyörälä in Adirondack , the Flyers are in serious need of umlauts .
Bush ’s Northern Ireland intervention
Earlier today , former U.S. President George W. Bush called British conservative leader David Cameron to try to convince him to urge his allies in the Northern Irish Ulster Unionist party to support a deal that would give the government in Belfast control over police .
As one source told the Guardian , " This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post - presidency period . "
Declan Kelly , the U.S. economic envoy to Northern Ireland aparrently asked Bush to make the call after the White House became increasingly concerned over Belfast ’s inability to strike a deal .
It might seem odd that Bush would choose break his radio silence on Northern Ireland , an issue on which his track record is n’t well known .
But as the Guardian ’s Henry Macdonald writes , his role in the peace process is more substantial than many realize :
Nationalist Ireland has enjoyed a love affair with former US president Bill Clinton since the earliest days of the search for peace in Northern Ireland .
His high profile post - ceasefire visits to Belfast were meant to set the seal on the process .
However , it was arguably his successor in the White House , George Bush , who drove the political process forward to the once unthinkable scenario of the Democratic Unionists sharing power with Sinn Féin .
The deal that led to power sharing between the DUP and Sinn Féin was sealed at the St Andrews negotiations in 2006 .
Central to that deal was Sinn Féin agreeing to drop its historic opposition to the police in Northern Ireland – a key DUP precondition before entering government with the republican party .
The key figure in the Americans persuading the DUP and Sinn Féin to come together was Bush ’s special envoy to Northern Ireland , Mitchell Reiss .
Reiss , in the summer of 2006 , won the confidence of the DUP by insisting Bush ’s ban on Sinn Féin raising funds in North America would remain in place .
Bush ’s intervention does n’t seem to have had much effect .
The Unionists are still opposed to the deal .
But coming after Obama sent Bush , along with Bill Clinton , on a mission to Haiti in January , it does seem like something of an olive branch to the former president .
It ’s hard to imagine there are too many international constituencies that are looking forward to receiving a call from Bush — Ulster Unionists , Kosovar nationalists , the Georgian government — but there ’s no reason not to enlist his services when they may be of help .
The Chamber of Commerce is leading the opposition to the health care bill with a coalition called Employers for a Healthy Economy .
In two weeks , the group has bought more than $ 7 million in television advertising and plans to spend up to $ 3 million more .
Americans for Prosperity , a group financed by David Koch , the oilman , is also jumping into the fray with an advertising campaign of nearly $ 1 million .
For weeks , Democrats who support the health care legislation have struggled to compete with the opposition .
A disparity in radio and television advertisements , along with calls and mailings , meant that the lawmakers Mr. Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi were trying to persuade to vote for the measure were taking a pounding in their districts .
The new money from Pharma , the association of drug makers , as well as contributions from labor unions and other groups helped equalize the advertising fight .
This week , officials said , the groups backing the legislation will focus extensively on the insurance industry with this theme : “ When insurance companies win , you lose . ”
The strategies for the climactic week ahead go well beyond vote counting in the corridors of the Capitol .
Until this week , a divided Democratic Party struggled to raise money to compete with forces rallying against the measure , so creative approaches were used .
Television advertisements were cost - prohibitive in the district of Representative John Adler of New Jersey , who voted against the health care bill last year , so proponents formed a special grass - roots action campaign .
A dozen members of the clergy who support overhauling the health care system recently met with the congressman ’s rabbi , who said he would talk to Mr. Adler about the legislation .
Mr. Obama is making daily telephone calls to Democrats who supported the health care bill last year , but have yet to decide how they intend to vote this time .
He is also focusing on those who opposed the legislation , including Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio , who said the measure did not go far enough .
The president ’s trip to Ohio includes Mr. Kucinich ’s district , and he invited the congressman to join him aboard Air Force One.
Mr. Kucinich said he was grateful for the ride and for the president ’s visit , but added that he was disinclined to support the bill as it stands .
Molar that was discovered in attic of Blickling Hall is thought to date from second world war
The National Trust is appealing for information about a human tooth that has turned up alongside Jacobean furniture and old masters during the annual winter cleaning of a stately pile .
The badly decayed molar , still with small scraps of flesh attached , was found in an attic cabinet at Blickling Hall , former home of the Boleyn family whose most famous member , Anne , lost her head in 1536 on the orders of King Henry VIII .
The tooth is thought to be much more recent than Anne's Tudor days , prompting the trust 's hopes that its former owner , or a relative , may have information about home dentistry or possibly a fight at the mansion in Norfolk .
The trust 's regional archaeologist , Angus Wainwright , said today : " Perhaps there was a servants ' brawl or maybe an airman lost a tooth when the RAF took the hall over during the second world war . "
The tooth's owner was a stranger to modern dentistry , with a large hole in one side of the molar and a honeycomb of small cavities throughout .
Wainwright said : " They would have suffered a huge amount of pain , which lends some weight to the extraction theory . "
Air force dentists attended staff billeted at Blickling , although the cheap alternative of tying a loose tooth to a doorknob and slamming the door was a common remedy in the 1940s .
Wainwright said : " The tooth is in a very bad condition indeed .
We 've found lots of interesting things in the Blickling attics before now but this has to got to be the weirdest . "
Scientific dating tests are likely to be applied to the tooth , although removal from a burial has already been ruled out .
Wainwright said : " It has never been buried in the ground because you can see some of the red mush still present , so I 'd say it was probably lost right here in the attics . "
The tooth will go on display when Blickling reopens at the end of February .
Louise Green , assistant house steward at Blickling , said : " We 're just really interested to know where it came from and why it 's ended up in our attic . "
In my article “ DMing Muse ” I mentioned a few elements that are good to put into a DnD game , and then decided that “ Wait a minute , this would be great to talk about also ! ”
So here I am again !
Some of the elements I mentioned in that article are traps , monsters , friendly npcs , non friendly npcs , illusions , places , puzzles , mazes , eye candy , items , plot , story , combat .
I ’ll be going into more detail about these things and perhaps adding a few .
So , let ’s get started !
( Also , if you already understand something such as “ Combat ” feel free to skip that section and read what best suits you , or read the whole thing to perhaps get a differing opinion , )
Traps , where they go , when , and how ?
Traps are sometimes one of the most overlooked aspects of the game .
You roll a die , see a trap , roll another die , disable it , continue on .
But what about the beautiful dynamics of a well created trap ?
You ’re genius ’s , not it ’s time to put that creative ability to work .
Your players are too smart , and just rolling a die no longer suffices !
There must be more to it !
Well , there can be .
First off , create a well designed trap .
I read a book awhile ago I believe it was an ADnD book that I honestly can’t remember the name of had a various selection of traps and defined them , how they worked etc .
I ’m sure there are more modern ones that may help , I also stumbled upon a website trying to find this book and found it had some rather useful tips and extras that can be found here ( http://www.acc.umu.se/~stradh/dnd/mirror/Ezra/books/olear/ADnD/NetBooks.html )
Though be warned they are in a “ ADnD ” format I - believe - .
But I read through some of it and it can be easily put into many situations .
It ’s a rather B - Rate website but does n’t make the content any less .
So , when creating a trap perhaps instead of just the same old rolling technique when they roll to disable the higher the roll the more “ information ” you give them about the device , from there on they must take the steps on their own to disable it .
If they are stuck , help give them tips such as “ You being a rogue know that pressure plates only activate when they are pushed down . ” so then they can decide to disable it for extra experience with whatever mechanisms it is attached too , or they wedge it so if someone steps on it the pressure plate will not push down ( this will give substantially less experience ) or they can do nothing and simply avoid it ( which still should allow a small amount of experience . ) and perhaps they use it later on to their own advantage .
( A monster is chasing them , so they use the pressure plate and set the trap off on the monster .
Experience points !)
You can make traps as much a part of your game as combat or roleplay .
In the 4E handbook on page 85 it discusses Traps and Hazards .
It describes the difference between a trap and a hazard being “ .. Traps are constructed with the intent of damage , harry , or impede intruders .
Hazards are natural or supernatural in origin , but typically lack the malicious intent of a trap .
Though both feature similar risks , a pit covered with goblin - constructed false floor is a trap , while a deep cahsm between two sections of troglodyte cave constitutes a hazard . ”
It ’s a good idea to read through this for more tips , most of these things you can always find other tips for in the DM ’s guide or players handbook .
It even gives a various list of different potential traps and hazards , winging it tips , and more .
Remember traps can be magical in nature OR natural .
Traps are n’t always pressure plates , sometimes they are magical silent alarms or many other various things .
Switch it up and enjoy !
Also remember :
Too much detail can slow a game down , perhaps you like keeping traps simple .
That ’s also fine .
Extra resources : For 3rd edition , page 119 in the DM ’s guide has a chart for traps according to CR ( Challenge Rating ) page 114 explains some mechanical traps , building them , and gives you a list of ideas .
Page 115 on the right begins to explain magical traps .
( 3.0 DM ’s guide ; sorry I do n’t have 3.5 )
Monsters , friendly NPCs and non-friendly NPC’s .
Monsters obviously are a big part , but keeping the monsters different help keep the game in flow .
Such as instead of goblins create some other small creature that is unique or at least different so that people do n’t feel “ bored ” with your selection .
There are many , many books with various monsters or you can come up with your own .
To do this either come up with your own stats or use stats of a similar monster in the book .
These are just simple steps to help spice up your monsters .
Or give your Goblins personality , by giving them tribe symbols , war cries , tactics , or just different scenarios to make it more interesting .
On that note , NPC ’s can be monsters as well and visa versus , if you capture a goblin with the means to get information out of him he then becomes an NPC and needs more of a personality and response basis , NPC ’s can be friendly and non friendly so always decide what type of out look they have on the party .
Perhaps you have a human party with one elf , and the NPC will not speak to you with the elf present , or will only speak to the elf .
Maybe he does n’t like someone because he ’s heard about them , or the way the dress .
NPC ’s can be bias for many different reasons , and sometimes they can be caring all around .
Remember to give them personality and that if the players attack a PC then it becomes a “ Monster ” , and if they capture a “ Monster ” he then has the capability of being an NPC .
Good luck and remember , be creative !

This is one smart dog , LMAO ..... Charges pending .
Even if Google defends itself against allegations of anti-competitive behaviour , a European investigation could spark all sorts of trouble
In many ways , it was unavoidable .
When a company becomes as large and as dominant as Google has managed to become in web search , it is usually only a matter of time before the European Commission launches an antitrust investigation .
But just as the company tried to take the offensive by announcing that it was subject to an EC probe , the question : even if Google succeeds in fighting off these particular allegations , will it be the end of the internet giant 's troubles - or just the beginning ?
Let 's look first at the specifics of the commission 's investigation .
The complaints apparently come from three rival businesses ; a British site called Foundem - whose grievances we have documented in the past - a similar French service called eJustice , and Ciao , a price comparison website bought by Microsoft in 2008 .
They argue , in various ways , that Google deliberately screens out or demotes their sites - something that they claim is monopolistic , anti-competitive behaviour that should be regulated by officials in Brussels .
Are they right ?
On first glance , the case is a tricky one .
There are a lot of metasearch engines that make money by optimising themselves to appear high up in Google search results .
There are also a lot of sites that spam Google 's index in the same way .
If Google builds an algorithm that discriminates against sites it feels are n't adding value for users - a process described very nicely in this recent Wired piece - is it being anti-competitive ?
There 's a very fine line , but given Google 's de facto search monopoly , it has to tread very carefully here .
" Though each case raises slightly different issues , the question they ultimately pose is whether Google is doing anything to choke off competition or hurt our users and partners , " said Julia Holtz , the company 's senior competition counsel .
" This is not the case .
We always try to listen carefully if someone has a real concern and we work hard to put our users ' interests first and to compete fair and square in the market .
We believe our business practices reflect those commitments . "
But beyond the intricacies of this investigation , the bigger question is how many more complaints we might see coming out of the woodwork .
Will it be a single , isolated case , or will it open the floodgates ?
My suspicion is that this may be the beginning of a long and often torturous set of complaints for the Silicon Valley company , perhaps in a manner highly reminiscent of Microsoft 's troubles with regulators over the last 15 years .
After all , Google has used its quest to " organise the world 's information " as the subtext to expand in every direction , filling almost every gap imaginable online .
Beyond the basic search engine for which it is most famous , it now has a strong presence in dozens of other areas , including video , office applications , email , maps , mobile phones , web browsers and many more .
And while it does n't necessarily dominate all of the markets it moves into , it often distorts things by cross - subsidising its efforts with the enormous piles of cash made through internet advertising .
You may question whether that 's right or wrong , but it 's clearly something that is changing the landscape in all sorts of ways - the type of impact that entrepreneur Chris Dixon alluded to in a recent diatribe in which he argued that " every time an engineer joins Google , a startup dies " .
We 've heard before that the US Justice Department has had its eye on Google , and regulators have already looked at the company 's links with rivals like Apple and Yahoo .
Now , with the company 's core business in the sights of Brussels , the stage could be set for a much wider set of issues to come out - not least because the European Commission often uses small antitrust concerns as a proxy for a much larger stick .
The long - running battle with Microsoft , for example , often picked on relatively insignificant aspects of the company 's business while appearing to try and discourage monopolistic behaviour in general .
So while Google will defend the small details of this particular case , it 's got a much larger issue on its hands - and must act quickly if it does n't want the problem to swell to immense proportions .

Pope Benedict XVI rebuked Irish bishops Saturday for " grave errors of judgment " in handling clerical sex abuse and ordered an investigation into the Irish church but did not mention any Vatican responsibility .
In a letter to the Irish faithful read across Europe amid a growing , multination abuse scandal , the pope doled out no specific punishments to bishops blamed by victims , and Irish government - ordered investigations , for having covered up abuse of thousands of Irish children from the 1930s to the 1990s .
Ireland 's main group of clerical - abuse victims , One in Four , said it was deeply disappointed by the letter because it failed to lay blame with the Vatican for what it called a " deliberate policy of the Catholic Church at the highest levels to protect sex offenders , thereby endangering children . "
" If the church can not acknowledge this fundamental truth , it is still in denial , " the group said .
The letter directly addressed only Ireland , but the Vatican said it could be read as applying to other countries .
Hundreds of new allegations of abuse have recently come to light across Europe , including in the pope 's native Germany , where he served as archbishop in a diocese where several victims have recently come forward .
One priest suspected of molesting boys while the future pope was in charge was transferred to a job where he abused more children .
While a cardinal at the Vatican , Joseph Ratzinger penned a letter instructing bishops around the world to report all cases of abuse to his office and keep them secret under threat of excommunication .
Irish bishops have said the letter was widely understood to mean they should n't report the cases to police .
" You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry , " Benedict said , addressing himself to Irish Catholics who suffered " sinful and criminal " abuse at the hands of priests , brothers and nuns and a botched response by their superiors .
" It is understandable that you find it hard to forgive or be reconciled with the church , " he said .
" In her name , I openly express the shame and remorse that we all feel . "
Benedict used his harshest words for the abusers themselves , saying they had betrayed the trust of the faithful , brought shame on the church and now must answer before God and civil authorities .
" Conceal nothing , " he exhorted them .
" Openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of God 's mercy . "
Benedict faulted their superiors , the Irish bishops , for having failed " sometimes grievously " to apply the church 's own law which calls for harsh punishments for child abusers , including defrocking priests .
But he did n't rebuke them specifically for having failed to report cases of abuse to police , saying only that serious mistakes were made and that now they must prevent future abuse and " continue to cooperate with civil authorities . "
" I recognize how difficult it was to grasp the extent and complexity of the problem , to obtain reliable information and to make the right decisions in the light of conflicting expert advice , " Benedict wrote .
" Nevertheless , it must be admitted that grave errors of judgment were made and failures of leadership occurred .
And this has seriously undermined your credibility and effectiveness . "
While the letter doled out no punishment for the bishops , the pope did order a Vatican investigation into some dioceses , seminaries and religious orders .
Such a move is undertaken only when Rome considers a local church unable to deal with a problem on its own .
The Vatican ordered such an " apostolic visitation " into U.S. seminaries after the U.S. clerical sex abuse scandal exploded in 2002 .
RELATED : Ireland takes stunned of battered church , economy , and nation
The results of the Irish investigation could lead to further action .
Victims have been demanding that bishops resign , and three Irish bishops have offered to step down .
Benedict has n't accepted the resignations .
Asked why there were no punitive provisions in the letter , Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi noted that the letter was pastoral , not administrative or disciplinary in nature , and that any further measures concerning resignations would be taken by the competent Vatican offices .
Cardinal Sean Brady , the top cardinal in Ireland who himself is under fire for not reporting a notorious abuser to police , welcomed the letter .
" Let us pray that the Holy Father 's pastoral letter will be the beginning of a great season of rebirth and hope in the Irish Church , " he said .
Three Irish government - ordered investigations published from 2005 to 2009 have documented how thousands of Irish children suffered rape , molestation and other abuse by priests in their parishes and by nuns and brothers in boarding schools and orphanages .
Irish bishops did not report a single case to police until 1996 after victims began to sue the church .
The reports have faulted Rome for sending confusing messages to the Irish church about norms to be followed and , in general , for what it called the absence of a coherent set of canon laws and rules to apply in cases of abuse .
In particular , the so - called Murphy report faulted the 2001 secrecy letter penned by then - Cardinal Ratzinger , who headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for a quarter - century before becoming pope , making him the most informed Vatican official about the global scale of clerical abuse .
In that role , he denounced the " filth " in the priesthood and initiated what has amounted to a crackdown on predatory priests , demanding a policy of zero tolerance from his bishops .
As pope , he has met with American , Australian and Canadian victims of abuse , offering them comfort and apologies .
Nevertheless , reports emerged last week that while he was archbishop of Munich in the 1980s , Ratzinger approved therapy for a priest suspected of molesting boys .
The priest was then transferred to a job where he later abused more children .
He was convicted in a criminal trial .
The archdiocese has said Ratzinger 's then vicar general took full responsibility for the transfer .
Lombardi defended Benedict in his handling of the global abuse scandal and said anyone who knows the pontiff 's background and history would know he has been a " witness for coherence and correctness " in confronting abuse and a " guide to overcome a past of silence . "
Lombardi was peppered with questions about why the German - born pope did n't directly address the German scandal or take the opportunity of the letter to make a more sweeping commentary on the now - global dimensions of the scandal .
Lombardi acknowledged the other cases but said the Irish scandal was unique in its scope .
But he said that obviously issues in the letter could be read to apply to other countries and individuals .
" You ca n't talk about the entire world every time , " he said .
" It risks becoming banal . "
The head of the German bishops ' conference , Archbishop Robert Zollitsch , said the letter was a message also for Germany .
" The sexual abuse scandal in Ireland is not just an Irish problem , it is the scandal of the church in many places , it is the scandal of the church in Germany , " he said .
A prominent German Catholic activist group , We Are Church , said it respected the pope 's efforts with the letter .
But it faulted him for failing to address the fact that abuse is a global and structural problem for the church .
" It would be good if there would be a mea culpa from him for all victims around the globe , " said spokesman Christian Weisner .

The national union has fought female firefighters every step of the way , using arguments like falling standards .
The only credible research about standards can be drawn from health research that shows that as male firefighters age , their balance and physical strength declines .
It can be safely speculated that many ageing male firefighters would fail the physical entry test that keeps women out right across Australia .
This does not make older males poor firefighters - it just shows the fallacy of the UFUA position .
Firefighters and the public have a right to expect entry processes that reflect the job being done .
An intimidating and inflexible culture harms all workers .
Hysterical notions that buildings will burn down and people will die if females become firefighters do n't cut it any more .
Dr Merilyn Childs , formerly director of fire services research program , University of Western Sydney , Springwood , NSW
Special assistance not on THE Metropolitan Fire Brigade is not a " closed culture " ( Editorial , 13/3 ) .
The MFB recruiting process is open ( and fair ) to all applicants .
Gender , race or '' physical strength ' ' are not barriers .
The truth is that not many women apply .
The proportion of females in the MFB is on a par with other Australian and overseas fire services .
We female firefighters in the MFB are offended by the implication of the gender inclusion action plan that females need special assistance to make it into the MFB .
New recruits should be selected on merit alone .
The United Firefighters Union has the full support of its female members in promoting a more inclusive plan than the MFB's .
Setting targets to increase diversity artificially is patronising and taints applicants who enter under the scheme .
Overseas case studies show it creates division in the workplace .
We have found the MFB to be a welcoming workplace and it is a job we are proud to do .
Melissa Hanson , station officer , Murrumbeena , and 23 MFB female firefighters
Wacky arguments rerun WHEN the army began widening its opportunities for women more than 25 years ago , some wacky arguments were advanced as to why women should not be given expanded career opportunities .
Squads would not be able to march in step because women have shorter legs ; the army would have to double its toilet allocation ; combat outcomes would be jeopardised by male soldiers giving excessive attention to the protection of their female comrades ; and so on .
Happily , all these objections were easily dealt with and common sense prevailed .
( Some male soldiers also have short legs ; unisex toilets were commonplace in aircraft ; and we would be disappointed if soldiers did not look out for the welfare of all comrades . )
The proportion of women then was probably not much better than the current 3.2 per cent in the MFB .
Now it is pushing 15 per cent - a big change for a conservative institution .
Nick Jans , Marysville Union 's conduct helps foes
THE reported behaviour of the United Firefighters Union gives a glimpse of the magnitude of the task facing women seeking fairness .
The barriers to equality extend way beyond the corporate world .
But the union 's conduct raises another issue .
While it is uncommon , the flash of the jackboot from a few irresponsible unions is still frequent enough to lend credibility to the campaigns of the formidable forces arrayed against the labour movement .
The success of these forces can be measured by the steadily increasing material inequality in all Western countries in recent decades .
The UFU 's conduct undermines the legitimate struggles of their union brothers .
Of course , they could n't give a stuff about their sisters .

We need a company to infiltrate cabinet THE Sunday
Age reveals that our state government is employing private security firms , police and international consortiums to spy on those who question its water policy ( '' Desal company ' spying ' '' , 14/3 ) .
This highlights the way this government has gone about imposing the desalination plant on us .
It introduced the idea against its mandate , refused to debate the issue , and did not provide a single study to justify its claim that Victoria needed such a huge plant .
Cabinet - commissioned studies advising against going down this route will not be released and a business case for Victoria 's most expensive infrastructure project was never done .
Perhaps the people of Victoria should be employing their own private security to infiltrate state cabinet and find out just what is going on in Victoria .
This project will cost you and I dearly , but will not even appear on the government 's books .

MICHAEL Lennon writes that a NIMBY attitude is preventing social housing being built and that ''if the normal planning processes … apply it is simply not possible for these dwellings to be completed in two years ' '.
( Comment , 13/3 ) .
These are two separate issues .
What 's causing pain for residents is not the thought of social housing in their neighbourhood , it 's the disenfranchisement from democratic processes .
And the only reason offered for having possibly inappropriate development next to your home is that a timeline , which appears arbitrary , has been established in Canberra .
Next door is a large block that has been sold and everything demolished .
No information was forthcoming from state government or council .
Rumours were rife .
Now it appears that 13 families are to be accommodated in five buildings on a block that previously housed one .
Every other block in the area has one family .
This will stick out as a ghetto .
Neighbours are furious at the lack of consultation .
The site is nowhere near shops or public transport so does n't seem to be ideal for social housing and contradicts the council 's planning guidelines for medium - density housing near transport hubs and facilities and the federal government 's guidelines .

Dangerous path PARLIAMENTARY committees are proceeding down a dangerous path when seeking to investigate ministerial staffers .
They are endangering the viability of the Westminster system of ministerial responsibility .
When senate committees sought to involve themselves in departmental matters in the early 1970s , Canberra 's mandarins became very concerned .
They were placated when assured that departmental witnesses would be required to answer factual questions only and not comment on policy .
The area that should remain sacrosanct is the ministerial office .
The Westminister principle of ministerial responsibility to Parliament should prevail .
Decades ago I had responsibility for a federal ministerial office .
Every day written and oral exchanges took place between myself and the minister , and with others , much of which was confidential and personal .
The thought that I , and not the minister , could be brought before a parliamentary committee to account for these would have been incomprehensible .
If we lose sight of the long - standing conventions we risk undermining the system that has sustained our parliaments over centuries .
Andrew Farran , former senior lecturer in public law , Beaumaris Cuts both ways
IN DEFENDING his appearance in the place of his subpoenaed press secretary at the inquiry into the Windsor Hotel sham , Planning Minister Justin Madden cites a long - standing tradition that politicians ' staff do not appear before parliamentary committees .
There is another long - standing Westminster tradition that ministers accept responsibility for the activities of their department .
You can't have it both ways .
Allow your staffer the opportunity to tell the truth , or accept personal responsibility and resign .

Truce in weed war MALCOLM Maiden ( '' Weed out the parochial fools ' ' , BusinessDay , 13/3 ) is spot on .
Removing willows and other exotic trees from urban precincts and waterways is a tragic mistake .
Driven by an ideology that values natives more than exotics , Melbourne Water and other agencies are stripping away Melbourne 's cultural heritage .
There is wide disagreement as to which plants are invasive .
Bureaucrats are taking a doctrinaire approach regardless of community concern .
The bitter joke is that the lemon - scented gums proposed for the Shrine of Remembrance are themselves exotic in Victoria , being indigenous to Queensland .
They are beautiful trees , but the heritage value of the Lombardy poplars is such that they should be conserved .
Government agencies should declare a truce in their '' war against weeds ' ' and recognise that Melbourne 's exotic trees make a vital contribution to making Melbourne a great city .

Rail good for taxis JOHN Tait ( Letters , 13/3 ) calls for the Airport West tramline to be extended to Tullamarine .
As a cabbie of many years ' standing , and having sat at the airport on countless occasions , I venture there would be overwhelming support from cabbies .
For many drivers , there is nothing more galling than , after queueing for up to three hours , a passenger who directs them to a suburb along that tram line or , worse , the area between the terminus and the airport .
Extending the line would solve that and many more problems .
Likewise , fewer freeways and a greater reliance on public transport in general could be very good for the taxi industry , with people taking more , but shorter , trips to and from stations .
Youngsters , given the option of buying a car or taking reliable public transport and the occasional short taxi trip , might choose the latter .
Let 's wake up and see the big picture .

However , the media themselves are often guilty of the spin sin .
This can be as overt as editorial meetings determining the ' ' angle ' ' of an article or as subtle as the selection of quotes , photos , headlines , story juxtapositions and other techniques that go beyond factual reporting - if such a thing is even possible .

Engineers at BERU f1systems in Norfolk , England , have created what they call the " world 's first bike designed and hand built by Formula one engineers . "
The incredibly expensive Factor 001 bicycle has a starting price of £ 22,000 .
For that money , the customer gets a lightweight carbon monocoque frame completely customized to the owner 's physical measurements .
The bicycle does not comply with many rules for competitive cycling , which gave designers the opportunity to create a machine that accelerates quickly with the highest level of stability .
The look of the bike can also be designed to the customer 's wishes , with his or her name engraved on the handlebars .
" In designing and perfecting Factor 001 we chose not to be limited by any preconceptions surrounding traditional road bike design , " said BERU exec John Bailey .
" Each model takes six highly skilled engineers a week to make .
With only a limited number of bikes due to be built , we expect Factor 001 to become a desirable collector 's item . "
Built into the frame are " highly sophisticated load sensors , wiring , batteries , control cables and lines for its hydraulic braking system . "
With additional electronics , the bike collects data on ergonometrics , biometrics , physical forces , and environmental factors .
Data is displayed on the included LCD touch screen , but can also be downloaded onto a computer for analysis .
The bike is on sale now with carbon ceramic brakes , and a Shimano Di2 gear shift .
The version with added electronics will be sold for £ 27,000 .
Only several hundred units of the Factor 001 will be produced .
Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) is n’t off the hook for last year ’s scandal - laden affair with his staffer ’s wife .
In fact , his troubles now look worse than ever .
The Nevada television news station KLAS reported on Thursday that the Department of Justice has enhanced its “ criminal ” investigation of the events surrounding Ensign ’s actions .
ADVERTISEMENT
The criminal probe stems from a romantic affair Ensign had with the wife of his key staffer and close friend , Doug Hampton , and what Ensign has done to help Hampton financially .
Subpoenas have been issued to at least six Las Vegas businesses .
The Justice Department came to Las Vegas to interview several prominent business and political figures in what appears to be a wide - ranging and deadly - serious criminal probe .
The subpoena , which can be read here , seeks “ any and all records ; including emails , phone calls and calendars regarding any interaction the Las Vegas businesses may have had with Ensign , his Chief of Staff John Lopez , Doug Hampton , Hampton ’s wife Cindy — the object of the senator ’s romantic interest — Ensign ’s principal political advisor Mike Slanker , and Slanker ’s company November Inc , ” according to KLAS ’s LasVegasNow.com

Talking Points Memo‘s Zachary
Roth notes that “ the federal grand jury probe of the sex - and - lobbying scandal that ensnared Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) is getting hotter than a Las Vegas parking lot in July . ”
The Associated Press provides details on the nature of the investigations against the Nevada senator , who was reportedly mulling a run for president in 2012 prior to these transgressions becoming public .
According to one subpoena obtained by a Las Vegas television station , recipients were ordered to testify March 31 in Washington , D.C. , and to turn over documents relating to the Republican senator .
The FBI and Senate Ethics Committee are investigating whether Ensign tried to limit political damage from an affair he had with the wife of one of his Senate aides by conspiring to help the aide find a new job as a lobbyist , which might have violated restrictions on lobbying by former congressional staff .
Federal criminal law prohibits congressional aides from lobbying their ex-bosses or office colleagues for one year after departing their Hill jobs .
Ensign acknowledged the relationship with Cynthia Hampton last June .
In addition to Ensign ’s helping her husband , Doug Hampton , gain employment with a lobbying firm , Ensign ’s parents provided the Hamptons with a payment of $ 96,000 that they described as a gift .

The Washington Monthly ‘s Steve Benen offers additional background on the situation .
If you ’re just joining us , Ensign ’s humiliation came to public attention in June , when we learned the conservative , “ family - values ” lawmaker carried on a lengthy extra-marital affair with one of his aides , who happened to be married to another one of his aides .
Ensign ’s parents tried to pay off the mistress ’ family .
The scandal grew far worse in October , when we learned that the Republican senator pushed his political and corporate allies to give lobbying contracts to his mistress ’s husband .
When Douglas and Cynthia Hampton left Ensign ’s employ — because , you know , the senator was sleeping with Cynthia — Ensign allegedly took steps to help them make up the lost income , leaning on corporate associates to hire Douglas as a lobbyist .
Emails that surfaced last week bolstered the allegations .
Ensign has denied that he violated any ethics laws and has pledged to cooperate with the investigations .

Today across the blogosphere Ada Lovelace will be honoured by writing about her and other remarkable women in technology .
But today I prefer to appeal to and for the unremarkable .
At the day job we 've been hiring people continuously for a year for programming jobs .
My entire team of 12 is all men , and in the last 12 months we 've interviewed two women .
Looking into all the candidates who 've sent in an application , men overwhelm women with a ratio of 24:1 .
Even if we just hired people randomnly the chance of hiring a woman would be tiny .
I find this situation tragic .
We 've hired with blindness to the age of our employees or their backgrounds .
In a team of 12 there are people who hail from Mexico , Northern Ireland , Greece ( via Canada ) , and Poland .
But not a single woman .
And yet I 've known women who love these implacable machines as much as I .
I 've talked to women programmers about the deepest guts of computers , about algorithms and problems to be solved .
Many of those women have recognized something that people outside the industry overlook : much of computer programming is a craft .
The people who made the smart phone in your hand , or built the system that waits patiently in your car for an accident to happen so it can fire the airbags in the right order , or made your web - based email and your music player , or built the software on the Voyager 1 spacecraft that keeps it looking longingly back at Earth as it leaves our grasp : those people are incredibly creative .
They have made beautiful things : beautiful things that everybody sees , and beautiful computer structures hidden out of sight but playing a part in all of our lives .
They have struggled against constraints of time , space and resources , and they have .
Although software may seem ephemeral because it has no physical form , these people , men and women , have sculpted electricity to form numbers to form programs and make software that touches the physical world .
So , my appeal when thinking about Ada Lovelace is to all the women who , like me , will never be a world famous genius , who will never look like computer engineer Barbie , but , like the men I 've worked with in the computer industry , love what they do .
Do n't think that computers are just for men to program and debug , but come place your fingers on a keyboard and share with me the joy of making .
And , perhaps , one day , I wo n't remark a woman in a team of computer programmers , because she 'll be unremarkable .
Or at least I 'll only remark her because she 's remarkable for her ability , not her missing Y .

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Intel Labs have developed a system of " whack gestures " that could allow any phone with an accelerometer to be silenced with a punch .
This is brilliant .

Tap gestures as a concept are n't totally new , but the new software promises a much lower error rate than previous solutions , as well as a much simpler philosophy .
Chris Harrison , developer :
I think for whack gestures to be commercially viable only two gestures might be desired : one to silence the phone , and a second to postpone an alert , ask the caller to try again in 5 minutes or snooze an alarm .

2. ) Panic , violently strike outer thigh

In 2008 , Liberty University Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr. declared it his hope that Liberty U would “ go down in history as the college that elected a president . ”
That dream died when John McCain lost the election , but Falwell has been hard at work making the most of LU ’s political power in Lynchburg by running campus - wide voter registration drives , busing students to the polls , and then taking credit for delivering a state House seat for a Republican candidate .
Sensing its growing importance in the area , Liberty recently demanded that the Lynchburg City Council move the polling places used by LU students right on to campus for their convenience ; a move which the City Council rejected , much to LU ’s outrage .
Well , now a Liberty U student has announced that he is running for a seat on the Lynchburg City Council … and , would n’t you know it , LU is sending out thousands of letters urging everyone to vote in the election in May :
Liberty University continues its push to register voters for Lynchburg ’s May City Council elections with a mass mailing .
Earlier this week , donors and the university sent out 10,000 letters to alumni , supporters , and online students urging them to register .
The letter does n’t go as far as to endorse any candidates , but it expresses Liberty ’s desire to grow with fewer restrictions .
Liberty co-founder Dr. Elmer
Towns wrote it and writes in it that the city council election is critical in making that happen .
The letter says “ Lynchburg City Council will cost LU great amounts of money as they grow , ” referring to millions of dollars in infrastructure projects when the university hits 12,000 on - campus students .
“ Which is absolutely crazy for the city to mandate those types of things that Liberty has to do in order to grow , ” Liberty University official Lee Beaumont said .
The city says LU agreed to these improvements in a conditional - use permit in June 2008 .
Beaumont says those projects would increase tuition and affect growth , and the LU community needs to be aware .
…
The letter is a call to elect members to city council who will set favorable development policies for Liberty … “ I say get out there and vote .
Get off your butt , register , make sure you ’re registered and show up for a city council election , ” [ Beaumont ] said .
The engineers at NASA have combined every one of our geeky transportation dreams into a single little vehicle called the Puffin .
It takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane .
It can cruise at 140 mph and , with a boost mode , hit about twice that .
Oh – and it 's electric .
If that sounds too good to be true , it is – for the moment .
But give it time .
NASA unveiled the concept today at the American Helicopter Society meeting in San Francisco .
The tilt - rotor Puffin has a flight system similar to the V - 22 Osprey , but instead of carrying a bunch of Marines and their gear , the Puffin carries one person in the prone position .
The rotors are nearly 7.5 feet in diameter and the aircraft has a wingspan just over 13 feet .
Thanks to carbon composite construction , the Puffin weighs in at less than 400 pounds including the lithium phosphate batteries .
The Puffin is designed to stand on its tail , which serves as the landing gear ( check out the video ) .
Once the Puffin transitions to horizontal flight , the pilot can cruise at more than 140 miles per hour .
Hit the boost mode and this bird will do nearly 300 mph .
The projected range is 50 miles on a charge .
Yeah , that 's not much , but using electricity means the Puffin 's powerplant wo n't be limited by air density .
NASA says it should be able to climb under full power to around 30,000 feet before the battery pack would be depleted enough to require coming back down .
So why call it the Puffin ?
" If you 've ever seen a puffin on the ground , it looks very awkward , with wings too small to fly , and that 's exactly what our vehicle looks like , " Mark Moore , an aerospace engineer at NASA Langley Research Center , told Scientific American .
" But it 's also apparently called the most environmentally friendly bird because it hides its poop , and we 're environmentally friendly because we have essentially no emissions .
Also , puffins tend to live in solitude , only ever coming together on land to mate , and ours is a one - person vehicle . "
No word on when the Puffin will make its first manned flight , though NASA plans to finish a one - third size demonstrator by March and see how well it transitions from cruising to hovering .
But it 's safe to say that if this bird flies – and that 's a very big if – we 'll no longer be dreaming of having our own jetpack .

Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke continues trying to sell a story nobody 's buying : that the historically low fed funds rate throughout the past decade did not lead to the real estate bubble .
Here 's the relevant portion from his exchange yesterday with Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) at a House Financial Services Committee hearing :
Ron Paul : During the early part of the decade a lot of the free market economists would be saying interest rates were kept too low too long and there was a financial bubble and a housing bubble .
There had to be a correction .
And of course we did in 2008 .
Since 2008 many of the mainstream economists have more or less agreed with that assessment , because frequently we 'll hear them say , " Interest rates were held too low too long . "
And I think even Secretary Geithner has made that statement .
Where do you come down on that perception ?
Do you think interest rates were held too low too long ?
Ben Bernanke : Well Congressman , I 've given a speech on this .
And I think the bottom line is that nobody really knows for sure but that the evidence is really quite mixed .
And I would say that even if they were too low for too long , the magnitude of the error was not big enough to account for the huge crisis we had .
I think what caused the crisis was the failures of regulation .
And I would fault the Fed here too , because some of those failures were ours in the sense that we did n't do enough — and I 've admitted this and acknowledged this many times — we did n't do enough on mortgage regulation .
So I think it was the weakness of the regulatory system , not monetary policy that was most important here .
Ron Paul :
Of course I do n't agree with that .
But if you assume for a minute that it was too low too long and you had perfect regulations , what is the harm done by interest rates being too low too long ?
Do you see any damage from interest rates being artificially low for a long period of time ?
Sort that away from regulations for a second .
Ben Bernanke :
Well certainly one possibility which [ former Fed chairman Paul Volcker ] knows a lot about is that if you keep rates too low for too long you 'll get inflation .
And every central banker wants to be sure that the price level remains stable .
And that 's an important consideration .
Ron Paul :
Do you think the investor , the businessman makes mistakes if interest rates are lower than , say , the market ?
Are n't low interest rates an indication that there are savings , and if there are no savings but interest rates are low because of newly created credit by the Fed , does that not send a false signal to some investors and some business people ?
Ben Bernanke :
Well if interest rates are below their normal levels it 's because the economy is operating at a very low level .
I mean currently we 're not in anything that an economist would call a Pareto optimal equilibrium or anything like that .
We 're certainly in a situation where a lot of people are out of work , and consumption is below its normal level , and low interest rates serve the function of creating demand and putting people back to work .
Ron Paul :
But you do n't think that if interest rates are two and three percent instead of six percent — without artificially low interest rates — there would n't be a temptation for people to build too many houses , or people to try to capitalize on the fact that they 're anticipating price inflation and participate in the bubble ?
Ben Bernanke : Well Congressman , interest rates are very low right now and I do n't think building too many houses is really a problem .
Ron Paul :
And that makes a very important point .
You know , in the boom part of the cycle , interest rates cause people to do things that might not be proper and in the best interest of the economy , and then when the bust comes we resort to that same policy of keeping interest rates , you know , extremely low for too long .
What are the chances ?
Do you think there 's any chance that in a year or two or three and say , " Well not only were they too low too long in the early part of the decade , they were too low too long in the latter part of the decade . "
Because when the prices start to go up , it 's sort of a little bit too late , then you have the job of reining that all in .
Ben Bernanke :
Well it 's a difficult , um …
Central banking is an art , and we need to balance our dual mandate .
Our dual mandate is to maximum employment and price stability .
We need to find an appropriate policy that gets us as close as we can to that mandate .
Ron Paul :
See the free market people see that it the dependency on regulation is just imaginary , because the fault is all these mistakes being made because they have false information .
Nobody 's advocating wage and price controls because of all the false information .
You can't run an economy with price fixing , that 's why socialism fails .
But if you fix the price of interest rates , one half of the economy goes , " You 're messing around with the financial system . "
And then all of sudden , instead of dealing with that we say , " We just need more and smarter regulations that will solve all these problems . "
Does n't that concern you at all ?
Ben Bernanke :
Well you need some system to set the money supply .
I know — I guess you 're a gold standard supporter .
I do n't know .
Is that correct ?
Ron Paul : I 'm for the Constitution .
Ben Bernanke : Every major country though , currently in the world , uses a central bank which must make some decision , whether to keep it stable or to move it around .
Nevertheless it 's a choice that 's made .
A Facebook mail thread between two college bunkmates is going viral this weekend after earning over 3500 votes on social news site Digg .
The College Humor post by blogger Jeff Rosenberg says of the thread 's origin : " My cousin Jordan is starting his freshman year this coming August .
He just got his roommate assignment and sent this over to me the other day . "
The exchange , which starts simply and quickly escalates to a class war , pretty much speaks for itself .
It 's so amusing , in fact , that we 're led to question its authenticity .

Communicating with your baby is essential .
Almost all animals communicate whether it is verbal or nonverbal .
Babies react to your mood , so it is best that you always on your good mood if you are dealing with your baby .
When you feel anxious your baby feels it too .
Your baby reflects what he or she feels from you .
It is important that you manage your feelings when you are with your baby .
You should always keep in mind that the baby ’s first needs are food , warmth , safety and love .
It should be your utmost priority to make sure your child should have the best start of their life .
If you feel sad or any negative feeling , it will make you less loving towards your child .
This may be a sign of post-natal depression ; you should seek professional help .
The following are the things to be done to communicate properly to your baby :
Eye Contact
Try to check if your child engages in eye to eye contact with you .
It may not be able to see weeks after birth , but it is already aware of your face .
As your baby matures , he or she will be able to recognize mommy and daddy .
Once that baby will be able to that , the baby will not want to be with anybody else and will fuzz and cry if passed to others .
This is the way of the baby communicating that he or she does not recognize the person .
As the baby gets older , the baby will be able to follow you and look at you and make sure everything is as it should be .
Looking on your infant ’s eyes brings a special king of joy especially knowing that your baby completely trusts you and love that they feel safe in your arms .
Speaking of getting the best for your baby , if you want to read articles about comparing strollers , this can be helpful .
Mimicking
Baby is looking at the parents faces , and the baby is looking back .
Babies usually makes a lot of noise and the parents copy these noises .
The baby will soon learn that the parents are copying what he does and the baby will imitate the things they do .
The share of borrowers who are falling seriously behind on loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration jumped by more than a third in the past year , foreshadowing a crush of foreclosures that could further buffet an agency vital to the housing market 's recovery .
About 9.1 percent of FHA borrowers had missed at least three payments as of December , up from 6.5 percent a year ago , the agency 's figures show .
Although the FHA 's default rate has been climbing for months and eating into the agency 's cash , the latest figures show that the FHA 's woes are getting worse even as the housing market shows signs of improvement .
The problems are rooted in FHA mortgages made in 2007 and 2008 .
Those loans are now maturing into their worst years because failures most often occur two to three years after a mortgage is made .
If the trend continues and the FHA 's cash reserves are exhausted , the federal government would automatically use taxpayer money to cover the losses -- a first for the agency , which has always used the fees it charges borrowers to pay for its losses .
Chris Pryce , director of Fitch Ratings for Greece , said the devil is in the detail .
" It is a further confirmation that things went badly wrong , and a reminder that there may be further increases in debt that need to be recognised before we get to the bottom of this , " he said .

Two Sundays ago , I went to the Hershey Bears / Adirondack Phantoms game where the Bears ’ AHL Record Home winning streak ended at 24 .
There ’ll be more on RMNB ’s collective bad luck later .
But one thing I learned that night is that Braden Holtby is a wildly popular man .
Beyond Bruce Boudreau , there is no more popular guy in Hershey .
Need examples ?
Well , while the Bears PA guy announced the starting line - up before the game , there was a smattering of applause for the starting 5 .
When the PA guy announced Holtby in goal , everyone in the arena rose to their feet and gave him a roaring standing ovation .
I turned to my friends in complete shock and asked “ Did that really just happen ? ? ”
Oh , it most certainly did .
And really , there ’s a lot to love about the guy ( beyond his superb fashion sense and his excellent communication skills with the bewildering Alexander Semin ) .
Holtby has put up incredible numbers in his first professional season in the Capitals ’ minor league system .
Braden started the year with the South Carolina Stingrays going 7 - 2 - 3 with a .911 Save Percentage .
He then rode the pine as an injury replacement player in Washington for two games before getting his first shot to stick in Hershey .
And stick he did .
Since receiving that promotion , Holtby has gone 23 - 6 - 2 with 2 Shutouts for the AHL ’s most winningest team .
His sparkling 2.36 GAA and above average .917 Save Percentage are among AHL Leaders .
And really , what has the Chocolate and White fans talking is the fact that Holtby has single - handedly won games this year by himself – even with the incredible roster around him .
That has many in Hershey thinking he could eventually push his way into the discussion of who deserves to be the goalie of the future in Washington between Semyon Varlamov and Michal Neuvirth .
But if you ’re looking for a statistical dissertation of who ’s better among those three ( SEMYON VARLAMOV ) , you ’ve come to the wrong place my friends .
Instead , RMNB has found another reason to fall in love with the twenty year old from Saskatoon :
His eccentric “ Holtbyisms . ”
Do n’t know what we ’re talking about ?
We ’ll let Bears regular Kathryn Hedrick explain :
As a Holtby admirer since he came to the Hershey Bears , I was already aware of the many rituals and tics he has when he plays .
But it was n’t until I had front row seats right by him on Sunday night that I saw just how much he did .
Goalies are a whole different world of hockey players and we all know how superstitious they can be .
But I think Holtby goes above and beyond the rest with his rituals .
I could n’t take my eyes off of him .
There were times when the action was on the other side of the ice but I would still watch him .
These “ Holtbyisms , ” as they ’ve become known , occur from the second he gets on the ice until he gets off ( and , let ’s be honest , he probably has more that he does in the locker room ) .
During every stoppage in play , he pushes his mask on his head , picks up his water bottle , squirts it at the boards , then squirts it in his mouth .
He swishes the water around and then spits it back out through his teeth ( Photo Montage Here ) .
I realized how hard it would be to explain some of it to other people so I took two videos of Holtby : one at the start of the period , and one at the end ( shown below ) .
The Bears beat the Binghamton Senators 3 - 2 that night and Holtby was called on to make several huge saves .
He ’s easily having the best year of any rookie on the team and he ’s putting up some monster stats for someone who was expected to be in South Carolina this season .
Maybe these habits are n’t so strange …
Here ’s Video of Braden Holtby at the beginning of a period .
Holtby flies into the video around the 10 second mark … and then pure hilarity ensues .
Now Here ’s Video of Braden Holtby at the end of a period .
Please notice the thorough sweeping of the crease , the maniacal swipes at the pipes with his stick and then the awesome flip shot of the gatorade bottle into his glove .
Somehow , this is even more ridiculous than Karl Alzner ’s Superstitions .
Now I know I said the other day that Mike Green was my new favorite player .
But after seeing the Holtbyisms described above , I think I ’ve got a new number one .
Anyways , I wanted to extend a huge thanks to Kathryn for her writeup , photos and video .
Please make sure to follow her on Twitter and thank her for her time .
Kathryn , once you ’re of age , we ’ll buy you a beer ( Please God , do n’t tell your parents that ) .
And for those of you who have witnessed the Holtbyisms live , tell us more about them in the comments below .
Feel free to link to any other photos or videos .

Kristin Des Marais crouches in the damp and shines a flashlight into the vast crawl space beneath the apartment building .
The light sweeps across rocks and mounds of dirt , the glint of an empty tin can , a flash of tail .
Eyes glare back , glittering and metallic , then disappear .
A light , drizzling rain muffles sound , but an unmistakable kittenish mewing rises from the depths of the cavelike recess , beyond the light 's reach .
A pudgy skunk waddles through the beam , headed away from the noise .
Des Marais stands up and clicks off the torch .
" There 's so many places they can hide , " she says .
" This is n't going to be easy . "
There are nine buildings in the apartment complex , many with exposed crawl spaces .
The place has ponds , courtyards , a clubhouse , without a human in sight in all this rain .
But there are cats slipping in and out of the basement - level covered parking , cats huddled next to dumpsters and still - warm car engines , cats on porches and stairs .
They slink back silently when Des Marais approaches .
It 's impossible to even attempt an inventory on a wet night like this .
Some tenants think there could be fifty cats around .
Others say it 's closer to a hundred , which would make this complex in southeast Denver one of the larger feral cat colonies in the area .
It could be even more .
From the uncovered garbage cans to the cavernous crawl spaces , all the elements are in place — food , water , shelter , horny cats — for a major population explosion .
Animal - welfare activists have requested that the address be withheld ; they say that revealing the location of a colony encourages people to dump unwanted cats there .
In neighborhoods that have feral cat problems , the common lament is , " There were just two a while ago . "
But a female cat can have two or three litters a year for life .
Her female kittens can get pregnant at five months .
Before long the brood is hooking up with unfixed domestic cats , and a Malthusian nightmare has begun .
Estimates of the number of feral cats in the metro area range from tens of thousands to 125,000 ( a Denver Dumb Friends League figure ) to an improbable quarter - million ( based on a formula that assigns one stray cat to every six humans in an urban setting ) .
The Rocky Mountain Alley Cat Alliance , the lead group spearheading efforts to deal with ferals locally , has identified dozens of colonies and more than 2,000 cats in one survey , showing a heavy concentration along the Colfax and Federal corridors .
But that figure is considered just the tip of the tabby .
" We know what 's happening in colonies that we 've touched , but there are places all around that no one knows about , " says RMACA executive director Amy Angelilli .
Thirty thousand cats are euthanized every year in Colorado , double the rate of dogs .
Many are homeless cats considered unsuitable for adoption .
Working with RMACA , Des Marais and other volunteers are trying to reduce the kill rate by trapping ferals , spaying or neutering them , then returning them — in effect , transforming the entire colony from feral to sterile so that it will eventually die out on its own .
But trap - neuter - return , or TNR , is a controversial solution , often unpopular with communities afflicted by the colonies .
" More often than not , people will call and say , ' Come pick up these cats , ' " Angelilli explains .
" They think we have a special vehicle we drive around and pick up stray cats and bring them to this utopia in the country .
If people knew about TNR and why it works — but it needs to start before the population gets out of control .
By the time people call us about the problem , they 're usually so fed up that they just want the cats gone . "
That appears to be the case at this apartment complex .
Des Marais tracks down the tenant who invited her here , a man named Santos .
He says things are getting worse by the day .
He caught a neighbor shooting at the cats with a BB gun and asked him to stop .
" He said , ' Those are n't your cats , ' " Santos recalls .
" He told me to mind my own business . "
Another tenant saw a coyote eating a cat .
Cats have been found with their entrails hanging out .
One was decapitated .
Santos does n't think all the mutilations are the work of coyotes .
" People can be cruel , " he says .
Des Marais nods sympathetically .
The TNR job at this colony is beginning to look overwhelming , but she 's willing to try .
She volunteered for the no-kill MaxFund shelter for years , running its mobile adoption program , and eventually started her own nonprofit , Four Paws Pet Center of Colorado , which works with small shelters around the state to arrange low - cost or free spay / neuter clinics .
Since last year 's economic meltdown , calls to her group have tripled .
Four Paws now subsidizes 1,200 surgeries a month — many of them out of Des Marais 's own pocket .
" I was in Rocky Ford last weekend , " she says .
" We had people at 5:30 in the morning lining up and waiting to get their animals fixed for free , including some feral cats .
One woman had fifteen around her place .
You 'd think farm people could care less , but there was definitely a need .
They just can't afford it . "
Des Marais is prepared to spend two grand to get the apartment complex 's cat colony fixed at RMACA 's high - volume clinic .
But the plan soon hits a snag .
Hours after her site visit , Des Marais learns she 's not welcome on the property .
The company that manages the complex has arranged for a pest - control service to remove the skunks and cats .
Ironically , trapping skunks requires a wildlife permit and relocation of the animals , but cats can simply be turned over to the Denver Municipal Animal Shelter — which , since ferals are not adoptable , will end up euthanizing them .
Des Marais is stunned .
" They told me my money is better spent elsewhere , " she says .
" I 'm not used to this kind of thing .
I 'm trying to help . "
The management company just wants the cats removed , but it 's possible that the pest company might turn the animals over to rescuers — just as long as they do n't bring them back to the complex .
Des Marais and other volunteers begin working on a relocation plan for the entire colony .
It 's a formidable task .
Not only is there no magical place in the country for them to go , but feral cats are highly territorial .
Relocating them requires keeping them confined for weeks until they get comfortable in new surroundings .
Contrary to the myths about cats being able to fend for themselves — the same myths that have helped create the feral cat problem in the first place — a feral released in the country will try to find its way back to its colony and probably perish in the attempt .
" Cats are about twenty years behind the dog movement , " notes Angelilli .
" In Denver , the dog is treated like a kid .
People still think of cats as independent .
They think they can fare well on their own .
But they 're not going to fare well in your alley . "
Moving with the brisk efficiency of a field medic , Holly Aubart prepares a seemingly endless procession of cats for surgery .
She kneels with a syringe over a plastic carrier , and soon the caterwauling inside the box stops .
She places the anesthesized cat on a counter , at the end of a chain of similarly comatose kitties , and shaves its belly .
In the adjacent room , veterinarian Jason Cordeiro is cutting , snipping and sewing .
After thousands of identical operations , he has the procedure down to an unvarying series of steps that can be timed with a stopwatch .
Spaying a female takes about seven minutes .
And neutering a male ?
" Thirty seconds , " Cordeiro says .
He demonstrates on a gray tomcat , snoozing obliviously in a device that spreads its legs akimbo .
In moments the testes are stripped and removed ; balanced on the index finger of Cordeiro 's glove , they look like the tiniest of seed pearls .
He peels off the glove and flicks it and the tom's future generations into a trash receptacle .
Aubart moves the patient to the recovery room and brings in another .
Cordeiro and Aubart are the surgical team driving the Feline Fix , the high - volume clinic launched by the Rocky Mountain Alley Cat Alliance .
Located a few blocks east of Federal in the Valverde neighborhood , the clinic has been open since July .
But today is its official " grand opening , " complete with a ribbon - cutting ceremony , a visit from city councilwoman Judy Montero — and 47 speedy surgeries .
Most of the patients are domestic cats , brought in by owners taking advantage of the clinic 's low prices ( $ 35 for neutering a tame cat , $ 20 for ferals ) .
But one row of traps in the pre-op room is covered with blankets , some of them shaking with the displeasure of a wild thing caged .
These are ferals .
The tip of the left ear of each feral will be removed after surgery , signaling to trappers and colony managers that these have already been fixed .
RMACA does n't provide fostering , shelter , adoption or relocation services ; it 's chosen to focus on neutering as the best solution to the overpopulation problem .
Last year the group fixed 3,400 cats .
With the opening of the clinic and a grant from PetSmart Charities , RMACA plans to double that number in the coming year .
As the program expands , Angelilli expects that an increasing number of the clinic 's clients will be feral cats .
But at present , the group has no reliable process for getting them to the operating table .
If people call to report a feral cat , RMACA will loan them a trap and show them how to use it .
The organization also trains volunteer trappers who coordinate raids on colonies , bringing the ferals in waves to the clinic to be fixed , then returning them to the colonies .
Another nonprofit , Divine Feline , runs a mobile clinic that can visit a particular colony and fix the population on site .
Yet there are far more colonies than volunteers , and residents who call for help usually expect someone else to do all the work and cover the expense .
" The ideal situation would be for a partner organization to be involved in the trapping and community outreach , but nobody does that , " Angelilli says .
" All the other agencies are sheltering and rescuing , that kind of thing .
They may have traps to loan out , but they do n't have a trapping coordinator , a community - relations person to lead workshops .
Right now we do n't even have good data to show that our efforts are impacting the community . "
Angelilli came to RMACA two years ago , after starting the People Pet Partnership in Philadelphia .
Her background is in marketing and public relations , and much of her animal - welfare work has involved breaking down barriers between organizations and getting them to work together toward common goals .
As she sees it , the feral cat problem is intimately connected to irresponsible pet owners who refuse to get their own cats fixed , leading to unwanted litters , abandoned animals and feral offspring .
" Even people in the animal - welfare community think tame cats are one issue and feral cats are another , and they 're not , " she says .
" Everything is connected .
Tame is one end of the spectrum , feral is the other .
But there 's all sorts of shades of gray in between . "
When colonies do get fixed , RMACA will work with Dumb Friends and other agencies to try to find homes for the kittens .
Ferals that are five or six weeks old can usually be domesticated , Angelilli says , but it becomes increasingly difficult as they get older .
And at three to four months , forget it ; they may socialize with each other , but they will resist confinement and shun human contact .
The average lifespan of a feral cat is about three years , but advocates of the TNR approach say it can be longer if that feral is lucky enough to belong to a stable colony .
Ferals are no more prone to disease than house cats , and once they 're fixed , much of the behavior that neighbors find objectionable — spraying , fighting , roaming far and wide — is greatly decreased .
If there are caretakers willing to " manage " the colony , leaving out food and providing makeshift shelters during cold spells , the colony can die out on its own over time .
" A good , managed colony can lead a decent life , " Angelilli says .
" To try to put ferals inside is n't going to work .
And just to euthanize them — personally , I feel that 's us playing God .
People started this mess , and we 're going to end lives to solve it ? "
The effort to establish a grassroots TNR program in the city is enthusiastically endorsed by Doug Kelley , director of Denver 's Municipal Animal Shelter .
As an " open admission " operation , the shelter takes in every type of stray or homeless pet .
Cats labeled as feral will be euthanized — but not before they 've already taken up space and expense in feline housing that often operates near capacity .
Last year the city shelter put down 1,141 cats ; another 389 were adopted by the public , and 820 were transferred to rescue groups .
" We 're pretty open with the fact that a feral cat 's going to be euthanized if they bring it to us , " Kelley says .
" If a cat comes in with a notched ear , if it 's actually a managed - colony cat , we 'll get in touch with RMACA .
But animals have to be held five days , and sometimes a healthy , adoptable cat has to be euthanized to make room for an unadoptable one . "
Kelley would prefer to see ferals fixed and managed in colonies rather than being hauled to his shelter and certain death .
" A managed colony is , to me , planned obsolescence , " he says .
" It 's a way of resolving a neighborhood situation without having to euthanize a bunch of cats . "
Yet Angelilli points out that Denver 's current animal - control ordinances make the TNR approach tougher .
" You have laws that say if you feed a cat , it 's yours , " she notes , " and there 's a five - cat limit . "
Many of the volunteers in the TNR movement are violating the city 's five - pet limit by virtue of the number of cats and kittens they are in the process of rescuing , fostering or otherwise housing ; putting out food for a colony can result in further violations .
Consequently , many feral - cat people tend to operate furtively , setting up feeding stations in alleys and hiding their work from the neighbors and animal - control officers .
" We need an exemption for ferals , " says Angelilli , who 's been meeting with city councilmembers over proposed changes in local ordinances .
Kelley would rather not see his office embroiled in neighborhood complaints about feral cats , but they keep coming .
" If somebody really pushes , then we have to take some sort of action , and we 'll contact Neighborhood Inspection Services , " he says of the city agency that handles such matters .
" It 's a fine line between being a responsible person who helps take care of a colony and being a hoarder .
We 've certainly been on properties where well - meaning people have a hundred - plus cats .
Then it becomes a health and safety issue . "
Although he hopes to one day see TNR lead to a decline in shelter intake , saving tax dollars , Kelley does n't expect the numbers to change much in the short term .
In the meantime , the shelter is acquiring special feral cat boxes that are easier to clean while dealing with a hissing , biting captive .
And his staff is receiving training from RMACA in order to better distinguish a true feral , slated for euthanasia , from a cat that might simply be ill - tempered yet salvageable .
" Sometimes it 's hard to tell a feral cat from one that 's very unsocialized or one that 's just nasty , " Kelley explains .
" What we 're calling feral cats are n't always feral cats . "
Three years ago , Carol Tudor agreed to help a friend who was trying to corral a feral cat and her kittens in a condominium complex .
She learned about TNR and borrowed a trap .
The mission was successful , and she decided to get some training and volunteer to help RMACA with other ferals .
An environmental engineer who works for a consulting firm , Tudor has become an accomplished feral trapper .
In her spare time , she 's tackled colonies with as few as six and as many as thirty cats .
Residents are encouraged to do their own trapping , but if the neighbors are too elderly — or apathetic — Tudor helps out .
" Most of the time , people are thrilled to have me there , " she says .
" We get a lot of calls from elderly ladies .
They 're home all day ; they see the cats come and go .
They put out food and more come , and then there 's a litter of kittens and they do n't know what to do .
" A lot of times , they 're skeptical , " she adds .
" They ask me , ' Are you really going to bring my cats back ? '
They become quite attached , even though they can't touch them . "
Some of the highest concentrations of ferals can be found in mobile - home parks and salvage yards .
Tudor recently pulled 22 cats out of a trailer park near the city shelter .
Rising foreclosures have aggravated the problem ; people clear out and leave the cats behind .
If the colony proves to be too enormous for one trapper to handle , the volunteers will combine forces , stacking the traps in SUVs or station wagons and booking blocks of time at the Feline Fix for the surgeries .
Tudor is working with Des Marais on negotiations with the apartment complex that wants to eradicate its colony .
She recently sent a letter to the pest - control company , offering to take the cats off the company 's hands and fix them .
" They 're happy to let us take them , " Tudor says .
" They just want something in writing that says we 're not going to bring them back . "
Developing a relocation plan for up to a hundred ferals requires persistence and patience .
Tudor and Des Marais have found a few rural citizens who would n't mind having a couple of barn cats to deal with rodents , but Tudor still hopes to persuade the apartment complex managers to allow at least some fixed cats to stay .
" It 's better to have forty feral cats than forty fertile cats , " she says .
" It 's going to take a lot of barn homes to accommodate all these cats .
I may end up with some in traps in my house this week . "
( At press time , the relocation plan was still under review by the property 's management ; it 's also possible the cats could be turned over to another rescue group . )
Trappers often wind up being the principal ambassadors of the TNR movement .
They have to get permission to go on private property to set traps , explain to neighbors what they 're doing and why they 're bringing the cats back , warn people to keep their own cats indoors during the trapping operation — and , if possible , solicit donations to help pay for the whole process .
In some cases , their greatest obstacles are not the local cat haters , but the crazy cat lovers , including some of those sweet old ladies who feed the ferals .
Feeders can be the bane of an effective trapping operation .
When she 's not assisting Cordeiro with surgeries at Feline Fix , Holly Aubart works with another vet in the Divine Feline van , and she 's seen how the feeders can get in the way of a total colony fix .
" We have people who are considered caretakers , who are feeding the cats but not fixing them , " Aubart says .
" They get overwhelmed , and they have to choose between feeding and fixing .
They choose feeding , of course .
But all that does is make it so that you have to feed more . "
In order to lure the cats into traps with tasty bait , trappers ask locals not to feed the ferals just before the operation begins .
Some feeders refuse to cooperate .
" They wo n't withhold the food , which makes it more difficult to trap , " Aubart says .
" Some people will actually hold a couple of cats back because they like having kittens around .
That defeats the whole purpose of TNR . "
One feeder in Lakewood has gained particular infamy among the fixers .
The woman has set up numerous feeding stations , regularly spaced over several blocks .
Aubart estimates that she 's feeding 180 or more cats .
But she refuses to get involved in fixing them .
" She feeds all the time , " Aubart sighs .
" Other volunteers have tried to help her , and they 've given up . "
Crazy cat ladies aside , Aubart may have a deeper acquaintance with feral cats than anyone else in the state .
She works at the Feline Fix four days a week and with Divine Feline two days , assisting with dozens of surgeries .
Then she comes home to her own feral cat colony .
A few years ago , a woman in Swansea decided to leave her house to the RMACA in her will , on one condition :
The organization had to feed and protect the feral cats that frequented the property until they died a natural death .
Aubart agreed to become the caretaker of the colony .
When Aubart moved into the house in 2007 , the place was almost uninhabitable .
Feral cats roamed indoors and outdoors .
There were no litter boxes .
Aubart scoured , repainted , refinished .
She turned a carport into a heated shed , decked out with shelves and cubbyholes and numerous exits , where she could feed ferals .
And she set about trapping and fixing the cats , determined to transform the property into a model managed colony .
These days the house is presentable , if still a work in progress .
Late in the afternoon , Aubart gets ready for the evening feeding , bustling from kitchen to living room , surrounded by three domestic cats and two dogs , including Little Man Tate , a small , vocal scamp of indeterminate breed , rescued months earlier in Mexico .
In a pen are three feral kittens somebody asked her to foster , assuring her they were only four weeks old .
They 're not .
" These were dumped on me Saturday , " she says .
" They 're eight weeks old .
At four weeks , they 're easy to socialize .
But eight weeks is a little old .
You need someone who 's going to be holding them a lot , not someone who works twelve - hour days . "
She picks up one of the kittens .
It hisses , but tolerates her caress .
" It sucks to be me , " Aubart mutters .
As the sun sinks , the ferals begin gathering in the back yard .
Four , five , six — more lurking in the shadows .
Some have matted fur and resemble tufted rugs that have been left out in the elements too long .
Others are sleek , black or gray , but clearly not in their prime .
Aubart says she has about a dozen regulars , most of them ten years or older , well beyond the life expectancy of the typical feral .
Sparrow , a one - eyed snaggletooth , is at the front of the line .
When Aubart first arrived , the other eyeball was still attached but dangling out of the socket .
She has names for all of them , knows their individual quirks and temperaments : Carrot .
Rainy .
Pettie . Mattie . Lucas .
" I love these cats as much as I love my own , " she says .
" They 're not domesticated cats , but they 're not wildlife .
They 're their own category . "
Not all of the neighbors love the ferals .
Many longtime residents are used to the cats that wander the alleys , but others have complained about unwanted visitors and deposits in their yards .
Aubart plans to install mesh barriers above the privacy fence in her back yard to keep the cats contained there .
But first she has to rip up the yard , which now is a sea of weeds and stickers , and reinforce the fence at ground level to keep the cats from digging out .
Aubart opens cans in the shed , dividing the contents among several plates .
Sparrow and the others surround her .
The crowd seems to double magically , as cats slip into the shed from two directions .
A few still hold back , wary of the two - legged visitors .
Some ferals can become accustomed to a single caretaker , enough to tolerate contact with that person — but no others .
Some want nothing to do with any human .
Four ferals live in Aubart 's house and never go outside .
They are all failed experiments in socialization .
Three of them the former owner tried to domesticate .
" The other one is my fault , " Aubart says .
" You can only wait three weeks to get them back to their colony .
I waited too long .
Now I have a cat I only see every few weeks .
He loves the other cats , but he hides from me . "
Colonies such as this one are the only alternative to mass extermination of ferals , says Angelilli .
She points to another successful colony in her own Five Points neighborhood , where one couple has trapped fifty cats over a period of three years and returned them .
The neutered veterans now stay close to their feeding stations .
" This is a community problem , and it needs a community solution , " she says .
" You can't depend on one small agency to manage the entire feral cat population of the metro area .
It 's unrealistic . "
After all , cats are inherently social creatures , and over time , colonies can spill into each other .
Managers have to be vigilant and keep an eye out for newcomers , especially if the left ear is n't notched .
Aubart knows her shed is a beacon for wandering cats of all kinds , even if they have a home somewhere .
" I have nine regulars that I see every day , " she says .
" But I 've also had seven new ones since February .
Four of them are tame . "
Robin van Persie returns to Arsenal to join full training this week .
Having missed nearly five months of the season with serious ankle damage sustained on international duty with Holland , the striker is ready to rejoin his team - mates and attempt to regain match fitness before the end of the season .
" We sent our fitness coach to Holland where he has been doing his rehabilitation and we are told he looks very sharp , " said the manager , Arsène Wenger , after Arsenal 's 2 - 0 win over West Ham .
" He will be back this week but we have to wait at least a month . "
If Van Persie is able to get back on the pitch in a month , he would be available to help his team for at least three Premier League matches .
Arsenal play Manchester City at the Emirates on 24 April , then visit Blackburn , and end their campaign with a home game against Fulham .
There is also the possibility of their fixture at Tottenham being rescheduled , subject to how their north London rivals get on in their FA Cup semi-final replay .
If Arsenal progress in the Champions League , the Dutchman would also be in contention to play around the time of the semi-finals .
Van Persie scored eight goals in 15 appearances before his injury last November .
<!– ORIGINAL TITLE : " H0H 0H0 " <]
ORIGINAL EXAMPLE : Example : [ Twitchell , 2000 ] [ Content missing ] –> For years , children have been writing to Santa Claus to remind him of what good little boys and girls they ’ve been and what they would especially like for Christmas , but the problem has long been where to send such letters .
Eagle - eyed parents of previous generations would snatch up such missives when they < !– –> saw them placed among the household ’s outgoing mail , but children of more recent vintage have taken to posting such entreaties themselves ( thereby beating parents out of precise information about their offspring ’s material desires ) .
Labeled with such addresses as “ Santa at the North Pole , ” many of these notes from hope - filled children often did n’t go anywhere , instead landing in dead letter offices , there to pile up with other misaddressed mail accumulated over the years .
Canada ’s alphanumeric mail routing system provided that country with a solution to the Santa mail problem : designate the postal code version of Santa ’s familiar “ Ho Ho Ho ! ” ( “ H0H 0H0 ” ) as the Canadian equivalent of Saint Nick ’s personal ZIP code , thereby providing an easy funneling of letters meant for Santa to a central location .
Under this system , it matters not if a tot addresses his yearly wish list to “ Santa ” ( with no additional address provided ) or “ North Pole ” or “ Santa ’s Workshop ” — as long as the envelope bears the “ H0H 0H0 ” postal code , it will end up in the hands of the jolly old elf ( and his helpers at Canada Post ) .
Each letter Santa receives via the “ H0H 0H0 ” code gets read and answered .
As many fed - up secretaries in the Frozen North will attest , postal codes in Canada are six - character affairs of letter - number - letter number - letter - number .
( Try typing strings of upper case letters interspersed with numbers and see how joy - filled the experience leaves you . )
Each character in the six - item string works to narrow the destination of the mail so embossed .
For example , “ K1Z 6B7 , ” the “ K1Z ” ( forward sortation area of the code ) indicates a piece of mail bearing that designation is headed for a specific neighborhood in Ottawa , while the “ 6B7 ” ( local delivery unit ) shunts it to a particular block on Merivale Road within that city .
By the standard method of working out which Canadian postal code matches with what part of the U.S. ’s northern neighbor , one could erroneously conclude the North Pole is located somewhere in the wilds of metropolitan Montreal .
Montreal is so vast that its postal codes have exclusive use of “ H ” in the first position .
By contrast , outside of Ontario and Quebec , whole provinces and territories make do with their own initial letters ( e.g. , all of Alberta is serviced by “ T ” and British Columbia by “ V ” ) .
However , Canada Post in all its wisdom reserved “ H0H 0H0 ” for Santa ’s personal use , thereby making a geographic exception for Kris Kringle .
“ H0H 0H0 ” has been Santa ’s very own postal code since 1982 .
Approximately 1 million pieces of mail bearing that code are received by Canada Post each year , and all are answered , each in the language or form in which it was written — be it Japanese , Esperanto or Braille .
Children of all ages interested in keeping an eye on Santa ’s progress around the world on Christmas Night can do so through NORAD ’s web site for Tracking Santa . <!–

Kung fu , a martial art normally associated with China , is becoming increasingly popular in Pakistan .
There are now around 200 kung fu centres in the country and many are located in areas where the army is fighting the Taliban .
Tom Burridge reports .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti – Days after the Jan. 12 earthquake , a group of Haitians set up a small tent camp in an open field not far from the U.S. Embassy .
In theory , this small community was well - situated to receive aid :
It was in spitting distance of a helicopter landing zone .
And right nearby was the World Food Program ’s consolidated warehouse , where relief agencies store all their goods shipped from the Dominican Republic .
Being close to the nerve center of this massive relief operation , however , was no guarantee of aid .
Gene Kunze , a program officer for the U.S. charity Mercy Corps , came upon the camp quite by chance , while scanning a digital map of earthquake relief operations .
After noting the grid coordinates , Mercy Corps went out to do an assessment .
“ There are so many isolated pockets of people , ” he said .
“ Sure enough , no one [ from the aid community ] was there . ”
Delivering aid to earthquake - hit Port - au - Prince is , simply put , a logistical nightmare .
Unlike tsunami relief in 2004 , when aid workers were able to map out the gaps in their operations between villages and towns , Haitians have crowded into small , often isolated , camps throughout this sprawling city : a few families living under lean - to behind a wall , hundreds of people may be camping in an empty lot .
With mounting frustration over the distribution of aid , it has become more important than ever for aid and relief groups to coordinate their efforts : to avoid duplication of effort , and to make sure that help reaches some of Haiti ’s more isolated communities .
“ The U.N. definitely has geospatial information front and center , ” said Kunze .
“ And they also have much better map services in general than you would have seen not long ago . ”
Mercy Corps is using Google Earth to find underserved camps for cash - for - work programs .
Kunze flipped open his laptop to show a satellite map of Port - au - Prince : Red stars showed cash - for - work sites , where the group is paying people to help clean up trash and debris .
The idea is not just to use this information for Mercy Corps operations , but to share it with the rest of the aid community .
Data is fed to Map Action , located in the U.N. operations center here .
As more information comes in , a better picture emerges of what needs to be done in a certain area .
It ’s supposed to help both larger nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) like Mercy Corps as well as smaller groups that are arriving here every day .
Of course , there ’s a catch :
The system is voluntary .
The U.N. is pressing NGOs to provide GPS coordinates about their activities , no real enforcement mechanism .
Theoretically , the UN requires this basic information from any group that uses its services , including logistics and warehousing , but it is self - policing .
The U.S. government has a more robust tool for enforcing this kind of information - sharing mechanism : Cash .
According to aid workers who have attended recent USAID planning meetings , the U.S. government has made it clear that organizations not fully compliant with U.N. coordination ( in NGO - speak , the " cluster mechanism " ) should not expect to see a penny of U.S. government money .
Still , it ’s a cumbersome mechanism .
Participants in the system ca n’t instantaneously plug in grid coordinates or upload a .gpx file .
Instead , they have to fill out an Excel spreadsheet , cutting and pasting grid coordinates .
This kind of geotagging also has application for civil affairs - type work in war zones .
In Afghanistan , for instance , Mercy Corps uses similar tools to track cash - for - work projects in more dangerous parts of the country .
Local workers can take photos and provide GPS coordinates to prove that a project has been completed .
Still , despite the coordination , some Haitians think aid is not getting here quickly enough .
On a drive through Port - au - Prince ’s devastated Fort National area , pictured here , a young man flagged down our truck .
With the windows down , the stench was appalling .
Nearly all the concrete - and - masonry houses were collapsed , and bodies apparently were still in the rubble .
A young man , who gave his name as Charlie Gabriel , extended a hand , and asked me where I was from .
“ The American came here , and promised food , ” he replied .
“ We got nothing . ”
What American , I asked .
“ He was a journalist , from Brooklyn . ”

January 2 , 2010 : The Beginning And The End
The rollercoaster ride of the last year has had plenty of twists and turns , but the first cut was definitely the deepest .
Some philosopher or songwriter , probably once said that before we take a step forward we must take two steps backwards , so I wanted to take you back to where this nightmare all began .
( Did I just paraphrase Bruce Springsteen ?
Wow , I feel dirty . )
Anyhow , here ’s the bumpy ride to the land of unemployment .
( Insert harp music for the flashback . )
One day , I was managing a staff of about 50 people , most of which were the highly motivated 20 or 30 somethings who were looking to find their place in life .
Most of our full - time employees were making barely above minimum wage compared to their colleagues in the industry , while most of our part - time employees were literally making barely above minimum wage .
Either way , this group was really happy to be working and it was all worth it , right ?
We were paying our dues and building a career .
We delivered results that were well above what anyone would ’ve expected , especially when you consider that we were doing it with blindfolds on and hands tied behind the back .
As their manager , friend , and teacher , I was very proud .
Unfortunately all that meant nothing when business got involved .
The company we had all called home for almost a decade was sold to a company that had a history of 1 ) buying , 2 ) stripping down and 3 ) selling at a profit .
No way , we were going to be different .
We were going to teach the cheating boyfriend how not to cheat .
My wise mother of 79 years , said immediately after the sale that this was not a good thing , but I was too blind to see it or believe it .
Knowing that I treated the employees like people and actually felt their heartbeat , I was kept completely out of all plans for what was going to happen .
Day after day , week by week , month after month , my office was used more for therapy sessions than work .
One employee after another would come in to discuss the rumors of our demise .
I was feeling more like Dr. Phil than myself , but I was honest with every single person who walked in .
I told them I had been told nothing and that anything was possible .
For months , the upper management laid out a trail of poisonous popcorn to keep us going , like “ just keep doing what your doing ” and “ nothing is set yet ” , but behind close doors they were counting down to doomsday .
Through my own therapy sessions , I had learned , if you are going to create a make - believe scenario in your head , you do n’t always have to create a doom - and - gloom one .
Sometimes , there are happy endings .
Well , not this time .
After months of putting the group through the hell of the unknown , the ax fell .
A mandatory staff meeting was called and the group was fired -- with no notice .
Wow , that sounds pretty clean and easy .
I guess it was for them .
After all , they had been planning this massacre for more than four months .
Among the victims in attendance at the lynching was a 7 - month pregnant employee who probably would ’ve had more energy to find a job had she been told when she was 3 - months pregnant .
Of course that would ’ve spoiled the big surprise .
It ’s not like Hitler sent out emails to say when he would be stopping by .
That would ’ve ruined all the fun .
There were fathers and daughters , brothers and sisters .
A mother on maternity leave , husbands who had moved their families to take on this job .
Business is business and we all pretend to understand that , but to not give ANYbody , ANY notice was inhumane .
The new owners had every right to burn down the building , but to leave people in it to burn was were the line was drawn .
The bottom line was after decades of loyalty and countless hours of work , it all meant nothing .
Get your severance check and get out .
Oh -- and good luck with your search for employment .
From : My Unemployed Journey
When a loved one dies , most people honor their memory by attending a funeral , donating to a charity or offering condolences with a card .
Inventor Douglas Hines decided to honor a friend who died during the terrorist attacks of September 11th by creating an animatronic , Wi-Fi sex doll .
Well , I suppose we all grieve differently !
Making its debut at this year ’s Adult Entertainment Expo was Roxxxy the sex robot , which looks like a blow - up doll hooked up to a laptop .
The developers have programmed Roxxxy with multiple personalities , including Wild Windy , Frigid Farrah and S&M Susan .
She ’s also touch sensitive , as Douglas demonstrates with the video above .
I ca n’t decide what ’s weirder : the origin story of this sex doll or the awkwardly long pause it takes for Roxxxy to recognize you ’re futzing with her privates .

( OPRAH.com ) --
Can we talk ?
I mean really talk ?
I was deeply involved with a man ( let 's call him Steve ) when he surprised me with an unusual request .
One night , Steve explained that if and when we got married , he would always want to have a separate apartment where he could be " alone . "
In his version of our lives , Steve 's " alone " was when he would step out on our relationship -- up to three nights a week .
Steve wanted an open marriage -- a nonmonogamous , polyamorous arrangement wherein he could go his way and I could go mine .
Steve made his request after he and I were intimately involved -- catching me totally off guard .
I 'm a nice Jewish girl from Philadelphia who grew up in a cul de sac where we played kickball and said " darn " instead of " damn " when we missed a kick .
The concept of open marriage is very foreign to me , but I do consider myself open - minded .
I was already in love with Steve , so wondered , " Was four - sevenths of a marriage to Steve better than no marriage at all ? "
Was it at all possible that the pros of an open marriage agreement could outweigh its cons ?
We all know that deceiving someone you love feels horrible on both sides -- so could creating a system of rules for cheating actually prove to be helpful ?
Does operating with transparency when cheating lessen the stress of an affair ?
Is the true immorality of cheating the act of dishonesty rather than the act of sex itself ?
Here 's what I learned about open marriages -- the good , the bad and the @#$@ !
Oprah.com :
When to break up and when to make up
The Good
When open marriages work , it is most likely because the unconventional unions are focused on good old - fashioned open communication .
Telling the truth shows your partner respect , as does following agreed upon rules -- for example , keeping your partner in the loop as to where you have been and who you have been with .
The goal of an open marriage is to never have to lie -- to create an environment where you can be open about anything that makes you uncomfortable or afraid .
Proponents say that this atmosphere supposedly then creates an opportunity for incredible communication , deeper intimacy and the opportunity to thrive as your fullest self .
Basically , the thought is that if you truly love your partner , you want them to live their fullest life -- flings and all .
Flings are simply superficial sensory delights .
There 's no difference between your partner enjoying a pizza with anchovies without you and your partner enjoying a blonde with blue eyes without you .
In a good open marriage , you are simply creating a buffet of sexual experiences , so nobody feels like they are starving for new sensations .
This honesty enables couples to avoid the emotional downward spiral of hidden affairs because the need for secrecy is removed .
Oprah.com :
Are men only as faithful as their options ?
And what about that green - eyed monster jealousy ?
Most open marriages make strong distinctions between sex with others and romance with others .
Couples who subscribe to open - marriage philosophies typically agree to keep their spouses first at heart -- no matter who else they mingle with .
The Bad
I must confess , every time I type the words " good open marriage , " my fingers twitch .
These words feel oxymoronic .
Personally , I view more cons than pros to an open marriage .
For me , the whole point of marriage is to show your love and commitment by protecting your union with fidelity .
There 's a great deal of calm and security that comes from knowing your partner is directing his love and attention to you and you alone .
For me , rather than viewing open marriage as offering a yummy buffet of taste sensations , I view it as one big recipe for disaster .
The main ingredients -- resentment , competitiveness , jealousy , insecurity , curtailed time , scattered affections , feelings of betrayal , lack of security -- all inevitably blur the lines of a healthy marriage .
For me , a healthy marriage asks you both to bring out your highest selves .
Sure , it might take a little higher willpower to resist the lure of extracurricular sex , but this discipline is for the higher good , allowing for a calm , secure refuge to emerge .
Calm and security may not sound as hotsy totsy as sex and more sex , but many of us believe it brings far more happiness in the long run .
This security brings with it the confidence of knowing your partner is committed to you " till death do you part " rather than until their next Wednesday evening date .
In my opinion , open marriage is pretty much the opposite of marriage .
It seems to be about avoiding commitment -- one of the cornerstones of a happy marriage .
You may be able to agree on the " rules for cheating " in an intellectual way , but does n't the emotional nature of love always get in the way ?
Oprah.com :
How to get good at love
The " #$@ % ^ ! "
By the end of my research , I firmly believed that open marriage is merely an excuse for getting away with behaving self - indulgently and recklessly .
In my book " Prince Harming Syndrome " , any man who wants an open marriage is what I call a Prince Harming .
Prince Harming is someone who does not make his partner feel safe , calm , secure , confident -- and the idea of an open marriage does not leave me feeling that way .
Oprah.com : Could you be dating a Prince Harming ?
Dating is for making the most of your options .
Marriage is for nurturing the one wonderful union you 've been lucky enough to find so it grows into something incredibly wonderful .
It was surprisingly difficult to find statistics on whether open marriages work .
Ironically , open marriage is n't something we talk about all that openly .
Some research suggests that open marriage has a 92 percent failure rate .
Steve Brody , Ph.D. , a psychologist in Cambria , California , explains that less than 1 percent of married people are in open marriages .
Nevertheless , it does seem to be a trend on the upturn .
Several online dating sites offer applicants a new box to check -- married .
So what happened to Steve ?
I said no to his suggestion for an apartment he'd go to three days a week .
You can't be four - sevenths married .
If you are going to cheat , why bother asking someone to marry you in the first place ?

U.S. President Barack Obama delivers a statement following the passage of health - care legislation , as Vice - President Joe Biden listens in the East Room of the White House in Washington late Sunday .
( ( Jason Reed / Reuters ) )
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a historic health - care bill late Sunday that will make coverage possible for more than 30 million uninsured Americans and end discrimination by insurance companies against people with existing medical conditions .
Legislators voted 219 to 212 in favour of the landmark legislation that has been debated on Capitol Hill for a year .
The bill , previously passed by the Senate , did n't receive a single vote from Republicans .
It will now go to President Barack Obama for his signing into law , possibly as early as Tuesday .
" It is with great humility and with great pride that we tonight will make history for our country and progress for the American people , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said during her closing argument for health - care reform .
" Just think , we will be joining those who established social security , Medicare and now , tonight , health care for all Americans . "
Following the vote , Obama said , " This is what change looks like .
" We proved we are a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges , " he said .
" We proved that this government — a government of the people and by the people — still works for the people . "
YOUR VOICE :
What are your experiences with the American system ?
You tell us .
Overhauling of the health - care system is the most ambitious U.S. social program since Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society reforms of the tumultuous 1960s and Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal that emerged from the trauma of the Great Depression in the 1930s .
Resolving differences
The passage of the legislation was made possible by a last - minute deal struck earlier in the day between the White House and House Democrats who were holding out over abortion concerns .
The White House said in a statement that Obama would issue an executive order after passage of the health - care bill that would reaffirm current law banning federal spending on abortion , except in cases of rape , incest or a threat to the mother 's life .
Moments after the statement , leading abortion foe Bart Stupak , a Democrat congressman from Michigan , and six other anti-abortion Democrats said they would back the health - care bill .
" We 're well past 216 , " Stupak told reporters , referring to the number of votes required to pass the bill in the House of Representatives .
The legislation would extend coverage to an estimated 32 million uninsured Americans , bar insurers from denying coverage on the basis of existing medical conditions and cut federal deficits by an estimated $ 138 billion US over a decade .
Congressional analysts estimate the cost of the two bills combined would be $ 940 billion over 10 years .
Amid talk of success for Obama 's efforts to expand health coverage to the uninsured , Republicans resolutely opposed the bill .
President Barack Obama and House majority whip James Clyburn , a Democrat from South Carolina , embrace during their meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington on Saturday .
( ( Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press ) )
Republican House Leader John Boehner , on NBC's Meet the Press , said Sunday Republicans would work to repeal the sweeping reforms if they win a majority in Congress in November 's mid-term election .
Republicans say the plan to overhaul the system amounts to a government takeover of health care that will lead to higher deficits and taxes .
Obama closes the deal
On Saturday , Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to make an emotional and candid speech in an effort to close the deal , speaking to the entire Democratic caucus .
" We are proud of our individualism , we are proud of our liberty , but we also have a sense of neighbourliness and a sense of community and we are willing to look out for one another and help people who are vulnerable and help people who are down on their luck , " he said .
Obama appealed to Democrats to recall individual stories of Americans who have not been able to get health insurance because of a pre-existing condition or because of loss of employment .
" Every single one of you at some point before you arrived in Congress and after you arrived in Congress have met constituents with heartbreaking stories , " he said .
The bill would require most Americans to carry insurance , with subsidies for those who can't afford it .
It would also create state - based exchanges where the uninsured can compare and shop for plans .
Seniors who spend more on prescription drugs would get a more generous benefit , including a $ 250 rebate this year .
Young adults could remain on a parent 's insurance plan until age 26 , and no one with a pre-existing health condition could be denied insurance coverage .

I have a dream .
An idea .
A maybe great notion .
Actually , as Auggie March might say , " I got a scheme . "
What if everyone on Twitter read the same book at the same time and we formed one massive , international book club ?
Usually such programs are organized by big-city libraries .
Seattle started the trend for collective reading in 1998 when zillions of Seattlites all read Russell Banks ' book , Sweet Hereafter .
Chicago followed suit with To Kill a Mockingbird a few years later , and then other cities started jumping on the bandwagon .
When the program works – and it does n't always – it gets more people reading , more people talking and more people generally appreciating the written word .
What 's not to like ?
A few weeks ago , I was reading about the Chicago 's read - along for a grad seminar on social capital I 'm taking with Robert Putnam this semester .
My strong suspicion ( and I 'm hardly alone ) is that networks like Twitter are rife with social capital , especially the so - called " bridging " social capital that connects communities of people who have little else in common .
The thought struck me that Twitter would provide a much better platform for a book club than the mere accident of physical proximity .
Just think , we could supplant #howyouathug with # chapterfourexegesis in trending topics !
Actually , no , we probably could n't , and that 's not the goal anyway .
I love books .
So do you .
Let 's love one book together , our actual geographical location be damned .
Here 's how it'd go :
Now :
We collect nominations for what book we want to read .
Take the Reddit poll at the bottom of this story to make suggestions and vote up and down the suggestions of others .

We pick a winner out of the top selections .
Why not just pick the one with the most votes ?
Because it 's not too hard to game the system .
The final selection needs to be of general interest .
It needs to be translated into many , many languages , and ideally it should be freely available .

Soon after that :
We start reading , and tweeting , and reading , and tweeting .
In the meantime , the hashtag for One Book , One Twitter is # 1b1t .
If you want to keep up - to - date , follow me @crowdsourcing .
A few quick notes :
This is not a book club , per se .
There are some wonderful book clubs on Twitter , including # thebookclub and the Twitter Book Club ( #tbc ) .
The aim with One Book , One Twitter is – like the one city , one book program which inspired it – is to get a zillion people all reading and talking about a single book .
It is not , for instance , an attempt to gather a more selective crew of book lovers to read a series of books and meet at established times to discuss .
The point of this ( to the extent it has a point beyond good fun with a good book ) is to create community across geographical , cultural , ethnic , economic and social boundaries .
At best we start an annual summer Twitter tradition , and bring a bunch of people from all over the world to read together .
At worst a handful of us pick a book in an ad hoc fashion and we 'll simply have started another Twitter book club .
If you 're a word nerd , how bad could that be ?

Buy Local , Burn Local
Transporting firewood far from its origin can spread invasive species
In the last few years , many regulations and quarantines have been put into place that restrict the movement of firewood .
Movement of firewood across the USA - Canada border , for instance , is now restricted very closely .
Many states and counties in the USA , as well as some of the provinces and regions in Canada , now are under quarantine for wood products like cut firewood .
While these changes may be frustrating for firewood cutters , distributors and customers , they are crucial for the protection of North America 's trees from invasive forest insects and diseases .
Asian longhorn beetleBut why is moving firewood such a bad idea ?
The answer is simple ; invasive tree - killing insects and diseases can lurk in firewood .
What land managers and scientists have come to understand is that these dangerous pests rarely move very far on their own , but when people move infested firewood the problem can jump hundreds of miles .
The trouble is that infestations can be surprisingly subtle , and even the experts can't always see a couple of pin-head sized insect eggs , or a few microscopic fungus spores , in a pile of wood .
Even wood from your own backyard or woodlot , with no quarantines or pest alerts in your area , could be host to an undiscovered insect or disease .
Pest infestations can take years to be recognized by the authorities - sometimes trees appear perfectly healthy for years despite harboring harmful organisms .
By the time a tree looks sick , or the quarantine is announced , you could have spread the infestation to the forests near your family 's home , vacation cottage , favorite ski area , or secluded hunting cabin .
For instance , the Asian longhorned beetle infestation recently discovered in Worcester MA was at least ten years old when it was finally found .
Authorities now know that these beetles had infested over three thousand trees before the beetle was reported by an observant citizen .
Emerald ash borerBecause foreign bugs do n't have any predators or natural defenses to stop them , they reproduce really fast and become out of control , killing trees in their wake .
Right now , new infestations of non-native insects are destroying forests , property values , businesses , and costing both the US and Canada huge sums of money to control .
Slowing the spread of these dangerous pests by cutting , distributing , and burning firewood locally is incredibly important .
As an informed firewood user , now you know not to take any unnecessary chances with your wood supply .
You do n't need to burn less – you just need to buy the wood as close to where you burn it as possible .
Using a firewood supply that was harvested from just down the road , or at least in the same county , will help both your local economy and will protect native forests .
Invasive insects and diseases can be unwittingly transported in even the cleanest looking firewood , and the health of our forests depend on people like you making the right decision – to buy it where you 'll burn it .

With all of that excitement surrounding the beaches , it ’s only natural that the lifeguard tower stations themselves stand out .
Whether it ’s the American Flag Motif of the infamous 13th Street lifeguard station , the bright yellows and oranges of the 3rd Street station , the turquoise station of 14th Street with its kidney - shaped roof , or the bright pink and yellow of the 10th Street station , everything on Miami Beach is just a lot of fun to look at .

The question confronting the Obama administration , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , and its financial regulators is whether too much of the Financial Community has gone over to the Dark Side .
This notion has two possible interpretations .
Information Dark Side –
The first idea posits that financial institutions have now become dependent on having corners on the market of critical financial information .
This implies that financial players , particularly those dealing in complex derivative instruments ( but also hedge and short players ) , now rely on various dark lacunae regarding who owns what financial instruments , when and how much was taken on / given off and what the terms of those financial agreements are , etc .
This embracing of the financial information dark side has been impelled by the increased use of quantitative models that predict behaviors of financial instruments ( not just stocks and bonds but nestling into many large scale , yet near - opague financial instruments ) .
It is like having a corner on a rarified perspective but highly valuable financial insights .
Think of it as insider trading in financial info .
This privileged knowledge then gives their crews of quantitative analytics a competitive advantage in either creating models and hedges and / or executing the financial strategies issuing from those models .
The various funds and institutions then setup “ trading machines ” that deliver outsize returns ( read the Lowenstein book on LongTerm Capital for details ) until their models are deciphered , bettered by other players in the markets , or simply fail to track and predict well in the ever changing financial and economic markets .
The problems are twofold : 1 ) access to information is constrained to an annointed few and 2 ) regulation and control when things go awry ( think of many financial submarkets in the current broad Financial Meltdown ) is near impossible .
Dark Side Zero Sum Behavior –
The broader problem is the Masters of the Universe mentality in the financial community which posits that only a ruthless player can triumph in their dog - eat - dog Darwinian andperfectly competitive financial markets .
This , of course , can hardly be so with so much of financial markets and their information being hoarded in dark side fashion noted just above , so these markets cannot be truly efficient .
Also , many transactions can allow for several “ winners ” rather than a single winner scenario .
So many in the financial community must be the Best of the Best and deserving of their $ hundred millions to $ billion dollar annual compensations and other lordly percs .
So to be that Alpha Dog , more major financial players have been driven to the dark side which says that all financial transactions and markets are zero - sum games where my win must be your loss with no margin or allowance for any win-win transactions or outcomes .
Hardly the breeding ground for trust and a good clue as to why trust in and within financial markets [ Joe Nocera at the NYTimes describes how downright ugly the “ within ” got on Wall Street over the past two years ] is at such a low ebb .
It also helps to explain why so many bankers and investment houses refused to lend a hand to Bear Stearns , Lehman , Wamu , and other financial institutions as they imploded [ with a little short - handed help from “ friends ” ] .
It also helps to explain why self regulation by the financial community ( costs and co-operation are regarded as highly suspect ) is at a minimum and government regulation is despised despite all the financial communities sins and current floundering about .
Explanation for the Slowness of Obama Team to Spell Out Financial Reforms –
The reasons the Obama team may have been slow to make proposals for financial reforms is that a ) they have some rather pernicious financial fires to deal with not just nationally but also globally , b) they have been slow to fill Treasury posts due a vaiety of “ recruiting ” problems , c ) they have some major policymakers allied with Wall Street , d) they do n’t dare rattle the financial cages too much and But another factor is that the Obama team may be trying to sniff out if they have enough non -zero - sum players among the major financial players and elites .
There is a tough conundrum here .
Not only do the Obama people not know what is the extent and depth of toxic financial assets strewn through the banks and financial system ; but also they do n’t know how many ‘ ruthless sharks ’ permeate those same financial institutions and their key management posts .
This will determine the level and depth of reforms they will need to bring in .
Already Barney Frank , Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke are talking major changes in how the financial community does business and is regulated .
The problem now is how deep to cut to root out the decay in fiduciary trust .
The problem is that the financial elites , like the Republican party ( and in many cases we are talking one and the same ) , are baddy out of touch as evidenced in 4 prevailing viewpoints :
1 ) they regard the current financial fiasco not of their making but rather just a statistical aberration – a once in one hundred years fluke of chance like Katrina and the Floods in the Midwest ;
2 ) their cutthroat , Darwinian practices are a ) inevitable and b ) appropriate to any and all markets ;
3 ) they themselves are completely innocent of any contributions to the current financial meltdown – the meltdown was primarily due to “ lax regulators ” , “ greedy consumers ” , “ government and politicians urging easy access to housing mortgages for the underclasses ” , plus the flukes of chance and 1 in 100 year events .
To paraphrase Mad Magazine ’s Alfred E. Neuman – What , Me ?
Responsible ?!?;
4 ) so from the Wall Street view , the best reforms are minimal and none that might threaten the current US dominance of financial markets .
For the latter viewpoint there is not just an overhang of huge job losses on Wall Street and other US financial markets but the often repeated threat of going off shore , of being bought out or taking there business to overseas markets .
More than less , many US financial organizations are playing strict Darwinian hardball – an exception is the views from Blackstone ’s Steve Schwarzmann .
So that is the Obama team dilemma – how to re-regulate players who can undermine your financial recovery without losing the momentum for reform .
Judging by the recently announced financial reform package – the Obama administration left many markets dark , shrouded , largely untouched and capable of producing yet another Depression - inducing financial bubble [ the Obama / Summers aim to track the too big to fail leaves out the small / medium - scale institutions who can induce financial gridlock with domino - effect collapses ] .
By the way the next time you here an Wall Streeter or Finacial pundit say that they operate in nearly perfectly competitive markets – laugh at them .
Right now too many Wall Street and other Financial players – the best and the brightest , are morally bankrupt .
Tell them that their “ perfect markets ” have near zero trust with so many backstabbing zero - sum players , with great lacunae of financial data shrouded if not opaque but to a privileged few , with risk instruments so complex that again only an anointed few can understand them and then only marginally predict the intruments ’ effectiveness , and finally with the attitude that Moral Hazard insurance is always available from governments , compensation will forever be uncapped and never related to performance , and Madoff - equivalent behavior [ think Moodys , Fitch , and Standard + Poors ] surely to go unpunished .

The Obama administration 's passage of a sweeping health - care revamp has scrambled Republicans ' strategic calculations on Capitol Hill , forcing the GOP to decide whether to maintain its largely unified opposition to Democratic proposals .
On key pieces of legislation , including a revamp of financial rules and a rewrite of the No Child Left Behind education law , some Republicans are either explicitly on board or could soon be so .
For most of the Obama presidency , the party has moved in lock - step opposition , which has helped coalesce a revitalized conservative movement in recent months .
But some Republicans feel these two issues in particular — education and financial regulation — are harder to oppose for political reasons .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan , who has consulted closely with Republicans , has produced a plan to maintain most of the standards in former President George W. Bush 's education law , while giving school boards and the nation 's nearly 100,000 public schools more flexibility in achieving them .
Rep. John Kline of Minnesota , the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee , said that while he has some concerns about Obama 's plan , " I 'm still very supportive . "
On an overhaul of financial regulations , which is currently before the Senate , Democrats and even some senior Senate Republican aides think a handful of Republicans will vote for legislation , which could pass the Senate by Memorial Day .
Republicans have faced challenges in trying to present a unified position on the bill , given the dicey political prospect of appearing to side with big Wall Street banks .
Following the enactment of the health - care revamp , some Republicans have said the party should have sought to negotiate , instead of offering blanket opposition , to win concessions .
Others nonetheless say Democrats made a mistake in forcing through the health bill , and that the backlash against it will ultimately help the GOP in the November elections .
" If they want to drive these bills to the far left , the ideological left , then there will be less cooperation and more confrontation , " said Sen. John Thune ( R. , S.D. ) .
" If they come to the middle on some of this stuff , then I think there is obviously room for cooperation . "

Once upon a time , gay activists hated Vaughn Walker for legally squashing the Gay Olympics .
But this weekend The San Francisco Chronicle definitively revealed that the Prop. 8 judge is gay .
Judge Walker 's sexual identity has overlapped with his public life before .
Appointed to the bench by the first President Bush in 1989 , he spent his early career battling the perception that he was anti-gay after he represented the U.S. Olympic Committee in a trademark infringement battle with San Francisco 's Gay Olympics .
Nancy Pelosi accused him of " insensitivity . "
( Putting a lien on the Gay Olympics ' AIDS - ravaged leader during the man 's dying days did n't help . )
Walker had " no comment " on Chronicle political gossip duo Matier and Ross ' question about his sexuality , but did note that " Life is full of irony " when they brought up the Gay Olympics debacle .
Matier and Ross ' headline is both report and conclusion : " Judge Being Gay a Nonissue During Prop. 8 Trial . "
It 'd be cool if the relative quiet on Walker 's orientation was because America recognized that Judge Walker 's sex life does n't affect his job .
( Minimal MSM and right - wing pickup so far . )
As SF Weekly points out , even calling the Chronicle 's article an " outing " is misleading : Walker never tried to hide his orientation , and it 's pretty common for judges to keep their personal lives away from the spotlight .
A funnier explanation for the relative quiet — that the right - wing bullies who usually drive a story like this forward simply do n't read the San Francisco Chronicle or gay blogs like Queerty , which has been reporting this story for months — is perhaps slowed the Breitbartian bullhorns , too .
Recall that six months ago right - wingers feared Sonia Sotomayor incapable of fairly judging white men .
When it comes to minority judges , plenty of people are still idiots .
Hard - right hangouts like The Corner are just warming up , so the wingnut freak - out machine may fly into action yet .
The most cynical guess would be that the right measured the risks and calculated that luck of the draw ( which is how the Prop. 8 trial landed in Walker 's courtroom ) is still in their favor .
Here 's why :
A Republican appointment , Walker is believed to lean conservative , albeit by way of libertarianism , which could make him gay - friendlier .
Almost everyone agrees that , after 21 years on the bench , Walker is fair .
There is no reason to believe he'd change now — if anything , the Gay Olympics debacle demonstrated an imperviousness to public pressure .
( And resisting the urge to scream But I am one in Nancy Pelosi 's face was probably hard . )
If he rules against Prop. 8 , the homophobes will have their big , nasty appeal primed and ready .
Lest there be any doubt : Judge Walker 's sexuality is irrelevant .
Assuming gay judges always side with other gays ( or " Wise Latinas " with other Latinas ) is a flawed logic that assumes neutrality lies with heterosexuals ( or whites , or males ) .
Sexuality and identity are inescapable ; you could just as easily argue that a straight judge will be biased because all straights secretly fear gays .
Or that a straight judge with a gay child would be the most biased .
The rabbit hole of identity - based speculation is infinite ( What if Walker is self - hating ?
What if he overcompensates ?
What if one of the lawyers looks like his ex-boyfriend who was a jerk , and he can't judge fairly because he hates that guy 's face so much ? ) and pointless .
We routinely ask judges to place the law above politics and emotion .
As Queerty elegantly states , " Immutable characteristics do not disqualify a person from exercising justice . "
Also , if you write a law that so offends an entire class of people that you cannot trust them ever to discuss it fairly , then perhaps there is something wrong with your law .

Noted time - travel expert Dave Goldberg , a physics professor at Drexel University , just saw Hot Tub Time Machine and was - disturbed .
Here he explains the " egregious number of inviolable paradoxes " in the film , in an open letter to its creators .

There are spoilers for Hot Tub Time Machine below .
Be warned !
Dear Sirs :
As a noted time - travel expert , I looked forward to your new film , " Hot Tub Time Machine " with great anticipation .
Of course , one expects a fair amount of artistic license in movies .
For example , even in 1985 , the most energy efficient flux capacitors could be powered at far less than 1.21 Gigawatts of electricity .
It is also wholly understandable that you have ignored ( or are perhaps ignorant of ) the vast literature on time machine design and have therefore built yours around a hot tub , which has been shown to be unstable , rather than around the more conventional wormhole .
Further , you exhibit an admirable attention to detail on many particulars .
Following on the Terminator model , you correctly realize that time travel may only be undertaken while in the nude .
Advertisement
However , I cannot stand idly by as you subject your characters to a number of inviolable paradoxes .
Considered from least to most egregious :
1. Predestination Paradoxes .
In models of time travel with a single timeline , a traveler who has already experienced the past has no choice but to repeat his / her actions .
It is troubling to me that you address predestination in matters of only the most trifling detail , such as whether John Cusack is destined to get a fork in the eye or the fate of Crispin Glover 's arm , all while allowing gross details of history to be changed with impunity .
Tinkering with history is n't a matter of " close enough . "
Once things are changed , however slightly , they 're changed for good .

Your characters , showing better temporal intuition than you , yourselves , comment on this point , and warn of the " Butterfly Effect . "
A couple of observations are in order .
First , the movie of that name was unspeakably terribly , and you do yourself and your characters a disservice to speak of it approvingly .
Secondly , the changes wrought in the past would have so changed the future that any foreknowledge would quickly become worthless .
If you do n't make your fortune in the first couple of days , it 's already too late .
The alternate future you will have created will likely have everyone running around in goatees and building doomsday devices .
2. Information Paradoxes .
In my universe , the Black Eyed Peas hit , " Let 's get it started " came out it 2002 , but Craig Robinson feels that by dint of chronological advantage , he can take credit for another 's work .

Normal information paradoxes are concerned with inventions that have no inventors , like a time traveler who gives a design to a younger version himself .
But you take this abuse of time travel a step further , as a gross violation of patent and copyright law .
In your alternate , " utopian " future , Black Eyed Peas genius is presumably never recognized .
3. Grandfather Paradoxes .
This is perhaps the most famous time travel paradox , since it supposes that the time traveler 's actions in the past can prevent his own future from playing out as he originally experienced it , or even his own existence .
When Clark Duke interrupts his parents mid-coitus , he temporarily disappears from existence .
Mathematical models demonstrate that this is not what would happen .
It has been shown conclusively that he would fade from existence a bit at a time , starting with images in photographs .

4 . It is also not clear to me what the punk rockers were doing at the ski resort in the first place ; they certainly were n't there to see Poison .
I have n't yet addressed my biggest concern : your use of a malleable history that permits of parallel universes .
To be sure , parallel universes are distasteful from a physical perspective , but I 'll forgive you that .
What can not be forgiven is that by your reasoning , good people deserve to be live in terrible universes .
Consider that the from the moment John Cusack showed up to resume his life in alternate 2010 there was a being inhabiting his body who had done all of the hard work getting his life together .
Once the John Cusack from our universe showed up , that other – better – version of Cusack was displaced .
He was banished , presumably along with the Google founders ' patent claims .

I would be more than willing to serve as a scientific consultant should you choose to make a sequel ( or perhaps even a director 's cut of the present film ) in order that these transgressions not be repeated .
As a closing note : I found the nudity tasteful and not at all excessive .
Sincerely ,
Professor Dave Goldberg

It looked for a time like even Harry Reid ’s stripped - down jobs bill might stall with less than the required 60 votes , but at least two Republicans — Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Olympia Snowe of Maine — have joined with the Democrats , which should be enough to advance the bill through this key procedural vote .
Late Update : The final vote was 62 - 30 .
The Dems lost Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , who voted against the bill ; and Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) is undergoing cancer treatment and did not vote .
So that knocked the Dems from 59 votes down to 57 , but they picked up five Republicans , Brown and Snowe , as I mention above , plus Susan Collins ( R- ME ) , Kit Bond ( R - MO ) and George Voinovich ( R - OH ) .
At the top is a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol .
Below , the WiiAuto Pistol .
Mistaking the former for the latter , three - year - old Cheyenne Alexis McKeehan of Wilson County , Tennessee , shot and killed herself Sunday evening .
Where does the blame lie ?

We reported on the accidental shooting death of Cheyenne Alexis McKeehan yesterday , mainly due to the fact that the initial reports indicated the girl mistook a real pistol , left on a living room table by her stepfather , for a gun-shaped Wii controller .
In our experience , Wii gun controllers are generally white , blue , or orange , in order to avoid exactly this sort of situation .
Advertisement
The WiiAuto Pistol is a cheap bit of plastic manufactured by the HAIHONGCHANG Electronics Company in China , available for purchase via various web sites and on eBay .
I 've seen the peripheral go for anywhere for $ 7 to $ 15 , so not only is it coloring realistic , it 's cheap as well .
We 've reached out to the manufacturer regarding this story , and would update should we receive a response .

Further details have arisen about the case itself as well .
The child 's stepfather , Douglas Cronberger , had been checking for trespassers using the gun , and not scaring off dogs , as originally reported .
Both Cronberger and his wife , Tina Ann Cronberger , were home at the time of the shooting , with the mother working on the computer a few feet away from where Cheyenne played .
A police statement noted that Cheyenne had learned to use a gun by playing with the Wii for several days .
Advertisement
There are several things that strike me odd about this case , but I 'm not here to speculate .
The fact of the matter is that I can now see how the child could have mistaken the real gun for the toy .
Free from American manufacturing and product approval restraints , the Chinese manufacturer created a very convincing facsimile of a real weapon , especially when fitted with a black Wii remote .
That does n't make them responsible for this death .
There is a very clear message in this story .
If you own a handgun , or a gun of any kind , make sure you 're responsible enough to keep it away from children .
The presence of a lifelike gun controller for the Wii does n't shift blame to Nintendo or a Chinese peripheral manufacturer .
If anything , it piles more responsibility onto the shoulders of the parents .
I can walk into any big electronics store and find two or three Wii gun controllers in several different shades of unrealistic gaudiness .
Advertisement
Instead of purchasing one of those , someone opted for the more realistic model , just like someone opted to leave a loaded weapon within reach of a curious three - year - old child with a notion that gun-shaped objects are fun to play with .
We 've reached out to both Nintendo and the Wilson County Sheriff 's Department for comment on this story , but no response was received as of publishing time .

Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death .
( Albert Einstein , Religion and Science , New York Times Magazine , 9 November 1930
The most beautiful and most profound experience is the sensation of the mystical .
It is the sower of all true science .
He to whom this emotion is a stranger , who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe , is as good as dead .
To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists , manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their primitive forms - this knowledge , this feeling is at the center of true religiousness .
( Albert Einstein - The Merging of Spirit and Science ) The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion .
It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology .
Covering both the natural and the spiritual , it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity .
Buddhism answers this description .
If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism .
( Albert Einstein ) It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it .
( Albert Einstein , 1954 ) From Albert Einstein : The Human Side , edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman , Princeton University PressScientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of Nature , and therefore this holds for the action of people .
For this reason , a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer , i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being .
( Albert Einstein , 1936 ) Responding to a child who wrote and asked if scientists pray .
Source : Albert Einstein : The Human Side , Edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh HoffmannI cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures , or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves .
Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death ; let feeble souls , from fear or absurd egoism , cherish such thoughts .
I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world , together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion , be it ever so tiny , of the Reason that manifests itself in nature .

The Middle East 's biggest shopping centre was partially evacuated today as maintenance crews scrambled to contain a leak , captured on video , springing from a shark - filled aquarium .
The footage posted on the website of a Dubai newspaper showed the water from the 2.6 m - gallon ( 11 m - litre ) tank pouring on to the mall 's polished floors .
Visitors were kept from the scene after the water began pouring from behind the 75 cm - thick viewing panel .
However , from a distance the water appeared to be contained inside the tank .
" There has been a small break in the glass , " an official at Dubai 's civil defence department said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Emaar – the company that owns the mall and the world 's largest building , the Burj Khalifa , above – confirmed the leak in a brief statement .
" A leakage was noticed at one of the panel joints of the Dubai Aquarium at the Dubai Mall and was immediately fixed by the aquarium 's maintenance team , " it said .
" The leakage did not impact the aquarium environment or the safety of the aquatic animals . "
The incident raises fresh questions about building safety in the city - state .
Less than three weeks ago Emaar barred public access to the Burj Khalifa after an elevator got stuck near the 124th - floor observation deck .
The company added that it " upholds the highest safety standards in its management " .
It did not make anyone available to comment further .
Much of the area around the aquarium was evacuated and has been cordoned off .
An employee working for the ticket office , Samia al - Rajaby , said that the aquarium was being closed for the day as maintenance crews worked .
Shopkeepers near the aquarium said they were ordered to close their stores and evacuate the area for fear of further flooding during repairs .
" They told me that the aquarium exploded , " an employee of an affected shop said on condition of anonymity .
" We feel upset because it 's the end of the month and the start of the weekend and we were expecting many customers . "
But Alena Markovich , a manager of a clothing store that remained open for business , said the security response was swift and appropriate .
" They are doing their best , " she said .
The Dubai Mall opened in November 2008 .
The shark , stingray and fish - filled aquarium is on the ground floor and boasts the world 's largest acrylic viewing panel .
A Short Study of the Jewish Hercules
As much as many of us enjoyed watching the humiliation of Israel and PM Netanyahu in Washington this week , I am reluctant to suggest that the emerging crisis between America and Israel may also be a red light warning for all of us .
The current crisis may lead to some devastating consequences as far as Palestine , Iran and the Middle East are concerned .
“ Netanyahu and Obama are at a point of no return ” claims Haaretz writer Akiva Eldar .
“ As far as President Barack Obama and his senior advisers are concerned , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to blame for nothing less than damaging the standing of the U.S. in the Middle East and the Muslim world . ”
It may be possible that the Americans have started to gather that there is no partner for peace in Israel .
America clearly has had to shun its ‘ kosher ally ’ .
The American military and political elite already admitted this week that Israel is a strategic burden on the U.S. Seemingly , the only people who genuinely believe in the American Israel strategic bond are AIPAC and its list of obedient ‘ Sabbath Congressmen Goyim ’ .
But unfortunately , this is just one side of the story .
A deeper reading of recent events would suggest that the latest American Israeli rift is actually led by Netanyahu ’s political partners .
Interestingly enough , as much as America reveals growing disapproval of Israeli policy , the anti American attitude , demonstrated by Netanyahu ’s allies at home , is overwhelming .
It does n’t take a genius to grasp that some of Netanyahu ’s cabinet members are doing everything in their power to fire up a storm between Israel and its ‘ closest ally ’ .
Interior Minister Eli Yishai , the man behind decisions that sparked the recent diplomatic crisis , said this week ‘ Israelis voted for this government ’s path , according to which , there will be no compromises on ( the ) Jerusalem issue ’ .
He also used the opportunity to thank his creator for giving him “ the right to be the minister who approves the construction of thousands of housing units in Jerusalem ” .
Along with his latest disastrous visit to Washington , PM Netanyahu found time to consult with his Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman .
According to Ynet , Lieberman advised his PM “ not to capitulate in face of American pressure ” .
I guess that most political analysts fail to understand the depth of the Israeli right wing expansionist and racist conviction .
Unlike Sharon , Peres , Livni , Rabin , Olmert , Barak and even Netanyahu himself , who along the years , paid a limited respect to the West and the US in particular , Netanyahu ’s cabinet is dominated by right wing Zionist hawks .
They follow David Ben Gurion ’s old mantra : “ It does n’t matter what the Goyim ( Gentiles ) say , the only thing that matters is what the Jews do ” .
Netanyahu ’s political partners are not willing to compromise or acquiesce to American conditions .
Netanyahu ’s political allies are convinced that at least momentarily they will do better without Uncle Sam .
They realise that the days of the ‘ Jew - only state ’ are numbered unless some radical moves are put into action .
They grasp that unless the Jewish state implements measures that would push the entire Palestinian population out of Israel , the Zionist dream will come to its end and pretty soon .
Those hawks also realise that once Iran gets a hold of a nuclear capacity , Israel ’s ability to maintain its status as a ‘ regional terror - inflicting power ’ , would disappear overnight .
Netanyahu ’s cabinet members grasp that if Israel wants to survive as a Jewish ethnocracy and a regional super power , Israel must confront Iran soon and ethnically cleanse Palestine of its indigenous population , in an act that will complete the objectives of the 1948 Nakba .
Israeli hawks who currently dominate Netanyahu ’s government and Israeli politics realise that a bond with America can only restrict and even jeopardize their sinister plans for the region .
It is obviously hard to predict Israel ’s next move .
However it is crucial to remember that at the heart of the Zionist collective narrative we find Biblical stories like that of Samson , a tale of a suicidal genocidal character .
Samson is the Jewish Hercules .
He was granted some tremendous strength by God to combat the Jew ’s enemies and to perform some ‘ heroic ’ feats unachievable by ordinary humans .
He wrestles a lion , he slays an entire army with only a donkey ’s jawbone and eventually when the time is ripe , he commits mass murder .
Single - handedly he crushes a Philistine temple killing thousands , including the elderly , women , children and himself .
I do not know whether Lieberman regards himself to be the new Samson .
Looking at his recent picture , he is probably not fit enough to fight a lion .
However , the genocidal tendency together with suicidal inclination is absolutely there .
Many of those killed and injured are believed to be civilians Mogadishu 's mayor has told residents to leave the Somali capital 's war zones , amid fierce battles with insurgents .
At least 50 people have been killed in three days of Islamist insurgent attacks , witnesses and officials say .
Mayor Abdurisaq Mohamed
Nor said the long - anticipated government offensive may start soon , so residents should withdraw at least 2 km ( 1.25 miles ) .
About half of Mogadishu 's residents have already fled the city after two decades of conflict .
The BBC's Mohamed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu says this is the heaviest fighting since May 2009 , when insurgents tried to topple the weak UN - backed government .
He says those still in the city have not yet responded to the mayor 's call .
" We urge the civilians to flee from the battle zones and go at least 2 km away to avoid being hit , " Mr Nor said .
The United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that some 33,000 people have been driven from their homes in Mogadishu over the past six weeks .
' Trapped '
Our reporter says government forces are shelling insurgent front lines , to stop them advancing towards the few areas under control of government forces , who are backed by African Union peacekeepers .
My oldest son is still there to take care of the house and the property
Adow Yusuf Da'ud " Some 200 insurgents aboard 12 vehicles mounted with machine guns came to our district and started to move towards the presidential palace , " said Mohamed Abdi Haji , a resident of Mogadishu 's northern Wardhigley area .
" Government soldiers and AU peacekeepers bombed them with heavy artillery and forced them to retreat , " he said .
Some of those fleeing the city told the BBC that many of their relatives and neighbours are trapped in the war zone .
" My husband and six of my relatives and some of my neighbours are trapped inside their homes in north Mogadishu 's Abdulasiz district by landing mortars and bullets flying everywhere , " said Dahabo Duhulow , a mother of six .
Government forces only control a small part of Mogadishu
With his two - year - old son clasped to his chest , Adow Yusuf Da'ud said he had walked three hours through dangerous streets and alleyways to escape the fighting .
" During the day and during the night , the shells were raining down into our residences , " Mr Da'ud said .
" My oldest son is still there to take care of the house and the property . "
The UNHCR said it was especially worried about the thousands of people who are unable to flee the capital .
There are almost 1.5 million people now displaced within the country .
For months now government leaders and its military commanders have been talking about an impending operation to seize control of the whole of Mogadishu .
Our reporter says there are few civilians left in areas which often see battles but large numbers remain in some districts controlled by the insurgents .

Slide 1 of 11 ,
An effort is under way to open up the investigative files on more than 370 New York City schoolteachers who were ousted in the 1950s because of suspected Commmunist ties .
Irving Adler , now 96 and living in Vermont , remembers the day he was fired from Straubenmuller Textile High School in Manhattan .
" I was teaching a class when the principal sent up a letter he had just received from the superintendent announcing my suspension , as of the close of day . "
Cheryl Senter for The New York Times
SCO v. Novell went to the jury today .
Judge Ted Stewart said , after the jury left to begin to deliberate , that in all his years on the bench , he 's never seen such fine lawyering as in this case .
Chris Brown reports that the jury says they will not reach a verdict by today : I 've just received word that the jury does not expect to be done by 5 pm ( it was 4:30 when I got the call , it 's 4:45 now ) .
They will be going home at 5 pm and resume on Tuesday morning .
If you recall , one juror is on vacation through Monday , so that 's why it 's not resuming until Tuesday .
What it means is either that there is at least some disagreement on something , or that they just can't get through all the check boxes in time .
Update : From Chris : " I 've just received word that the jury has , in fact , left the building . "
cpeterson and Chris were just two of our reporters there today .
So , we 'll start with their initial reports , beginning with cpeterson : Judge Stewart read instructions to the jury this morning .
Then Stuart Singer gave the main part of the closing argument for SCO , followed by Brent Hatch who spoke about the damages portion .
Then a break , followed by a sidebar , with white noise , and no jury present .
Following the sidebar , Judge Stewart informed the gallery that if there were any audible reactions , those responsible would be removed .
Sterling Brennan gave the closing argument for Novell , followed by a rebuttal by Singer .
Then the jury - minus the alternate , who was excused - retired to consider their verdict .
Now , it seems is the time to wait ... and if you 're a lawyer , take bets , I guess .
( I was asked by several , including Mr. Hatch , how I was handicapping it . )
Say , how was he handicapping it ?
I guess we 'll have to wait .
And here 's Chris 's report : I got to the courtroom at about 11:45 am and found it standing - room only .
Novell 's Sterling Brennan was just winding up his last fifteen minutes of an impassioned , even patriotic , summation to the jury .
I heard SCO 's Sterling Singer provide his last rebuttal , a strongly argued request to rule in their favor .
Judge Stewart gave some final direction to the jury , including announcing to them that Juror 13 was the alternate and would not have the privilege of deliberating .
When Judge Stewart opined that she'd be sorry to do so , she vigorously shook her head no ( drawing a laugh from everyone ) .
A marshal affirmed an oath to protect the jury , and they left in good spirits .
After they 'd departed , Judge Stewart said in his ten years on the bench he 's never had a finer , more talented , professional set of lawyers in the room .
He thanked them sincerely for their fine work and demeanor .
He thanked Mr. Lee and Mr. Grant for their deft handling of the courtroom technology , saying it almost made it worth its money .
He said if anyone has children at home and is interested in buying their own noise system , to contact Ms. Malley .
He then adjourned the court .
All the lawyers and audience were in high spirits , spending a lot of time chatting in groups before they left .
I chatted with a number of Groklaw people afterwards who'd attended all or part of the day and who promised to get reports in .
I do n't know about the jury , but my plan is to sleep until Tuesday .
Nah .
Kidding .
I 'll let you know the minute I get more reports .
Update 2 : And here they come .
Lots of folks were there today , so let 's start with MSS2 : Sorry this took me so long .
Rather than come straight home , I hung around the courthouse until after 4:00 , chatting and hoping that there would be a verdict .
When we got the word that there would n't be , I headed home and started typing .
The morning started with a conference .
They agreed on how to handle presentation of materials in the closing arguments .
( I believe that the issue here was that SCO wanted to show videos , and Novell argued against .
They agreed not to . )
SCO filed a motion on three issues ( see two articles ago ) .
Stewart said he was going to agree with SCO on all three points .
First , the demonstratives .
Second , Novell can't argue that the APA only meant Unix , not UnixWare .
Novell said that they would argue that they owned the pre-APA code and SCO owned everything SCO had written post - APA .
Stewart said that would be all right .
Third , the motion said that Novell could n't argue anything contrary to the law ( perhaps this meant contrary to the law of the case ) .
Novell could not argue that the copyrights did not transfer based on the lack of a 204A writing .
Novell said that they would argue based on the contract .
There was some discussion about a footnote in the 10th Circuit ruling .
After looking at the wording , Stewart said that Novell could argue based on intent .
Judge Stewart said that Novell 's slander claim against SCO had been dismissed .
Both sides ' proposals for findings of fact and conclusions of law are due on April 16th .
Then the jury came in .
The jury will get a copy of the jury instructions in the jury room .
Judge Stewart read them to the jury .
The first few points were about following the law .
If the jury does n't follow the law , they will be violating their oath as jurors .
Statements by counsel , he told them , are not evidence .
Novell 's slander of title claim is gone .
The jurors should not worry any further about it .
SCO has the burden of proof , he explained .
They need to show that the preponderance of evidence is in their favor .
This is not the same as showing that they have the higher number of witnesses .
This is based on probabilities , not certainty .
For constitutional malice , SCO has a higher burden of proof .
The standard is clear and convincing evidence , meaning that there is no substantial doubt .
The jurors are allowed to use notes , but should not use them as anything but a personal memory aid .
Evidence can be either direct ( testimony or exhibit ) or indirect ( chain of reasoning ) .
Both are acceptable .
The charts and illustrations presented to the jury are illustrations , not evidence .
The prior rulings in the case that the jurors heard about were without benefit of the evidence presented to the jury and were overturned unanimously .
They are relevant only to the determination of special damages .
It was mentioned that SCO was bankrupt .
That 's not relevant to the case .
They heard about the 2008 trial .
That was about other matters than what is before the jury .
Finding that Novell committed slander of title requires four elements .
First , it requires that Novell made statements disparaging SCO 's title .
They must have been made to someone other than SCO .
They must convey the idea of a statement of fact .
Do n't consider words or even sentences in isolation .
Second , slander requires falsity , either a statement that is directly untrue or which conveys a false impression .
This means that the jury must determine who owns the copyrights .
The APA and the amendments must be taken together to make this determination .
The amendments supercede parts of the APA .
The jury must determine what the intent was at the time of the contract .
They may consider extrinsic evidence such as testimony of intent and the course of conduct of the parties .
( I think this means that SCO lost a small battle here ; if I recall correctly , they wanted Stewart to say " should " instead of " may " . )
To be valid , the transfer of copyrights must be in writing .
Third , slander requires constitutional malice .
This means either knowledge that the statement was false , or reckless disregard of the truth .
This means a high degree of awareness that it was probably false .
It takes more than recklessness or spite .
Finally , slander requires that the statements caused special damages such as lost sales .
The slander has to be a substantial factor in loss of specific purchases , or else it has to be widely disseminated .
A decline in stock price is not special damages .
If ill will was involved , punitive damages may be awarded .
Regular damages must be real damage , not speculation .
The issues related to 4.16 are for the court , not for the jury , but may be used to help the jury interpret the APA .
And then came an instruction that I thought was rather odd :
The jury is not to write on the copy of the instructions in the jury room .
Finally , Stewart said that the jury needed to reach a unanimous verdict .
They need to come to conclusions together without doing violence to each other 's opinions .
And here is his report on SCO 's closing arguments : SCO 's closing argument , by Stuart Singer :
This is an important case .
It 's important to SCO .
It 's important to individuals who work at SCO .
There are two questions for the jury .
Did the copyrights go to SCO ?
And was there slander ?
And if so , what are the damages ?
He talked about consistency .
I think his point was that you had to build a consistent picture out of all the evidence presented , but he used it to point out a couple of inconsistencies , as he saw it , in Novell 's testimony .
Some said that the waiver in the IBM case was without input from IBM , but LaSala said Marriott asked for it .
Also , Stone said that he was asked to leave Novell , but Messman said that he was not .
Did the amended APA transfer the copyrights ?
The amendment replaced language that was inconsistent with the intent .
The plain language of the APA with Amendment 2 says that the copyrights transferred .
Novell admits that Amendment 2 transfers the copyrights .
In the June 6 press release , they said that it " appears to " .
And Amadia 's testimony said that whatever SCO needed to exercise their rights transferred .
And the copyrights were needed .
He quoted from Frankenberg , Jim Wilk , Sabbath , and Broderick .
It all makes sense with Amendment 2 .
There was too much money for it not to be a sale of the whole business ( he included the royalties here ) .
The license back makes no sense without the purchase of the copyrights .
This all makes sense in light of the witness testimony .
He cited Michaels , Sabbath , Madsen , Mohan ..
( He specifically noted that Madsen has no interest in the outcome of the case . )
And Novell 's people agreed , too : Frankenberg , Duff Thompson , Ed Chatlos , and Ty Mattingly .
He noted that Frankenberg had no interest in the outcome .
You have to believe that all ten of their witnesses are mistaken or lying in order to believe Novell .
Tor Braham was only involved in the last two weeks of the negotiation .
He ignored the intent of the negotiators in a " forced march " to get the deal done .
No pushback from SCO at the time of the sale means that the copyright transfer was missed , not that it was accepted .
At the Novell board meeting , the copyrights were not mentioned in the overview , but only in the resolution .
Messman says he remembers , but then he 's the one who approved the slander .
This was done by mistake , or by overzealous lawyers .
It was fixed by Amendment 2 .
That this was the intent is supported by the press release .
It 's supported by the summary reported to the federal government .
IBM recognized that SCO had the copyrights .
What was the course of performance of the parties ?
Broderick had letters sent to the customers .
Nagle had the code changed to reflect the copyright change .
So , yes , the copyrights transferred .
Did Novell slander SCO ?
If SCO owns the copyrights , there 's not much question .
After June 6 , Novell 's statements were made with actual knowledge that they were false .
Novell 's May 28 statement was reckless - Novell already had found Amendment 2 , though unsigned .
On June 5 , they got a signed copy .
On June 6 , they made a clear statement of SCO 's ownership .
But on March 14 ( next year ) , Stone said " we still own Unix " .
Chatlos and Levine said that it would have been unethical to do the deal without transferring the copyrights .
So Novell 's allegations must have been knowingly false .
Special damages are the damages to SCOsource .
They have claims that their source code was found in Linux , but that 's not an issue before the jury .
The companies getting SCOsource licenses were sophisticated companies .
He quotes Laura Didio and two others .
( I 'm a bit unclear on what point he was trying to make here . )
Punitive damages are based on malice , on intent to injure .
Two slanders on the same day as SCO 's earning announcements .
That 's intent to injure .
( There was lots of anger and outrage in his voice here . )
O'Gara 's testimony about Stone shows intent to injure .
Messman said that Novell 's intent was to publicise their statement as widely as possible .
Novell waived SCO 's rights against IBM at the same time as IBM 's investment in Novell .
( Reporter 's note :
My overall impression of Singer 's statement is that he had lots of logical gaps where his facts did n't add up to his conclusions , papered over with rhetoric . )
Then Brent Hatch took over .
He was wearing a maroon ( or burgundy ? ) bow tie .
SCOsource had real sales , in the tens of millions of dollars .
HP was looking at a contract worth $ 30 million .
Then Novell inserted themselves and said that they would re-assert copyright ownership .
The deal went away .
Google has over 500,000 servers .
That would have been a large deal .
Novell was a substantial factor in why the deal fell apart .
A deal with Dell died after Novell 's December 22nd announcement .
He quoted testimony from SCO 's salespeople .
Gasparro had $ 50 - 60 million of opportunities , but they dried up after Novell 's claims .
Novell was a major factor why .
Langer had more than $ 3 million worth of deals in the pipeline , but they dried up after Novell made their claims .
There was a third salesman , named Peck or Pettit , that he talked about .
He talked about the standard specified in the jury instructions to show that it lined up with the evidence he was reviewing .
Musika said that people disliked SCO .
It 's just a small Utah company standing up for its rights .
But it 's hated .
Botosan and Pisano took all this into account .
They came up with 19 to 45 % .
Pisano's hard , scientific data took into account all the factors that Musika used to say that the figure was zero .
The special damages are the vendor licenses that SCO did n't sell .
The damage figures are conservative .
Musika did n't do any calculations ; he just highlighted the risks .
He did n't use a " but for " analysis , even though he admitted that it was the correct method .
Punitive damages are at the discretion of the jury .
Hatch points out that Novell is worth about $ 1 billion .
The jury is allowed to consider that in determining the amount of punitive damages .
Hatch closes by saying that Novell knew with certainty that it did n't own the copyrights by the time of their second anouncement ( December 22 ) .
We also had in the audience a new reporter , his first time sending us a report from the trial , and here are his impressions of the two Fridays he was in attendance , today and the morning of March 12 :
Here is my summary impression of the part of the Novell vs. SCO trial I witnessed .
I attended two morning portions of the trial : Friday March 12 and Friday March 26 .
On the 12th , I think Ty Mattingly had pretty good command in delivering his testimony ( whether it has bearing or not ) and that tended to carry the morning .
This morning , on the 26th , my impression is that Singer started with a pretty strong closing but then Brennan gave a masterful presentation that carried it home .
Singer came back at the very end for 12 minutes but it seemed he was fishing for something to equal it , talking quickly and not being as organized as he was in his first segment of closing .
At the end , Judge Stewart stated that he had never had so much legal competence in the room over the last 10 years as he did this day .
It was fun to see them in action !
Other notes : Judge Stewart 's instructions to the jury :
The jury only needs to decide based on a preponderance of the evidence , i.e. that it is more likely true than not true .
In the case of a tie ( my own words ) , they should rule in favor of Novell .
SCO 's evidence must be clear and convincing .
Even though the judge let the jury take notes ( not allowed by the judge in some cases ) , the jury 's memory should take precedence over their notes ( i.e. their notes are a tool only , as they are n't evidence ) .
Acts and omissions by the actors of corporations are the acts and omissions of the corporations .
The Kimball ruling ( not referred to by Stewart as the Kimball ruling ) should have no bearing on the jury 's finding .
The jury should view the contract and Amendment 2 as the contract , with Amendment 2 taking precedence in the event of any conflicts .
Also the jury should look at the course of performance subsequent to the signing of the contract to resolve any ambiguities .
Something about exclusive licensee .
Slander of title has to have  constitutional malice .
A drop in value ( of what was sold ) is not a damage .
Singer closing : Amendment 2 replaces the asset purchase agreement and is the rest of the story  ( to use a phrase Paul Harvey was known for that Brennan used earlier ) .
It would n't make sense to get the Unix and UnixWare business without the copyrights .
Consideration of 40 to 50 million plus royalties having four components was given .
The license back to use would n't have been given to Novell unless the copyrights were transferred .
10 SCO witnesses said SCO got the copyrights , plus Sabbath , Madsen , Mohan , Wilt et al [ incomplete ] .
Some Novell executives agree with the SCO witnesses .
Frakenberg  the most important witness  says the copyrights did n't transfer .
Amendment 2 was a fix applied a year later to clarify the intention of the parties .
How did the mistake happen in the first place ?
The original APA was screwed up due to time pressures in getting the business transacted .
No push back does n't make sense .
Attorneys operated on cover documents without details .
Or we have a case of overzealous lawyers .
Press articles confirmed the nature of the deal .
Novell told the federal government such ( something consistent with SCO 's viewpoint ) .
With regard to course of performance : Novell gave notices to customers stating ownership had transferred .
SCO put copyright notices in the code .
With regard to Novell slandering SCO : Singer referred to the 2003 statements by Novell .
Messman conceded ownership after being confronted with Amendment 2 .
Singer said Messman could n't get the decade right to otherwise damage the reliability of his testimony .
Novell announced on SCO 's earnings statement days -- on two occasions -- their assertion of ownership to damage SCO .
Then Hatch on Singer 's team got up .
I had to feed the meter as it was now about 10:15 and so I missed most of Hatch 's argument on how much the damages should be .
Hatch stated HP was told by Novell that they ( Novell ) would assert and that killed the licensing deal .
Then a licensing deal with Google was killed , then a deal with Dell ( McBride had met with them ) .
Hatch states something to the effect that the jury should fill in the blank on the amount of punishment ( for punitive damages ) .
Brennan closing :
When growing up he had heard the phrase let 's not make a federal case out of it  but here we are in federal court , and this is a federal case .
It 's not trivial .
It 's very important .
Open source has been threatened .
This is the entry ( i.e. , beginning ) to many cases if there 's an adverse verdict .
The sanctity of contracts and being able to rely on what they say is at stake here .
Contracts are not determined by hindsight or what we would have wanted to do .
At question here is whether people are free to speak what they believe ( in reference to the slander part of the case ) .
Novell minutes are what appear in the contract .
The agreement ( i.e. , contract ) has three months for review and nobody objected to the language as written .
Other provisions were modified but the asset transfer provisions were not modified .
The bill of sale refers to the APA ; therefore , one has to look at the APA to determine what transferred .
SCO could not represent to Caldera that they had chain of title .
Enter McBride .
Notwithstanding the above , he chose a course of litigation .
( This was stated more than once ) .
Mike Amber said the contract excludes everything .
The term sheet produced by Ty Mattingly , late and initially only to SCO counsel , was preliminary .
The press release was SCO 's statement only .
The license back provisions referred only to assets transferred .
Jim Tolonen testified he wrote the contract the way Novell has stated it is constructed .
Also Tor Braham , the lawyer who wrote it .
I believe he stated the two prior individuals had no financial interest to gain .
Alison Amedia drafted Amendment 2 . Sabbath under sworn testimony said that Novell retained IP .
Chatlos  he and his wife stand to make money if the outcome is favorable to SCO .
Ryan Tibbitts and McBride had no involvement with the contract and stand to gain if the outcome is favorable to SCO .
Novell had business reasons to exclude transfer of the copyrights : 1 ) to protect Novell 's interests , and 2 ) Novell did n't get sufficient money to transfer them .
There 's a great void of evidence .
None of SCO 's hired attorneys are testifying [ directly or through deposition ] that the copyrights transferred .
On Amendment 2 that Steve Sabbath drafted , he stated something about the copyrights that SCO had acquired  and that language was struck out  intentionally .
What copyrights were required to conduct business ?
To give copyrights to SCO would have required that signers of Amendment 2 get approval from the board of directors , but they did not get that approval because they knew they were n't transferring copyrights .
Was transfer of copyrights required for SCO to conduct business ?
McBride testified something to the effect that we could run our business without it  though he also knew he could n't sue the heck out of everyone without it .
So was the exclusion snuck into the APA ?
This was not the case .
Let 's look now how people believed what they had transacted ( course of performance ) .
SCO only put their copyright notice on new code .
The letters Novell sent to customers did not say Novell transferred ownership .
It directed customers to SCO for help with the software .
About the slander part of the case 
Novell had a first amendment right to say what they believe .
Santa Cruz stated that SCO was in a protection racket [ akin to extortion is how I took it ] .
Messman was there , at the board meeting , and despite SCO trying to embarrass him when he failed to place some events in the right decade , he specifically stated that the APA excluded transfer of the copyrights .
Maureen O'Gara is not credible .
On June 6 , 2003 in a private letter Novell disputed SCOs claim .
McBride knowing this , still publicly claimed that Novell would state that SCO had the copyrights .
On slander : 1 ) the transfer did n't occur ( so that is the end of it ) , 2 ) [ oops I did n't write this one down quick enough ] , 3 ) there was no constitutional malice .
Linux does not infringe Unix .
A judicial ruling ( Kimball ) at a minimum calls into question that SCO had copyrights .
Note : Brennan waxed really eloquent at the end .
I liked the way he treated the jury . . . like they were smart thinkers .
At one point he requested them -- in support of the point he was making -- to refer to an exhibit when deliberating that he in the interest of time would n't be able to cover .
He also referred to the painting in the hall about the signing of the Constitution , and that the right to free speech was something that protected Novell , himself , and the jurors .
It was much better than I am describing here and at one point he -- Brennan -- choked up when talking about these things and I was feeling a little choked up myself !
Good going Brennan !
Singer  final words :
The book Brennan was holding up in his closing remarks and with which he was visually making his point does n't contain Amendment 2 .
 It 's not an extortion ( in reference to the licensing scheme of McBride ) .
I did n't editorialize much in my notes , but I could n't help but write the words  I am not a crook on my note pad .
Those words dogged Nixon much of his life .
I did behave , though , and I did n't show what I had written to McBride  he was sitting nearly directly behind me on the back row .
I believe it was him because he said " Darl " when he was checking past security ( we both arrived at the same time , at about 8:20 am ) .
Singer then refers to the 10 witnesses  they are credible .
He then uses exclamatory excerpts and phrases from their testimony like copyrights are like oxygen to the business  etc. & etc .
He mentions others agreeing to their position as well .
I believe .
That 's what I 've got !
I wish you could have been there , maybe you were .
Me too .
I wish .
Is n't it lovely , though , to have multiple pairs of eyes and ears ?
Losat was there today again as well , and here is his report , part 1 : Here 's part 1 of my notes from today : jury instructions and first hour of closing ( Singer and Hatch ) : Next up : Brennan 's closing and Singer rebuttal .
It was a full courtroom today .
Im not familiar with the faces , but I was told there were several of the usual SCO supporters .
Groklaw was well represented .
I spoke with 4 fellow Groklaw frequenters , and I think there was at least one other .
MSS2 remained at the courthouse in case theres a quick verdict .
He urged others of us to post information as soon as possible because there are 10000 geeks waiting . :)
[ PJ : more than that . ]
I had thought I might mostly listen to the closing arguments as if I were on the jury , not taking extensive notes .
But , I ended up taking lots of notes anyway .
I didnt try to catch every word by any means , but I wrote down things that seemed interesting or important .
First , the judge asked if there were disputes over closing .
There were no objections .
He then indicated that SCO had filed a motion today with 3 points : Judge Stewart said the first is no longer relevant .
The second : that Novell should not argue  Unix not UnixWare . 
Jacobs agreed with regard to closing .
Third , there should be no attempt to argue contrary to law .
He stated his assumption that nobody would do that .
Jacobs said that was correct .
They would not argue the bill of sale under section 204 of copyright act .
They may argue that there was only a promise to assign under contract law , which the 10th Circuit did not address .
Singer stated that arguing contract law equivalent to section 204 , contrary to 10th circuit .
Jacobs referred to a footnote in the 10th circuit ruling ( not a holding ) ; he offered to hand it to the judge .
Judge Stewart : I should probably look at it .
Singer made an argument , to which Judge Stewart replied that was a good argument for his reply .
He allowed Novell to go there if not arguing pure legal but the intent of the parties .
Singer will go first .
SCO will reserve 15 minutes for the end .
Hatch will share time : 45 minutes Singer then 15 Hatch .
Brennan will close for Novell .
Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law will be due in 20 days .
Jury is brought in .
Judge Stewart delivers jury instructions .
There was a lot of typical stuff , which I didnt take notes of .
Only the items particular to this trial are described below .
SCO burden of proof , mostly preponderance ( which he describes including the phrase  probability not possibility  ) .
The constitutional malice requires clear and convincing evidence .
He uses the phrase no substantial doubt .
He comments about notes taken by jurors , which he has allowed while some courts do not .
He cautioned : dont compare notes , dont give extra weight to things written in your notes .
He mentioned direct vs. indirect / circumstantial evidence ( both acceptable under the law ) .
He mentioned the earlier rulings : did not have benefit of the evidence youve heard .
 Reversed , why you re here .
No bearing .
But they may be considered for special damages and punitive damages , if any .
He also mentioned the bankruptcy and 2008 trials .
Slander of title requirements : lists the 4 requirements then provided detail on each : 1 . Publication
Not private , not in pleadings ; not slanderous if clear its opinion , not fact ; but couching purported facts as opinions doesnt excuse ; dont consider in isolation  context of statement , surrounding circumstances must be considered .
2 . Falsity
Directly untrue or untrue inference ; need not be absolutely , totally , or literally accurate .
Substantially true ,  the gist .
In order to answer this , must decide who owns the copyrights (  Unix and UnixWare ) .
APA : interpret : taken together , as single document ; what the terms mean ; the intent of the parties .
Where clear , ordinary meanings .
Whole agreement , not isolated portions .
Extrinsic evidence as to intent .
Intent of those negotiating ; performance of the parties after the agreement , before the dispute .
May consider nature of copyright ( lists rights : reproduction , derivatives , distribution )  Owner : author , assignee , or * exclusive licensee * .
Possession of registration certificates immaterial to ownership but may be considered for other purposes .
Transfer must be in writing .
Exclusive license , transfer , sale , conveyance must be in writing .
Implied may be non-written , can only be non-exclusive .
3 . Constitutional Malice
Clear and convincing evidence 1 . Knowledge of falsity ; or 2 .
Reckless disregard
High degree of awareness that probably false ; or substantial doubt that it was true .
Not enough : negligence ; carelessness ; sloppy ; not researched ; reliance on one source , even if others would be available or one might think should reasonably be consulted ; spite , hate , evil purpose , or intent to harm .
Unless you find constitutional malice , there is no liability .
3 . Caused Damages : Special Damages
No lost sale , no damage .
Loss in value not sufficient .
Proof of specific person or group not possible to identify individually .
Slander is substantial factor , not exclusive or predominant factor ; had substantial weight on decision .
Stock price is not special damages .
Punitive Damages
If statement is false , and :
Hatred , intent to injure
Reasonable and proper punishment and wholesome warning to others .
Caution .
Only for reason just mentioned .
The fact you were instructed on damages does not indicate you should award any .
Damage award must have reasonable basis  without speculation or guesswork .
Burden of proof as to damages and cause
Not speculative Section 4.16 issue is for the court to decide .
May consider the section in interpreting the amended APA .
Lawyers have a duty to object .
Dont show prejudice .
Foreperson selection .
Collective judgment .
Unanimous .
Consult without violence to individual judgment .
( There was no break between instructions and closing . )
Singer : Depends on copyright ownership .
( I noticed the jury was very attentive at this point and seemed to remain so through closing arguments . )
Credibility : Stone vs LaSalla contradiction regarding IBM asking Novell to waive .
Another : Stone vs Messman about whether Stone was asked to leave Novell .
Amendment 2 replaces old language .
Novell in opening referred to  the rest of the story : the rest of the story is the copyright exclusion language doesnt exist any more .
 That s really the rest of the story on this . 
 All rights and ownership .
Novell admitted in June 6 2003 press release appears to support SCO claim . 2nd time admitted : March 23rd .
Allison Amadia .
( Cites Normand cross , question about the required for SCO  language -- Q : if required , copyrights transferred ?
A : Yes )
No real dispute that copyrights are required .
 Ludicrous to exclude .
Like breathing oxygen .
 Walk out the door and your head goes with you . 
 Couldnt go after pirated software .
With Amendment 2 , APA makes sense .
( Suggest car without engine , house without roof , sundae but you only get the cherry . )
It s consistent with the intent .
( Shows Novell slide from opening statements )
40 - 50 M  a lot of money : wouldnt even receive that if copyrights werent included .
Sale of business , not agent .
License - back : no sense if Novell kept the copyrights .
TLA : ownership of licensed technology is with SCO .
Made sense in light of testimony of witnesses .
Novells intent is not the issue : look at the intent of both parties .
Santa Cruz said copyrights are like oxygen . 
 We put copyright notices in every software module we wrote . 
An executive : if suggested SCO had to ask Novell , Id have laughed them out of my office .
Kimberly Madsen ( at Apple now ) : clear to me intent was to transfer copyrights .
Numerous execs with Novell agree .
Frankenberg -- the most important witness in this trial .
The term stand up guy  I think of him .
He said it was clear to him the copyrights went to SCO .
There was an error that had to be fixed a year later .
Chatlos ' wife has a little stock .
Youd have to believe 10 people remembered wrong or were lying  half of them Novells people .
Braham ignored months of negotiation from before his involvement .
He ignored the term sheet .
The term sheets list of rights lines up well with the copyright rights listed in the jury instructions .
No pushback from SCO about copyright exclusion in contract means it was just missed .
Executives copy of draft APA had * no* schedules [ neither the included nor exclude assets schedules ] .
[ PJ : Not to interrupt , but a draft of a contract would often not have the schedules , just because of the way drafting works .
In my experience , drafts get passed back and forth a lot and then the schedules referenced get added .
So this is the worst argument made so far , to me . ]
Messman didnt even know which decade the agreement was from ( 81 or  83 ) .
It is nt even in the board of directors meeting minutes that the discussion took place .
Either by mistake or overzealous lawyers .
Mistake corrected in Amendment 2 .
Press release at the time said intellectual property .
Novells version cant be squared with this .
Even IBM recognized that SCO had the copyrights .
 You can show us the source code because you have copyrights to protect you .
Course of performance : 3 individuals ' testimony .
Nagle [ did nt catch other 2 names ] .
Virtually undisputed .
Letters were sent ( Prentice Hall ) by Novell .
ownership Nagle : changed copyright notices in UnixWare .
Novell could have kept registrations , but theyve been sitting with Santa Cruz .
Next question : slandered ?
If SCO owns the copyrights , theres not much question .
It was a campaign . 
Constitutional malice : Reckless disregard .
After June 6 , knowledge of falsity .
Balance of free speech .
Knew about unsigned Amendment 2 .
Didnt do checking .
Could easily .
Could have called Sonsini .
Could have called Frankenberg .
Recklessness .
After that , not just reckless .
They turned upside down  looking for signed Amendment 2  know it was very important .
June 5 : signed Amendment 2 faxed by SCO .
MkBride says Messman admitted copyrights transferred .
Press release next day .
June 6 : not just casual statement .
Amendment 2 language was in one paragraph .
Didnt take months to analyze .
It took them months to turn it around .
Stones
 We still own Unix  outrageous !
This was echoed by Messman .
Falsity proven by Novell witnesses .
 So absurd would be unethical to take that position .
Deal I negotiated included copyrights .
Chatlos similar .
unethical  Damages : special ( to compensate SCO ) , damage to SCOsource .
 Certain Unix libraries being used to run Linux .
Obtain a license .
Unix in Linux not issue .
Protection against infringement , a number of these individual companies  took licenses after seeing code room 
Press citations readible 
 If everything SCO showed me today is true , then Linux [ users ] should be concerned .
Sent letters with examples of code .
Not issue in this trial .
Percentage of users would license ; others wait and see ; others never .
Members of Open Source community viciously attacked .
Submit Novell has brought some of them here . [ ?! ]
If no threat to Novells Linux activities , there would have been no slander .
( Compare to house : no title ) Deadly .
That type of slander killed SCOsource .
Punitive : personal malice  intent to injure .
No shortage of evidence .
Same day as earnings announcement .
Not a coincidence .
Intent to injure .
Malice .
OGara : Stone admitted timing was planned .
[ PJ : Shame .
Even she did n't say that .
She inferred . ] [ statement trying to dismiss ]  why dont you take a jab at PJ ?   while chortling 
Messman published as widely as possible .
Waiver was because of IBM .
Consider as evidence of intent .
Consider 50 M investment .
Not telling the truth about IBMs involvement the first time asked .
Singer turns time over to Hatch .
Hatch : SCOsource had begun to make sales .
Tens of millions of dollars .
Next : HP deal ( shows draft contract ) : redlines typed in by HP : $ 30 M deal .
Sudden change .
McBride said  Novell inserted itself to reassert copyright ownership .
Google ( 500 K Linux servers ) : pulled out of deal , Novell a substantial factor .
Dell .
Primary reason : Novell .
Testimony of 3 SCO salespeople :
Potential buyers cant buy because theres not clear title .
Referred to jury instructions .
People hated SCO :  It was a small Utah company standing up for its IP rights 
Some of largest companies 
Sun , Microsoft -- had done deals .
Understood the risk yet took licenses .
[ PJ : If they understood , why did Microsoft say they licensed a patent from SCO , when SCO had no Unix patents ? ] 3 studies ( not one ) : 19 - 45 % range .
 Taking into account every one of the risk factors  hard , scientific data Verdict form question 3 : amount of special damages , if any :
Best and proper measure : Expert helped you .
Botosan cherry picked the low numbers to be conservative .
 conservative on top of conservative  Novell offered no calculations .
Agreed it was the correct but for 
Answer for # 3 : 115-200 M range from Botosan .
Malice / bad acts : punitive .
Additional .
 Teach them a lesson . 
Timing of press release was to maximize damages .
2nd time , again to maximize damages .
And here 's Losat 's part 2 : One thing of note I forgot to mention on the jury instructions : when he told them they would n't be deciding the Novell counterclaim of slander of title , he instructed them not to infer anything from this , not to speculate .
Disclaimer : the actual closing arguments on both sides were much , much smoother and effective than my poor notes might suggest .
Now , on to Novell 's closing arguments : Brennan : I promised to tell you " the rest of the story . "
Burden is on SCO .
I do n't get to speak to you again after Singer .
Please anticipate what you think Novell would say .
When I was a kid I was told " do n't make a federal case out of it . "
( Do n't make something minor into a big deal . )
Here we are in a federal case .
This is a big deal .
SCOsource intent : " extract " fees Huge uproar
It was beyond Novell .
Novell felt compelled to respond .
There are other cases out there waiting to be heard .
Other suits .
This hangs over all Linux users .
3rd :
Very important fundamental question : meaning , sanctity of contract .
Contract carefully drafted and meticulously written .
If we go look not at the language but at what we should have , the whole reliability of contracts is threatened .
Chaos would result !
Challenged by outside thoughts .
Rely upon written contract .
4th :
Free speech .
( Businesses are comprised of individuals . )
Stand and state position without fear of monumental damage claims .
Recommended result * for you to consider * :
Did the copyrights transfer ?
No .
How do we know ?
Intent . BOD resolution .
Very language of the resolution appeared in the contract .
List of assets .
Clearly excluded copyrights .
1.1 ( b ) .
Regarding suggestion that this was " passed by quickly " : it did not go without review .
Almost 3 months before closing of the deal .
Exhibit T5 , Amendment 1 : 10 - 12 pages of modifications .
1.1 ( a ) not modified to include copyrights .
1.1 ( b ) with exclusion not modified .
No credible argument can be made that there was any pulling the wool over eyes December 5 actual transfer : APA just a promise to transfer .
Bill of Sale transfers .
What does the bill of sale say ?
It 's straightforward and clear .
Novell acquired * entire *
Unix business from AT&T .
SCO deal was only a limited transfer of some assets .
Santa Cruz sold to Caldera , now SCO .
The agreement disclaimed : could not represent to SCO that it had a chain of title that includes copyrights .
McBride joined in 2002 : see whether they can change the business .
Existing business : UnixWare + even servicing Linux !
New : try to turn on customers .
Go after rather than aid them .
SCO counsel advised McBride far less transferred .
Excludes .
Need to be careful -- might be less than you think .
Term sheet ?
( Ty Mattingly found in his garage -- not final agreement -- preliminary sketch of possible agreement . )
Final APA is what was agreed and signed .
Press release back at time of deal was not joint .
Logo was SCO's .
Theory that maybe TLA transferred copyrights : sleight of hand maybe taking license back .
Argument was :
Why take license back if you retained the copyrights ?
License back was to the assets that had been transferred which did n't include copyrights ( 1.1 ( b ) ) .
Sleight of hand ?
I think you 'll see past that quickly .
Witnesses presented by SCO were not involved , have n't read the APA , or misinterpreted .
Look at those who actually were involved : Tolonen : not mistake .
Sleight of hand ?
Tolonen was the one who actually signed Amendment 2 .
No financial interest in the case .
Should you rely on him ?
Frankenberg said he did .
He would expect that Mr. Tolonen would be able to accurately state the agreement .
Bradford knew .
Lawyer who actually wrote the agreement : if anyone knew , Braham know .
Carefully crafted to protect license revenue .
Tor stated the client was the board of directors -- the governing body .
No financial interest .
Thompson more interested in SCO interests .
Mattingly and Chatlos not involved in final negotiations .
Amadia : she drafted Amendment 2 .
No financial interest .
Compare SCO : Thompson : not at Novell long ( since coming from WordPerfect ) .
No good place for him at Novell .
Already decided to leave Novell ( " checked out " ) .
Already planned to go to SCO .
Owns 100,000 shares of SCO .
Michaels actually said no specific memory .
Did n't know what Amendment 2 was .
Had n't read APA .
Whatever wishes , hopes , and dreams he might have had , he was not involved in APA .
Mattingly owned SCO stock .
Not drafting .
Not Amendment 2 . No mention of board meeting .
Sabbath : ( what he actually said ) in declaration ( from IBM litigation ) :
Q : recall executing deal ?
A : Yes Paragraph 11 : under APA , Novell retains -- 1.1B provides much would not be transferred .
[ Not sure where Q ends and A begins here ]
And Amendment 2 -- Novell retained certain IP .
Frankenberg , the " most important witness in the case " repeatedly asked about board --- what approved .
Was agreement consistent with the BOD ?
Q : Acting beyond authority ?
A : of course not .
Yesterday : Q : express exclusion APA minutes :
You thought you saw or heard something different ?
A : Yes .
Imagine what would happen -- heard the words , had something else in mind .
From most important witness in case !
Chatlos ' wife works for SCO and will make money if they win .
He was n't involved with BOD .
Kim Madsen : no specific memory of intent of Amendment 2 .
Did not remember .
Or even remember discussion with Sabbath .
SCO former CEO [ McBride ] : millions of dollars he'd make -- financial interest .
Darl had no involvement in Amendment 2 .
Ca n't know intent .
Tibbitts : financial interest .
No involvement in preparation and agreement .
Parade of witnesses who were n't there , not involved in BOD decision , personal financial interests .
Why exclude copyrights ?
Sounds one - sided ?
Could just as easily ask why did SCO agree ?
Valid reasons : - Defazio : " Q APA intended to transfer copyrights ?
A : No . " Designed to protect Novell .
Implement bulletproofing .
( Bankruptcy concerns . )
( Also concerns about MS . ) - Novell paid 330M , SCO paid 50 M [ stock ] .
Novell retained license fees .
If SCO succeeded with merged product , additional royalties to Novell .
( But did n't reach that level . )
Back to Frankenberg ( " most important witness in the case " ) : " Q : Possible copyrights were excluded ?
A : Yes , a possibility .
Q : board agreed to ?
A : Yes . "
You heard about Novell outside counsel that negotiated / drafted the APA .
SCO had outside counsel , too .
Brobeck .
You did n't hear from Brobeck .
None of them appeared in this case .
None of them appeared by deposition .
Empty chairs .
Tells you something .
SCO should have presented .
They have burden of proof to substantiate " mistake " Amendment 2 ( agree it's of critical importance ) .
1st draft resulted from Sabbath claiming " clerical error " ( Shows comparison of language between draft and final Amendment 2 ) Red : stripped out by Novell : which pertained to and which SCO has acquired hereto had been transferred -- APA very clearly contradicts .
except for * required *
What was required ?
Tolonen ( CFO ) : did not intend to transfer copyrights .
Sabbath 's suggestion was * rejected * Amendment 2 clearly not intended to transfer copyrights .
Did not go back to BOD .
To change exclusion of copyrights would be material .
BOD would have to have been involved .
Amidia : Q : Positive not intended to transfer copyrights ?
A : I am .
Q : How can you be so sure ?
A : I drafted it .
I did n't have the authority to change that .
Were copyrights required ?
We need to get an answer to that question .
McBride : Q : did n't you tell them you could run that part of your business without copyrights ?
A : We could run our business .
Just like HP and others
We 'll come back to that .
HP , IBM , and others had license .
They built and sell .
None owns Unix copyrights .
That 's the business SCO was in .
They did not need the copyrights to do that .
Darl acknowledged .
Not the business SCO wanted to get into in 2003 .
He wanted to turn on his customers .
Infringing Unix .
New and different business .
( McBride ) Q : A : unable to run the business on the licensing side , which was the future of the company .
Q : You could operate business but outside SCOsource , correct ?
A : affirmative Recall what SCO was doing .
First 1000 letters sent out [ including to licensees ] .
Were they prohibited from these actions ?
4.16B : cannot , no right to enter into new licenses .
They were violating contractual obligation .
Re : " Ludicrous " to operate without copyrights ?
Tibbitts : Q : Aware of proposed transaction where SCO would sell its Unix business and retain the copyrights ?
A : Correct .
Q : SCO to sell product business and retain copyrights ?
A : Yes Messman :
They did n't need copyrights to run the legitimate Unix and UnixWare business .
Displays Legos Small block on left , Unix .
Rights under APL to build on top .
SCO owns copyright on its own block on top .
For 8 years , this was not a problem .
Re : suggestion that exclusion was " snuck " in or hidden " in a corner " Levine ( worked at AT&T , went to Novell , then moved to SCO ) On 1.1A and 1.1B : His draft of 1.1B excluded all copyrights .
This was not a last - minute invention .
SCO 's guy wrote that language .
Document was reviewed : [ someone ] : I 'm sure that I did see / read it .
Mattingly : Q : chance to read ?
A : Yes
When Mattingly appeared , he brought documents with him and showed SCO .
Novell had n't received them .
He had a draft APA which includes the exclusion of copyrights .
See how people behaved .
( All SCO employees ) : Copyright notices .
We did n't go back and change prior versions , only current or going forward .
You can obtain copyright protection on new work performed [ on old files , no need to own the original copyright ]
Nagle : copyright on box .
Acknowledged what 's on box does n't establish ownership -- look to the legal agreements .
Regarding letters suggesting transfer :
You 'll have a chance to look and see .
Mr. Nagle stated the letters were [ something like just rough descriptions ? ] , included something about contacting SCO if recipient had questions .
Answering questions is one of the things SCO has to do for the 5 % they retain of the royalties .
1st Amendment : Fundamental protection of civil liberties .
Novell has the right to speak .
Jury instruction 3rd element required proof by clear and convincing evidence ( not preponderance , which is little more than tip the scales ) .
Constitutional malice .
To protect constitutional rights to free speech , avoid chilling effects .
Imagine the consequence : fear of speaking if you can be held accountable for monumental damages .
[ He repeats standard for slander from jury instructions here ]
That 's the standard .
You must be convinced -- clear and convincing .
If reckless , all these other factors .
No substantial doubt in your mind .
Highly probable .
Spite , hatred , evil purpose , intent to harm do not mean constitutional malice .
Exhibit I11 . SCO in business of licensing Linux .
They were encouraging Linux use , reaching out to Linux users .
Then turned on them !
The motivation for their new and different business : financials were down .
Hail Mary ?
Yes .
Looking for ways to improve declining finances .
What did Santa Cruz think of SCO ?
" Guys that run protection rackets occasionally make a profit -- but not long term success . "
There was backlash to SCO .
Feb 2003 : Recognizing they did not own the copyrights , SCO proposed to Novell and agreement to " clarify " the transfer .
If indeed SCO owned the copyrights , why ask for written confirmation ?
Novell rejected this proposal and did not sign it .
Threats .
Linux infringes our Unix IP and rights .
The threats were made to Fortune 1000 companies .
Public uproar !
Novell itself was sent one of the letters .
The response : Linux : doubt validity of claims .
GPL violation .
Linux is an alternative to MS .
Who benefits from this ?
MS .
Ultimately , Novell had to respond .
They did report to McBride that Novell owned the copyrights .
The response came May 28th .
Novell has the APA ( Messman recalled no copyrights transferred ) .
McBride acknowledged it was a reasonable reading ( without Amendment 2 ) .
It 's important to respond publicly .
No idea of the timing ( coincidence ) .
Suggestion of Malice : Sole witness : O'Gara .
In fact , she confirmed to SCO she wanted " war pay . "
Asked by SCO to send a jab PJ 's way .
Hardly evidence of detached journalist .
Attempt to create words
Stone never said .
Q : What were the words ?
( Pressed repeatedly . )
She could not .
Public statements .
( SCO 's earnings were preannounced before May 28 . )
Amendment 2 was sent to Messman .
Singer suggested that in searching for signed Amendment 2 earlier , Novell should have reached out to Sonsini .
Sonsini was not involved in Amendment 2 .
It was handled by in - house counsel Amidia .
Should have reached out to Frankenberg .
He left the company before Amendment 2 .
Novell , trying to act responsibly did release statement about " appears " Novell then , with some time , undertook to review the matter more carefully .
( They made the June 6 response because of pressure from SCO . )
After looking more closely , Novell sent private communication to SCO that Novell believes the copyrights did not transfer .
SCO , in the face of this , stated publicly " if you go ask Novell today , they 'll tell you " SCO has the copyrights .
Novell sent another private letter to SCO .
( 2 private letters ) .
Public statement from Darl : " regarding Novell 's recent claim it still owned the copyrights -- took just 4 days to press the eject button " Nov. 8 . SCO : once we had copyright issues resolved had clarity Novell had been * privately * talking to SCO .
SCO was publicly stating the contrary .
With all that brewing , Novell did make a public release .
Its form : copies are here .
SCO is well aware of our position .
See the letters and judge for yourself .
We invite you to look at it .
Claim of slander :
1st no false statement
2nd not believe they were false
3rd not requisite level of malice Damages : ( for these " atrocious acts " [ sarcastically ] )
What did the marketplace do in reaction in the real world ?
People dispute to this day Linux infringement .
Hotly debated .
Contested .
Indemnifications offered ( from Novell and others ) GPL issue : provides protection for Linux users .
Quickly adapt , design around .
Will not pay " license extraction fee . "
Tremendous public anger .
Looking in " but for "
What * really * happened .
2004 Ruling at minimum raised substantial question .
Ruling is available to the public .
People can see for themselves .
Summary judgment in favor of Novell .
As a matter of law , Novell did not transfer copyrights .
( based on APA with Amendment 2 ) Yes it was reversed ; you 're here today .
But what could consumers know from this judgment ?
HP : I * urge * you to take a look at exhibit D20 .
Why ? -- for so many reasons .
I *urge * you to take a look at it .
Verdict form # 1 : Did APA transfer copyrights ?
No .
Look at agreements themselves .
Look at the words .
If you answer no as the contract compels , that 's the end of deliberation .
My plea : Mark No .
If you get past that point : Whether Novell slandered :
When you get to the jury room , see if any of you have questions in your mind as to whether copyrights transferred .
You 're reasonable people .
If reasonable jurors can have questions , how can Novell [ be found to meet the standards for slander ] ?
In this courthouse is a painting of the signing of the Constitution .
[ Very impassioned , patriotic speech here , almost to tears ]
The constitution protects us .
Novell is entitled to rely on it .
[ Sorry , there was a little bit more to the speech , but my notes are poor and illegible here .
Something about at very heart , was n't slander .
Constitutional protections .]
While we wait for the next parts to arrive , Chris was asking me a question :
In Mr. Singer 's rebuttal ( and possibly in his summation ) noted the lack of information from SCO 's side regarding the APA + A2 .
( Lamlaw : " And where is the attorney for Santa Cruz that can testify that the agreement was that the copyrights were transferred ?
No show .
Na da .
Not there . " )
You 've mentioned that absence before too .
Mr. Singer said it 's because that law firm is no longer in business , and that Novell knows that .
As the other Groklaw reporters and I discussed afterwards , it 's as if SCO 's asking us to believe all those lawyers were shot and their files burned .
I thought in situations where law firms go out of business , it 's not really the end .
Is n't there some plan for the handling of their files ?
And the lawyers themselves can still be tracked down .
Novell got Tor Braham from Deutsche Bank , Alison Amadia from her company ( see also http://www.infertilitylawyer.com/ )
So does their being out of business claim hold any water at all ?
The answer is simple , in that as he points out , Tor Braham was no longer with Wilson Sonsini , but they found him at Deutsche Bank , Allison Amadia was no longer at Novell but was found , etc .
It does sometimes happen that a lawyer stops practicing and old cases can't be traced any more because you can't find the lawyer or he died , but SCO not only found one lawyer , Troy Keller , they insisted on his deposition during the trial , and then SCO * still * did n't put him on the stand after the deposition .
What does that tell you ?
It tells me that sometimes when a party does n't put a lawyer on the stand , it is n't because they can't find him .
Now , the jury does n't know about all that Troy Keller stuff , so SCO said what it said .
Would you like to know why I think they did n't put him on the stand ?
I think it 's maybe because he said in his declaration that he and all the other lawyers working on the deal between Caldera and Santa Cruz in 2001 reviewed the APA * and Amendment 2 * in 2001 .
But Darl McBride and all the SCOfolk that testified swore on the Bible and to the media in 2003 that they did n't know about Amendment 2 until the paralegal allegedly found it in a file cabinet that year , just after Novell claimed to own the copyrights .
So ... which is it ?
See what I mean ?
Anyway , the lawyer for Caldera on that later deal was John E. Hayes III , then with the Brobeck , Phleger law firm , which went out of business in 2003 .
Would this not be he ?
That took two minutes .
The name on the APA was Edward M. Leonard of Brobeck , representing Santa Cruz .
If it were me , I 'd just ask Mr. Hayes III where Mr. Leonard is .
Or let 's ask Google : Mr. Leonard , I presume .
And now sit back and enjoy MSS2's next segment :
There was a break after SCO 's closing argument .
After that , there was a sidebar discussion .
That white noise really is pretty annoying , at least at the volume that they had it at .
Judge Stewart cautioned the spectators that audible response to closing arguments is inappropriate , and that he would have spectators removed if necessary .
Then Brennan gave Novell 's closing argument : The SCOsource license was to extract payment from Linux users .
This case is of great significance to people beyond Novell .
It 's a gateway to other litigation .
It 's a threat hanging over all Linux users .
A big issue here is the reliability of contracts .
Changes based on what people hoped or wished threatens the reliability of contracts .
Can you really rely on a written contract ?
It 's also about the free speech right to speak freely on issues of public interest without fear of reprisal or monumental damage claims .
The first question before the jury is , did the copyrights transfer ?
No , they did n't .
How do we know ?
We know by intent .
It 's in the board minutes .
They match the contract .
Sections 1.1a and 1.1b are clear .
There was three months of review to the APA - it was n't a case of the wool being pulled over anyone 's eyes .
Amendment 1 fixed the issues that were found in those three months .
It made no changes to sections 1.1a or 1.1b .
The APA does not transfer anything , the bill of sale does .
What does it say ?
It says see the APA .
Novell bought the whole business from AT&T , in a merger .
It sold some of it to Santa Cruz in an APA .
They sold what they got to Caldera , which became SCO .
Santa Cruz said that they could not establish chain of title to the IP .
This was not unknown to SCO .
McBride came in to SCO in 2002 .
In January 2003 , he decided that maybe they could turn on their own customers .
Mike Anderer told him that far less transferred than McBride thought .
SCO relies on the wrong documents .
The term sheet is not the final agreement , just a summary of the current idea of the deal .
The press release was not a joint statement - it did not have the Novell logo or something else ( maybe contact information ) .
The technology license agreement licensed back the assets that transferred .
What were they ?
Not the copyrights - see section 1.1b .
SCO 's witnesses were not involved in the APA .
They were uninformed .
But Tolonen said that the copyrights were purposely excluded .
And note that Frankenberg said that he relied on Tolonen .
Bradford gave instructions to keep the copyrights .
Braham crafted the document to protect Novell 's interest .
His client was the Novell board of directors .
Amadia drafted Amendment 2 and knew what the intent was .
Brennan emphasised that none of these witnesses had a financial interest in the outcome of the case .
Compare that with SCO 's witnesses .
Thompson had " checked out " and had an interest in the outcome .
Michaels was entertaining , but what did he say ?
He did n't remember what happened , and he never read the APA .
Mattingly admitted that he was not involved in the details , and he has no memory of the board of directors meeting .
What did Sabbath actually say ?
That under the APA , Novell retained the IP , that under Amendment 2 Novell retained the SysV IP ( he prepared Amendment 2 from the Santa Cruz side ) .
Frankenberg admitted that the APA was consistent with the board of director minutes .
Chatlos ' wife works for SCO , and he was n't at the board of directors meeting .
Madsen has no specific memory of Amendment 2 . McBride has lots of money on the line .
He also had no involvment in the APA or Amendment 2 .
Tibbitts has an interest in the case , and was not involved with the APA or Amendment 2 .
In summary , SCO 's witnesses were n't there , do n't remember , were n't involved , and have a lot of money on the line in the case .
Why did n't copyrights transfer ?
DeFazio was the general manager of Unix at Novell .
He said that no copyrights transferred , and that was deliberate .
It was bullet - proofing their asset stream against a SCO bankruptcy , and also against Microsoft .
Was the whole business sold ?
Novell bought it for $ 300 million .
They sold what they sold to SCO for $ 50 million .
SCO bought the right to develop UnixWare .
Frankenberg said that it was possible that the exclusion was deliberate , and that it was what the board approved .
In the case , we never heard from the SCO lawyers .
SCO was n't willing to call the people who negotiated the APA from the Santa Cruz side .
And SCO has the burden of proof .
Turning to Amendment 2 , Sabbath asked Amadia for language that said that the copyrights transferred .
She replaced his proposed language with " copyrights required for " .
Tolonen did not intend for Amendment 2 to transfer the copyrights .
It was suggested by SCO and rejected by Novell .
He did n't go back to the board of directors , and he would have if Amendment 2 transferred copyrights , because that would have significantly altered the deal .
Amadia negotiated Amendment 2 .
She did n't have the authority to transfer the copyrights .
Sabbath was asked who negotiated Amendment 2 from the SCO side .
He said he did n't know .
Were copyrights required ?
McBride said that he could run the Unix business without the copyrights , like HP , IBM , and all the others did .
All those guys built flavors of Unix without the copyrights .
That business was to create derivatives ; they did n't need the copyrights for that .
But that business was n't the business that McBride tried to get into in 2003 .
That was a new and different business .
McBride said SCO could n't run the licensing ( SCOsource ) part without the copyrights .
When SCO sent the SCOsource " threat " letters , that was a violation of section 4.16 b of the APA .
How could a software company operate without the copyrights ?
Within the last year , SCO tried to do so .
They tried to sell the business but keep the Unix copyrights .
Messman said that SCO did n't need the copyrights in 2003 .
Novell does not dispute that SCO has rights to the code that it wrote after the APA .
People had time to look at the APA .
It did not sneak in at the last minute .
Levine ( a Santa Cruz guy ) wrote the 1.1b exclusion language .
Mattingly 's draft had the exclusion language .
How did people behave ?
Copyright changes to source code were consistent with owning the copyright to newly - written code .
Nagle admitted that the copyright on the box means nothing .
The letters sent do n't say that the copyrights transferred , and the letters were simplifications of the transaction .
( I note that Brennan spent most of his time on copyright transfer .
It seemed to me that he spent a larger fraction of his time there than SCO did . )
Then he turned to slander .
He read the First Amendment .
It 's a fundamental protection for all of us .
The heavier burden of proof for constitutional malice is to protect our constitutional rights .
What was going on in the marketplace at this time ?
SCO was in the business of licensing Linux .
This was the type of customer that SCO turned on .
Santa Cruz - the ones Novell originally sold to - called SCOsource a protection racket .
SCO came to Novell looking to " clarify " that SCO owned the copyrights .
Novell rejected the paper that SCO wanted them to sign .
SCO made very public claims , including to Novell ( Novell received the " threat " letter ) .
The public response was very hostile .
Novell had to respond .
What was Novell thinking at this time ?
They had the APA .
McBride admitted that the APA could be read to conclude that no copyrights transferred .
O'Gara is the only witness as to malice .
And she wanted " war pay " .
SCO wanted her to " send a jab PJ's way " .
She 's not objective .
She also does n't know what Stone said specifically .
Brennan lays out the timeline : - May 12 : The " threat " letter .
- May 14 : SCO preannounces earnings .
- May 28 : Novell 's public response to SCO .
At this point , SCO 's earnings have been known for two weeks .
- June 5 : SCO sends the signed copy of Amendment 2 to Novell .
( During Singer 's closing argument , he asked , Why Novell did n't ask Wilson Sonsini if they had a copy ?
Why did n't they ask Frankenberg ?
Brennan responds now : Wilson Sonsini did n't negotiate Amendment 2 .
And Frankenberg was gone before it happened . )
- June 6 : Novell says Amendment 2 " appears to " give copyrights to SCO .
They had to respond to public pressure from SCO .
They sent a private letter to SCO saying they still did n't agree that copyrights transferred .
- June 23 : McBride publicly claims that Novell does n't claim copyright ownership .
- August 4 : Novell sends another private letter disputing that copyrights transferred .
- August 18 : McBride publicly says that it took SCO four days to " press the eject button " on Novell 's claim to own the copyrights .
- October 14 : Novell registers the copyrights .
- November 14 : SCO CFO
Bench says publicly " once we had the copyright issue resolved " ( not meaning that once it was settled and now it 's not , but that it has been settled since some point in the past ) .
- December 22 : Novell publicly claims copyright ownership , and releases the correspondence between Novell and SCO .
This was n't slander .
It was n't slander because it was n't a false statement - the copyrights did n't transfer .
It was n't slander because Novell did n't believe that it was false .
And it was n't said in malice .
In terms of damages , what did the market do in reaction to all this in the real world ?
Infringement was n't proven .
There were indemnification programs from Novell and RedHat .
The GPL gave protection .
Linux would design around the issue .
And people were unwilling to pay $ 699 .
As evidence from the real world , at a minimum , the 2004 judicial ruling cast doubt on SCO 's claims .
The 2007 summary judgment said that no copyrights transferred .
It was reversed .
But at the time , consumers had reason not to buy .
Exhibit D - 20 says that HP did n't buy for many reasons , none of which are Novell .
The copyrights did n't transfer .
Look at the contract .
Look at the agreements .
But if you have to talk over the first question , whether copyrights transferred , if it takes some work to reach that decision , then slander fails .
The jury is composed of reasonable people .
If you have questions about whether the copyrights transferred , then it 's not clear enough for slander of title .
That was the end of Brennan 's closing argument .
There was a pause to stretch , then SCO got the last word .
And here 's his report on Singer 's rebuttal to the end of the day : SCO got the final word .
It was given by Singer , who had 12 minutes to work with : Amendment 2 is part of the contract .
It fixed the agreement .
" Except for required " .
Novell admitted they transferred on June 6 .
And Amadia admitted that if they were required , they transferred .
Were they required ?
Yes .
SCO could n't protect their IP without them .
SCOsource is gone .
It ca n't be resurrected .
Slander is reckless , deliberate , knowing .
The court decisions were reversed .
It was only an implied license .
The law firm that negotiated SCO 's end of the APA no longer exists , and that 's why SCO can't call them as witnesses .
Santa Cruz transferred to Caldera everything they got from Novell .
The term sheet that Mattingly found was the real , final term sheet .
You 'd have to disbelieve ten witnesses to buy Novell 's position .
Amadia said that if the copyrights were required , they transferred .
Frankenberg is the one witness that Novell can't impeach .
SCO presented two credible witnesses as to damages .
Consider what SCO has had to go through for seven years , not having clear title to their crown jewels .
Yes , he really hit all of that in 12 minutes ( he went half a minute over by my watch ) .
When he finished , Stewart told him , " You can breathe now . "
One juror was dismissed as the alternate .
Stewart asked her if she was disappointed .
She shook her head , and many laughed .
A marshall was sworn in to protect the jury ( specifically to protect their sequestering ) .
Then the jury was dismissed .
Judge Stewart thanked the attorneys for supplying him with at least one motion a day .
Without them , Copeland ( his assistant ? ) would have been " an aimless wastrel somewhere " for the last three weeks .
Then he really thanked the attorneys .
He said that they were the finest attorneys that he 's seen in ten years on the bench .
He specifically mentioned that the opposing sides had worked well with each other .
MSS2 also sent some final thoughts :
Final thoughts , comments , and handicapping : I thought Singer 's tapdancing was more obvious in his reply close .
For many of his points , I thought that the rebuttal was obvious .
I hope it is to the jury .
Singer is incredibly effective at tapdancing , though .
I 'd hate to see him when he had a case to work with .
I met several other Groklaw folks there .
I met cpeterson .
I sat next to Losat .
Met another guy who was in town on vacation and , finding himself in Salt Lake on the day of the closing arguments , talked his wife into letting him attend .
And I finally met Chris , the man , the myth , the legend , the reporter with the iron bottom and the lightening - fast pen .
Chris , thanks immensely for all the reports on this trial .
Handicapping : I do n't think there 's any way that a twelve - person jury is going to unanimously agree to slander of title .
I think that 's dead .
The copyright transfer is harder .
I could see the jury hanging on that one .
If they do n't hang , then I think the odds favor Novell .
But I wo n't give any odds on whether they 'll hang .
So his wife let him go !
Thank you .
Thanks to all our reporters and their long suffering wives / SO 's , too .
If anyone had expenses , like parking , or whatever , please let me know .
Update Monday :
He not only attended , he has sent us his impressions , and will be sending more as he is able .
Here 's zenock 's report , after I asked him about Stuart Singer 's closing remarks :
The impression I got is that Singer could talk a dog off a meat wagon and leave him convinced he was a vegetarian .
Singer mentioned Amadia twice .
Having not heard her testimony I can't be sure , but I would say he was spinning what she said pretty wildly .
When he first spoke ( and I did n't write this down and my memory may not be accurate ) he indicated that she testified that it was n't the intent to transfer copyrights but under the persistent cross examination by Normand he got her to admit that the copyrights had in fact transfered .
He created the impression that she was a recalcitrant witness but that due to Normand 's ability in cross examination he got her to crack and tell the truth .
When he spoke again in his 12 minute sprint , I did write down what he said however I can not attest to it being a direct quote as I was writing pretty fast and I may have only caught my impression of what he said rather than what he actually said .
Anyway , this is what I have ... he ( referring to Brennen 's closing arguements ) did not address the issue of Miss Amadia under cross admitting if the copyrights were required they transferred .
Are the copyrights required ? ...
Even if you can sell under license you can not protect ...
I found the closing remarks disturbing , which is why I inquired as to what he saw .
I 'm looking forward to reading the transcripts .
Soon .
On handicapping , I 'll just tell you straight up that no one can figure out what a jury will do .
So while it 's fun to try , nobody knows , and that includes me .
Updated , Monday March 29 : Here 's Losat 's segment on Stuart Singer 's final remarks to the jury and the judge 's final remarks : Singer again ( 12 minutes left ) .
Something about credibility .
May I borrow that book ?
( Bound APA ) Sanctity of contract : Amendment 2 fixed the contract .
We are n't saying to use unwritten language .
Amendment 2 . Which is not found in this book .
" Except required ... " June 6 admission .
You decide .
Not addressed by Braham .
Amadia : if required , they transferred .
Virtually every witness said copyright is required .
[ PJ : Except the ex-CEO , who said they were not required for UNIX or UnixWare business . ]
Even if there was a license , no express license .
This could not protect SCO .
Novell admitted .
" Extract license fee . " I suppose Novell 's license fees are not extraction .
IBM 's not extraction ?
It was not extraction ; it was opportunity to purchase .
Except that market is now gone .
[ PJ : Opportunity to purchase .
Heh heh .
In the same way that a root canal is an opportunity to chat with your dentist . ]
Regarding other litigation in the waiting : Constitutional right to go to court .
They tried to block .
A right IBM and Novell used .
1st Ammendment .
Interesting that Brennan said " now we get to the important question . "
That 's because the copyrights are with SCO .
So he wants to lead to a finding of no slander .
Recklessness .
Reckless is not finding out if there was a signed Amendment 2 .
The court decisions were reversed .
Nothing to do with damages anyway .
But for the slander , lawsuit would never have occurred .
Sleight of hand .
Only implied license .
Implied license is nonexclusive , covered in jury instructions .
" Empty Chairs " : Brobeck firm no longer exists .
[ PJ : But the people who were at the firm survived the firm 's closure , and I found them on the internet in about two minutes .
My logical brain tells me that this means SCO could have found them and invited them to testify . ]
They stated their position in an exhibit [ something for European governmental agency ; states something about transfer of rights ] [ PJ : I believe this is likely a reference to the Santa Cruz letter in 1997 to the EU Commission complaining about having to pay Microsoft royalties for old code from Xenix they did n't want that forced " unwilling parties to license MS software under circumstances where it is not wanted and increase [ d ] the financial cost of any non-Windows operating system alternative " .
Say .
Sort of like SCOsource , if you ask me . ]
Amendment 2 specifically transfers copyrights .
Copyrights -- oxygen .
Response from McBride regarding not required : " ca n't protect property " .
Lego : [ According to Novell 's view of what transferred ] brick on top that represents SCO property would be a very small sliver instead of full - size brick .
Would undermine products SCO wants to sell .
Have to have copyrights ?
Alleged term sheet .
Testimony was that it was the term sheet actually used .
It was provided before Mattingly brought his copy -- by Novell .
Actual term sheets .
Witnesses : You 'd have to disbelieve 10 .
Half of them from Novell .
Shots at witnesses .
Examples : Steve Sabbath : stated deposition was not his testimony .
Someone else reviewed copyright language and said it was " intended to apply to Netware " .
Bulletproofing :
Amadia : Final Amendment 2 : if required , SCO gets copyright .
Braham :
Why something put in at last minute ?
Got fixed by Amendment 2 .
Ca n't take shots at Frankenberg .
His testimony clearly says intent was to transfer .
The deal Chatlos et al negotiated called for transfer .
Damages :
Novell 's expert has been paid to testify too many times .
No number but zero .
You decide who 's reasonable .
How important !
Title to Crown Jewels .
( end of rebuttal / closing ) Judge : Thank you , Mr. Singer , you can breathe now .
( Laughter in the court ) ( After a few moments , Singer replies " did n't want to go over my time . " ( more laughter ) Judge Stewart dismisses Juror 13 ( the alternate ) .
" Not allowed to deliberate with jury .
That will be some disappointment to you . "
Much laughter at her reaction .
It 's apparent she 's not disappointed .
Judge continues about if you were disappointed , know that your presence was important .
Thanks her for her part .
Oath to Marshall to guard jury .
( Judge asks jurors to listen to the oath because , though it's with the marshall , it 's applicable to them . )
Jury departs .
Judge Stewart explains that if the jury asks questions , he 'll call counsel in .
Both sides must agree with responses .
If it 's something simple , he can do over the phone .
( Example : if they ask if they can have a dictionary , the answer will be " no " ; no need to bring counsel here to discuss that . )
Judge Stewart jokingly delivers a compliment on behalf of a lawyer : if you had n't met your quota of at least one motion per day he'd [ something like have had to wander aimlessly , only funnier ] .
Then he delivers a serious compliment to both legal teams .
Something about the biggest collection of legal talent he 's had in his court room .
Compliments on their professionalism .
Finally , " sincere gratitude of this court . "
Now the waiting for jury to deliberate .
Freescale is showing their reference design for sub -$ 200 tablets .
The target is that tablets can soon be sold below $ 200 to end consumers that are able to run any Linux - based OS , including Android or Chromium OS - based on the open - source code available at http://chromium.org
In this video , Freescale 's product manager of Software Development demonstrates the status of their optimizations of running Chromium OS on their i.MX51 based devices , among other form factors is the recently announced $ 199 tablet form factor .
It even supports hardware acceleration of HTML5 based video playback .
This means , full power Chromium OS could be made available in the next few months in Laptop and Tablet form factors to be sold well below $ 200 unlocked without contracts .
The main question is how fast and how smooth will the Chromium Browser feel on ARM Powered devices ?
This is to be seen and tested very soon !
Follow my video - blog for hands - on reports showing performance of Chromium OS running on all the ARM Powered devices very soon .
Check also for Chrome browser running within Android , or for Chromium OS modified to add Android apps support , thus merging the two .
I also wonder , how much more does a $ 65 ARM Powered laptop cost if it uses an ARM Cortex A8 processor like the ones from Freescale instead of the ARM9 or ARM11 based ones from rockchip , VIA , Samsung and others .
If the price increase is within $ 35 , then welcome will be all the sub - $ 100 full power smooth ARM Powered Chromium OS laptops and tablets !
Without actually knowing the real price difference between the ARM9 , ARM11 and ARM Cortex based cheap laptops , my guess is that the availability of sub -$ 200 and sub -$ 100 Chromium / Android Laptops / Tablets is a possibility .
How soon will we see Google sell unlocked Chromium / Android on ARM powered laptop / tablet / e- reader convertibles with 50 - hour battery life on Pixel Qi screens at http://google.com/laptop?
The Ripsaw is an unmanned ground vehicle that tears shit up and does n't even bother taking names later .
It goes from 0 to 50 MPH in 3.5 seconds , is very maneuverable , and can knock over barns .
It 's been around for about two years since it hit the scene as a privately funded DARPA challenger and military prototype , but now they 're available to the masses .
And for only $ 200,000 .
Of course I would want to be able to get in mine and drive it , otherwise it 's just a really sick RC car .
I 'm going to do donuts in the yard of that a - hole down the street that throws his newspaper at me whenever I drive by .
If he comes out of his house I 'll tell him exactly where I 'm gonna ram this thing if I ever catch him with another paper .

After seeing Karen Mulder on the cover of a magazine , she said that she wanted to be just like her and be a model .

GAIL Sherwood , a mother - of - three who falsely claimed to have been raped , has been found guilty of three counts of perverting the course of justice .
Sherwood , 52 , of Yew Tree Way , Thrupp , twice claimed she had been raped and also accused a man of stalking her .
During a six week trial , Bristol Crown Court heard she had been found tied up and had also sent text messages to friends saying she was in trouble .
Sherwood told the court she had been stalked by a man with whom she had been involved in a minor road traffic collision on April 12 , 2008 .
This led to the arrest of the man , who was detained for 20 hours before being released without charge .
Next , Sherwood told police she was dragged into woods by a man with a weapon who then raped her as she returned to her car from walking her dogs at Haresfield Beacon on April 25 , 2008 .
On June 1 , 2008 , Sherwood claimed she was hit over the head , taken to a remote spot in the grounds of Nether Lypiatt Manor , the former home of Princess Michael of Kent , and raped .
On one occasion , she was found naked from the waist down with gaffer tape over her mouth and her hands tied behind her , the court heard .
A police helicopter located her half - naked behind a fence on another occasion .
In court , Sherwood said police had lied to her and had manipulated the evidence .
Police arrested Sherwood on June 18 , 2008 after a covert camera disproved her claim of being kidnapped from her home on June 1 .
Rather than being dragged from her house against her will , the video showed her calmly leaving her property by herself .
The court heard Sherwood , who has always maintained her innocence , told police in an interview how a man had called her mobile phone and then stalked her in his van through villages near Stroud .
On Friday , a jury found her guilty of all three counts of perverting the course of justice .
She was released on bail and will be sentenced on Thursday , March 4 .
Speaking outside the court , Detective Chief Inspector Paul Shorrock , of Gloucestershire police , said : " Ms Sherwood has wasted significant police time and resources with these false allegations but what is most upsetting is the way a false claim such as this completely undermines those people whose lives have been devastated by genuine crimes of this nature . "
Commenting on the verdict , a spokesman for Women Against Rape said : " We are shocked at today 's verdict .
Our belief in her innocence remains unshaken . "

I would like to say that I intend to flesh out each of the following bullet points in such a way as to minimize hate mail , though that would be undermining the creativity of hate mailers .
Instead , I 'll just say that , yes , I live in Tokyo and I have for many years , and that I do understand that many of the complaints here are maybe particular to Tokyo .
Maybe if I moved out to Osaka , things would be better .
What things , though ?
Well , maybe the people would n't bother me so much .
Though you know what , if I 'm going to choose my place to live based entirely on how little I mind the surrounding people , or if I 'm going to live somewhere I would n't have to deal with people at all , it might as well be somewhere I would n't have to pay quite as much for vegetarian recipe ingredients .

I 'm also sure that it 's a good idea to address the unavoidable comment that I sound like a person who would n't be happy anywhere : Maybe this is true .
I have spent a large part of my life circling the globe , immersing myself in languages , and tolerating the hell out of some world cultures .
Believe it or not , though , I am the kind of person who focuses on the positive things until , one at a time , I manage to wear them out .
In short — and maybe this is just a theory — if I move someplace new , I like it for a while , until finally I can't stand it .
This can't possibly be unique to me .
Probably millions of people come to not like anyplace they can call " here . "
There 's a chance that I 'm overreacting and / or having some mid-life crisis .
Actually , my most recent physical indicates this might just be a quarter - life crisis ( I am somewhat unfortunately a paragon of health ) .
To determine whether this is the case or not , I plan to type up a list of things I do n't like about Japan .
As my frame of reference for " Not Japan , " I 'll try to use San Francisco .
I 'll try to start with small things and work my way up to big things .
Eventually , we 'll enter another topic , which is much more directly related to video games .

Before that , I want to say that all of the Japanese people I know who know of Kotaku.com and are also not complete and total game freaks seem to be under the impression that Kotaku.com is a " website about Japanese culture . "
Maybe that 's interesting .
So when I told a friend , " Oh , I 'm going to go home tonight and write a column for Kotaku.com , " he said , " Oh , so you 're going to write about Japan ? "
For a second , I thought he had read my mind .
Well , let 's see .
Actually , let 's get the
THINGS I LOVE ABOUT JAPAN
out of the way , first .
1. Experimental music :
These guys know what they 're doing !
2. Classic video games from the 1990s : Goemon 2 is the shit , dude .
Panzer Dragoon Zwei is totally the shit , too .

3 . Trains :
Do I ever love riding Japanese trains — while playing Dragon Quest on DS , and drinking delicious Coca - Cola Zero .
[ Note : I only love trains on weekdays around noon , when they 're not crowded . ]
4. Popular music from the 1970s , 1980s , early 1990s
Now onto the complaints :
ANIME SUCKS
When foreign cultures talk about Japan , they usually talk about anime and / or manga .
Usually , it 's anime .
Anime is terrible .
It used to be okay .
Now , it 's not .
It 's inbred trailer - trash in entertainment form : Every season 's new Japanese animation places one - upmanship of every single aspect of the last season higher on their list of priorities than even " make something entertaining . "
The same can perhaps be said of all Japanese entertainment , though it 's not relevant anywhere else as much as it is in anime .
Anime used to answer the questions of kids ' dreams : " How awesome would it be to be a world - class assassin / kung - fu master / robot pilot / baseball hero ? "
Now it 's just a bunch of shit pandering to perverts and pedophiles .
Anime heroes used to be people with amazing job descriptions ; now they 're reasonably young men who find themselves miraculously sharing houses with a dozen girls aged six to nine , accidentally almost touching every other scene .
Or else it 's just guys with huge hair and impossible weapons shouting jargon .
Long ago , manga aspired to be like Dragon Ball Z : graphically iconic , with a story more coherent than it probably needed to be .
Now there 's the ADHD - addled Dragon - Ball - Z-inspired One Piece , a manga for the Twitter age if there ever was one .

SO MANY PEOPLE SMOKE
I do n't like people when they 're smoking .
I do n't like how almost every restaurant has a smoking section , and you invariably have to go through the smoking section to get to the non-smoking section .
I do n't like that people are allowed to smoke in my favorite little organic vegetable cafe , right there on the floor with the open kitchen .
I do n't want cigarette smoke near my organic vegetables !
Hel -lo ?
That makes them pretty much not organic anymore !
You might as well just be buying them from a hobo , at that point .

In a country so dense with rules and polite gestures , you 'd figure less people would so flagrantly brandish cigarettes on the street .
They walk and run and walk - run everywhere with the things .
You 'd figure something would compute in the smoker 's brain , when they hold their burning cigarette as far away from their own face as possible — at toddler - eyeball - burning height — that maybe , just maybe , the smoke coming out of their cigarette tip might bother other people as much as it actually bothers them .
My neighbor , once , smoked in his apartment , sitting by the window .
I could never see his face , though I could definitely smell his tobacco , because the smoke exited his window and promptly entered mine .
That was a spring nearly ruined .
I once put a note in his mailbox : " You know , if you 're going to blow the smoke out the window — if you do n't love smoking enough to just close the windows and turn your apartment into a hot - box , maybe you should just quit . "
He never quit .
This was also the guy ( or girl ) who was always out all night Friday night , and never got home until around 2 pm on Saturdays .
His alarm clock , programmed to go off every morning at 5 am , woke me up every Saturday .
You see a lot of young couples with their toddlers , at restaurants , in the smoking section .
I 'm sure if I said I 'd feel sorry for the kids , someone would point out how Japanese people seem to pretty much never get lung cancer — maybe because of all the green tea , or walking — so it 's not so bad if the kids grow up to be smokers .
Well , what about the people who , like me , simply find the smoke terrible ?
That 's why they have smoking sections at restaurants .

So lately , they 're trying to cut down on people smoking .
By " trying " , I mean they 're putting up signs everywhere that say you 'll be fined 2,000 yen if you smoke .
I wrote about this before .
Well , five months later , I 've never seen or heard of anyone getting fined .
I once pointed out , to a police officer , that someone was smoking in the no-smoking zone , and asked if he would fine him , and the cop simply asked me for my ID , passport , and visa papers .
He looked them over , gave them back , and turned away .
I suppose the number of smokers actually has gone down in the past years , since I 've been here .
A friend claims that his friend actually quit smoking when the Japanese rolled out a new mandatory cigarette vending machine ID proxy card called " Taspo " : to get a Taspo , you have to go through this process of proving your age , supplying a photo , et cetera .
You then receive a microchipped card that will allow you to purchase cigarettes from vending machines .
In addition to possibly cutting minors off of Japan 's abundant supply of cigarettes , it also makes you , the adult , literally a card - carrying member of a club called " smokers . "
My friend claimed his friend was only a casual smoker , and did n't feel like taking the necessary leap of bureaucracy to join the Smokers ' Club .
Way back when people first started suiciding abundantly in front of express trains , many train stations installed mirrors across the platform .
They were supposed to force the about - to - die person to take a good look at themselves , and give up on giving up .
Taspo had something of the same effect on my friend 's friend .
Weird .

What this has to do with videogames :
When you buy Super Famicom games in used game shops , the gray plastic is very often stained deep , ugly yellow from existing in houses packed to bursting with cigarette smoke .
Sometimes , the consoles themselves are so yellow .
I had fun , one day , by taking mental note of what games were the yellowest .
Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series titles were by far the consistently yellowest of all Super Famicom games .
That makes sense .
I can't imagine anyone playing Dynasty Warriors , by the way , without a cigarette in their mouth .
Once , shortly after getting a new job , a coworker announced he was getting up to smoke a cigarette .
He asked if I wanted to join him .
I said I did n't smoke .
He was surprised .
" I thought you said you were in a band ? "
Just like that :
You 're in a band .
You must smoke .
Well .
My excuse that I was just the vocalist , so I needed to keep my throat pure .
He mentioned how Kurt Cobain apparently smoked five packs a day .
Well .
A couple years later , another person learned I did n't smoke , and acted surprised .
" I figured you must smoke because , you know ; you play video games . "
That 's a real stereotype , man .
It exists .
In Japan , gamers are smokers .
Maybe this impression is born from the fact that breathing in Japanese arcades is pretty much exactly like dunking your head in a bucket of hot water and dead cigarettes .
Do n't let the hype fool you : Japanese arcades are great because , you know , video games , though man , there is a hell of a lot of smoking going on in those places , man .
Maybe the arcades only exist because people need some excuse to get away from their smoke - averse significant other and puff away .
Fact : I have never seen anyone playing Tekken 6 without also smoking a cigarette .
Advertisement
Also , I suspect that the Pokemon " Koffing " is n't a symbol of the evils of pollution — he 's Japan 's Joe Camel , hooking kids on the power and might of smoke .

EVERYTHING IN JAPAN HAS MEAT IN IT
Everything in Japan has meat in it .
Potato chips pretty much always have beef or pork extract in them .
I 've watched ingredient labels with perverse interest over the years .
I tend to avoid white bread on principle , eating only whole wheat bread .
Still , something caught my eye while looking over the white bread ingredient labels one day two or three years ago ( sometimes I 'm hanging out in a convenience store , waiting for a friend to make a purchase , and I just need to pick up and gently squeeze something soft ) :
About half of the makers of white bread include lard as an ingredient .
This is a thing that I know happens in white bread in other countries .
However , since phrases like " lard - ass " and " tub of lard " successfully penetrated to the deepest levels of the collective modern English - speaking human consciousness around twenty years ago , food companies all over the place are avoiding the word 's appearance on their ingredient labels .
Many bread - makers substitute oils , butter , or — god help us — margarine .
Advertisement
Well , I can now curiously report that , on a recent trip to a super market , I could n't find a single loaf of white bread that did n't have lard in it .
Hmm .
I could rattle off curious examples for hours — like how " Indian " curry powder I liked once happily advertised " Now With Beef Extract " on the can .
( Recall Indiana Jones in " The Temple of Doom " — " Hindus do n't eat meat !
Something 's wrong here . " )
Or how the Japanese variety of Bac - Os bacon ( - flavored ) bits , which are completely vegan - friendly in America , list " Pork Extract " as the top ingredient , even though — according to a foreign friend brave enough to eat them regularly — they smell and taste exactly like American Bac - Os .
Or how a coincidentally meat - free soup stock once changed their label to proudly advertise " Now tastes more like crab ! "
It had never tasted anything like crab .
I checked the ingredients :
It definitely had crab in it .
You can see where this is going .
Advertisement
The absolute best example , however , involves a ramen shop I used to go to , because they offered a vegetarian - friendly ramen .
According to friends who regularly eat " normal " ramen , the vegetarian ramen was unique and delicious .
It was also distinctly lacking in iridescent grease bubbles floating on the surface of the ramen .
Here is the part of the story where someone in the audience interjects , " Mmm ! Delicious grease bubbles ! "
Save it , asshole !
Let me finish : I do n't eat meat because I do n't like things like grease bubbles .
I do n't like eating dirty things .
I have a lot of fun , lately , making up the weirdest fake reasons for not eating meat :
My favorite one is saying that I do n't eat meat because I would n't want to ingest an animal weak or dumb enough to enter a life of slavery under another species , that the only meat I would eat would be that of an animal which a human cannot actually kill .
This explanation , recently , actually drew the serious response , " Well , if you can't kill the animal , you can't eat it ! "
This , tangentially , highlights another problem I have with Japan — that people do n't get sarcasm or irony , though maybe I 'm wrong here , and maybe the person who gave that response was just a genius wielding his own sarcasm so fake - seriously .
Anyway , this ramen shop caught the attention of some society of Japanese vegetarians .
They have a little magazine — which , in Japan , means that it 's huge , glossy , printed on cardboard , costs around $ 20 , and comes with a free six - hour DVD .
They asked to have their little logo put on the menu standing outside the ramen shops , so the few vegetarians would know this place was safe .
The vegetarian people featured the ramen shop in a magazine .
That 's how I found it .
Not long after this happened , the chain coincidentally took off .
People really loved their Extra Pork Bone Marrow ramen !
The number of locations multiplied .
Eventually , someone higher up in the administration of the parent company was running down a checklist of things they could do to make more money .
The suggestion that non-vegetarians might be put - off by the inclusion of the vegetarian magazine 's seal of approval was immediately heeded .
Only rather than humbly ask the vegetarian magazine if it was alright to remove the vegetarian magazine logo , they decided to humbly apologize that the recipe had changed , and the vegetarian ramen 's broth now included pork bone marrow , so they would have to stop advertising as safe for vegetarians .

The underlying principle at work here — that businesspeople realize some people will ignore an entire selection of products because one does not appeal to them — is universal , I guess .
Delicious , garlic - based vegetarian - friendly ramen , however , was exclusive only to a few ramen shops in Tokyo .
Damn it !
This topic applies to me pretty directly , so I have researched it on and off over the years .
In all world cultures , meat has always been associated with an act of sacrifice .
Cows can do other things aside from die and be cut up for steak .
Oxen can pull plows , et cetera .
I have yet to find a single not - high - class Chinese restaurant in Tokyo that serves a single vegetarian dish .
In China , however , nearly half of everything is vegetarian .
That 's the half I eat .
In China , meat is associated with wealth and success .
Tofu is a food that requires so many nearly - dehumanizing labor processes to prepare .
We can live on it , though if we 're making it ourselves , it 's something we have to devote our lives to .
A Chinese friend once told me that Chinese restaurants in Japan serve only dishes with meat in them as some kind of subconscious celebration of their finding success in a foreign land .

Once , a Japanese co-worker , who had gone to Tokyo University and somehow survived on Planet Earth for more than fifty years without decapitating himself on a bathroom door frame , insisted on my ordering some food at a company party I was forced to attend .
I had excused myself the day before the party , saying I 'd only be able to sit in for a half an hour at the most — a moving truck was coming to my apartment that very night .
It was a very real , legitimate excuse .
This guy explained to the waitress in painstaking detail that we needed a salad with no chicken , no shrimp , and no tuna in it .
The waitress looked over the little notepad in her hands .
" This salad . . . it 'll only have vegetables in it .
Would you like something with some substance ? "
The man thought for a second : " Bacon ! " " Okay " , said the waitress , and hurried away .
A minute later , I was about to get up .
" Where are you going ? " the guy asked .
" I 've got to run , " I said .
" I just ordered you a salad ! "
The salad came .
There it was , with bacon .
" Oh , " I said .
" I can't eat this .
It has bacon in it . "
" You do n't like bacon ? " " It 's meat . "
" No it 's not ! "
The man was being deadly , gravely serious .
We argued about it in the politest tones possible for maybe three minutes .
" Look , man , I do n't eat meat .
I know what 's meat and what 's not meat , " was my ultimate closing argument .
His closing argument , in the Japanese tradition , was the same as mine , only with one of the words in the first sentence changed : " Look , man , I do eat meat .
I know what 's meat and what 's not meat . "
We ended with a little " agree to disagree " thing .
We parted ways both knowing that we were right , only , to this day , I still kind of have the edge , because I actually was right .
What does this have to do with videogames ?
Have you ever played a game , really liked it , and then found that the sequel went and added something you did n't want , or something that just did n't apply to you ?
I hate when that happens !
Also , that many times the people old enough to make important decisions at the companies producing your favorite videogames are literally stupid and / or ignorant enough to think that bacon is not meat .

THE MANDATORY PARTIES
The Japanese are so serious about work that even work - related parties are mandatory .
If you do n't go to a company party , you 're not part of the team .
If you 're not part of the team , it 's possible you 're not actually working at the company .
Advertisement
It 's been said , many times , in many ways , that the Japanese are an intense people .
The samurai used to , like , ritualistically scream , kneel , and cut their intestines out with their sword if they were disgraced in battle .
An attendant would then cut the samurai's head off with a sword .
Being serious about parties and requiring all employees to attend or it's they ass is not nearly as bad as forcing an employee to disembowel himself as punishment for the feudal Japanese equivalent of jamming the paper shredder .
Either way , I 've never heard a story about someone who got fired directly because they did n't go to a company party .
I 'm sure it 's only ever happened indirectly .
Advertisement
The general consensus is that , if a guy does n't want to go to a party and get terribly drunk with everyone else in the company , then he obviously has some element of his outside life — a girlfriend , a hobby , et cetera — that is more important to him than the company , so any work he does is less worthy of trust than any work done by anyone who " respects the company " enough to go to all the parties and match the boss drink for drink .
Try skipping a party as an employee of a Japanese company : Instantly , you 're The Guy Who Skipped The Party , you 're The Guy Who Does n't Care About The Company .
Or try going to the party and not drinking .
I literally have to say " I 'm allergic to alcohol " 40 times before they 'll stop pushing me to take a drink .
" Take just one drink ! "
" I'm allergic . "
" Oh , no you 're not !
Just take one drink ! "
" I 'm allergic .
I 'll die . "
Advertisement
Repeat 20 to 25 times , until , eventually , the other guy goes , " Oh , wait , you 're serious ? "
Maybe if I were a Japanese person , and I said this , they would n't be attempting to detect irony , and it would go more smoothly .
I 'd probably also get a profound apology .
Well , these days , people have iPhones , which are more or less like Japanese cellular phones , only browsing the Internet does n't cost six dollars a page load .
If the bar is n't 60 feet underground ( they usually are ) , someone whips out that phone , looks up " alcohol allergy , " and says " Oh , all that 'll happen is you 'll break out in some hives . "
Advertisement
" It 's just hives , man . "
Then I inevitably get someone leaning over and whispering to me , " Hives are not so bad .
I get hives when I eat mushrooms .
You are really not helping your reputation by refusing to drink , here . "
Advertisement
I 'm not going to blame just this society - fragment for the poor state of the economy , or even the low birth rate .
Rather , I 'll blame it and all the things like it .
The Japanese have distilled " social life " to a point where it is literally a part of work .
The " rules " of working adult society so very mathematically dictate that
1. Drinking = having fun
2 . Good employees like to have fun
3 . People who have fun are good employees
4 . Good employees will never , ever get fired

Maybe you know the story about how Gran Turismo got started because Kazunori Yamauchi , on his first day in the Sony Computer Entertainment offices , wrote out a sample game design idea consisting only of the words " I want to drive my car on my television . "
What you may not know is that this is more or less the way many Japanese companies have been doing everything creative for maybe fifty years .
Occasionally , I 'll be out eating dinner with friends , and young people at a nearby table will be talking about opening a business .
This is really common : it seems like they have no idea what the company is going to be .
Okay , this happens in the West , too — BioWare got started from the idea of making medical software .
Well , sometimes , Japanese companies do n't even start with that much vision .
They 're just companies .
Who knows what the products have to be ?
There 's a lot of at - wall shit - flinging .
Sony , back then , were requiring all employees in the Computer Entertainment division to fill out a Game Design Idea Submission form every single day .
What 's most intriguing is that — every time I 've ever talked to a Japanese businessperson about a product that was actually monstrously successful , it seems that the one thing the boss respected most about their proposal was how it was worded so simply .
For example , Kazunori Yamauchi had n't even filled out the form completely for Gran Turismo 's proposal .
( If this idea morbidly amuses you , try Kobo Abe 's novel Kangaroo Notebook , in which a company man simply writes " Kangaroo Notebook " on a proposal form , exciting his boss 's interest and turning his life into a stressful hell .
( Among other things . )

What this has to do with videogames :
Once , when I was working for a Japanese game company as something of a liaison to help them develop games with a more future - proof " western " method , I suggested that every employee be , at all points in the process , encouraged to offer input on things such as game design .
The initial reaction was , " That 's what the game designers do ! "
It took days of near - futile conversation to uncover the controversial finding that , prior to designing a game for the first time , people like Shigeru Miyamoto had actually never designed any games .
To be most blunt , modern Japanese games are so soulless because the only people who make them are people who make games .
You need some outside influence , I said .
And anyway , maybe some of these people who like videogames enough to learn how to program them might have some decent ideas of what they like or do n't like in game design ?
What happened , eventually , was an email : " ALL EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM IMMEDIATELY FOR A BRAINSTORMING SESSION RE : GAME DESIGN " .
Some part - time kid fresh out of college sat there with a notebook , writing down literally everything everyone said .
The meeting was a terrible failure .
" That did n't work , " someone said .
" So much for that idea , " someone else said .
Once , another foreign employee at another company suggested to the management that they try doing things like ordering pizza — or the Japanese equivalent — for the employees , every once in a while .
You know , because these guys put in soul - crushing work hours and could probably use the encouragement from the company .
He was immediately greeted with an automaton - like voice : " QUANTIFY : ' ENCOURAGEMENT ' " .
His explanation was that employees who are actually happy , or content , or who feel appreciated , generally do better work .
The guys in this company were the type to sit at their desks with bowls of terrible convenience - store ramen through the night .
Why not treat them to , you know , one higher class of a food ?
The human resources department passed the idea around , and figured it could n't hurt .
So , one day , we got an email : " THIS FRIDAY AT SIX PM , EVERY EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM TO EAT PIZZA " .
Well , there you go .

I 'm told , sometimes , that at such functions at the Mandatory Cherry Blossom - Viewing Party every company holds every year in the nearest large park , if you just relax and enjoy yourself , it 's not so bad , and sometimes it 's not bad at all .
SOME JAPANESE OFFICE TRADITIONS ARE GENUINELY TERRIFYING
Every once in a while , you 're outside , and you find a huge crowd of people in suits and ties .
They take up all of the sidewalk .
They 're all drunk .
They just got out of a mandatory company party in the nearest wooden - submarine - like Japanese restaurant whose menu consists of whatever fell off the garbage truck as it peeled away from a flock of particularly aggressive crows that morning .
They 're standing a circle , completely of their own accord .
The boss is nowhere in sight .
Someone in this group of juniors influenced them all to get into this circle .
Anyway , they start chanting something .
You can hardly understand what it is , even if you fluently understand the language .
What the hell are they doing ?
The chant soon becomes a scream .
This group of maybe forty young men and women in suits are screaming in unison .
Advertisement
What the hell is that about ?
The answer is : nothing .
They 're screaming for screaming 's sake .
They 're doing this to show that they have some energy — any energy at all .
This is a subtle hint :
Their lives , bodies , and souls belong to the company ; the energy that resides in those bodies is all to the company 's benefit .
If you say it like that , it comes out as sensationalist and weird .
Well , it 's that kind of thing .
You know how football players get into a huddle before a game , bump fists and yell " GOOOOOO TEAM " ?
It 's like that , only they 're doing it after successfully Achievement Unlocked : The Drunkening .
High school students will do it to celebrate their anticipation of successful performance on , like , college entrance exams .
Certain times of the year roll around , and you can't navigate a well - populated street without encountering a large group of screaming , chanting businesspeople .
Sometimes , I stand and watch them as they continue to chant for literally a half an hour at a time .
Lots of people who I meet as tourists seem enamored with the idea when they first encounter it .
It 's a different kind of culture .
Well , no one likes it after a while , least of all the people who are doing it .
Maybe I can sum up every little point I 'm trying to make in this whole word - slab by saying I do n't like that so many people agree to do things that they obviously hate doing .
At least football players like playing football .
Sometimes , they love it !
Sometimes , they get severe brain damage , too .
Maybe the Japanese do n't get severe brain damage from screaming all night in the death - like frigidity of a winter night , though they do sometimes pass out .
I 've heard maybe six dozen variations of this story from friends who work in hyper - large corporations :
Some poor guy , during the Mandatory Daily Morning Gather And Scream in the middle of the office ( or , in some cases , the large conference room downstairs ) , passes out , has a heart attack , an asthma attack , an aneurysm , whatever .
I only once worked for a company big enough to have Gather And Scream events every morning , though I was lucky enough to work in a division with mostly old dudes who were n't expected to participate , so that made me not expected to participate , either .
Advertisement
I do n't know .
I know someone 's going to say I 'm a racist , or being intolerant , or whatever , though man , that kind of thing is creepy as hell .
In other news , looking at my outline of to - be - written bullet points , I am struck by just how many of them concern screaming .
Okay , here 's one mostly related :
In many Japanese offices , you 're required to scream " Good morning ! " at the top of your lungs , clapping your hands to your thighs , as soon as you enter the office area every morning .
Everyone in the office then shouts " Good morning ! " back to you .
At my orientation for one company , the Human Resources Girl — whose face ( figuratively ) literally screamed " Hall Monitor " — was going over the " Good Morning ! " protocol .
Her explanation weird despite its terseness : " This is how adults interact in Japan . "
Most of the people at the orientation , like me , were under twenty - five .
" Before we move onto the next item , does anyone have any questions ? "
I seriously and portentously asked a question , then , which I thought was hilarious : " If we 're the first one in the office in the morning , do we still have to scream ' Good Morning ' and clap our hands to the sides of our legs ? "
Her answer was immediate , and humorless : " Yes . "
" Well , I mean , there 's no one else around to hear it , right ? "
" You still have to do it .
It 's the rule .
Every employee must do this .
That 's why we call it ' protocol . ' "
This instant was actually the very first time I begin to ponder the logistics of actually going ahead and being homeless .
You know , cardboard , up against concrete , is not only not uncomfortable — it 's pretty good for your spine !
Advertisement
I pushed further : " What if I am the second person in the office , and the first person is someone with whom I have , previously , managed to successfully cultivate a congenial personal relationship ?
What if it 's a person whose first and last name I know , with whom I share interests and hobbies , and we 've previously agreed that we think this ' Good morning ' shit is some serious bullshit , and we just agree to be like , ' Hey , what 's up ' to one another in the morning and we 've also agreed that hey , if anyone else asks , we 'll just go ahead and say ' Oh yeah , that dude totally screamed " Good morning " to me this morning ' ? "
The HR girl did n't even blink : " You still have to carry out the customary ' Good Morning . ' "

How this relates to videogames :
That company I talk about in the above paragraphs ?
They were a ( pretty big ) Japanese game company .
These are the kinds of things the people who make your favorite Japanese games are forced to do every day .
It 's worth noting that I got friendly with a guy in the office — and one day , he happened to be first in the office , and I was second .
I did n't say good morning to him .
He came over to my desk about two minutes after I 'd settled in .
" You forgot to say good morning . "
Advertisement
" Yeah , I know , dude .
How are you doing today ? "
" . . .
You know , I do n't really mind , myself , though you really do have to say good morning .
If there were more people in the office , and not just me , they would think you were not part of the team .
Even if it 's just me in the office when you get in , you should try getting into the habit of saying good morning in my presence .
This is just how we do things in Japan , Tim . "
Advertisement
" Well , [ Name - removed ] - san , you can try putting ' san ' on the end of my fucking name from now on , then , you know , as practice . "
Really — all these customs and politeness and whatever , and they go and throw out the customary name suffix and just call me " Tim " .
Why not " Tim - san " ?
I 'm required to put " san " on the end of their names .
It 's a little . . . suspicious .
I knew from the beginning that I would never " fit in " whether I wanted to or not ; well , this was probably around when the rest of the world got the memo .
Advertisement
I never talked to that guy again !
From that day on , when I arrived in the office and he was the only other person there , I wold snap my fingers , point directly at him , and then , when I had gotten his attention , I 'd give him a sharp military salute , letting some huge " HOOH " sound escape the back of my throat .
SCREAMING IS THE MESSAGE
I can't have not mentioned this before : Employees at shops in Japan scream all the time , and sometimes with no reason .
I read several weekly Japanese business magazines , and I once read one where a columnist reported some figures from some Japanese PhD 's recent research findings :
Apparently , " putting on the impression of being busy " is mathematically proven to be " more important " for making money than either " offering good products " or " offering good service " .

Western business gurus have been advising young up - and - comers for years to put " President and Founder " on their business card instead of " First and Only Employee . "
Well , Tokyo is a pedestrian culture , and on the ground , this advice translate into something terrifying .
Chances are , if you 've only spent a short time in Japan , you might have found it endearing .
You really came to feel like you were in Asia , what with people screaming everywhere , like they would in an epic Chinese marketplace scene in an adventure film .
This atmosphere is completely manufactured .
Like , the biggest electronics stores actually keep ladders on hand so that certain employees can climb the ladders and scream indecipherable words down at the customers , through megaphones .

I do not use the word " indecipherable " lightly .
Very seldom are the words actual words .
A friend let me in on this secret .
" You know , aside from ' irasshaimase ' , they 're not using actual words , most of the time . "
He had prior job experience , see .
Apparently , some stores actually demand that employees enlisted as barkers absolutely refrain from using actual words .
That 's a little weird .
I do n't like knowing things like that .
It 's like seeing a cockroach scatter from behind the TV and up into a crack in the ceiling just before you shut off the light to go to bed in a seedy motel : now you have to sleep with that knowledge .
So , wait , if everyone knows that the people are n't saying actual words , why do n't they , like , get pissed about it ?
I mean , that 's some serious " The Matrix " bullshit right there .
That 's a machine there 's got to be somebody raging against .

Or maybe it 's just me .
Maybe these things really do n't bother other people so much .
Japanese people always tell me , " Oh , it 's just a Japanese thing .
If you grew up here , maybe you 'd be okay with all of it . "
Well , sure .
Maybe I would have become desensitized to it .
Hell , maybe I'm on the verge of becoming desensitized to it right now .
Maybe the rage of this current moment is , in fact , a last - ditch effort to affect some change before I can't care less anymore .

Okay , here 's what I think is the crux of my problem .
When I first came to Japan , and learned that " irasshaimase " meant " come [ into the store ] ! "
I expressed a certain amount of confusion to the dude who was playing the part of my tour guide .
We were in a Jeansmate — a Japanese jeans store that is inexplicably open twenty - four hours a day , even in towns where ( as in ours ) the only god damn supermarket closes at eight in the PM .
I was looking at jeans , and an employee , standing nearby , was repeatedly yelling " Irrashaimase " at my roommate and I .
" That 's just how they do things . "
He must have yelled it maybe a hundred times .
We were the only customers in the store .
" Why is he telling us to come into the store if we 're already in the store ? "
" Beats me , man , " was my roommate 's response .
Years later , I was dating a woman who might have really hated me .
I think the thing she might have hated most about me was that I did n't hate her .
Anyway , I brought up the " irasshaimase " thing , and she groaned .
Her first explanation was the knee - jerk : " It 's a Japanese thing . "
Her second explanation was to give me a history lesson : " Irasshaimase is a greeting that dates back hundreds of years , when shops were traditionally stalls in a marketplace .
In such cases , the word indicated to customers that they should come closer to the stall , that they should buy their little dried fishes at your stall , and not the stall next to you , which sells the same things . "
This explanation was good enough .
However , the kid in the Jeansmate , years ago , was n't standing behind a stall .
The word " Come [ into the store / over here ] " is not genuine .
The kid was calling it out repeatedly as he folded jeans a few aisles away from the jeans that interested me .
If I were to blindly and deafly heed the command semantically buried in his polite perfunctory greeting , it would require me to abandon my act of genuinely curious commercialism .

My problem is that " irasshaimase " actually means something in both ancient and modern Japanese .
Like , we have the word " Hello " in English , right ?
" Hello " does n't mean anything .
You look it up in a dictionary , and it'll say " Word used to greet someone in a friendly manner " .
Actually , I just made that definition up ; let 's actually check Dictionary.com :
hello –interjection 1 . ( used to express a greeting , answer a telephone , or attract attention . )
Advertisement
There you have it .
Many of the words used perfunctorily in the Japanese language have both useful purposes and cold , hard semantic meanings .
That kind of bothers me .
I can't really say why — maybe because I did n't grow up with it ?
No , that can't be it : I once met a hardcore Japanese punk rock dude who brought up his own out - creeped - ness with the semantics of Japanese customary greetings completely independent of my input .
Like , during orientation at a Japanese company , you 're told to use the word " Otsukaresamadesu ! " when greeting other employees either in the hallway , at the coffee machine , or even on a train station platform on the weekend .
The word means , more or less , " You are tired ! "
The progression goes like this :
When you see someone in the office before noon , you are to tell them " good morning . "
After lunch has finished , leading right up to the end of the day , it 's " You are tired ! "
So there you have it : Japanese people in the office are expected to work themselves to tiredness before lunch .
Or maybe they 're expected to eat so much that they get tired .
Advertisement
Of course , it 's all a front .
You might have heard that the Japanese work insanely hard , or that some people die from overwork .
That 's a joke .
They do n't .
You know how they die ?
The same way that kid in Korea died while playing Counter - Strike :
The very act of sitting and staring at a computer screen becomes something of an addiction in and of itself ; they simply forget to use the toilet , or maybe have an aneurysm .
In short , if you 've ever worked at an office anywhere in the world , you 've done about the same degree of actual work that Japanese people do in Japanese companies .
You just might have not had the same semantic prison constructed around you by all the people subliminally intoning " You are tired ! " to you every thirty fucking seconds .
Here 's what I think of these words :
They exist to cut the bullshit out of life .
This exquisite , extravagant , repeated conversational miscarriage occurs ever nano - second somewhere in this megalopolis .
Say you enter a Starbucks and the girl behind the counter is hella hot .
She immediately prostrates herself by shouting a — oh , wait .
Starbucks is a western corporation , and forward - thinking enough to say " Konnichiwa " ( " Hello " ) and not " Irasshaimase . "
Okay , let 's say you go into some Japanese franchise cafe , and the hella - hot girl behind the counter immediately prostrates herself by speaking that sharp little sentence - word - knife .
Immediately , she has placed herself beneath you .
From where she stands at the edge of the synapse marked " Come into the store ! " she can just about touch the synapse marked " You are the master , and I am a lowly slave ! " with her index finger .
( This is going to be important later . )
How prone are you to start a conversation with someone in such a situation ?
Probably not very .
Things could , of course , be worse .
They could just not have coffee at all .

With the service industry so twisted to a point where " chatting up a shop girl " is literally considered by men- about - town to be the hardest form of pick - up , how do Japanese people make friends ?
The answer seems to be that , in any sense other than meeting people through school , work , or companies related to their company , they do n't .
( Not saying that friends you make at work are n't " real " friends , though hey . )
It is only in a social climate where chatting up a shop - girl is considered arcane black magic that a concept like a hostess club can exist .
You may know hostess clubs from the Ryu ga gotoku or Yakuza games .
Sure .
I 've talked about hostess clubs at length in a previous column ( " can videogames be our friends ? " ) .
For now , I 'll summarize : Hostess clubs are bars that hire girls who dress entirely in the modern fashion befitting girls who work at hostess clubs .
The girls are not only willing to talk to the customers — it 's their job , so they have to .
These girls , who usually earn more money than their clients , exist in a culturally unique gray area between customer and employee .
Men in Japan nearly all transit through a phase , in their early twenties , where their favorite hobby is dressing up in their best clothes , standing in the middle of a crowded street with their best mates , and yelling single words at every reasonably attractive girl who walks by .
This is the non-Vegas equivalent of playing the nickel slots :
The odds are fucking hell of slim , though who knows ?
You could strike a jackpot ( " get laid " ) .
Then you 're up to your ears in nickels ( " in bed with a girl who probably disrespects you as much as you disrespect her " ) .
Advertisement
Hostess clubs have become the stuff of video games in recent years , and I hesitate to postulate that the idea of a dating simulation video - game was born of the oldest traditional ancestors of hostess clubs .
In the days of dating simulations and of actual slot machines and lottery tickets that could produce a jackpot from a minimal investment , in a society of pedestrians whose every waking moment is some form of game , shackles made of words with meanings that do n't always add up to their practical use contribute to the bottling up of what I believe to be some pretty fuckin ' weird shit , man .
Chatting up a shop - girl used to be the ultimate pick - up , and it was because of the difficulty of said pick - up that " talking to a girl who is involved in some capacity in the service industry " became a certifiable fetish .
So hostess clubs proliferated .
Hostesses in hostess clubs do not have sex with the customers .
That 's how they keep them coming .
It 's business .
So now , of course , the ultimate pick - up is to sleep with a hostess who you meet by being a customer in her workplace .
Sure , any guy can have sex with a girl who works in a hostess club that the guy has never been to .
So , it used to be , the ultimate Achievement Unlocked was to pick up a girl who is bound by the rules of her society to not converse casually with you .
Now , the ultimate pick - up is to score with a girl who you were willing to pay money simply to talk to , who you met under circumstances that allowed her to do anything with you except relate to you sexually .

How this relates to videogames :
We have centuries of literature and decades of film from which to draw artistic inspiration ; we have 1080 p graphics and processors capable of displaying tens of thousands of high - definition polygons rotating at the scale speed of sound .
And though game designers all know that more interesting methods of communication are possible , when you hit enemies in Final Fantasy XIII , huge numbers fly out in every direction .
Huge , horse - choking , golden , gleaming five - digit numerals explode outward everywhere .
The game never shows you how many hit points the monsters have .
It shows you the shit out of how many hit points of damage you 're doing .
They do this because this is how it used to be , so that 's probably how it should be , forever .
The customer is already in the store , and they 're going to keep yelling at them , telling them to come in .
Also , it 's worth noting that certain other expressions , ejaculations , and exclamations in the Japanese language are also full words .
When someone is hurt , they typically do n't make a surprised sound such as " Ow " , they say " itai " — " [ adjective meaning ] painful " .
This really works in Japanese , because every syllable ends with a vowel , making it friendly to exclamations .
What 's weird is when you play a video game translated from Japanese into English , and the translators are " thorough " enough to translate these actual - word ejaculations into actual words of English .
I once saw a video on YouTube of the game Infinite Undiscovery , in which the hero said " Cutitout ! " every time he got hit .
Oh , god .
Maybe , in the Japanese version , he was saying " Yamero ! " , which pretty much means " Quit it ! " or " Cut it out ! "
Man , it was really weird to hear that .
The guy just kept yelling it in the exact same tone of voice every time he got hit .
It made me think :
You know , in Japan , the guy at the 7 - eleven nearest to my house literally does say " Irasshaimase " in the exact same tone of voice every time a customer enters the store .
His precision is hardly creepy .
However , if you translate this idea into English , it comes across as unforgivably stilted .
I feel a transient pride , typing this , that my own native language is less conducive to such robot - like precision .

THE COPYCATS , THE UP - GIVERS
It is my opinion that Japanese businesses generally suck at marketing .
My favorite example is The Chokokuro Cafe .
I like this example a lot :
Starbucks suddenly existed ; people loved it .
Starbucks made lots of different kinds of coffees and treats .
People enjoyed drinking / eat / inhaling them .
Every once in a while , Starbucks came up with something new .
Around this time , a lot of Japanese kids whose parents had ridden high during the Pre-Sony - Walkman - Era boom were just graduating college .
Seeing as big business was the thing putting the Japanese all over the map , most kids around then had been studying business .
About half of everyone wanted to work their way up a big company .
They 're probably still at their desks , answering the phones , right about now , at four AM on Sunday , waiting for that day when they wo n't be answering the phones anymore .
Advertisement
Anyway , lots of people started cafes , for some reason or another , right around the time Starbucks really took off .
I wonder why .
As if having four Starbuckses on one city block was n't bad enough , you now had to deal with literally four Starbuckses and then one of each of two dozen other franchise Starbucks clones .
One of these Japanese franchise cafes was called Saint Marc's .
The Saint Marc corporation was founded in 1989 by a couple of young people who did n't know they wanted to have a cafe .
Eventually , they had a cafe .
Advertisement
Okay , I 'm not going to glorify this .
They just had a couple of cafes in Tokyo .
They were known for an edgier decor than your old - school Japanese cafes , or than Starbucks 's down - home feel .
They made a lot of little pastries , you know , just flinging shit at the wall .
Nothing stuck .
Well , eventually , they made a croissant with a little bit of chocolate in it .
They called it the " Chocolate Croissant . "
What a name !
I 'm not really sure how this happened , though it got popular .
Some women 's magazine must have written a review or a recommendation of it .
I was dating the woman who might have sincerely hated me around the time this happened , because she mentioned having heard about it , and wanting to eat it .
I learned a lot about marketing from that woman , literally and figuratively .
First of all , her saying she'd " heard about it " was stated so generically that she could have been indicating she 'd heard about it from a friend or from some media source .
At the end of the day , it was the same thing .
I ate one of the Chocolate Croissants .
It tasted like a chocolate croissant .
Not two years later , Saint Marc's Cafe had changed the name of all their locations to " Chokokuro Cafe " .
" Chokokuro " is a little abbreviation , like " Pokemon " is to " Pocket Monsters . " " Chokokuro " is short for " Chokoreeto Kurowasan . "
( In Japanese , as in French , the " t " in " Croissant " is silent . )
Advertisement
Starbucks evolved from a small chain of cafes to a huge one by consistently introducing new products , constantly pushing the envelope .
Right ?
So what the hell ?
They just immediately changed their name to reflect the name of the first product that brought them moderate success .
A Japanese friend who works in marketing told me this is the " Japanese resolve . "
A company sees its fate and resigns itself to it .
I think it sounds more like someone just giving up and settling for what they have .
Now , there 's nothing wrong with limiting one 's ambitions , in theory .
I 'm not the kind of person to say that everybody should want to rule the world .
My main beef here is that , in the hip , beautiful town of Koenji , in which I live , the only franchise cafe is a Chokokuro Cafe , not a Starbucks .
Chokokuro Cafe has a smoking section , separated from the non-smoking section by a maybe - four - foot - tall wall of plastic .
Starbuckses the world over are smoke - free .
So yeah , I 've kind of come to hate on Chokokuro Cafe at every opportunity :
If they 're so willing to just settle down and marry their proverbial high school sweetheart , why do they try to keep expanding ?
Eventually , they 're going to find they 've expanded too far , spread themselves too thin .
What 's going to happen , then ?
Businesses like Chokokuro Cafe are nonchalantly dumping tiny little rabbit turds into the ocean - sized reservoir of the world economy .

How this relates to games :
So you have all these little niches , right ?
How many of them , really , need to exist ?
You have people sitting around in planning rooms going , " How are we going to get more money ? "
" Whose money are we going to get next ? "
It 's fairly simple why they want this money .
Business is like a shark : it moves forward , or it stops breathing .
Nobody wants to retire , because if they work a little bit harder , their ideal retirement yacht might grow an extra bedroom .
I mentioned in my last column that trends only move forward into the mainstream because someone in marketing decides what the next big thing is going to be .
This happens a lot with games .
Only —
I think — the producers and marketers of games in Japan are particularly out of touch with their fan - base .
Every other game is one of two scenarios :
1. Producers taking a niche and encouraging it — like , say , we have maids , right ?
Maids creep me the hell out .
Above , I mentioned how girls ( and dudes ) working in normal cafes , or any kind of restaurant , immediately place themselves a level lower than you , using very ancient , stilted words .
Someone must have noticed how close Japanese polite society stands to a brave new service industry populated by individuals who literally proclaim to every customer , " You are the master !
I am the servant !
You are awesome !
I am scum ! "
Maybe there was a manga with a maid in it , and maybe some people thought that was funny and made jokes about it ; it escalated , and they started drawing their own comics ; eventually , the marketers caught wind of it , and it became A Thing .
Now it 's a niche .
Why encourage these niches ?
Eventually , the people who started the joke see how seriously it 's being taken .
At first , they support it monetarily with some unease ; sooner or later , their unease has given way to high - pitched laughter , as a private joke builds into an industry in itself .
Like , they have this cell - phone game now where you raise a hostess like a virtual pet .
I suppose the intended audience is dudes who think this sort of thing is hilarious , though what 's the possibility that those games exist so that girls can aspire to be hostesses , and consider the game some kind of primer for their future lifestyle ?
Where are we headed , then ?
The producers might be the type of people to think , " Yeah , the hostess club industry exist because of some weird multi- layered passive aggressive need cooked in the crucible of Japanese semantics for centuries , and there 's probably a better role - model for girls , though some girls want to be hostesses already , and it 's more profitable to not try to change their mind . "
I realize I sound like one of those conservatives saying they should n't hand out condoms in high school , though man , like George Michael said , " Sex is natural , sex is good , not everybody does it — everybody should " .
" Natural " means we are born with penises and vaginas and what - have - you .
We are not born with a natural inclination to , you know , need to dress in gaudy clothes , tell men up - front that sex is an impossibility because of contract stipulations , and then proceed to take their money in exchange for the service of acting surprised whenever they mention how tired they are from work .

2. Entertainment distilled to an impenetrable essence : Final Fantasy XIII is such a good example for this :
They took out all the towns and all of the situations where you feel like you own the world in some small part .
Instead , rather than take what did n't work all the time and try to make it actually work all the time , they took what did work , and left it all by itself .
A perfect example is the Amazon. co.jp page for Sega and tri-Ace 's RPG End of Eternity .
The " product description " reads like a bullet - pointed list from one of the Japanese game industry 's beloved PowerPoint presentations , which got sent to Amazon administrators on mistake .
I will not embellish my translation :
" Graphics are very pretty : the game is on a high - end console . "
" Innovative RPG battle system : different from other RPG battle systems . "
Advertisement
Here 's the one that actually scared me of the whole world for a couple of minutes :
" Feels like a game : is easy to play , and features level design that will not stress the player . "
Advertisement
I feel like I 've seen into a confidential document , here .
This is the agenda : to never stress any players again .
Damn it , when I was eight years old , I loved feeling stressed when playing Final Fantasy .
The experience spawned a lifetime of seeking out digital stress and triumphing over it .
In The Real Life , I am stress - free .
( Mostly . )
Might these things have some connection ?
If this is the direction things are headed , then the games of the future are going to be fuckin ' scary .
It 's like , what if they made a Cap'n Crunch that was all Crunchberries ?
Oh wait .
They did .
Okay :
What if they made a Lucky Charms that was all marshmallows ?
Japanese games , thanks to Chokokuro - like thinking , are now like ramen with more noodles and less soup , because people like the noodles more , and lots of jerks manage to finish the noodles without finishing the soup .

JAPANESE COMEDY IS NOT FUNNY
I can't get behind Japanese comedy .
God , I can hardly stand to be in front of it .
Advertisement
The majority of Japanese comedians are people who stand on a stage reciting one catch phrase over and over again .
Like , there was this guy who dressed up roughly as a player from the " Lion King " musical , stood on stage , and chanted like at the beginning of " The Circle of Life . "
He would occasionally stop , be awkwardly silent for a moment , and then start chanting again .
He was really popular for a while .
I mean , that was all he did .
He was n't given his fifteen minutes of fame because he was somehow more appealing or interesting than everyone else working in the field — it was simply his turn in line .
Another form of Japanese comedy involves two men standing on a stage simultaneously .
I do n't like this form of comedy .
I 've expressed my dislike for it to many people , including people trying to make it in the field of this very form of comedy .
I say the comedy is antiquated and Bob - Hope - like .
The comedians or ex-comedians to whom I express this opinion all sigh , say , " You know , man , I 'd love to get out there and do some edgy jokes , though that 's just not how it works here , man .
You have to play by the rules .
You would n't understand .
You 're not Japanese . "

One particular comedy routine I once witnessed involved two guys — a skinny guy and a fat guy .
They approached the old - fashioned microphones , stopped , bowed to the audience , and began :
Skinny Guy : Hello everyone !
Nice to meet you !
We are [ Dumb Name of Comedy Duo ] .
Fat Guy :
We 're very glad to be here .
SG : We hope you will enjoy being entertained by us , and my apologies in advance : my partner is kind of fat .
FG : Anyway , let 's get star — hey !
Did you just call me fat ?
SG : No , I did n't .
You must be hearing things .
FG : Oh , I 'm sorry .
Anyway , last night I was drinking beer — wait , are you SURE you did n't call me fat ?
SG : Oh no , I certainly did not .
FG : Oh , if you say so —
SG : You really ARE fat , though !
FG : Heyyyyyyy !!
Advertisement
Sudden stop .
Both : Goodnight everybody !
And that was it .
" Given a thirty - second slot in a revolving door of comedy duos at some little club , how would you challenge the rules of the comedy duo format ? "
I asked this guy , this one night , at this dinner - thing .
Advertisement
He paused .
He did n't stop pausing .
" What I mean is , what kind of comedy is it that you really would ' love ' to do ?
Give me a for example . "
Advertisement
" It 's . . . hard to just think of something off the top of my head . "
" Here 's one you can use — just come out and immediately say , ' So , I just want to confess , I have n't jerked off in four years .
Yeah , ever since that day my microwave malfunctioned , I can't reach my hand high enough over my head ! "
Advertisement
" I do n't get it .
Masturbation is a taboo topic , so , no . "
Here I could talk about how EVERY JAPANESE POP SONG IS ABOUT THE SAME THING , and how you really need to only know maybe six words — one of them " wasurenai " ( " [ I / he / she / it ] [ will not / does not ] forget " ) to get the basic idea of what they 're always saying .
Every song is about people meeting for the first time , about how they 'll never forget when they met for the first time , or how " because of you positive [ adjective ] " .
I could complain about this , though I find it easy enough to ignore , so it does n't bother me .
You might say I could ignore comedy by turning the TV off — not so .
You can't .
I keep my TV off religiously .
Japanese comedy finds a way out of the TV .
It seeps directly into normal people 's conversations .
You can't ride a train , sometimes , without being surrounded by catch - phrases .
I can't say for sure , though I reckon many Japanese men inherited certain speech idiosyncrasies by watching catch - phrase - oriented television programs .

It 's not just comedy .
Japan is land of the abundant " Famous For Being Famous " class of entertainers .
If Paris Hilton were Japanese , they 'd literally have her anchoring the fucking national news .
The most common TV show is a genreless , formless , gelatinous entertainment blog in which the Famous For Being Famous sit around a table and view video clips .
The video clips expand to fill our entire TV screens ; a picture - in - picture shows the faces of these Famous For Being Famous people as they react .
They say things like " SUGOOOOI " when something impressive happens .
They say " OMOSHIROOOOOI " when something is interesting .
They say " OISHISOU ! " when something looks delicious .
Men say " UMAI ! " immediately after taking a minuscule bite of food , sometimes before they even swallow , in this nasal voice , in a tone like they just ran up a flight of stairs .
It took me a while to really catch on to what this is .
A coworker prepared a new variety of cup ramen for lunch ; another co-worker looked at it and said " UMASOOOOOU " like he was on TV .
Dude took a bite of the ramen , slurping it loudly , like people do on TV , like you 're supposed to do it .
" UMAI ! " he yelled , before the heat of the boiling water could even vent out of his mouth .
Japanese television is a way of programming the mannerisms of tomorrow 's society and / or / by propagating the mannerisms of yesterday .
It scared the shit out of me .
Once I got back from the toilet , I thought about it some more , and realized that Japanese television is mostly something people put on in the background ; it 's wallpaper for conversations .
I know some people have some great conversations in Japan , usually with the TV off , though hanging out with those people did n't earn me financial stability , much less the right to continue to live in this country , so I had to stick with the people who need the TV to know how to react to a delicious meal .

JAPANESE MOVIES SUCK
Okay , " Ponyo " was one of the best films I 've ever seen in my life , though for the most part modern Japanese films kind of blow .
The film industry figures all they have to do is spend one yen more than their last mathematical success , and the world can keep on turning .
" Big budget " in the Japanese film industry usually means that shit was shot on Beta Cam .

In Hollywood , yes , it 's true that almost everything is a remake or a sequel .
In Japan , the shame is even thinner .
Last year there was a movie version of the manga " 20th Century Boys . "
The poster showed all of the actors in the film , each of them positioned in poses that mirrored poses their characters had assumed in particular memorable panels in the manga .
Only — get this — the poster also included the manga panels , so you could know exactly how much the actors looked like the characters in the manga .
Also , whenever there 's a popular book in Japan , they 'll make both a movie and a TV series out of it at the same time .
I do n't like this because it seems like , if they really think the story is so great , why do n't they pour all that time and effort into making , say , one really spectacular , world - class film out of it ?
Oh , because of the money .
Then there 's the issue of movie stars .
Without getting too heavy into specifics , let 's just say that the Japanese entertainment industry is like what would happen if , every single year , One Movie Studio released precisely three films each starring Batman , Superman , Spider - man , and Iron Man , with the same actor in the lead role of all of them .
Or , no , this is better — the Japanese entertainment industry is like what would happen if ABC , NBC , and CBS announced that they were replacing the hosts of all of their late - night talk shows with Regis Philbin , starting immediately .

THE PASSIVE AGGRESSION
It 's hard to find a garbage can in Tokyo .
That 's why the city is so clean — the people carry their garbage everywhere .
In addition to being a metaphor for the en-masse bottling - up of passive aggression in Tokyo , it 's also the truth .

Try sitting at the window on the second floor of the Starbucks at Hachiko crossing on a rainy day .
That 's the busiest pedestrian crossing — and the busiest Starbucks — in the world .
Watch people crossing the street with umbrellas .
Every once in a while , you 'll see someone just . . . slam their opened umbrella into someone else 's .
It 's pretty terrifying to see how often it happens .
Tokyo is the city that invented the transparent umbrella — that 's a plus , I guess — and it probably came about to help people walk without bumping into one another .
It does n't always work , of course .
Sometimes , someone bumps into someone , purely by accident .
Many times , the someone being bumped into has had a hard day of apologizing to his superiors six times an hour , perfunctorily , every time they come back into the office from a cigarette break .
The tension is building .
So , sometimes , this person who 's just been bumped on accident sharply and angrily bumps into someone else , on purpose .
The second person bumped in our little example is officially the victim of a violent outburst .
They wonder , " Why me ? "
Maybe this stirs up violent feelings in them .
Eventually , this escalates to a point where either someone gets punched in the throat or kicked in the nuts , or someone just goes home and drinks himself to a dreamless sleep and a morning hangover .

I used to think old men grunted at me on the train because they did n't like foreigners .
Maybe that 's not it .
Many of my Japanese rock - dude friends report being grunted at pretty often .
The one thing we all have in common is that we sometimes ride the train during nighttime rush hour , and we 're not wearing suits .
The old men do n't like people who are not in the same exact situation as themselves .
I get really ugly noises — teeth - sucking , lip - flicking , throaty grunts — every time I get on a train .
I guess I look like a bit of a flake .
They probably think I came over here on a mission to fornicate , or something .
It 's not me so much as it's all people younger than 80 .
The old people are the majority , and they do n't like us because we lack the drive they had .
Well , they 've done fucked up a whole lot of shit , financially speaking .
It 's terrifying to see so many dozens of seventy - something man , drunk , on a train , in a suit , on the way home at midnight on a Wednesday .
If I was thirty years old , and I put on a suit , and I 'm still wearing the suit at age seventy , and I still do n't have a car , or a chauffeur to drive me home when I 'm drunk , or at least money to pay for a taxi , man , I 'm taking that fuckin ' suit off .
The birth rate in Japan is plummeting , and something like 33 % of newlywed couples ask for two master bedrooms in their new homes .
People are n't having sex , and they 're not trying to set the world on fire financially , either .
The old people feel like the young people are giving up .
It 's a cliched kind of situation .

SHIT BE EXPENSIVE UP IN HERE
To exist in Tokyo is to stand in a packed rush - hour train with your nose pressed against hard against the back of the head of the black hole named " Supply And Demand . "
It costs like $ 25 to see a movie .
If you 're considering renting the entire first five seasons of " LOST " one episode at a time , you might want to also consider taking out a loan .
New CDs from popular average around $ 40 each .
If you want to go see a no - name band play at a bedroom - sized bar , it 's going to cost you around $ 40 .

You might wonder , " How is this happen ? "
Man , there are so many reasons .
Movie tickets are as expensive as they are because
1. Real estate is expensive
2. Approximately 60 million people live within an hour 's commute of Central Tokyo
3. Seats are limited in cinemas
4 . The price is fixed at pretty much the precise point at which movie tickets will sell out

CDs are so expensive because , ever since the earliest days of CDs , rental has been legal .
Every rental joint knows exactly what 's up : Back in the 80s , they sold blank cassette tapes .
Later , it was MDs , then CD - Rs. Now , everyone has an iPod.
iTunes can't even get a break over here :
When you can rent an entire CD for $ 4 and then rip it , why buy the songs for $ 2 each ?
Of course , the bands I like typically do n't have their CDs available for rent at the major chains .
That does n't stop them from charging professional prices .
If you want to like music over here , you need to be willing to surrender all of your disposable income .

Also , games tend to pretty much always cost $ 100 on their release dates here .
It 's getting fairly ridiculous .
Game rental generally does n't happen .
So most people who buy new games race through them lovelessly so they can sell them back to the local used shop before the buyback price drops .
I 'm sure the publishers have crunched the numbers a thousand times , and come up with some reason to justify not lowering the initial price of a typical game .
I researched this topic a couple years back , and one of the recurring theories was that game publishers know that used shops exist , and they would n't like to cannibalize their businesses by ultimately producing fewer used games .
Recently , some retailer in , uhh , New Zealand , was it ?
They said they refused to carry the PSPGo .
The reason was obvious : digital games will be everything sooner or later .
They 'd be out of work .
At least they had the guts to say something public about it .
In Japan , everyone just keeps their hands under the table .

NO SUBJECTIVITY
Maybe this is the reason games and movies suck : Barely no one in the media ever says anything subjective about anything .
When a mild celebrity says a food item " LOOKS DELICIOUS !! " their tone is so rehearsed and sterile that it might as well be a statement of fact .
The magazine publishers and content providers are such a close - knit group that they silently agree to say only positive things .
This is why Weekly Famitsu — a game magazine — is noteworthy .
They actually have some semblance of subjectivity in their weekly reviews section .
However low the numerical scores may be , however , the reviewers seldom say anything negative .
And though Famitsu 's reviews consist of four viewpoints , the fans are prone to more or less always consider the score as a total out of forty rather than four scores on a scale of one to ten .
And it 's hard to find any other critical voices in Japan .
No one wants to hurt anyone else 's money .
PR is thoroughly integrated into every aspect of business that

I 'M ALMOST FINISHED
I only have a few more things I want to say before I conclude this .
I should just write off a few of my frustrations as quickly as possible , or else we 'll be here all day tomorrow as well :
EVERYTHING MOVES
Every damn store I ever go to always moves every single item from one side of the store to the other every three months .
They never have a reason for doing this .
I think they just want to find an excuse to keep the employees after hours , screaming in a circle to psych themselves up for the act of moving shelves and stock .
I went into my favorite local used book store the other day , and could n't find anything .
They had a big sign out front : " We 've moved everything in the store !
Come in and take a look ! "
Uh , okay .
American supermarkets will sometimes advertise a gallon of milk for $ .99 .
The milk is always in the refrigerated section , in the back of the store .
So you might go in there just to get milk , and end up getting a bunch of stuff you did n't know you wanted .
This works , because groceries are very impulse - friendly .
Moving everything in a major electronics retail store , however , just feels tacky .
Do you seriously expect me to get lost on my way to find DVD - Rs and suddenly go , " Oh man , I should get this MacBook Pro — and this 57 - inch LED HDTV " ?
Advertisement
At one office where I worked for a while , they actually hired a guy from an efficiency expert firm to sit in the office for a week and analyze where the staff should sit .
Anyway , they consulted the same firm every other month .
They must have moved the coffee machine like twenty - four times in one year .
STOP APOLOGIZING TO ME
So yesterday , at my favorite used book store : a guy held a mouthpiece and spoke over the PA , repeating the same message for the duration of my perplexed wandering : " DEAR HONORABLE CUSTOMERS : THERE IS NO EXCUSE : IT IS WITH GRAVE FEAR IN OUR HEARTS THAT WE APOLOGIZE SINCERELY FOR MOVING EVERYTHING IN THE STORE .
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS , PLEASE ASK THE NEAREST EMPLOYEE . "
It 's like , man — " really good at apologizing " is a shitty thing to write on a culture 's resume .
Why not try avoiding the situations where you 'd normally have to apologize ?
Advertisement
I once worked at a company where " I 'm deeply sorry for not picking up the phone sooner ! " was the required telephone greeting .
We were coached in orientation to use a neighbor 's phone to call our own desk phone to learn the exact length of one ring , so that we could practice the timing of picking up the phone partway through its first ring — not soon enough to freak out the person on the other end .
TEMPLATE CONVERSATIONS
CREEP ME OUT
I swear , at every party I 've ever been to in Japan , this exact conversation has occurred , word for word :
" Ahh !
Beer ! "
" This beer is delicious ! "
" Yes !
This beer is delicious ! "
" There 's nothing quite so delicious as a cold beer after a hard day of work ! "
You know those trees in " Lord of the Rings " , where they have to sit in a circle for an hour making low sounds just to say " hello " to one another ?
That 's what this is like .
Advertisement
" I'M SORRY , IT DOESN'T HAVE VERY MUCH STUFF IN IT "
I used to go to this restaurant with a really delicious pepperoncini pasta .
It 's a pretty simple kind of pasta — just oil , garlic , and peppers .
Every single time I would order the pasta , the waitress would utter , in the same practiced tone : " I 'm sorry — it does n't have very much stuff in it " .
Advertisement
Eventually , I went there one day , and the pasta had shredded octopus tentacles and bacon in it .
I never went there again . :-/
THE " DRINK TICKET " SYSTEM
When you go see a live musical performance , the venues always force you to pay at least 500 yen for a " drink ticket . "
They do this even if you 're on the guest list !
It 's weird .
The idea is that the venues are not primarily places people go to listen to music : they are places owned by people who want to make money from bands who want a place to play a show .
Bands put out a bunch of money to rent the place out for the night .
The bands divide up the ticket sales .
The venue gets to keep the money from the drink sales .
To encourage people to drink , they literally force you to purchase a " ticket " for a drink prior to entering the club .
If you do n't purchase the drink ticket , they wo n't let you in .
I would know ; I 've tried it .
You know , in any country aside from Japan , 500 yen is about what you 'd pay for cover at a dive bar .

TAPE
If I buy a drink at a convenience store and say I do n't want a bag , they insist on putting a little piece of tape over the barcode .
Most of the time , they put it on sideways , instead of vertically — you know , the way that would prevent the barcode from being scanned by a rogue scanner .
They do this so you can prove that you paid for the drink , should you roll into another convenient store glugging away .
For some reason , the longer I live in Tokyo , the more this really shits me off .
I do n't know why !
I like to take the tape off , stick it to my receipt , and then drop it into the little trash can by the register .

WEIRD RESERVATION RULES
I wanted to write a story for Kotaku.com ( this website right here ) about what it was like to go visit the Dragon Quest IX - themed " Luida 's Bar " in Roppongi .
I could n't do this , though , because , despite their having nine empty tables , my friend and I were n't allowed in !
You know why ?
Because we had failed to reserve our table twenty - four hours in advance .
Actually , we would have needed to make reservations more than twenty - four hours in advance :
We could only reserve a spot between eight or nine PM on Wednesday between twelve and four on Tuesday .
Dragon - Quest - themed bars in Roppongi are n't the only places to do this .
It 's a thing insecure Tokyo business owners do when they are afraid of their place being empty at peak hours .
When you think about it , it makes some kind of marketing sense .
People unable to get in are then forced to think really hard about getting in next time .
In Tokyo , when consumers start thinking really hard , they end up spending more money :
In the case of the Dragon Quest bar , that means they would buy more drinks .
Do n't ask me to prove this , because it will extend this already bloated chunk of pseudo - prose by another six thousand words .

Then there are things like how Dominos Pizza , should you register for their web - based pizza ordering service , will send you digital coupons .
The coupons expire in two weeks .
If you do n't use the coupon , it will never disappear from your " Coupon Inbox " .
If you do use the coupon , it does disappear .
This is interesting because , sometimes , you 'll be looking at your coupon box , and go , " Man , I could have saved like fifteen percent on like six pizzas !
If only I ate more pizza ! "
This epiphany is about as richly cathartic as any big story reveal or any any battle - system - related " Aha " in any Japanese RPG .
A tenuous video - game connection I can think of off the top of my head is when Eiji Aonuma told an interviewer that Zelda fans are so faithful because puzzles in Zelda games make the player " feel smart . "
On the one hand , maybe making consumers feel smart , or at least thoughtful , makes them end up spending more money somewhere down the line .
On the other hand , I did n't get to enter the Dragon Quest bar , and that sucked .

POSITIVE NEGATIVES
Again , this is a language issue , though again , I am going to presume that it accounts for a decent amount of passive aggression .
I can't possibly be the only person who is creeped out by this stuff :
There is a whole verb in Japanese which , when appended to the stem form of any other verb , allows you to express the opposite of that verb without having to use its negative form .
Advertisement
Maybe that description did n't make much sense .
It 's like , append the positive form of this verb to the end of the stem of the verb in the sentence " It 's possible to do that " , and you can make the sentence mean " It 's not possible to do that . "
Though since verbs end the sentences in Japan , it 's more like " Yes , we can do that for you — NOTTTTTT . "
I mean , how is that " polite " ?
How is that the way to deal with people in business ?
Do people feel really great whenever they use that in a professional conversation ?
Do they feel like they just scored a four - hit combo in Street Fighter IV ?
EVERYONE'S UNCLE
There 's a distinct personality type existing all over Japan .
I call it " Everyone 's Uncle " .
Eventually , a guy just barely outgrows the " Big Brother " personality type , and suddenly becomes like everyone in the room 's uncle .
This is the guy who Do n't Do Shit at the office usually .
When there 's a party , he 'll be the guy who immediately grabs the menu , counts up the number of people at the table , asks for a show of hands , says " Who is NOT drinking beer ? "
He 'll bark to the waitress how many beers we need , and bring us some of this fried chicken cartilage and these potato things , and some edamame beans , and some salad , and some pickles , too .
Man , I hate this kind of guy .
As long as the boss sees him going and getting at the party , this guy is not going to lose his job anytime soon .
In fact , he 's going to get promoted , and he 's going to be telling you what to do , and he 's going to be pulling figures off the internet , and going , " Oh , it looks like this game called Halo 3 has twenty - seven guns in it .
Our game only has , what , four ?
We need to step it up ! "
And you say , " Well , Halo 3 was made by a team of like six hundred people .
We 've got , uhh , about sixteen people . "
And then he pumps his fist and says , " We 're just gonna hafta work overtime ! "
No we 're not , asshole .

THE EMOTION GESTAPO
In an earlier column ( " Stop Telling Me What To Do " ) , I talked about a system of loudspeakers set up in my neighborhood , blaring advertisements for local businesses .
The voice of these advertisements is an old woman who sounds like she got lost on the walk home from the supermarket .
The speakers are illegally placed ; the businesses advertising on the service have never met a representative of the advertising service .
They only receive phone calls , once a month , with bank transfer information .
The account changes sometimes .
The police wo n't touch the advertisements , because the situation sounds like the yakuza are involved .
So the people of my town live in fear and annoyance .

Read more
This bothers me , sure , though what also bothers me is when , on a weekday afternoon , I 'm walking on a quaint little street in another town , and the loudspeakers are blaring classical music .
Like , " Here you go !
Listen to this music !
This is how you should feel right now ! "
Life is n't a television drama , or a movie , or a video game , man .
It 's real life .
That 's why they call it real life !

THE STEREOTYPING
My gym refuses entry / membership to anyone with a tattoo .
This means my drummer can't work out in my gym with me .
The reason for the tattoo hatred is , so the urban legend goes , to keep the yakuza out of the gym / bathing area .
Well , what about a white guy with a tattoo ?
He 's obviously not in the yakuza .
It sounds more like stereotyping in that context — that a " nice , " " good " person would n't have a tattoo .
Advertisement
So , why do they let so many clearly insane - looking octogenarians into the gym ?
We have one guy who looks like Mister Magoo .
He gets on the chest press machine , puts it down on the lowest weight — five kilograms — puts his hands on the handlebars , and screeeeeeams like he 's taking a dump on a planet of extreme gravity .
The weird thing is , he 's not even trying to lift the weight .
It does n't even move .
Oh , and then , there 's the creepy SOB who wears a track suit , holds two one - kilogram weights at shoulder - level , stands in the middle of the free weights area , and shakes his hands almost like he 's miming running up a flight of stairs .
In a voice just above a casual conversation , he counts his " reps " — from " one " to well past a thousand .
Then there 's the really old guy who gets the lightest possible resistance band , wraps it around the side of the squat rack , through the Smith press , and over the bench press , effectively commandeering half of the free weight area ; he holds it in place , and screams .
I think , in general , the Japanese seem to be comfortable stereotyping and being stereotyped .
High school students wear uniforms .
Everyone knows who they are and what they are up to .
In college , people are confused , because they do n't have uniforms .
They graduate and immediately find an excuse to wear a suit , even to companies with no dress code , so that everyone on the train might know where they stand in their life .
They hit eighty , join my gym , and start screaming .
That , or they go play pachinko .
I suppose that somewhat unceremoniously brings us to what might be the main point of all this :
I DON'T LIKE PACHINKO
I do n't like pachinko .
I had never played it until just last year , actually .
It 's a pretty idiotic capsule form of the entire Japanese entertainment industry .
There 's this " Neon Genesis Evangelion " pachinko machine , based on the popular animated series from over ten years ago .
There 's a TV screen in the middle of all pachinko machines , these days .
It plays video clips which , somehow , relate to the player which pegs or mechanisms have moved , so he knows how much strength to apply to rotating the cylindrical controller , with how much pressure to expel the little steel balls .
As far as game design goes , it 's not that incredible , because the video clips on the display screen really have absolutely nothing to do with anything aside from the animated series from which they 've been extracted .
Nothing about any one particular video clip deliberately says " Now the little flap on the right side is going to open . "
Advertisement
Pachinko machines were originally strictly for amusement .
Eventually , they turned into gambling devices .
So the ultimate reward for playing pachinko is money .
Some people are good enough at pachinko to not even need a job .
Most people are n't .
Two blocks down , the street I live on runs into a highway .
On the other side of the highway , visible from my living room window , stands a large pachinko parlor .
Every time the automatic doors open as a customer enters or leaves , if one of the windows in my home is open , I can hear the dense Eurobeat emanating out .
The volume is so atrociously high that it reaches even as far as my bedroom , late at night .
Advertisement
Last year , a half - dozen shops in the covered shopping street between my house and JR Koenji Station shut down all at once .
A big tarp went up where the shops used to be .
A month later , it was one huge pachinko parlor .
I walk by that pachinko parlor every time I go to JR Koenji Station .
It 's so huge , and loud , right there in the middle of my trendy street .
I look inside , at all the old people .
After my grandfather died , my grandmother set about spending as much of his money as quickly as possible .
She took cruises around the world .
Good for her .
What are these old people in these pachinko parlors doing ?
The generation gap between these people and my grandmother — between cruises around the world and zombification within a pachinko parlor — is only a decade and a half , at the most .
I look at these people , and I think , where in the hell are we going ?
A friend in real estate once told me that no building ever turned into a pachinko parlor or a love hotel will ever see life as anything else .
As brick - and - mortar game stores , for example disappear , as everyone starts ordering all their clothing online , will this turn completely into a city of pachinko parlors and love hotels ?
Math , and fucking , as it were ?
Is that what it is ?
Two people have sex ; ninety years later , you 're breathing nicotine and just trying to spend everything as effortlessly as possible before you die .

CAN VIDEOGAMES MAKE US BETTER PEOPLE ?
Stephen Totilo can corroborate when I say that I had originally planned to call this month 's column " Can Videogames Make Us Better People ? "
[ Note From Stephen : Tim speaks the truth . ]
Then , I saw this presentation from this year 's DICE conference .
There 's a lot of brain - hacking going on in there .
In that talk , Carnegie - Mellon University professor Jesse Schell envisions a future in which everything is game - designed .
Sooner or later , everyone is going to be connected on a service that tracks everything , Unlocking Achievements in all forms of art and entertainment , every game they play or book they read logged meticulously for future generations to see .
Schell says we might read a new " Star Trek " book , and then be told we 've just Unlocked the Achievement of having read 500 books , and we might feel dumb that this is our 500th book .
Maybe , if we know that so much of us will remain behind for other generations to inspect , we 'll try being better people .

I was going to say something along the same lines , though probably with a lot more words .
I was going to say that I 've noticed little trends in the design of Japanese games and / or game - console software .
Animal Crossing and Brain Training were extremely popular , money - making software products , though both of them had feet planted in The Real .
Animal Crossing is more or less a game about communication , in which your only rewards come from doing good deeds .
Brain Training is a tool to keep your mind active .
These products were so successful that the certifiable geniuses at Nintendo considered , developed , released , and then reaped the benefits of such products as " My Finance Diary " and Tomodachi Collection .
The latter is like Animal Crossing , only the characters are humans — Nintendo Wii Miis , actually — and thus maybe easier to relate to .
The former is just a simple kind of productivity software , which you can use to keep track of how much money you spend , and on what .
You can input your salary and bank account balance and all that .
You can set up a budget plan and it'll tell you how much money you should spend per day .
It 's nothing an iPhone application could n't do , though it was monstrously popular .
Maybe it was popular because it was so well - designed .
The sounds were pleasing , the friction of the pen on the DS screen felt just right ( I 've " played " a friend 's copy ) .
In his presentation , Schell mentions a little tree - shaped virtual - pet - kind - of thing on the dashboard of the Toyota Prius .
It grows as you save money on gas .
It 's not much of a " game . "
Though there it is .
When is something like Nintendo's " Finance Diary " going to be implemented into ATMs ?
Well , cash will near - completely fade away , at some point in the future .
In Japan , they 've had these microchip - equipped cards for a decade .
You charge them up at terminals in the stations .
It used to be you could just use them to ride the train .
You might have similar cards in your city elsewhere in the world .
Though man , in Tokyo , you can use them for so much : vending machines , supermarkets , whatever .
Sooner or later , you 'll be able to use them everywhere .
It 's a great system .
I 'm sure if they developed easy retinal scan technology , the Japanese would slap a cute - looking eyeball mascot on the advertisements and people would be lined up to volunteer their information for the system .
I 'm pretty sure the " Minority Report " future will emerge well before I 'm old enough to play pachinko .
Will Japan evolve because of this , or will it only continue its deepening spiral into the realm of my disinterest ?

Thanks to several recent developments in my life , I 've realized that life is really just a game , and that I 'm so dissatisfied with games ( like Final Fantasy XIII ) lately , because I am approaching them as games within a game .
I have a " habit " of applying the " rules " of the game of life to the things I do for " fun . "
I might have mentioned before : I never believed in Santa Claus , et cetera .
I have a " problem " stepping completely away from reality .
What I 've realized , recently , is that the skeleton of rules of the " game " of " life " is just too visible here in Japan , where multiple perfunctory sentences are required to start any conversation , where you can use a certain positive verb to soften the preconceived impact of a negative verb form , where you can prove mathematically that you are a good person by drinking alongside everyone else , by being the last to go home every day , by ritualistically screaming in the middle of the street after a company party .
Oh no !
You messed up today !
The company lost money .
BONUS ROUND : At least you get the opportunity to apologize to the boss .
People who can apologize well are respected !
Be sure to apologize every time you pick up the phone !
Miss one , and you 'll lose points !
Your score in this game is represented by the balance of your bank account .
When you reach the goal , you have earned the right to play a game with much simpler rules .

Man , life is like the world 's most boring MMORPG .

Maybe I 'm just in the wrong country for over - thinking .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Freshman Democratic Representative Eric Massa announced his resignation on Friday , saying an ethics investigation into alleged misconduct toward a male staff member would tear his family and staff apart .
" In the incredibly toxic atmosphere that is Washington D.C. , with the destruction of our elected leaders having become a blood sport , especially in talk radio and on the Internet , there is also no doubt that an ethics investigation would tear my family and my staff apart , " the New York lawmaker said in a note posted on the Internet , massa.house.gov / .
His resignation is effective on Monday at 5 p.m. , he said .
Massa was the second Democrat in a week to be hit by damaging ethics questions , and his departure is a further embarrassment for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who had pledged to create “ the most honest , most open and most ethical Congress in history . ”
Republicans have ridiculed Pelosi over this week ’s ethics revelations , saying the behavior of Democrats had made a mockery of her promise to clean up Congress .
Massa announced earlier this week that he would not seek re-election because of health reasons .
News reports said he was under an ethics investigation for alleged sexual harassment against a male staffer .
“ My difficulties are of my own making , ” he wrote .
“ I am also aware that blogs and radio will have a field day with this in today ’s destructive and unforgiving political environment . ”
Massa ’s problems follow an ethics probe of fellow New York Representative Charles Rangel , who was admonished by the House ethics panel for taking corporate - paid trips to the Caribbean in violation of the chamber ’s gift rules .
Rangel gave up his chairmanship of the powerful tax - writing Ways and Means Committee this week pending other ethics investigations .
Massa ’s departure brings the number of Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to 253 , with 178 Republicans .
His departure is not likely to have a big impact on Pelosi ’s ability to round up votes to get a final healthcare overhaul bill to President Barack Obama .
Massa voted against the bill that passed the House in November in a close vote .
Four vacancies bring the number of House members to 431 , which means 216 votes will be needed to pass the sweeping healthcare overhaul .

As I wrote yesterday , Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox , also a Republican candidate for governor , has joined in a lawsuit with 12 other state Attorneys General that contends the health insurance reform LAW is unconstitutional .
This has made Governor Michigan Jennifer Granholm very unhappy .
So , in her capacity as governor , she has directed Cox to intervene on behalf of the state against the lawsuit he himself signed on to .
This is beautiful .
H/T wizardkitten at Blogging for Michigan .
Here ’s are some excerpts from Governor Granholm ’s letter to Attorney General Cox ( pdf ) which is a very entertaining read :
Your statutory authority does not , however , override the superior constitutional authority vested in the Governor to determine the position to be taken by the executive branch of the state government and certainly does not authorize you , as Attorney General , to unilaterally , and without consultation , to determine and declare the policy position of the state of Michigan .
Accordingly , pursuant to the constitutional authority vested in me as Governor , and the statutory duty imposed upon you by MCL 14.28 , I am directing you to intervene in the Florida litigation on behalf of the Governor , the state of Michigan , and the Michigan Department of Community Health to uphold the recently enacted federal health care legislation and to protect and preserve the important protections afforded our state and its citizens by the new law . ”
“ I certainly do not question your authority or even your obligation when specifically authorized under MCL 14.28 to intervene in litigation in your capacity as Attorney General and to vigorously advocate those positions you believe are most consistent with the constitution and laws of this state .
OH , SNAP !!!
So , basically , Cox , in a transparent effort to bolster his gubernatorial bid by appealing to those who are angry about the new health insurance reform LAW , has signed on to a Quixotic lawsuit that has no chance of going anywhere on behalf of the state of Michigan and the governor has directed him to intervene against that very same lawsuit on behalf of the state of Michigan .

Digg it , baby !
Tens of thousands of striking Greek workers took to the streets today , some throwing stones at police , in a defiant show of protest against austerity measures aimed at averting the debt - plagued country 's economic collapse .
Riot police responded with teargas when , in sporadic bursts , masked youths charged them in Athens city centre .
The violence coincided with a general strike that shut down public services and closed off Greece to the outside world .
For trade unions the mass show of force was a warning shot to a government struggling to satisfy its eurozone partners with policies deemed vital for the nation 's fiscal health while appeasing angry workers at home .
" This is the red line , " said Nikos Goulas , head of a union that represents 20,000 workers at Athens international airport .
" Greece is not Ireland .
If the government does not back down there will be huge unrest , " he added , holding a banner that proclaimed : " As much as you terrorise us , these measures wo n't pass . "
The protests came against a backdrop of mounting Greek hostility towards the EU , with particular venom reserved for Germany , which has pressed for harder measures to be forced on Athens .
Greece 's political elite has been outraged and hurt by hard - hitting German media coverage of the debt crisis .
The cover of a German magazine , Focus , which showed the Venus de Milo making a less than complimentary finger gesture under the headline " Swindlers in the eurozone " has triggered widespread fury .
In an extraordinary tirade , the deputy prime minister , Theodore Pangalos , said Germany had no right to judge Greek finances after wreaking havoc on the economy during the four years that the country was under Nazi occupation in the second world war .
Worse still , he said , Germany had failed to make adequate compensation .
" They took away the Greek gold that was at the Bank of Greece , they took away the Greek money and they never gave it back .
This is an issue that has to be faced sometime , " he told the BBC .
" I do n't think they have to give back the money necessarily but they have at least to say thanks .
And they should n't complain so much about stealing and not being very specific about economic dealings . "
Pangalos , a former foreign minister who is widely seen as a father figure to the more mild - mannered Greek prime minister George Papandreou , said Greek public finances might never have reached such dire straits had the EU not had such weak leadership .
Italy , he added , had done much more to mask the true extent of its public debt and deficit than Greece when it entered the EU .
" The quality of leadership in the union is very , very poor indeed , " he said .
today , as the diplomatic row intensified amid growing demands that George Papandreou 's Socialist government step up claims for war reparations , Berlin hit back with a tart reminder that Greece had received 115 m deutschmarks in compensation by 1960 .
" I must reject these accusations , " said Andreas Peschke , a spokesman at the German foreign ministry .
Greece , he said , had also received around € 33bn in aid from Germany " both bilaterally and in the context of the EU " .
" A discussion about the past is not helpful to solve the problems … facing us in Europe today . "
Athens has barely three weeks to prove to its EU partners that the spending cuts and tax rises it has announced are working .
With the euro severely undermined by the country 's debt crisis , the government has announced an ambitious cost - cutting programme to reduce the public deficit from 12.7 % of GDP to just under the permissible EU level of 3 % by 2012 .
This week , as an EU monitoring team visited Athens to examine the progress being made , finance minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou hinted at further measures , saying the government " will do whatever is needed " to solve the crisis .
But if Greek workers have their way such targets may be out of reach .
For low - and middle - income earners , the policies , which include a public sector wage freeze , a rise in pensionable age and higher taxes , will be particularly painful .
" I already have to make do with € 345 a month , " said Kostantinos Doganis , a pensioner participating in the strike , the first mass walkout in Greece since the Socialists assumed power last October .
" These measures have not yet been passed .
Once we start to feel their effect in our pockets there will be a downpour of protests , a social explosion in this country . "
Wonderful !
I laughed like hell at this !

Here 's a neat dolphin trick that does n't involve jumping through hoops .
While dolphins sleep overnight ( with half their brains and one eye at a time ) , they begin to show signs of the kind of insulin resistance that marks type 2 diabetes in humans .
But when they wake up and have their breakfast , they switch back to their normal state .
A research team led by Stephanie Venn - Watson announced the findings at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Diego , and said that dolphins ' apparent ability to switch insulin resistance on and off could lead to better understanding of the disease in humans .
Insulin helps people control their levels of blood sugar , and the resistance to it inherent in type 2 diabetes means those levels can get way too high .
The dolphins , though , switch on this temporary insulin resistance to their advantage , boosting blood sugar levels overnight .
" Bottlenose dolphins have large brains that need sugar , " Dr Venn - Watson explained .
Since their diet is very low in sugar , " it works to their advantage to have a condition that keeps blood sugar in the body … to keep the brain well fed " [ BBC News ]
.
However , while dolphins can turn this resistance off once they start their day and revert to a normal state , they can have metabolic problems similar to diabetes , too .
For 21 weeks , Venn - Watson and her colleagues measured insulin levels in six dolphins two hours after the animals ate .
One dolphin that had especially high insulin levels compared to others , also had a 10 - year history of iron overload , or hemochromatosis .
Iron overload is associated with type 2 diabetes in people , Venn - Watson noted [ Science News ]
.
No other animal has symptoms relating to diabetes so similar to humans , and the connection between the two species is probably our big , glucose - demanding brains .
So , Venn - Watson says , studying them could help researchers figure out how to confront insulin resistance in humans :
" There is no desire to make a dolphin a lab animal , but what we can do is compare their genes with human genes and look for evidence of a genetic switch " [ The Guardian ]

BEIJING 
The discovery has punched a 170 - ton hole in China 's promises to overhaul its food safety system .
Officials say they 've found yet another case where large amounts of tainted milk powder from the country 's 2008 scandal that should have been destroyed were instead repackaged .
China ordered tens of thousands of milk products laced with an industrial chemical burned or buried after more than 300,000 children were sickened and at least six died from the contamination .
But , crucially , the government did not carry out the eradication itself , and this month an emergency crackdown has made it clear that tons of compromised products are still on the market .
Tainted dairy has recently been found in China 's largest city , Shanghai , and in the provinces of Shaanxi , Shandong , Liaoning , Guizhou , Jilin and Hebei .
At least five companies are suspected of reselling tainted products that should have been destroyed , the Health Ministry said last week .
The problem products uncovered in the 10 - day emergency crackdown have so far been limited to the domestic market .
The campaign is set to end Wednesday , and it's not clear whether it will be extended .
The country 's biggest holiday , the Lunar New Year , starts this weekend , and already some offices are closing and millions of people are going on vacation .
The Health Ministry has not commented since the crackdown began , and the China Dairy Association has remained quiet as well .
" The problem is , this is a product with a shelf life of several years .
It 's very important that the product is not left unattended , " said Dr. Peter Ben Embarek , a WHO senior scientist on food safety based in Beijing .
" There 's always a risk it will find a way back into the system . "
The latest discovery underscores the difficulties of policing China 's smaller food producers , despite a sweeping new food safety law that took effect last summer and promised stricter quality controls after the 2008 scandal , which was China 's worst food safety crisis in years .
In the wake of that crisis , China punished dozens of officials , dairy executives and farmers , even executing a dairy farmer and a milk salesman .
But the government did n't destroy seized products itself .
Instead , it issued guidelines on how to destroy them , suggesting they be burned in large - capacity incinerators or that small amounts be buried in landfills .
In the southern city of Guangzhou , however , the local government did take over disposal after one garbage company poured tainted milk into a city river .
China 's new food safety law places even more responsibility on food producers to ensure their products are safe , including introducing tough new penalties for makers of unsafe products .
On Monday , with the announcement that more products contaminated by the industrial chemical melmine had been found , it appeared the new regulations had failed again .
Officials issued a recall for more than 170 tons of milk powder tainted by the industrial chemical melamine and closed two dairy companies in the northern region of Ningxia , the China Daily newspaper reported .
The report said officials have already seized 72 tons of the powder but were still looking for the rest , which had been sold by the Ningxia Tiantian Dairy Co. to five factories in the neighboring region of Inner Mongolia and the bustling southern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian .
The report said the tainted powder should have been destroyed in the 2008 scandal , but that an unnamed company gave it to Ningxia Tiantian as a debt payment .
Zhao Shuming , secretary - general of the Ningxia Dairy Industry Association , told the China Daily that said Ningxia Tiantian appears to have been unaware the product contained melamine but should have known that the repackaging itself , which usually involves changing production and sell - by dates , was illegal .
Zhao told the paper that many small dairies , including Ningxia Tiantian , do n't have the technology to even test for melamine .
When watered - down milk is laced with the chemical , it appears to still be rich in protein in quality tests that measure nitrogen , found in both the melamine and protein .
" Flaws in the previous system led to the current chaos .
What if companies with tainted milk also hold back their stocks for this round of checkups and reuse them later , just like what 's happening now ? " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
Zhao spoke more carefully Monday , telling the AP , " We have strict checks , and our client companies have strict checks , too . "
Ningxia Tiantian has been shut down , and a second company , Ningxia Panda Dairy Co. , was also ordered closed because of ties to a Shanghai dairy found with tainted goods last year , the report said .
Online Chinese chat rooms were buzzing Monday over the latest tainted milk finding , with many asking " Why are these things happening again ? "
But a large - scale drop in consumer confidence that happened in the 2008 scandal is n't likely this time , said Cindy Yang , a dairy analyst for the Netherlands - based Rabobank Group in Shanghai .
" These companies are quite small ones , " she said Monday , adding that China 's largest dairies put stricter safety measures in place after feeling the bite of bad publicity — and raised prices 20 to 30 % to pay for the better quality .
" You can't say that because of these cases , there 's no trust in the whole market , " she said .

Oracle Cuts Affect GNOME Accessibility Work
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 08 , 2010
Sun used to boast that it was one of the largest contributors to open source .
That 's being demonstrated now that Oracle has acquired the company .
Oracle 's acquisition of Sun , and subsequent layoffs , are having ripple effects on the open source community .
The cuts are also hitting the GNOME accessibility ( a11y ) team and leading the project to think about the future of a 11y efforts in GNOME .
Last week Oracle laid off two members of Sun's Accessibility Program Office ( APO ) , including GNOME a11y team lead , Willie Walker .
Joanmarie Diggs , who works with the team contributing to GNOME 's Orca screen reader , says that as a result of the layoffs that " the accessibility of the GNOME desktop will become the open source equivalent of an unfunded mandate , doomed ultimately to fail , " if Oracle does n't reverse its position or if another company does n't step up to help .
It 's tempting to point a finger at Oracle alone here , but this just shows that all too few companies are sponsoring a 11y work .
If one company laying off a couple of developers spells trouble for the project , then there were problems before that happened .
It is disappointing to see Oracle making cuts in a 11y support , but Oracle should n't have sole responsibility for a 11y in GNOME either .
Other vendors have a strong interest in supporting GNOME 's a 11y efforts .
Mozilla recently made a second donation to the GNOME Foundation to support accessibility , but the overall support for GNOME a11y does n't look very robust .
This may be because a 11y is typically not a problem most users think about .
Users who do n't need assistive technologies do n't think about the need for assistive technologies .
Developers who do n't need assistive technologies often need to be reminded to think about a 11y in their applications , whether or not they 're working directly on things like Orca .
In addition to showing how fragile support is for a 11y work among sponsor companies , it also demonstrates the need for expanding a 11y awareness throughout projects .
Walker writes on the GNOME list that he'd like to " work hard to put myself out of at least one facet of my job : "
What I mean is that we need to embrace accessible design , development , and testing as a complete community , much as we do for internationalization .
So , whereas not everyone needs to be developing assistive technology , everyone needs to be developing for accessibility .
If we can accomplish that , the overall cost of accessibility goes way down and the quality goes way up .
This has been done before , on other technologies .
The GNOME internationalization efforts have been very successful in addressing internationalization throughout the project .
If the same attention was given to a11y , it would n't require so much work now .
Users can rest easy that Walker 's work will continue on GNOME 2.30 , but there 's a lot of work to do on the GNOME 3.0 a 11y roadmap .
Walker points out that the immediate goals for GNOME 3.0 are not staffed appropriately at this time , and they that may need to be re-scoped if another company does n't step up to help fund the work .
Let 's hope that a solution is found , otherwise putting Linux on the mainstream desktop is going to be much , much harder .
Shepherd Book , possibly the most mysterious character on Joss Whedon 's ill - fated space - western Firefly is to star in in a comic book that will finally let us in on his past .
A character with a mysterious past is hardly a new idea for Joss Whedon , by Firefly 's Shepherd Book was a particularly good one .
Played by Ron Glass , the Shepherd - the term used for men of the cloth on the show - clearly had not been a God 's servant all his life , and some pretty high - level connections with the Alliance .
What made the mystery extra-potent however was that the show got cancelled , and we never got to find out what his mysterious past actually was .
All that is about to change though , as a new comic book , entitled The Shepherd 's Tale , is coming out that will finally cast some light on the preacher 's colorful life .
The book is written by Zack Whedon , and based on a detailed scene - by - scene outline from brother Joss .
Zack Whedon said about the book : " You will see Book 's full trajectory ...
How he became the man he was in the show and who he was previous to that .
It takes you deep into his past .
You really get to see the entire evolution of this man ...
Book specifically is a great character to do the origin of because we know so little about it in the show , the little hints that we get are so enticing and his history is very ... complicated .
It 's an intricate set of circumstances that created the man we meet in the show so that is very fun to explore . "
The Shepherd 's Tale comes out in November , as a hardcover graphic novel .

Out of the labs , into the pubs
By Owen Duffy
Step Up , BBC Scotland
Science and critical thinking can be seen as exclusive and elitist .
But now a new group is aiming to bring scepticism to the masses across Scotland .
The Glasgow Skeptics hold monthly meetings in a city centre pub
The audience sits attentively , absorbing every word .
The speaker , a visiting doctor of particle physics , is discussing the effects of libel laws on science publishing .
But this is n't a university lecture hall or a scientific institution - it's a crowded pub on a Tuesday night in Glasgow city centre .
The organisers of Glasgow Skeptics in the Pub have been arranging monthly meetings since November last year .
Each event features a guest speaker addressing issues related to science , rationalism and critical thinking .
Organiser Ian Scott said the events were becoming increasingly popular .
" When we first started we only had a handful of people , but the group has been growing , " he said .
" Lately it seems as though we 're getting about 20 new people each month . "
Fed up
The crowd is diverse .
Ages range from the late teens to mid-50s .
Of the 65 or so people in attendance , roughly a quarter are female .
They have come to listen to Dr Simon Singh , whose book Trick or Treatment examines the efficacy of various forms of complementary and alternative medicine .
" The people we see here tonight are fed up with a growing irrationality which has existed over the last decade , whether that 's creationism or things like homeopathy , " he said .
" They 've looked to politicians and learned societies to act , and unfortunately I do n't think they have .
" So now these young people have started saying - ' well we 're going to speak up , we 're fed up with these outrageous claims ' . "
Simon Singh spoke at a recent Glasgow Skeptics in the Pub meeting Dr Singh has become something of a figurehead for this new , outspoken sceptical movement .
In 2008 he was sued by the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) over an article in a national newspaper in which he accused the organisation of " happily promot[ing ] bogus treatments " .
Groups including Sense About Science and Index on Censorship said the case showed the impact that libel law could have on science writers and have called for legal reform .
The BCA has also suffered a backlash .
A group of sceptical bloggers angered by the lawsuit scoured the internet for unsubstantiated medical claims made on chiropractic websites .
They filed complaints with local Trading Standards offices and the General Chiropractic Council .
Wider audience
More than 500 complaints were made against individual chiropractors in 24 hours .
This is not the only example of a groundswell of sceptical activism .
A recent campaign against homeopathy saw sceptics take to the streets across the UK .
Demonstrators swallowed vast amounts of homeopathic pills in an effort to show that they had no effect .
Several Skeptics in the Pub regulars from Glasgow and Edinburgh took part in the event .
SKEPTICS WITH A K ?
The dictionary definition of a sceptic ( or skeptic ) is someone who maintains a doubting attitude Many sceptical groups use the American spelling , with a K , in preference to the British spelling Alex Pryce of the Scottish Skeptics Society said the spelling aimed to set them apart from the more cynical connotations of the word
He said it also made the group a recognisable brand Meanwhile , a new group is now attempting to promote scepticism on a national level and bring science and rationalism to a wider audience .
Organiser Alex Pryce said the Scottish Skeptics Society would attempt to appeal to people beyond the scientific community .
" The society will aim to promote education and the idea that you do n't need to be a scientist to understand things , " he said .
" You just need to think , read , even get an audiobook . "
And he added : " Scotland was so heavily involved in the British enlightenment that it really has to be at the forefront of the new movement that 's taking place in the 21st Century . "
The group plans to publish information on the internet , visit schools and help to establish sceptical discussion groups outside of Glasgow and Edinburgh .
But is n't an ardently sceptical outlook a rather curmudgeonly approach to life ?
Mr Pryce thinks not .
" I think a lot of people confuse scepticism with cynicism , " he said .
" That 's a tendency to reject ideas out of hand without giving them any real consideration , and that 's not what scepticism is about .
" Scepticism is n't a set of beliefs .
It 's a system of inquiry that ultimately gives people the ability to understand the world around them - and I think that 's a really positive thing . "

MGMT ’s new album , Congratualtions found it ’s way onto the file sharing ecosphere over the weekend , so in a striking move to make the best of a bad situation , Columbia and MGMT decided to put the whole thing up to stream for free on the band ’s website :
Hey everybody , the album leaked , and we wanted you to be able to hear it from us .
We wanted to offer it as a free download but that did n’t make sense to anyone but us .
Which is a pretty cool way of going about things , if you ask us .
Bound to generate interest in the band and their music , and more of a gift to their fans than a capitulation to the pirates .
Music has changed so drastically that bands are having to combat leaks and pirates in new ways , and we really hope this strategy pays off for the band .
Go visit the site , get a t - shirt , buy the album in legit music stores , and stream it on Spotify , and let ’s make sure they get their dues .
Picture this : it 's 2 a.m. and your night is winding down at a popular Atlanta nightspot .
The DJ has just announced the last call for alcohol and you realize time is running out for you to make your move on the honey with the light eyes that you 've been checking out across the room for the last 30 minutes .
Why has n't another man tried to make a move on her , you wonder .
You dismiss your nagging suspicions that something is n't quite right .
Besides , you 're feeling super confident : she 's been checking you out too .
You both maintain steady eye contact as you make your way across the crowded dance floor towards her .
With the bass from Ludacris ' hit single " How Low " pounding in the background , you tell yourself she 's already yours .
You just have to seal the deal .
With luck , she 'll accept your invitation back to your condo , or at least to breakfast .
Your target is within reach when you notice a movement out of the corner of your eye .
It 's a casual acquaintance you know from the hood and he 's moving in on your target .
But wait , he now turns towards you and blocks your path .
" Do n't do it bruh , " he shouts as you strain to hear him over the loud music .
" That 's a dude ! "
Have you noticed that unclockable trannies have been making the news lately ?
I 'm sure you 've heard about NFL player Eric Green who was accused of forcibly sodomizing a tranny who filed a $ 10 million sex assault case against him ?
Angelina Mavilia said she met Green in an Arizona casino last year .
She said they went back to his condo where Green , 27 , assaulted her .
He then got " extremely agitated and threatening , " according to court documents , and warned : " This never happened .
You 'd better not tell . "
Here 's what likely happened : Green found out the beautiful chick that he just brought home for a night of fun was really a man under all that paint and chimera -- and he reacted like any full blooded heterosexual male would - with anger .
Green may or may not be homophobic , but it's hard to be politically correct or understanding when the beautiful woman you trusted with your heart turns out to be a dude with the same equipment as you .
This is happening more and more frequently as gender assignment surgery fees become more affordable and trannies venture out of the gay community and into the popular heterosexual nightclubs where they hope to land unsuspecting football players like Eric Green and rappers like Bow Wow .
A production company called Red Label Group is shopping around a new reality show called " Boss Ladies " featuring 5 trannies who hope to open up a boutique featuring their unique fashions .
The cast includes rapper Bow Wow 's friend Nadia ( pictured top and 2nd from left above ) who frequents the mostly straight Atlanta nightspots looking for ballers .
The thinking is : she 's got bills to pay too .
And since the ballers wo n't come to the gay clubs , she 'll go to the ballers playground .
There 's nothing wrong with being transgendered .
It is the dishonesty , the unspoken truth , and the deception surrounding them that is wrong .
The game has just gotten a little more serious for you heterosexual men .
One of the driving mantras for us is “ less is more ” .
I want us to “ clean up , simplify , streamline , focus ” the user experience work that we lead .
The idea is to recognize the cost of every bit of chrome , every gradient or animation or line or detail or option or gconf setting .
It turns out that all of those extras add some value , but they also add clutter .
There ’s a real cost to them – in attention , in space , in code , in QA .
So we ’re looking for things to strip out , as much ( or more ) as things to put in .
I ’m not sure we ’ll go as far as Microsoft has with their new Windows Phone 7 UI ( links to .
PPTX ) , which uses a design language called Metro .
It ’s radically pared back , and very cool work .
It will be interesting to see if they ’ve gone too far , or if users take to the more abstract feel of it .
It ’s not hard to get people enthusiastic about the idea that less is more .
However , it ’s quite hard to get people to agree on which bits can be less .
It turns out that one person ’s clutter is another person ’s most useful and valued feature .
Less , it turns out , is still less .
So , for example , consider tooltips on the panel .
In bug # 527458 , there ’s some discussion about a decision I made to deprecate tooltips on panel indicators .
For quite a lot of people , that ’s a little less too far .
On that particular decision , we ’ll have to let time tell .
For the moment , the decision stands .
I ’m the first to admit fallibility but I also know that it would be impossible to get consensus around a change like that .
If those tooltips are , on balance , really just clutter , then unless someone is willing to take a decision that will be unpopular , they will be clutter forever .
And it ’s easier for me to make a decision like that in Ubuntu than for virtually anybody else .
I apologise in advance for the mistakes that I will certainly make , and which others on the design team may make too , but I think it ’s important to defend our willingness to pare things back and let the core , essential goodness shine through .
We have to balance innovation and change with clarification and focus .
We ca n’t * stop * innovating and changing , and we have to be willing to remove things that someone will miss .
The bug is a good place to continue the discussion about that particular issue .
But I thought it would be useful to issue a call to arms , and invite suggestions from people on the Ayatana list as to what elements of the existing Ubuntu desktop can be trimmed back , on balance making the whole better .
There ’s a growing awareness and excitement about the importance of design in free software .
A few years ago , folks laughed out loud when it was suggested that design is a good thing for the free software community to build expertise in .
And it ’s been slow going , admittedly .
It ’s hard to bring clarity in a crowd .
Or mob .
We ’ve been doing our part to lead that at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community , both through internal work and through public forums .
If you ’re interested in design and Free Software , then Ubuntu and Ayatana and related forums are great places to participate .
And your participation is welcome !

We 've received a lot more complaints about NBC that will be shared with you a little later , but this one is particularly amusing and pretty symbolic of the network 's general ineptitude this Olympic season .
Reader James P. explains :
Was streaming the USA hockey game live yesterday afternoon at work over my computer — they actually have a decent player to watch the events — and noticed they had a " boss button " under the controls .
Curious , I clicked on it to see what it would bring up and if it would be as amusing as the ridiculous pie graph CBS has used similarly during the NCAA tourney .
Of course the geniuses at NBC have programmed in a screenshot of a single BLANK Excel spreadsheet that does n't even fill a quarter of the screen .
So if your boss did walk by , he 'd still think you were a lazy shit - for - brains staring at an empty spreadsheet for hours throughout the day .

Since the publication in May of his book , Heaven and Earth : Global Warming - The Missing Science , Ian Plimer has been the darling of conservative media commentators and the global network of climate change skeptics .
Plimer , an Australian geologist , has been strongly criticized by climate scientists for errors in his book .
More recently , he has been in the news over his challenge to British journalist , George Monbiot , for a debate over climate science .
Monbiot agreed , subject to Plimer answering some questions in writing ahead of a debate , but Plimer retreated .
While a few news stories have made a passing mention that Plimer is a director of several mining companies , none have looked with any detail at which companies he is involved with , and how substantial his interest is .
Recently , a volunteer editor on SourceWatch ( hat - tip to Scribe ) , did some digging into Plimer 's directorships with three mining companies , Ivanhoe Australia , CBH Resources and Kefi Minerals .
Annual reports for the three companies reveal that :
CBH Resources paid Plimer $ A125,000 in 2009 and $ 181,003 in 2008 .
As of June 2009 , Plimer also had options on 3,569,633 CBH Resources shares .
At the early November 2009 share price of .10 , Plimer 's options would be worth approximately $ A356,963 .
However , CBH 's annual report does not list details of what price , if any , the options would be available at , or the time limit under which they would have to be exercised .
As part of his employment agreement with Ivanhoe Australia , Plimer can forgo annual directors fees of $ 65,000 in return for a total of 100,000 share options " for nil consideration . "
The options are available in four installments , on September 1 each year from 2008 through to 2011 , subject to Plimer continuing in employment with the company .
Ivanhoe Australia , which has an interest in uranium exploration , stated in its 2008 prospectus ( pdf ) that " one of the arguments for nuclear energy is its substantially reduced level of carbon emissions . "
Hyping nuclear power as a " solution " to global warming is standard fare for uranium mining companies , but one wonders if it makes Plimer a little uncomfortable .
After all , he claims that in his book he tested the hypothesis " that increased atmospheric CO2 creates global warming " and found it to " be invalid on all time scales and by a diversity of methods . "
Plimer is also non-executive Director and Deputy Chairman of Kefi Minerals , a U.K. - headquartered mineral exploration company with gold and copper exploration projects in Turkey and , via a joint venture , gold projects in Saudia Arabia .
According to the company 's 2009 annual report , Plimer has 250,000 shares in Kefi which , at the early November 2009 value of 2.25 British pence , would be worth over $ A10,106 .
Plimer also has options on 2 million more shares which can be exercised at 3 pence prior to December 12 , 2012 .
Kefi Minerals ' 2009 annual report does not disclose what directors fees , if any , Plimer is paid .
All together , Plimer earns a very tidy sum as a director of the three mining companies .
Plimer has argued that the introduction of a cap - and - trade system in Australia could have a major impact on the mining industry , and even " probably destroy it totally . "
He has also argued that his mining directorships do n't affect his views on climate science .
But it would still be better if media outlets covering his opinions at least disclosed the magnitude of his interests in the industry .
AT least once a week I scrounge for dinner without shopping , a cooking style that I suppose is counter to current trends but one that admirably displays the benefits of my dedication to pantry stocking .
Often , the cooking centers on pasta .
And although I repeat favorites , I ’m gradually concluding that there are no limits to appealing combinations of dry - pasta - and - whatever , many of them originally created in Southern Italy .
This one is made with no fresh ingredients save for an onion and a little lemon  both pantry staples  and some parsley if it ’s around .
In fact , this is a meal made from a box , some jars and a can .
The box is pasta ( and maybe bread crumbs , but if you have stale bread around , so much the better ) , the jars are capers and oil , and the can is sardines .
The sardines are not only inexpensive and meaty but also one of the few fish not ( yet ) on anyone ’s “ watch ” list , so unlike most seafood they can be eaten without guilt .
Like so many pasta dishes , this one barely involves cooking .
You do have to brown the bread crumbs , a task that requires attention to make sure you catch them when they ’re golden - brown .
But once those are done , the dish takes as long to make as the pasta takes to cook .
THE freak storm that hit Melbourne two weeks ago is on track to be one of the 10 most costly Australian natural disasters of the past 50 years , according to insurance experts .
The Insurance Council of Australia say that insurers have so far received 79,000 claims worth $ 491 million , but industry experts predict that figure will go past $ 700 million .
If so , it will surpass the $ 707 million figure - in 2007 dollars - set by a hailstorm in Sydney in 1986 , currently the 10th most expensive insurance event since records began in 1967 .
It is already Victoria 's costliest storm .
Only bushfires , specifically Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday , have cost the state 's insurers more .
'' We 're still taking claims , and that figure 's looking to rise , '' said council spokeswoman Sandra Van Dijk .
'' The Melbourne situation happened in two hours .
That 's rare .
In two hours we declared it a catastrophe and for it to be declared a catastrophe it has to meet a number of guidelines … off the top of my head I do n't know of any other storm in Melbourne in recent memory [ that 's caused that much damage ] . ''

Screening for illness is based on a simple concept : catch the disease early and more timely treatment will ( inevitably ) lead to better outcomes .
However , as with most things in life , things turn out to be not a clear - cut as they sometimes seem .
Tests are not foolproof , of course .
And sometimes tests can detect things that do n’t necessarily matter .
For example , mammography will inevitably detect breast cancers that are not destined to significantly compromise the quality or quantity of the life of the woman in whom it has been detected .
What this means in this case is that women may be subjected to unnecessary debilitating and expensive treatment .
You can read more about the issues surrounding breast cancer screening here and here .
The male counterpart of mammography is the PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) test – levels of which can go up when the prostate is affected by cancer .
This test has been enthusiastically embraced by the American medical community , while here in the UK doctors have been more reticent about deploying this test .
This might have something to do with the fact that running PSA tests and the treatment that may result is a potentially lucrative practice in the context of ostensibly - private system of medicine in the US .
In fact , this fact has recently been highlighted a one Dr Richard Ablin .
Today ’s British Medical Journal contains a piece which explores Dr Ablin ’s many objections to PSA screening [ 1 ] .
In fact , he thinks doctors should stop using it , a view he expressed in a recent New York Times article .
What qualifies Dr Ablin to take such a broadside regarding PSA ?
Well , he discovered it .
Some of Dr Ablin ’s reservations about PSA screening are :
1 . It is not specific for cancer : the cut - off point for PSA is generally set at 4 ng / ml. 80 per cent of men with PSA values of 4 - 10 ng / ml actually have benign ( non-cancerous ) prostatic enlargement .
2 . Even when it detects actual cancer , the test cannot be used to determine whether the cancer is slow - growing and non-life - threatening or more aggressive in type .
3 . Evidence shows that for one life to be saved as a result of PSA screening , 48 men would have to be treated .
This leaves 47 men who have had perhaps non-critical surgery , that can leave them impotent and maybe incontinent .
This last point reminded me of a client I saw recently who had , some time ago , been found to have a raised PSA .
Prostate biopsy revealed genuine cancer , and he was offered ( with different specialists ) different treatments of varying aggressiveness for this .
In all of this , though , doing nothing did not appear to be an option .
However , he was particularly concerned about the potential side - effects of treatment , and resolved to do some reading and research .
In the end he elected not to have any conventional treatment .
He actually ended up consulting a naturally - oriented doctor with a special interest in cancer .
The last I heard his PSA was back down in the normal range , with no sign of any further advancement in his disease .
He ’s had no adverse side - effects either .
At this stage at least , it appears his decision to do nothing ( regarding conventional treatment ) was the right one .
Dr Ablin is scathing in his opinion of what drives PSA screening in the US .
In ths BMJ piece today he is quoted as saying “ It seems to me that financial motives have spurred a tsunami of testing , ” adding “ There ’s an unbelievable industry behind this .
Unfortunately we do n’t practise evidence based medicine here ; we do things and later rationalise what we ’ve done by saying we thought it was the best thing to do at the time . ”
The piece ends with this quote from Dr Ablin : “ The medical community must confront reality and stop the inappropriate use of PSA screening .
Doing so would save billions of dollars and rescue millions of men from unnecessary , debilitating treatments . ”
It ’s one man ’s view , but one that appears to be gaining considerable momentum .

According to officials with the North Carolina State Board of Education , the Tar Heel State ’s high school children do n’t need to learn about the founding of our nation or the Civil War .
The Board is proposing changes to the high school history curriculum that will eliminate teaching about any historical events prior to 1877 .
The recommended changes are buried amidst a proposal that came out on a state web posting suggesting other curriculum changes .
The change document flies under the mysterious acronym of ACRE — Accountability and Curriculum Reform Effort .
“ All feedback will be read , ” screams the document in smallish font .
What is n’t immediately clear however is by whom or how it will be used in making final decisions .
The online document requested feedback by the extended deadline of March 2 .
Rebecca Garland is the chief academic officer for the NC Department of Public Instruction .
She was quoted by Fox News on February 3 stating : “ We are certainly not trying to go away from American History .
What we are trying to do is figure out a way to teach it where students are connected to it , where they see the big idea , where they are able to make conclusions and draw relationships between parts of our history and the present day . ”
The big idea ?
Had George Washington known his actions would n’t even be worthy of a footnote in the foundational education of children in one of the original thirteen colonies he might never have crossed the Delaware .
Apparently those overseeing the education curriculum for the state ’s public schools do n’t find such minor historical events as the Revolutionary War or Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation relevant .
Currently NC high school kids are taught U.S. History from the beginning in the eleventh grade .
The recommended changes would have freshman taking global studies , sophomores studying civics and economics , and juniors studying U.S. history from 1877 forward .
It is not clear how this date was selected by the Department .
But wait , there ’s more !
Cut the eggheads in Raleigh a little slack .
They do n’t want all of history ’s lessons lost to the sands of time .
They just want to teach them earlier in the kiddies ’ education .
More U.S. history in the fifth grade is called for in the proposal as is a full year in middle school .
Fifth grade ?
Most ten year - olds consider their past weekend as ancient history and hardly seem intellectually prepared to analyze and discuss crucial occurrences in the formation of the nation in which they reside .
The story has gone viral and has more than a few parents , educators and even high school kids upset and mobilized .
NBC Charlotte , NC affiliate WCNC ran a piece Thursday that featured State Senator , Debbie Clary who said she was “ appalled ” at the proposed changes .
She indicated that while the state legislature does not typically “ tinker ” with education curriculum , she would be certain they would should this proposal move forward .
Tinker away .

Many different kinds of animals coexisted during the Jurassic period , from primitive birds to two - legged , large - jawed dinosaurs .
As different as they sound , paleontologists have found extensive evidence that they share a common ancestry .
Two new studies of fossils from China show that bird - like dinosaurs predate the earliest official birds , and shed light on the origin of feathers .
Scientists have generally accepted that birds and theropods , bipedal dinosaurs à la Tyrannosaurus rex , share a common history somewhere back down the genetic line , but they 've had trouble locating ancestors of the two groups .
The early appearance of the first known bird - like animal , the archaeopteryx , relative to theropods has been particularly confounding , and has even been taken as evidence by some paleontologists that the two groups are unrelated .
A new fossil of a theropod has been uncovered in China that may help settle the matter .
The remains are of an alvarezsaur , a small bipedal dinosaur that paleontologists have previously suspected was related to birds , and date to the start of the Late Jurassic period .
That extends the records of alvarezsaurs by 63 million years , and places their origin at least a few million years earlier than the archaeopteryx .
The fossils of the alvarezsaur had two shrunken digits on its hands , a possible indicator that that the species ' arms were well on their way to becoming some sort of specialized appendage .
However , even the existence of a dinosaur with disappearing fingers still leaves a gap of millions of years to fill in the history of birdlike species .
The precise order of other adaptations was also the subject of a recent find .
Some time ago , a few theropod specimens discovered in China were said to show evidence of having had feathers , although the claim was controversial .
A number of scientists said the evidence was just degraded collagen , but others insisted that dinosaur 's skin had some kind of filament covering , such as hair or feathers , possibly even the robust vaned feathers found in modern bird wings , the kind used for quills .
Paleontologists have now used scanning electron microscopy to study some of the theropod fossils and found melanosomes , the organelles that create color in feathers , which were previously thought to be unable to survive fossilization .
The researchers noted that the fossilized remains of the melanosomes were packed and layered in a configuration found in modern feathers .
Two prominent varieties of melanosomes can create brown or black shades , and the paper 's authors were able to find both in their samples .
One dinosaur , the Sinornithosaurus , had filaments that were one color or the other in different locations , suggesting it may have been striped or had another prominent pattern , while the Confuciusornis had both colors in a single feather .
While the findings definitely appear to be feather precursors , the selective pressure that drove their evolution remains elusive .
Scientists speculate there could be a number of reasons for the feathers and coloration , including camouflage or communication ; then again , maybe the theropods were just cold .
Either way , the existence of these feathers will help in deriving the details of the dinosaurs ' appearance , as well as their relation to modern birds .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Intelligence comes second only to smoking as a predictor of heart disease , scientists said on Wednesday , suggesting public health campaigns may need to be designed for people with lower IQs if they are to work .
A patient is reflected in the heart monitor she is hooked up to in the emergency room at Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston , Texas , July 27 , 2009 .

Research by Britain ’s Medical Research Council ( MRC ) found that lower intelligence quotient ( IQ ) scores were associated with higher rates of heart disease and death , and were more important indicators than any other risk factors except smoking .
Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women Europe , the United States and most industrialised countries .
According to the World Health Organisation , cardiovascular diseases and diabetes accounted for 32 percent of all deaths around the world in 2005 .
It is well known that people with poorer education and lower incomes often face higher risks of ill health and a range of diseases .
Studies have pointed to many likely reasons , including limited access to healthcare and other resources , poorer living conditions , chronic stress and higher rates of lifestyle risk factors like smoking .
The MRC study , which analysed data from 1,145 men and women aged around 55 and followed up for 20 years , rated the top five heart disease risk factors as cigarette smoking , IQ , low income , high blood pressure , and low physical activity .
The researchers , led by David Batty of the MRC and Social and Public Health Science Unit in Glasgow , Scotland , said there were “ a number of plausible mechanisms ” which might explain why lower IQ scores could raise the risk of heart disease -- in particular a person ’s approach to “ healthy behaviour . ”
Those who ignored or failed to understand advice about the risks of smoking or benefits of good diet and exercise for heart health would be more likely to be at higher risk , they wrote in a study in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention .
Batty said it was important to recognise the public health implications of the findings -- that skills reflected in a person ’s IQ may be important for managing heart disease risk .
“ From a public health perspective , there is the possibility that IQ can be increased , with some mixed results from trials of early learning and school readiness programmes , ” he said .
Ioanna Tzoulaki , a lecturer in epidemiology from Imperial College London , agreed the public health impact was important .
“ Public health campaigns should focus on early life factors that have been shown to influence IQ levels and tackle social inequalities , ” she said in a comment on the study .
“ At the same time , the public health messages for known risk factors such as diet may need to be simplified . ”
Opposition leader Tony Abbott has been branded " incredibly old - fashioned " forimplying that housewives still do all the ironing .
Mr Abbott made the comment in a dry cleaners in the NSW town of Queanbeyan yesterday , as he warned of higher electricity prices under the government 's emissions trading scheme .
" What the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is that if they get it done commercially it 's going to go up in price , and their own power bills when they switch the iron on , are going to go up , " Mr Abbott said .
Government minister Greg Combet took issue with Mr Abbott for landing women everywhere with the job of ironing .
The time from Britain 's first inhabitation until the last glacial maximum is known as the Old Stone Age , or Palaeolithic era .
Archaeological evidence indicates that what was to become England was colonised by humans long before the rest of the British Isles because of its more hospitable climate between and during the various glacial periods of the distant past .
This earliest evidence , from Happisburgh in Norfolk , includes the oldest human footprints found outside Africa , and points to dates of more than 800,000 BP .
These earliest inhabitants were hunter - gatherers .
Low sea-levels meant that Britain was attached to the continent for much of this earliest period of history , and varying temperatures over tens of thousands of years meant that it was not always inhabited .
Le successeur de Carles Puyol à la défense centrale du FC Barcelone , Gérard Piqué , est une star qui fait diversement parler de lui .
Piqué , sur le terrain , montre une large efficacité qui agrée non seulement son Club , mais aussi les amoureux du football .
L’international footballeur espagnol s’illustre aussi bien sur le terrain que sur les réseaux .
Il est plus connu pour son franc - parler , mais aussi pour ses piques à l’endroit du club rival , le Real de Madrid .
Au - delà de son parcours en club et en équipe d’espagnol bien garni , il ne reste pas pour autant un joueur que tout le monde apprécie .
Une carrière bien riche
Formé à La Masia , le centre de formation barcelonais , Piqué entame un parcours junior en jouant pour le FC Barcelone de 1997 à 2004 .
Pour acquérir plus d’expériences , il fut envoyé à Manchester United de 2004 en 2008 après avoir été prêté au Réal Saragosse pour la saison 2006 - 2007 .
Il retourne jouer pour son club formateur le FC Barcelone à partir de mai 2008 avec un transfert de plus de 5 millions d’euros .
Piqué gagne la ligue des champions avec Manchester United en 2008 .
L’année suivante , il la gagne encore cette fois - ci contre Manchester avec le FC Barcelone .
Il est donc l’un des rares joueurs à remporter la ligue des champions consécutivement avec deux clubs différents .
Le défenseur central barcelonais a beaucoup d’autres titres : Supercoupe d’Europe et d’Espagne , Liga , coupe du Roi …
En sélection nationale , il a joué de 2004 à 2008 les catégories - 17 , - 19 , - 20 et Espoirs puis les séniors de 2009 à 2018 où il annonce sa retraite en équipe nationale avec une coupe du monde gagnée en 2010 .
Une présence sur les réseaux sociaux
Le célèbre défenseur central du Barcelone utilise comme toute autre star , les réseaux sociaux .
Piqué est donc présent sur la toile .
Et si vous êtes habitué à utiliser instagram video downloader , vous vous rendrez compte de sa galerie bien fournie .
On le retrouve sur Facebook , Instagram ou encore Twitter .
À l’instar de certains joueurs , le défenseur dispose de très peu de followers sur Instagram .
Environ 18 millions d’abonnés à côté de la centaine de millions pour CR7 ou Neymar .
En effet , Piqué partage des photos et des vidéos aussi bien professionnelles que privées auxquelles vous pouvez accéder via instagram video downloader .
On voit ainsi sur sa page des photos de lui en maillot officiel ou à l’entrainement .
Des postes aussi dans ses loisirs ne manquent pas .
On le voit sur certaines photos en compagnie de sa femme Shakira et de ses enfants .
On voit même un cliché d’échographie publié par la star alors que son couple attendait un enfant .
Les piques du défenseur
Piqué est connu pour son franc - parler .
Il n’est pas le genre de personne à faire langue de bois .
Ses discours déplacés lui ont même souvent valu le titre de joueur le plus détesté d’Espagne .
Il est le seul joueur barcelonais à lancer quelques phrases sur la crise des indépendantistes catalans en 2017 .
Cette saison , alors qu’il était questionné par un journaliste sur ses avoirs en compte à la veille du match retour contre Espagnol , Piqué a répondu qu’il l’ignorait , mais que cela dépasse certainement le budget annuel de l’Espagnol .
Une réponse qui a longtemps fait des vagues .
More trouble looms for the IPCC .
The body may need to revise statements made in its Fourth Assessment Report on hurricanes and global warming .
A statistical analysis of the raw data shows that the claims that global hurricane activity has increased cannot be supported .
Les Hatton once fixed weather models at the Met Office .
Having studied Maths at Cambridge , he completed his PhD as meteorologist : his PhD was the study of tornadoes and waterspouts .
He 's a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society , currently teaches at the University of Kingston , and is well known in the software engineering community - his studies include critical systems analysis .
Hatton has released what he describes as an ' A - level ' statistical analysis , which tests six IPCC statements against raw data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric ( NOAA ) Administration .
He 's published all the raw data and invites criticism , but warns he is neither " a warmist nor a denialist " , but a scientist .
Hatton performed a z - test statistical analysis of the period 1999 - 2009 against 1946 - 2009 to test the six conclusions .
He also ran the data ending with what the IPCC had available in 2007 .
He found that North Atlantic hurricane activity increased significantly , but the increase was counterbalanced by diminished activity in the East Pacific , where hurricane - strength storms are 50 per cent more prevalent .
The West Pacific showed no significant change .
Overall , the declines balance the increases .
" When you average the number of storms and their strength , it almost exactly balances . "
This is n't indicative of an increase in atmospheric energy manifesting itself in storms .
Even the North Atlantic increase should be treated with caution , Hatton concludes , since the period contains one anomalous year of unusually high hurricane activity - 2005 - the year Al Gore used the Katrina tragedy to advance the case for the manmade global warming theory .
The IPCC does indeed conclude that " there is no clear trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones . "
If only the IPCC had stopped there .
Yet it goes on to make more claims , and draw conclusions that the data does n't support .
Claims and data
Thre IPCC 's WG1 paper states : " There are also suggestions of increased intense tropical cyclone activity in some other regions where concerns over data quality are greater . "
Hatton points out the data quality is similar in each area .
The IPCC continues : " It is more likely than not (> 50 % ) that there has been some human contribution to the increases in hurricane intensity . "
But , as Hatton points out , that conclusion comes from computer climate models , not from the observational data , which show no increase .
" The IPCC goes on to make statements that would never pass peer review , " Hatton told us .
A more scientifically useful conclusion would have been to ask why there was a disparity .
" This differential behaviour to me is very interesting .
If it 's due to increased warming in one place , and decreased warming in the other - then that 's interesting to me . "
Hatton has thirty years of experience of getting scientific papers published , but describes this one , available on his personal website , as " unpublishable " .
" It 's an open invitation to tell me I 'm wrong , " he says .
He was prompted to look more closely by the Climategate emails , and by his years of experience with computer modelling .
All code and data on which policy conclusions are made should be open and freely downloadable , he says - preferably with open tools .
You can download both the paper and the code and tools from here . ®
Bootnote
The IPCC 's AR4 chapter lead was Kevin Trenberth , who features prominently in the Climategate emails .
In 2005 , the National Hurricane Center 's chief scientist Chris Landsea resigned his post in protest at the treatment of the subject by Trenberth .
" I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound .
As the IPCC leadership has seen no wrong in Dr. Trenberth ’s actions and have retained him as a Lead Author for the AR4 , I have decided to no longer participate in the IPCC AR4 . "
Critics point out that an increase in low - intensity storms being recorded is due to better instrumentation .
Most are at sea , and thanks to radar and satellites , more are now observed .
While drafting a post on ‘ Phil Jones and the ‘ expert judgement ’ of the IPCC ’ recently , a search of the CRU emails threw up a file that did not appear to be relevant to what I was looking for , but it is interesting nonetheless .
Since sceptics started raking through the Climategate emails , interest has focused on just a few dozen of the messages that contain egregiously alarming revelations about how climate research and the IPCC process is conducted .
A large number of the emails appear to contain nothing particularly noteworthy .
This is strange , given that they all seemed to have been grouped in a single folder for a purpose .
There is some agreement among systems analysts who have considered how this material became public that the FOI2009 folder that appeared on a Russian server in November last year was downloaded in toto from CRU , and had probably been compiled there for a reason or reasons unknown .
If this is the case , then it must have been the result of an exhaustive review of , and a process of selection from , a vast amount of material .
The folder certainly does n’t contain the whole contents of any particular mailbox .
The hacked or leaked file was named FOI2009.zip and contained a folder FOI2009 , which was divided into two sub-folders : documents and emails .
The emails folder is made up of 1073 files each of which contains an email , but many of these also contain chains of messages that are relevant to the primary message at the top of the page .
The file that I came across ( 1168467907.txt ) was one of these and contained five messages .
The primary email ( dated 10th January 2007 ) is from Phil Jones to Sir Brain Hoskins , with copies to : “ Susan Solomon ” , “ Kevin Trenberth ” , “ Brian Hoskins ” , martin. manning , “ Matilde Rusticucci ” , “ Phil Jones ” , “ Peter Lemke ” , “ Jurgen Willebrand ” , “ Nathan Bindoff ” , “ zhenlin chen ” , ” Melinda Marquis ” .
( The inclusion of Jones and Hoskins in the copies , in spite of their being the author and recipient of the primary message respectively , suggests that this was a designated mailing list . )
All are drafting or contributing authors to the IPCC’s AR4 , Working Group 1 ( WGI ) , Summary for Policymakers ( SPM ) except for Solomon , who is co-Chair of WGI and Marquis who is Deputy Director of the WGI Support Group .
Only Jones , Hoskins , Trenberth and Solomon take part in the discussion in the message chain .
The subject under discussion is mid-latitude winds in the context of climate change and extreme weather events , and the way in which research findings relating to this should be summarised in the SPM .
The emails were exchanged just prior to the IPCC plenary session in Paris during early February 2007 that would finalise the text .
It is important to note that government representatives who have the last word on the text attended this final meeting .
The general subject heading in the SPM is Direct Observations of Recent Climate Change .
In order to consider the contents in chronological order it is necessary to start with the last message at the bottom of the page , or in other words , to read the contents from bottom to top rather than top to bottom .
The earliest message is from Sir Brian Hoskins to Susan Soloman .
( Message 1 ) Brian Hoskins wrote : [ Review editor of WGI Chapter 3 and a drafting author of the SPM ] Susan [ Solomon ]
Headline 2
I suggest the following :
At continental or ocean basin scale , numerous changes in climate have been observed .
Mid-latitude westerly winds ( and the associated storms ) have shifted polewards and strengthened .
Other climate changes include precipitation , ….. I have taken the suggestion form SPM_327 to reverse the order of the first sentence .
The westerly winds sentence is essentially that in a headline in the TS .
I should much prefer not to include the bracketed itallicised phrase on storms .
The evidence is less strong .
There is some evidence for reduced numbers of storms also but no room to say that .
It was not headlined in the chapter or the TS .
Best wishes Brian my emphasis
Evidently a piece of copy concerning extreme weather is being hammered into shape and Hoskins has reservations because a claim of increased storm intensity may not be adequately supported by scientific evidence and there is also evidence that the frequency of storms is decreasing .
The next message is from Kevin Trenberth ( a cooridinating a lead author on WGI Chapter 3 ) to Sir Brian Hoskins .
( Message 2 ) At 8:54 AM -0700 1/9/07 , Kevin Trenberth wrote : Hi Brian
Do you need the first part ?
Are you rewriting the headline on SPM p5 lines 35 - 37 or are you adding an extra bullet on circulation ?
I thought we agreed on the latter , but your piece seems more like the former .
If we left the headline alone and added : * Changes in large - scale atmospheric circulation are apparent and , in particular , the mid-latitude westerly winds have shifted polewards and strengthened , altering storm tracks .
would be an alternative approach .
I think it is helpful to mention storm tracks but not be specific about how they have changed .
What do you think ?
Kevin my emphasis
Hoskins ’ initial reservations about the evidence of stronger winds , and the possibility that the frequency of storms is decreasing have disappeared and been replaced by wording that suggests that only the change in wind patterns is leading to stronger winds and worse storms .
Evidently space cannot be found for any caveats .
At this point , one of the biggest guns in the IPCC process , Susan Solomons , provides priority and direction to the discussion , as any good chairman should .
At all costs the scientists must deliver what the government representatives want to hear .
( Message 3 ) Susan Solomon [ Co - Chair , Working Group I , AR4 ) wrote : Thanks Brian and Kevin for the help .
I agree with Brian about reversing the order in the headline sentence but agree with Kevin that a separate bullet is most helpful .
I suggest we keep the headline short and simple and just leave the language we have about wind patterns being one of several things changing there .
Otherwise it could be read as putting the circulation change into a very high prominence in the headline which is n’t quite the emphasis we were discussing , I think .
I tried to combine the suggestions and to keep things clear enough that governments wo n’t complain about lack of specifics .
If you look over the comments , you will have seen that above all they will not tolerate vague language .
Anybody who was in Shanghai ( or any other IPCC meeting ) can attest to that so please please everybody help make things as specific as we can .
So my suggestion for the wind pattern bullet is : Mid-latitude westerly wind speeds have increased in both hemispheres since about the 1960s .
This has caused storm tracks to move towards higher latitudes .
{ 3.6 } Regarding the headline that proceeds it , can we consider something like this :
At continental or ocean basin scales , numerous changes in climate have been observed .
These include sea ice extent , precipitation amounts , ocean salinity , wind patterns , and [ aspects of extreme weather ]
OR [ the frequency of heavy precipitation and of heat waves , the intensity and duration of drought , and the intensity of hurricanes and typhoons . ]
The ice sheets have been taken out of the above because they are moving to a consolidated sea level subsection , to deal with several requests for that .
Is the new option after wind patterns too specific ?
I am a little concerned that we will be challenged on that .
We could keep what we have : ‘ aspects of extreme weather ’ .
Equally , I am worried that they will challenge the vagueness of ‘ extreme weather ’ so that is why you see two alternatives here .
Thoughts ?
Susan my emphasis
What should a poor scientist do when the bosses want specifics ?
As Hoskins ’ first message shows , there are n’t any other than to say that the scientific evidence for mid-latitude winds becoming a problem is a bit flimsy .
But Hoskins bounces back and he , if no one else , is still worried about the evidence that even if winds are strengthening , the frequency of storms may be decreasing .
It ’s difficult to blame extreme weather on climate change if there seems to be less of it about .
( Message 4 ) Dear All
To me a headline should be kept simple with the detail in the bullets
below , so I prefer the simple version with “ aspects of extreme weather ”
but I guess I am outvoted on that !
For the first part of the bullet on the westerlies I should prefer to
revert to including the shift and also using the word strengthen rather
than increase ( a number , such as the speed , increases ) : Mid-latitude westerly winds have shifted polewards and stengthened since
about the 1960s .
The next part on the storms is problematic .
I agree with Kevin that we
should steer clear of the causal langauage Susan had used .
However
Kevin ’s words seemed to link a shift in the storm tracks with an
increase in the winds .
Also , as reviewed in 3.5.3 , some papers suggest
that , in addition to a poleward shift in the storm tracks and an
increase in their average intensity , there is a decrease in the number
of storms .
This is probably too much for the bullet , so that a less
specific version may be required .
I think the whole bullet could be : Mid-latitude westerly winds have shifted polewards and stengthened since
about the 1960s , with associated changes in storms .
( 3.5 ) Brian my emphasis
This is a really skilful bit of drafting that completely avoids the real scientific issues .
The wording implies that storms are becoming more of a problem , and also provides for any challenge based on the evidence of decreasing storm frequency with the weasel words , ‘ associated changes ’ .
Finally , Phil Jones joins in , suggesting that if mentioning the storms is inconvenient , then why not just leave them out .
( Message 5 ) Dear All ,
Agree with Brian ’s new bullet .
I still think we will
get comments about what changes with storms .
If this
is going to lead somewhere we do n’t want it and cause
problems , then the final part is likely best removed .
Reading it again , better if we say .. since the 1960s .
About is a little vague .
Back in CRU on Friday .
I may be able to get this hotel link
to work tomorrow morning .
Cheers
Phil my emphasis
Evidently Jones had the last word .
The final wording in the SPM is as follows :
Mid-latitude westerly winds have strengthened in both hemispheres since the 1960s .
{ 3.5} Summary for Policymakers , Page 8
We have come a very long way from Hoskins ’ first message to Susan Solomon .
When I fist glanced through this message – looking for something else – I wondered how it had found its way into the FOI209 folder .
It seemed to be innocuous ; just a group of scientists discussing the wording in a report .
So I read it more carefully and realised that this email is in fact just the kind of ‘ dirty washing ’ that the participants would really want to be kept out of reach of any Freedom of Information Act requests .
Ever since the Climategate scandal broke , and led on to Himalayagate and all the other criticisms of the IPCC WG II report , we have been told that none of the revelations have any impact on the big picture ; the fundamental evidence for AGW .
Yet here we find some of the leading figures in the IPCC process drafting what is supposed to be an objective assessment of research findings in a way that is astonishing .
Apparently there is something going on that is every bit as troubling as ‘ hiding the decline ’ , rigging the peer review process , or refusing to make data available for scrutiny .
It seems to reveal a culture where the priority is not science at all , but presentation .
And in this instance it applies to the IPCC ’s most influential document , the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers .
Worse , it involves some of the biggest names in climate science .
It is true that the nature of mid-latitude storms does not provide clinching evidence either one way or the other in the climate debate .
But that is not the point .
Assessment , as applied in the IPCC process , is to a great extent a matter of judgement .
The most important revelation that the Climategate emails provide is an insight into the culture that exists within climate science .
This has been variously described as ‘ tribalism ’ , ‘ circling the wagons ’ , and more recently by Judith Curry in an interview with Discover Magazine as ‘ sloppiness ’ .
It is these characteristics , far more than any specific instance of wrong - doing that cast doubt on the evidence for AGW .
When people talk about the fundamental evidence for AGW not being called into question they are considering only a few specific allegations .
But we rely entirely on the IPCC for that evidence .
It is not too much to say that the evidence for AGW is the IPCC .
If the IPCC assessment process is contaminated by a culture that is essentially concerned with presentation , then the whole of that process , and the conclusions that have been reached about global warming , require fresh scrutiny .
The above email suggests that , in this case at least , the IPCC ’s priority was massaging the evidence to suit the message .
In how many other instances is this the case ?

A bit overdue , the first release of Braindump is available .
It has been a while since I announced the project of making a tool that gather allow to dump your thoughts into an electronic form .
For those who have forget ( which is probably most of you ) , Braindump is a collection of whiteboards on which you can put your notes , whether text notes , or drawing .
It is entirely based on KOffice technologies .
Which made Braindump quick and easy to develop , and it makes it very small , around 8000 lines of code .
I have been delaying that release because I wanted to make a video of Braindump in action , and have been too lazy to make one until now .
On that video I first create new whiteboards , then I demonstrate how to add shapes , manipulate them , and finally the different layout :
I you look at Braindump development history , you will notice that over the past six months the development has been really slow , there are a few reasons to that , the first one is that most of the development is done by other people than me in the KOffice repository , the second one is that I feel that Braindump is already doing exactly what I want , with a few glitches , but as a geek I tend to live happily with those …
That said there is a couple of features I want :
Search ( and replace )
Tagging , but then someone else ( yeah again ) is doing the work for me in KOffice
Auto - growing text shape
A solution to this problem : ( almost ) each time I create a new whiteboard , the first thing I do is to add a text shape .
So I wonder about either having always a permanent text shape in the background , or always add a text shape when creating a white board .
I am also starting to be curious about ownCloud , since personally I find it to be the right direction of cloud computing , so I would probably be interested in the possibility of storing whiteboards on an ownCloud server .
Lets see how it evolves .
If you have other ideas , do not hesitate to mention them , who knows , if I find them interesting , I might go on and implement them !
Download Braindump 0.8.0 , this release will work only with KOffice 2.1.x , from now on I will work on porting Braindump to the upcoming KOffice 2.2 .

Fernando Alonso believes he could have won the Australian Grand Prix - even after his first corner incident with Jenson Button had put him to the back .
In the event his charge towards the front was halted at fourth place , any further progress stymied by being stuck behind team - mate Felipe Massa .
With Ferrari unwilling at this early stage in the season to ask one of its drivers to make way for the other , it created a situation in which Alonso might have fallen into conflict with his new team for the first time .
How he handles this will be a crucial test for him ; Alonso has a history of not coping well with this sort of situation .
At Indianapolis in 2006 he was at odds with his Renault team when team - mate Giancarlo Fisichella was running ahead of him , insiders telling of him screaming over the radio to move ' Fisi ' aside .
An almost identical situation arose a year later at the same venue , with McLaren when Lewis Hamilton was running ahead of him and Alonso felt he was being held up .
Neither Massa nor Alonso are likely to get preferential treatment
In between times , he was publically critical of Renault in the aftermath of China 2006 when the team did not prevent Fisichella from taking advantage of Alonso 's tyre problems .
He made a now infamous speech in which he talked of " feeling alone " in the team .
Whereas the Indianapolis '06 incident had been contained within Renault at the time , this was the first public appearance of a previously unsuspected chink in the champion 's armour .
It was a chink that was prised open at McLaren by Hamilton 's speed .
Alonso 's failure to gel at McLaren , and his ill - judged attempts at using the team 's difficulty with governing body the FIA as ' spy - gate ' unfolded to get internal championship priority , led to him being dropped after just one year of what was originally a long - term contract .
This in turn led to two pretty barren years with Renault in 2008 and 2009 .
Having finally got himself back into a car worthy of his talent , he surely knows he cannot allow himself the indulgence of risking team unity over a relatively minor point .
Interestingly , however , Sunday 's situation in Melbourne created the exact sort of circumstances that have in the past led to just that - i.e. his team 's attempts at equality apparently compromising their chances of beating the opposition .
During his first race for McLaren at the same venue three years ago , he felt it would have been more logical for the team to have given him strategic preference rather than " waste " a set of fresh tyres just to beat his team - mate in qualifying and thereby earn preference .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG Sunday 's events in Albert Park proved the folly of writing off one of the world 's most unpredictable sports so early
This , he reasoned , denied him use of fresh tyres when they might have been needed the following day when fighting Ferrari .
He tends to assume dominance within the team and the only time this expectation has not been met , it triggered his ' glitch ' .
Can Alonso assume dominance within Ferrari and if not will the same glitch be revealed ?
At McLaren Hamilton was sufficiently competitive throughout the season that Alonso could not dominate .
At Bahrain two weeks ago Alonso beat Massa in the race , but was out - qualified by him .
But at Melbourne Alonso was much the faster driver in qualifying - and by a margin of 0.7 seconds , which is huge by F1 team - mate standards .
However , too much should not be read into that at this stage .
There was a very specific explanation for the size of the gap between them on Saturday and it was to do with tyre temperatures .
In the cool conditions of qualifying the tyres were right on the knife - edge of not reaching the temperature threshold at which they suddenly ' switch on ' - around 100C .
If a driver could somehow get to that threshold he would suddenly have a huge advantage over one who could not , and that is what we saw at Melbourne .
No matter what Massa tried , he could not emulate Alonso 's ability to generate tyre heat during the out - lap from the pits .
There may be qualifying days where this again becomes a problem for Massa but it is unlikely to happen often .
It was a specific mismatch of tyre compound to weather conditions on the day .
There is as yet no underlying evidence that Alonso will be able to consistently beat Massa and thereby form a natural hierarchy between them .
He is a psychologically complex man so it is going to be fascinating seeing if he can learn from past errors .

SAN FRANCISCO —
In the late 1950s , American space companies jumped into a headlong race to build an aerospace industry that could launch missiles across the world and rockets above it .
In her new book Another Science Fiction , archivist Megan Prelinger delves into the hyperbolic , whimsical world of the advertisements these early aerospace companies created to sell themselves .
Far from the dry , technical ads you might imagine , companies like Northrup , Ex - Cell - O , and National tried to lure the most talented young engineers into their cubicles by drawing on the mystique of science fiction .
Ball - bearing , engine - part , and guidance - system companies did n't sell themselves , but rather the grand vision of space exploration as the next step in mankind 's destiny .
The book is lovingly crafted and exhaustively researched .
Unlike so many " big idea " tomes that skip over the details to deliver the PowerPoint version of reality , Another Science Fiction glories in the details , providing a complex portrait of the nation 's spacefaring ambitions .
Prelinger 's analysis reaches outside the narrow confines of space boosterism to reveal the neural connections in the American psyche between the final frontier , the Soviet menace , and good , old industrial engineering .
We caught up with Prelinger at the wonderfully strange library she runs with her husband , Rick , to ogle old space stuff and discuss countercultural space utopias , alternatives to Apollo , and her hopes for a human spaceflight renaissance .
Image : Willi Baum .*
Wired.com :
Your book focuses on your amazing collection of space ephemera , particularly the advertisements of the aerospace companies that eagerly lapped up NASA cash .
It 's kind of strange : what were they advertising for ?
And what tropes and themes did they tend to use ?
Megan Prelinger :
The companies were mostly advertising for recruitment .
They were in a position of being funded to develop a civil space program that would be a nearly a whole new industry – from scratch .
As well as responding to a steeply escalating Cold War that “ demanded ” massive missile proliferation .
The companies needed to hire thousands of engineers to develop bids for NASA and DOD contracts , and hundreds of thousands of workers to build the new machines .
They needed to hire those people in just a few years .
And they did .
They tended to use tropes borrowed from science fiction and from mid-century modern design to convey a sense of fantasy and possibility around the process of technological emergence that was erupting .
Imagery that was culturally associated with space exploration dominated , as the civil space program was the leading public face of rocket - and - missile work .
Weapons development was more tacitly than explicitly expressed in the tropes and themes .
The companies and NASA both wanted to inspire people , and they used whatever visual language they could to achieve that goal .
Motifs of sci - fi influenced space exploration were prevalent , but also the trope of “ space will be our new home , ” is expressed in a lot of ways .
Mostly through images of the human body in space , but also in imagery that frames outer space as an extension of the domestic environment , and a zone for new architectural invention .
Wired.com :
What attracted you to this particular set of artifacts ?
Were you looking for stories of rocket advertisements past ?
Prelinger : I ’m a citizen - interpreter of the American West , a landscape aficionado , and a Cold War history buff .
I was originally geopolitically awakened and politicized by the early - 1980s crises in nuclear politics .
When I first picked up these magazines and started to read them , I was looking for untold stories of the militarized American west and untold stories of our atomic nightmare .
I thought there might be material in these magazines that would point to other interesting areas of research .
I have also always been very interested in space exploration and its history , but at the time I thought I mostly knew the outline of the history of NASA .
I did n’t expect to be surprised in that area .
Every discovery I made in the magazines that went into the book was an utter serendipity .
I am not a terribly visual person and I was n’t looking for the ads .
I just happened upon them while reading the articles .
As I gained momentum in reading the magazines , it hit me in a “ Eureka ! ” moment : that the ads formed a visual language of their own that spoke to all the historical , ideological , and technological complexities that were embedded in the massive changes of the era in history .
THAT was the story .
The visual language .
The idea framework for the book emerged almost overnight , an abrupt serendipity .
Wired.com : Your book seems fundamentally about the space race as an industrial opportunity .
The space race here is individual and much more about career advancement than human advancement .
How did companies adapt and borrow the grand themes of human advancement to support their own far more limited aims ?
Prelinger : Human spaceflight is a cultural project ; the mechanics to get us there are an industrial project .
The ads represent the convergence of these two aims .
At the baseline of course the companies were motivated by profit ; at the same time the people working within industry were largely genuinely driven by a sense of contributing to an exciting period of emerging technology .
I think the same can be said of our Silicon Valley giants of today .
How can you separate career advancement from human advancement among the people giving their lives to Big Tech today ?
Wired.com :
The beauty of the ads and the grandeur of space provided cover for the many military projects that aerospace companies undertook during this Cold War period .
If you had to say , do you think the dual military / civilian nature of space technologies hurt the long - range prospects of spacefaring or helped ?
Prelinger : Oh , that ’s complicated .
The military complex enabled a lot of technological transformations that would n’t have happened – or would have taken much , much longer– in a peaceful environment .
So in a basic technological sense , the military enabled spacefaring .
We would n’t have had rockets powerful enough to launch satellites into orbit if we had not been developing intercontinental ballistic missiles .
The rockets were a side project and a surplus of the missile research .
It would be nice to imagine that we could ’ve / would ’ve funded the development of orbit - capable launch vehicles without the stimulus of the Cold War , but it ’s unrealistic .
At the same time , the militarized nature of the early space program hurt it tremendously ( tremendously ! ) by costing it a lot of its legitimacy as a civil - scientific enterprise .
Viz. the conversation with Willi Baum [ creator of the top image ] that is quoted at the end of the book .
He does n’t understand how I can be a naturalist and wildlife rehabilitator and a space advocate at the same time .
A lot of people think as he does – that the whole civil space program is just a fig leaf for our overly militarized technological will to power .
I see that it is more than that , but among the social justice community it ’s very hard to convince people that there really is a hugely important civil - scientific aspect of space exploration ( climate science research , anyone ? ) .
As a member of the social and ecological justice communities it ’s sometimes hard for me to be “ out ” as a space fan .
All because of this intense confusion / conflation and commingling of resources between military and civil space .
That part is very regrettable .
Wired.com :
The space race was intimately tied to the military ambitions of the Cold War superpowers , but you uncover and describe several more human alternatives , a kind of countercultural space program .
Perhaps you can tell us what people like Stewart Brand and Princeton physicists Gerard O'Neill were up to ?
Prelinger :
The migration of space into the counterculture is a big story .
You might be interested in Robert Poole ’s book Earthrise , which is a cultural history of the image of earth from space .
Stewart Brand was responsible for the integration of space themed visual imagery ( the earthrise photo ) into the counterculture .
But back in the 1970s , through his initiative in developing the California Water Atlas , he led the cultural turn from space back toward Earth .
He was really the first to notice and develop the fact that earthrise was more than a pretty picture : it stood for the emerging truth that our journey into space really made more meaning for us out of Planet Earth than it did out of space itself .
He befriended astronaut Rusty Schweikart and integrated discussions about space exploration into the everyday discourse of the CoEvolution Quarterly , his post - Whole Earth Catalog magazine .
Those discussions seem diffuse to me .
But they definitely express a perspective that space exploration is a natural and desirable expression of a combined techno - power and woo - woo state of things .
Those conversations are heavily marked as countercultural in a number of ways .
At the same time Gerard O’Neill was coming from a different place and a different perspective .
As a physics professor at Princeton he was much more Eastern Establishment and institutional than Brand .
But his studies of physics convinced him that human beings could , and should , colonize space in huge numbers .
He believed it was technologically and economically feasible to build huge orbital floating terraria that would be hyper - verdant and would house and feed thousands of people .
He formed his own node of the counterculture just by being so extreme in his views .
He was well - connected enough to gain an appointment at NASA , and NASA sponsored one of his studies and published it as a government document .
That document is one of my favorite pieces of space ephemera .
O’Neill also popularized his vision through the book The High Frontier ; the book ’s ideas were so far outside most peoples ’ frame of reference that they represented a countercultural ideal .
It ’s important to also notice that his ideas were n’t utterly different from those espoused by the ex-Nazi hyper- militarized space visionary Wernher von Braun in the 1950s .
von Braun ’s ideas were assimilable in American culture because they were military themed .
O’Neill ’s peace - and - trees version of that vision was associated ( I think ) with the counterculture as much just by virtue of its pacifism as by anything else .
Wired.com :
In reading about the 70s space utopias , I could n't help thinking back to the 1840s , when railroads started to open up the West , by which I mean the area beyond the Appalachians , and all that land seemed like a great place to test out all the philosophical ideas about the way to live that were bubbling out of the industrializing cities .
You draw a lot of parallels between how people thought about frontiers ( " The Final Frontier " ) and space .
How was exploring space different from exploring , say , Arizona or the Antarctic ?
Prelinger : I ’d love to have time to write an essay - length reply to this question .
I did try to address this question in Chapter Four by making the point that we tried to make it like exploring Arizona , but it was n’t .
And that ’s why a lot of our dreams and initiatives failed to reach fruition .
We imagined we could colonize space as easily as the Europeans moved in to North America .
– perhaps even easier , because there would n’t be pre-existing sapiens cultures to push out .
Almost as if forgetting that we can’t breathe or eat or live or build in space .
The “ science fiction ” aspect of future visualizations grossly overstepped reality by too swiftly suggesting a land - based model of colonization where such a model just could not operate .
It would have been better if space had been conceptualized more like Antarctica ; a place where survival was really unlikely for early explorers , and would never be anything other than extraordinarily difficult for those who would follow them .
NASA maintains research stations in Antarctica devoted not only to polar studies of planetary science , but also research into living in extreme environments .
Human beings will have to adapt into extremophiles in order to live on the Moon or Mars .
Wired.com :
At one point you write that " The twelve - year race between the United States and the USSR to reach the Moon was simple compared to the battle for satellite supremacy , " you write .
That 's a fascinating statement because it goes against the entrenched idea that it was Apollo which formed the core of the American space program .
Prelinger :
As soon as satellite launch technology was proven , many countries and many companies wanted to have a presence in the satellite sky .
Competition was swift and multilateral .
The binary nationalist “ Moon - or - bust ” competition between the US and the USSR was not really attainable by other countries , much less by companies .
So it remained a simple binary for a long time .
But the satellite sky was ( and is ) a much more accessible forum for crowding and competition .
Apollo may have been the public face of the American space program , but we have always had a lot more going on with robotics than with human spaceflight .
From a structural and functional perspective , satellites are the core of the American space program .
Have been since 1958 .
Wired.com : I think most people see NASA ( and the American space program ) as basically Vanguard to Apollo to the Shuttle .
Maybe they throw Hubble in there .
But you recover a huge chunk of space history where the moon shot was by no means assured and where human spaceflight seems as if it could have gone many places .
Maybe not just or never to the moon .
You make the argument that Apollo caused a kind of public amnesia about the competing alternative space programs that might have been .
Can you describe the criticisms of and alternatives to Apollo in the scientific community and the media ?
Prelinger :
The criticisms of Apollo were comparable to the criticisms of human spaceflight today .
The criticisms are based on a schism between space for science , by scientists , and space for exploration , by explorers .
It is true now as it was then that robotic spaceflight is vastly less expensive and technologically difficult , and yields tangible scientific rewards .
Scientists mocked the Apollo program because the life support system had to dominate the payload of the spacecraft to such an extent that only a few pounds of scientific equipment – sensors and sample collectors – could be included .
That schism still exists , though within NASA great steps have been taken to resolve it as an internal contradiction .
Ambitious non-Apollo plans that were regrettably un-funded included a plan for a multi-planet flyby by a space probe in the 1970s .
There was an alignment of the planets in the 1970s that meant a multi- planet probe could go on a “ grand tour ” and get a lot more bang for its buck than at any time in the late 20th or 21st centuries .
Hey look , this idea has a wiki entry : Planetary Grand Tour .
Some people think that the emphasis on human spaceflight overshadowed what could have been public and political support for this Grand Tour .
Other people think that it would have been canceled in the 1970s anyway , just because of the economic contraction .
For the same reasons Apollo was canceled .
Wired.com :
You write in your book , " With fifty years ' hindsight the tone of the popular press stories of the late 1950s criticizing human spaceflight seems cartoonishly overblown . "
Is that really fair ?
It seems to me that the criticisms of the manned spaceflight program were pretty robust , the Apollo landing notwithstanding .
What do you think the best argument for human spaceflight is ?
And do you think we should be attempting to send humans into space now ?
Prelinger : I am a supporter of human spaceflight .
I want to see it happen , and I will do what I can to promote it as a cultural enterprise .
But it needs to be re-framed as a cultural enterprise .
Our human spaceflight program was a civil public institution .
Its primary functions were symbolic , inspirational , and cultural .
It was a positive , non-destructive expression of the urge to explore and to “ conquer ” ( space is un-conquerable , so space exploration de-fangs the conquering impulse ) .
It was a positive , non-destructive expression of technological upsmanship .
It was a positive , non-destructive expression of the human impulse to continuously expand our sense of territoriality .
It can be those things again in the future , and I ’d like to see that happen .
Its most important job was to inspire young people to see themselves as junior members of an advanced , highly - accomplished society , and to identify positively and peacefully with technology .
In its early years , that effect was worldwide .
Space exploration has the potential to transcend nationalism .
I have no doubt that the Apollo program inspired many young people to think higher than they would have without its symbolism in front of them , and I ’d like to see that inspiration come back .
That being said , the Apollo program in particular was an artifact of a major post - war economic and technological surplus .
We no longer have that surplus , we have spent it .
I have to agree on a practical level with the cancellation of the Constellation programs .
NASA ’s robotic programs are the ones that bring home the bacon , in terms of new knowledge and important scientific discoveries .
I ’m sorry that we are losing it as a public program , but it will be reborn as some kind of hybrid public - private partnership .
Private “ new space ” enterprise is hard at work developing human spaceflight alternatives , but it will be really hard for them to do that without some technology transfer from NASA .
I see public - private partnerships as the way of the future .
I ’m of two minds about the privatization of human spaceflight .
On the one hand , I hate to see it lost as a public , democratic institution .
On the other hand , the expense and the risk are utterly enormous .
It seems more appropriate to me for private companies to take the risk and make the expense , rather than our heavily stressed taxpayer base .
And it ’s not as much of a dichotomy as it seems on the surface because even when human spaceflight was a “ public , democratic ” institution , the profits from it still all went to private industry .
Wired.com :
One interesting argument you make is that the selection of a design for the Apollo rocketry and system actually stopped a lot of the more futuristic design proposals out there .
Do you think the lack of a program of record now that NASA has effectively cancelled Constellation will re-open people 's minds and allow them to imagine new paths for NASA ?
Prelinger : I was just discussing this question with a NASA staffer at the SpaceUp conference in San Diego this past weekend .
NASA is definitely at a bit of an identity crisis .
At least the parts of NASA dedicated to human spaceflight are at an identity crisis .
The cancellation of Constellation will result in a huge infusion of moneys into the “ new space ” companies that are developing non-NASA rocket systems .
Those systems are going to be bound to the same rules of physics as NASA rockets , yet they will innovate in design and function to some extent .
As for new paths for NASA well , that ’s a big subject .
What NASA does best and most importantly is robotic planetary science .
No one in the world does that as well as NASA .
Exploring Mars , bringing back samples of Martian soil – and using knowledge about Martian planetary science to help Earth sciences people understand our own planet ’s evolutionary history – THAT ’s what NASA does best .
Increasing public awareness and appreciation about this really important , urgent , and fascinating work is NASA ’s biggest hurdle .
I ’d of course love to see the breakdown of existing structures lead to a creative eruption in design and technology .
That could be visually as well as technologically interesting and exciting .
It remains to be seen though , how “ different ” spacecraft can look , now that the limiting factors of design , materials , and physics are much better known than they were in the 1950s .
Wired.com : Science fiction , the entertainment not the advertisements , seems to thread its way through your narrative as in the hilariously titled sci-fi magazine , Satellite Science Fiction , which you note " published articles about science fact alongside fiction . "
What was the relationship between science and science fiction in the late 50s and has it changed over the last 50 years ?
Prelinger :
In the 1950s , science and science fiction were close mutual contextualizers .
The magazine Analog ran half science / half fiction articles in its table of contents every issue .
The science fiction writer Fritz Leiber was commissioned to write a story – or a story of his was appropriated – by Los Alamos National Laboratory for an advertisement .
The advertisement was actually just a block of copy from the story , with the Laboratory ’s logo at the bottom .
Also , writers such as Arthur C. Clarke wrote fiction that was directly based on working plans for emerging technologies , such as “ The Wind from the Sun ” about a solar wind ship .
The relationship between science and sci- fi did not get much closer than it was during those years .
Today I think that relationship is a bit more diffuse .
It has moved on to the realm of computers .
The relationship between the world created by Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash and Second Life is pretty close , but not as close as the examples above from the 1950s .
And of course the relationship between sci-fi literature and the real stories of technological emergence vary quite a bit with media type .
Narrative film has always been more adventure - oriented than technology - oriented .
In the 1950s that relationship was probably closer than it is today – the ships themselves were part of the adventure .
In contemporary sci - fi narrative film I think I see evidence that we as an audience have become desensitized to the various promises offered by advanced spacefaring technology .
For instance in District 9 , the spaceship is very much in the background .
Though to really use District 9 as an example we ’d have to also look at the centrality of the “ gene therapy ” theme in the story which is very much out of today ’s science news headlines .
In sum I ’d say that the relationship is not quite as close - seeming as it was back then , but it ’s still there .
The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction runs occasional columns by scientists working at the Exploratorium .
But that ’s less than five percent of the magazine ’s content .

[ artist id = " 1220799 " ] John Mayer [ / artist ] has never been one to hold his tongue , whether freely tweeting his innermost thoughts or confessing his insecurities in the middle of a concert .
But his latest foray into the familiar territory of speaking - his - mind - no - matter - the - consequences comes in a new interview , which has already unleashed a strong backlash online .
During the lengthy chat , the 32 - year - old rock star spoke brazenly about his relationships with Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson ( calling the latter " sexual napalm " ) , his sloppy kiss with Perez Hilton and his lack of sexual attraction to black women .
" I do n't think I open myself to it , " Mayer said of dating black women .
" My d--- is sort of like a white supremacist .
I 've got a Benetton heart and a f-----'
David Duke c---.
I 'm going to start dating separately from my d---. "
Such comments have already lit up the Internet with cries of racism .
Yet Mayer also spoke about " why black people love me . "
" Someone asked me the other day , ' What does it feel like now to have a ' hood pass ? ' " he told Playboy .
" And by the way , it 's sort of a contradiction in terms , because if you really had a ' hood pass , you could call it a n--- a pass .
Why are you pulling a punch and calling it a ' hood pass if you really have a ' hood pass ?
But I said , ' I can't really have a ' hood pass . '
I 've never walked into a restaurant , asked for a table and been told , ' We 're full . ' "
Mayer also delved into detail about his two most high - profile romances .
When it came to dating Simpson , Mayer said he did n't think very much about the intrusion the paparazzi would make on his existence .
" It was n't as direct as me saying ' I now make the choice to bring the paparazzi into my life , ' " he explained .
" I really said , ' I now make the choice to sleep with Jessica Simpson . '
That was stronger than my desire to stay out of the paparazzi's eye .
That girl , for me , is a drug .
And drugs are n't good for you if you do lots of them .
Yeah , that girl is like crack cocaine to me .
...
Sexually it was crazy .
That 's all I 'll say .
It was like napalm , sexual napalm . "
During the interview , Mayer also spoke about his ongoing feud with Perez Hilton and how they once kissed at a club .
" I remember seeing Perez Hilton flitting about this club and acting as though he had just invented homosexuality , " he said .
" All of a sudden I thought , I can out - gay this guy right now .
I grabbed him and gave him the dirtiest , tongue - iest kiss I have ever put on anybody — almost as if I hated f-- s . "
Perez has already hit back against Mayer , but so far the usually Twitter - happy singer has not addressed any element of the Playboy interview .
What do you think of John Mayer 's comments ?
Let us know in the comments section below .
Often , news articles miss the point or become political rather than informative .
This one is unique .
It ’s got an odd mix of misunderstanding of the facts combined with compliments to McIntyre .
Again , climatology is an odd world and some of this requires translation for the public ( which does n’t spend hours a day looking at it ) to follow .
CA has the article under Hometown Coverage .
The full article by Jeet Heer is here .
It starts with this paragraph .
Much remains murky about the scandal dubbed Climategate , which involves the release last fall of e-mails leaked or stolen from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
Initial accounts focused on e-mails that seemed to show scientists deliberately distorting research to make the danger of global warming appear worse than it is .
Others have suggested this could be a misreading of the e-mails , most of which , though not all , simply suggest working professionals wrangling over contentious issues and occasionally slagging their critics .
Now I understand that a reporter will attempt to maintain balance , but how come reasonable and neutral people keep repeating the bullcrap lines of these scientists .
Others have suggested a misreading — come on .
Read them yourself if you ’re going to write an article .
It does n’t take a rocket surgeon to figure out who ’s being honest and who ’s got the financial incentives not to .
Gee , is it the unpaid bloggers or the multi-billion dollar climate industry ??
Work the math .
Anyway , it drives me nuts that people with keyboards are still pushing the obviously charade arguments .
Michael Mann said this :
“ I think the climate - change - denial movement has recognized that transition was taking place and has really invested a lot of effort and resources in creating this huge infrastructure of online disinformation .
And I think it is a challenge for legitimate news organizations to compete with that massive disinformation network . ”
He ’s taking too much airspace at my blog but the jerk is the central source of disinformation .
If the ‘ denial ’ movement is out there and organized , please contact me at the email on the left cause I WANT SOME MONEY TOO !!
It ’s not a lie though because the dolt has convinced me that he actually believes his own bs .
As one of the signature issues of his blog , Mr. Watts has focused on meteorological stations , arguing that they were often misplaced – positioned in areas where temperatures were artificially high , such as asphalt parking lots .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration responded to this critique by calculating temperatures minus Mr. Watts ’s list of objectionable stations .
Ironically , the new data showed a slight rise in temperatures .
I do n’t know why a slight temperature rise is ‘ ironic ’ but this is the kind of comment that gives the drive by ’s a bad name .
No thought or understanding whatsoever .
But then Michael Mann comes back with this crap :
“ What McIntyre has essentially done is put his finger on small technicalities that do n’t matter , ” argues Prof.
Mann , now based at Pennsylvania State University .
“ In every case , they ’ve been dismissed .
When the question arises , does it make a difference ?
The answer is always no .
All that is important to him is to be able to say that he ’s found a problem and then allow everybody else to say this fundamentally undermines the science . ”
Why is n’t it important that the HS uses bad math ?
Why is n’t it important that data is used upside down ?
Why is n’t the media mentally capable of calling out these people when they are sold lines of bull .
The key objection to the work of bloggers such as Mr. McIntyre is that they are engaged in an epic game of nitpicking : zeroing in on minor technical issues while ignoring the massive and converging lines of evidence that are coming in from many disciplines .
To read their online work is to enter a dank , claustrophobic universe where obsessive personalities talk endlessly about small building blocks – Yamal Peninsula trees , bristlecones , weather stations – the removal of which will somehow topple the entire edifice of climate science .
Lost in the blogging world is any sense of proportion , or the idea that science is built on cumulative work in many fields , the scientists say .
And that is the comment that spurred the post .
While beautiful in drama , it has a combination of ignorance and sophistry which can only be compared to the smell of old meat on a hot summer day .
Nobody expects the entire edifice of climate science to fall just because much of it is comprised of scat .
Dried old scat is strong enough to make houses of .
Just what is this guy trying to paint skeptics as when he writes this ?
However , we do expect that reasoned people will re-evaluate the extremist claims of climate science , as well as the absolute witchcraft of the paleoclimate branch .
I ’m published in other fields , I ’ve got several patents , we ’ve made products which lead the world in several categories , just what the hell makes us so much less than these paid global warming advocates ?
What does Michael Mann do that leads the wold in anything ? — not one damn thing !
So let me reply to this last little sentence —
“ Lost in the blogging world is any sense of proportion , or the idea that science is built on cumulative work in many fields , the scientists say . ”
Lost in the media world is any sense of understanding , or any ability to critically or objectively reason about an argument which goes against their political cause .
Lost is the understanding which would make a good reporter figure out that you simply cannot throw away over half your data to make a conclusion .
And finally , lost is the human race which is too damned stupid and lazy to see the scam right in front of their faces .
Finally , I need to address Shmidt who said this :
“ He could be a scientific superstar , ” Mr. Schmidt says .
“ He ’s a smart person .
He could be adding to the sum total of human knowledge , but in effect he adds to the reduction of the sum total of human knowledge . ”
Think of the hubris of this statement .
McIntyre could be a superstar because he ’s so smart .
A giant !!
Yet , he contributes to a reduction of human knowledge .
Where does this place Gavin in relationship to McIntyre on the scale of supergenius .
I ’ve seen gavin ’s work on frequency analysis of solar data .
He , a PhD mathematician screwed the analysis so badly that I an Aeronautical engineer could have corrected it for him in moments .
I ’m not bragging , I ’m pointing out that this self appointed genius has screwed up math in publication that even I can figure out .
I know already that it ’s sophistry .
I already know that Climate Audit is correct on the math issues , because I understand it .
I know the Antarctic ai n’t melting , Mann 08 and 09 are lies and a dozen other proxies and papers are rubbish .
All because of McIntyre .
Not because Steve said so , because I understand it .
What an idiot !

RABBITS are supposed to be easy to kill .
The French dispatch them with a sharp knife to the throat .
A farmer in upstate New York swears that a swift smack with the side of the hand works .
Others prefer a quick twist of the neck .
It did n’t seem so easy at the rabbit - killing seminar held in a parking lot behind Roberta ’s restaurant in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn in November .
The idea was to place the rabbit on its belly on straw - covered asphalt , press a broomstick across the back of its neck and swiftly yank up the rear legs .
Done right , it ’s a quiet and quick end .
But it takes a little skill and a lot of fortitude , which some of the novices lacked .
Nine people had paid $ 100 each to learn how to raise , kill and butcher the animals .
One was a woman hoping to start a farm in the Bronx .
Another was considering a move to family land in Montana .
A couple dressed in black had traveled from the Upper East Side with their knives and cutting boards in an Abercrombie & Fitch bag .

LONDON , Ontario , Feb. 12 ( UPI ) -- Canadian animal control officials in southwestern Ontario say they do n't know the location of a Siberian tiger that killed its owner last month .
Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals spokeswoman Alison Cross told the Toronto Star inspectors went to the farm southwest of London , Ontario , last week to check on the animals but did n't find any .

The 650 - pound tiger mauled owner Norman Buwalda Jan. 13 as he was feeding it .
Buwalda had successfully challenged township bylaws banning exotic pets .
There were also reports there were two lions on the rented farm , but there was no sign of them either , Cross said .
" We have n't been able to reach the property owners to ask them where the animals are , " Cross told the London Free Press .
Julie Woodyer , campaign director of Zoocheck Canada , said she was n't optimistic about the cats ' plight .
" I 'm guessing they either were moved into a worse situation or euthanized , " she told the Free Press .
" Euthanasia is perhaps preferable to a lifetime in a small , substandard facility . "

VANCOUVER , British Columbia --
The odds were stacked against the Detroit Red Wings at the start of Saturday ’s game and got worse in the early going .
They were playing their second game in as many nights against the rested Vancouver Canucks .
They dressed only 10 forwards because of injuries to
( head ) and
( groin ) .
And they fell behind by two goals less than 14 minutes into the game .
But the Red Wings persevered .
They peppered goaltender Roberto Luongo with 54 shots and , amazingly , scored a buzzer - beating goal for the second consecutive night .
Henrik Zetterberg whipped in a backhand shot with 0.3 seconds remaining in overtime to give his team a 4 - 3 win at General Motors Place .
“ No quit , ’’ goaltender Jimmy Howard said .
“ We played until the final buzzer . ’’
On Friday , Brian Rafalski scored with 0.2 seconds left in regulation against Edmonton , sending the game overtime .
The Red Wings
, but this win eases the sting and sends them home from Western Canada with five of a possible six points and a two - point lead over the Calgary Flames for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference .
“ We ’re playing like this is the playoffs for us right now , ’’ captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
“ We ’re really in need of points , so this is a huge one for us . ’’
Todd Bertuzzi and Pavel Datsyuk scored 5 seconds apart in the second period , equaling the franchise record for the fastest two goals .
Valtteri Filppula scored a shorthanded goal and added two assists .
Zetterberg had an assist to go along with his 20th goal of the season .
“ Their ( defenseman ) broke his stick , ’’ Zetterberg said .
“ Fil put it onto me , so I had a step on him and I did n’t know how much time was left , but it was enough . ’’
Said Lidstrom : “ At the end , we had almost all four guys in their zone pinching in , going towards the net , looking for chances , rebounds .
You saw the desperation come out at the end in the last couple of games . ’’
The Red Wings basically used three forward lines , occasionally playing defenseman Derek Meech up front .
Defenseman Brett Lebda dressed but did not play .
“ I thought we played real well , ’’ Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
“ Even when we were down 2 - 0 , I thought we were the better team in the first period .
Our guys just kept playing .
Anytime you ’re on the road and you generate the amount of opportunities we did , we must have done a lot of good things .
“ I thought Z and Pav were absolutely fantastic ; Rafi ( Brian Rafalski ) , Nick ( too ) , and Fil had a real good night for us .
We know we got to get points and I thought our guys played hard .
I told our coaching staff I really thought we ’d dig in here tonight .
“ We outplayed them from the start to the end . ’’
Despite outplaying the Canucks by a wide margin early , the Red Wings trailed 2 - 0 until they finally got a break on Bertuzzi ’s goal at 12:34 of the second period .
Filppula threw the puck in front of the net from the side .
It hit Kevin Bieksa ’s leg and sat in the crease .
While the defenseman was searching for the puck , Bertuzzi whacked it into the net to end his 19 - game goal - scoring drought , which dated back to Jan. 23 .
“ It was more fun scoring in this building ( against his former team ) than the relief of actually getting one , ’’ Bertuzzi said .
“ I just tried to get to the net for Z and Fil , and we had a handful of chances tonight . ’’
Then , off the ensuing faceoff , Datsyuk took the puck into the Vancouver zone and whipped a wrist shot from the slot past Luongo at 12:39 to tie the game and tie the club record for the quickest two goals ( set by Tomas Holmstrom and Datsyuk on Nov. 24 , 2007 ) .
It also is the fastest two goals allowed in Canucks history .
Filppula snapped the tie by scoring on a breakaway while shorthanded at 17:39 .
Defenseman Alex Edler stumbled at the Detroit blue line , enabling Filppula to break in alone and deposit a backhand shot past Luongo .
The Canucks applied heavy pressure at the start of the third period and tied it on Daniel Sedin ’s goal at 4:40 .
Sedin gloved a deflected pass from Bieksa , knocked the puck down and swatted it into the net .
The Red Wings outshot the Canucks 17 - 8 in the first period , controlling the play for a good portion of time in the offensive zone and getting some quality scoring chances .
But they trailed 2 - 0 after Vancouver scored twice on shots from the point through traffic .
After the Canucks killed an early penalty , Kyle Wellwood opened the scoring with a blast from the right point that found its way past a few bodies and through Howard ’s five - hole .
Shane O’Brien scored on a wrist shot from the left point at 13:38 .
But there was plenty of time left for the Red Wings .
“ It ’s a never - die attitude , ’’ Bertuzzi said .
“ Guys are playing well right now .
We responded with a big two points . ’’
NAIROBI , Kenya ( WOMENSENEWS )
–Earlier this month church leaders here threatened to mobilize their faithful against a draft of a national constitution if it included language allowing abortions under any circumstance .
" We insist that the constitution must protect all human life , which begins at conception and ends at natural death , " said Peter Karanja in a press statement .
Karanja is secretary general of the National Council of Churches of Kenya , a powerful political player in this deeply religious country , which includes 24 Christian denominations .
Kenya currently outlaws abortion unless three doctors certify that the pregnancy puts a woman ’s life in immediate danger .
In a sign of official acknowledgement of the widespread use of illegal abortions , however , post - abortion care is legal and available in hospitals .
In February , Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki , a Catholic , assured church leaders that Parliament would not pass the draft constitution , which is meant to be enacted within the next two years , if it includes any abortion exceptions .
" Most of us in Parliament have made up our minds and we are ready to persuade those who think otherwise , " Kibaki said during a bishop ’s ordination ceremony .
" Otherwise we will reject their attempts . "
A committee of experts charged with drafting the constitution had placed a provision allowing for abortions under certain emergencies in order to comply with international treaties on human rights that Kenya has signed .
The provision would permit abortion if a pregnancy brought danger to life or health of the mother .
Such phrasing could be interpreted to allow for the termination of pregnancies that pose both physical risks as well as psychological ones , such as when a woman has been raped .
Constitution to Curb Presidential Power
A new constitution is being drafted as part of a deal that brought an end to violence in the wake of the 2007 elections , which left more than 1,000 Kenyans dead .
Political factions here agreed to enact a new constitution before the next round of elections in 2012 in the hopes that curbing presidential powers would decrease corruption and avert further bloodshed .
While the abortion - related language in the draft varies little from what is currently allowed under Kenya ’s penal code , its inclusion in the constitution would make the imposition of a complete ban all but impossible and would open the door for more lenient legislation in the future , says a women ’s advocacy lawyer closely following the matter .
Kenya ’s Parliament is currently debating the draft of the constitution , including whether to leave the abortion - related provision , which is to be decided upon by the end of this year when Kenyans vote to accept or reject .
The criminalization of abortion in Kenya , combined with the stigma and shortage of legal post - abortion care , leads to the deaths of hundreds or possibly thousands of women each year due to complications of unsafe abortions , the New York - based Center for Reproductive Rights said in a report this month .
" These deaths are a direct consequence of Kenya ’s abortion law , one of the most restrictive in the world , " the report ’s authors wrote .
Kenyan women portrayed by the report described how they or their relatives or friends suffered illegal abortions from people who accepted small fees in exchange for procedures that used knitting needles , pipes , pens , bleach and malaria pills .
Unable or afraid to seek emergency care in public clinics , many women who undertake such illegal abortions die .
Hospital Mistreatment
Those who sought help in hospitals were often met by nurses and doctors who were corrupt , untrained , ill - equipped or even abusive , finishing incomplete abortions without analgesics or calling women names , according to the report .
The report includes the story of a 14 - year - old in the slum of Kibera who had sex with men for less than $ 2 after her widowed mother was hospitalized for two years .
When she became pregnant she underwent an illegal abortion that led to a serious infection .
She was too afraid to go to the hospital fearing , erroneously , that she could be jailed .
She and her mother tried to treat her infection with topical disinfectant to no avail .
She died last July .
Many young women from Kibera are arrested for having abortions , according to the center ’s report , and few understand that post - abortion care is legal and public hospitals are supposed to provide the service without cost if the patient is unable to pay .
Kenya ’s Ministry of Public Health told Women ’s eNews that it hopes to lower the death toll of illegal abortions by both improving and expanding family planning programs and ensuring that when women do suffer complications from illegal abortions , they have access to proper care .
Recently , the government has been training midwife nurse practitioners working outside of urban centers in post- abortion care .
" The country ’s approach is to try to reduce the need for abortion in the first place and to mitigate the complications when they arise by giving services to the people , by offering comprehensive post - abortion care which is close to the people , " said Dr. Josephine Kibaru , who heads the country ’s Department of Family Health , in an interview .
Focus on Saving Lives
" What we know is that health workers save lives , " Kibaru said .
" When we talk about maternal mortality , we are trying to save a woman ’s life .
Whether she is bleeding from a post - postpartum hemorrhage or after an unsafe abortion , it is all part and parcel of our work . "
Henry Njagi , spokesperson for the National Council of Churches , does not care to acknowledge the problems of dangerous and often fatal abortions flagged by the Center for Reproductive Rights report .
" Our position is that the abortions should n’t be happening in the first place , " he said in a recent telephone interview .
" Pregnancies should not be terminated .
What is required is education for the women so that they do n’t get pregnant if they are not interested in getting the baby . "
When pressed on the issue of pregnancies in difficult circumstances like rape , Njagi hung up the phone and did not respond to further questions sent via e-mail .
In a section of abortion - related questions on the Web site of the National Council of Churches , Secretary General Karanja responds to one about what happens to a girl who aborts a child .
" She is guilty of murder , " he says .
A lawyer at Kenya ’s Federation of Women Lawyers said such attitudes are by no means universal here and that it ’s still possible to keep the clause protecting a woman ’s right to an emergency abortion in the constitution .
" There are threats and half truths and falsehoods put out to create religious fear in the people , " said the lawyer , who asked not to be named in keeping with the group ’s policy of only allowing its executive director to be quoted publicly .
" But we find that whenever we go out to explain to people the real reasons for allowing abortion they immediately are sympathetic or would support abortion under difficult circumstances . "

On Thursday 18th March in Cardiff , the BBC screened the virtually finished cut of Doctor Who : The Eleventh Hour .
We were lucky enough to get a seat , and here ’s our spoiler - free reaction to what we saw .
A full , proper review will follow once the episode has been screened …
It ’s probably best that we get one thing out of the way up front .
And it ’s this : if you ’re looking for a major tonal shift from the Russell T Davies era of Doctor Who , you ’re not getting it with The Eleventh Hour .
The episode picks up immediately after the cliffhanger from The End Of Time Part Two , with the Tardis heading into a crash landing .
Then you get the same title sequence , just with a slightly different font and a new logo .
The sonic screwdriver is still present and correct .
And Matt Smith ’s Doctor is the same man who was screaming “ Geronimo ” when we saw him last , and he says it again here .
The tonal similarities are hardly a massive surprise , given that it ’s all in line with what Steven Moffat has been saying pretty much since he got the showrunner job .
But we felt it worth pointing out nonetheless , in case anyone out there thinks this is a top to bottom overhaul of the series .
It ’s not , and let ’s face it , it hardly needed it .
The numbers on your Social Security card actually mean something !
SSNs are not assigned consecutively ; the first was not the lowest number , and the most recent is not the highest .
They are assigned regionally and in batches .
The nine - digit SSN , which has been issued in more than 400 million different sequences , is divided into three parts : area numbers , group numbers and serial numbers .

Area numbers -
The first three numbers originally represented the state in which a person first applied for a Social Security card .
Numbers started in the northeast and moved westward .
This meant that people on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest .
Since 1972 , the SSA has assigned numbers and issued cards based on the ZIP code in the mailing address provided on the original application form .
Since the applicant 's mailing address does n't have to be the same as his residence , his area number does n't necessarily represent the state in which he resides .
For many of us who received our SSNs as infants , the area number indicates the state we were born in .
You can find out which area numbers go with each state at -

Group numbers -
These two middle digits , which range from 01 through 99 , are simply used to break all the SSNs with the same area number into smaller blocks , which makes administration easier .
( The SSA says that , for administrative reasons , group numbers issued first consist of the odd numbers from 01 through 09 , and then even numbers from 10 through 98 , within each area number assigned to a state .
After all the numbers in group 98 of a specific area have been issued , the even groups 02 through 08 are used , followed by odd groups 11 through 99 . )
Serial numbers - Within each group designation , serial numbers -- the last four digits in an SSN -- run consecutively from 0001 through 9999 .
Although SSNs are issued in some order , there is no simple way to tell a person 's age based on his Social Security number .
This story has been corrected .
A British man has received an apology from an English unemployment centre after he claimed staff violated his religious freedoms by demanding he remove a hooded sweater .
His religion ?
He ’s a Jedi Knight .
“ Jobcentre Plus is committed to provide a customer service which embraces diversity and respects a customer ’s religion or belief , ” the centre ’s manager , Wendy Flowers , wrote in a letter .
“ I would like to apologise that on this occasion you were asked to remove your hood which you have stated is not acceptable as part of your religious belief . ”
The Jedi in question is aptly named Chris Jarvis , 31 .
According to reports , he was in the Jobcentre Plus when a staffer asked him to remove a blue “ hoodie . ”
Hooded sweatshirts are a hot button issue in Britain , having become something of a uniform — as well as a method of disguise — for violent young offenders .
Jarvis refused .
He was removed from the business by security .
“ I am Star Wars follower .
It means following the way of the Jedi , ” Jarvis told the Daily Mail .
“ Someone with their own religious views is allowed to wear what their religion says .
The Sikhs are able to carry a great , big dagger .
My religion allows me to wear a hood . ”
Jarvis says he now plans to sue for discrimination .
So -called “ Jediism ” became a fad in England nine years ago after a few of wiseacres urged their fellows to declare themselves followers of the sci- fi religion on the national census .
A whopping 390,000 English citizens did so — meaning there are more Jedis than Jews in England .
However , most of them were in on the joke .
Apparently , Jarvis and the managers of Jobcentre Plus did n’t get the memo .

Civility War Is City Council Member Tim Burgess the New Mark Sidran ?
Burgess wants a new law punishing aggressive solicitation .
Kelly O
It 's a familiar story at City Hall :
An ambitious politician sees a softy mayor and a city fed up with crime and dirty streets .
Eyeing a potential vacancy at the top of city government in a few years , he introduces a flourish of tough - on - crime civility laws , some drawing the ire of liberals and advocates for the poor , and pushes the controversial bills through the city council .
In the 1990s , the man doing this was City Attorney Mark Sidran .
Cut to 2010 : City council member Tim Burgess chairs the council 's public safety committee , a catchall for complaints about crime .
A wave of shootings , including the murder of a Seattle cop , and a rise in burglaries at the bottom of the recession only exacerbate the sense that Seattle is heading down a dangerous path .
Burgess , a former police officer with widely known aspirations to be mayor , presents a vision for a safer city : more police , more foot patrols , more services , and — before any of those are enacted — an ordinance that would create a $ 50 fine for aggressive solicitation .
Naturally , his proposal has critics .
" The problem is street disorder in our downtown core , " Burgess says , explaining why the law is necessary ( echoing Sidran , coincidentally , who warned of " increasing disorder " when pushing laws to control street people and ban sitting on the sidewalk ) .
" What Burgess is doing is putting into law what we consider in the Northwest to be good , polite manners , " says George Allen , the senior vice president of government relations for the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce .
To make his case to his colleagues on the city council , Burgess sent them polls in late February about downtown safety :
Two - thirds of downtown residents are concerned about aggressive panhandling , and one - quarter of Seattle residents avoid downtown due to safety concerns .
" We know the problems are increasing from data we collect , " says Jon Scholes , policy director for the Downtown Seattle Association ( DSA ) , which commissioned the poll on the fears of downtown residents .
" It 's pretty clear we are headed in the wrong direction . "
Really ?
The poll actually showed that between 2007 and 2009 , residents ' extreme concerns about aggressive panhandling in the downtown core dropped from 57 percent to 32 percent , public - drunkenness concerns fell from 42 percent to 20 percent , and concern about loitering by youth decreased from 41 percent to 19 percent .
The DSA adds , " Over the last three years , there has been a slight decrease in levels of extreme concerns for all issues " with " the largest improvements ... in the areas of aggressive panhandlers . "
Alison Eisinger , director for the Seattle / King County Coalition on Homelessness , met with Burgess on March 8 .
" I was disappointed to hear that Council Member Burgess is quite unable to explain the actual need for this legislation or the reason why the existing legislation is n't sufficient , " she says .
Asked about these numbers , Burgess says , " We have made some progress , but we still have a ways to go . "
According to Seattle Police Department statistics released in February , serious crime did rise 7 percent in 2009 ( following a 40 - year low in 2008 ) .
He says the bill " will allow us to establish a new standard of behavior . "
Unrelenting solicitors and intimidating beggars can be menacing — even to the most hardened city dweller .
Burgess provided the city council with two dozen e-mails from locals who felt uncomfortable downtown and several letters from convention visitors who complained that their guests encountered hostile beggars .
One visitor complained in a letter to Seattle 's Convention and Visitors Bureau that a panhandler " got right into my client 's face and we finally had to walk to the other side of the street for him to leave us alone . "
Another convention attendee wrote , " I was approached constantly by panhandlers in the downtown area ...
A nice visit to your new public library off of Fifth turned into an excuse for strange people to ask me strange questions . "
Burgess explains , " The ordinance will give our police officers another tool to help them inform , educate , and caution individuals about aggressive solicitation .
And in rare cases , it will give the opportunity to issue a citation . "
The language of the aggressive - ­solicitation bill , which Burgess introduced to the city council on March 8 , would create a new class of civil penalty .
Aggressive begging is already a criminal offense , but the law put forth by Burgess has a broader impact .
The proposed law applies equally to beggars , Greenpeace canvassers , and Girl Scout cookie sellers .
An officer could ticket a person specifically for " engaging in intimidating conduct while soliciting , " which includes blocking someone 's path while asking for money , repeatedly soliciting a person who has given a negative response while remaining within 15 feet of the person , or — the clause that has drawn the most scrutiny — soliciting people from within 15 feet while they use or immediately after they use an ATM or pay parking station .
As a result , homeless activists and civil - ­liberties advocates are vowing to fight Burgess .
Several camps — the ACLU , the Defender Association , Real Change , WashPIRG , and other members of the city council — have contacted Burgess with concerns or say they will seek changes to the proposal .
" There is no evidence that aggressive panhandling is a criminal problem in downtown , " says Tim Harris , executive director for the newspaper Real Change .
Indeed , Burgess acknowledges the city prosecutes only 10 cases annually of aggressive begging .
ACLU of Washington spokesman Doug Honig warns that the broadly worded law " can give individual police officers too much discretion " to enforce the law disparately on indigent and homeless people .
" Some individuals say this is an attack on the homeless or an attempt to criminalize being homeless , and that is in no way our intent , " Burgess says .
To his credit , Burgess had floated a more severe idea last summer , which would have banned solicitors at intersections and after dark .
The new , milder proposal , he says , " does not target the homeless or disparage them in any way . "
Asked who then — if not the homeless — the law is aimed at , Burgess says the law is intended to restrict professional aggressive beggars , such as " drug traffickers " and " street criminals who are hustling . "
Downtown business interests , meanwhile , seem largely concerned with nonprofit workers armed with clipboards .
" The people who are soliciting money for the organizations , whether they are for the environment , children , or animals , have increased in the last few years , " says Scholes of the DSA .
" They are what we hear a lot about , really .
People ... walk through the gauntlet and feel like they are continually harassed even after saying , ' No , thank you . ' "
Blair Anundson , lead advocate of the environmental lobby group WashPIRG , which often posts canvassers downtown , says he does n't see his staff running afoul of the law .
But he may testify against the bill when it goes before the council 's public safety committee on March 17 , citing concerns with misplaced priorities for dealing with the poor and impacts on all canvassers .
" The problem with the ordinance is that if someone wanted to go after our canvassers , if they do n't like our political agenda , for instance , they could , " Anundson says .
Burgess says of his proposal : " I do n't see it being applied to political canvassers or Girl Scout cookie sellers . "
He argues that the law 's ultimate value is deterring aggressive solicitation , and he cites a law in Tacoma that , since being enacted in 2007 , has n't resulted in a single infraction because it 's worked so well .
Council Member Sally Bagshaw , a downtown resident for the past 10 years , sincerely believes Burgess is trying " to improve things downtown , " but she is concerned the infraction could escalate to a burden on the criminal justice system and onerous penalties .
Although an officer may ticket an aggressive solicitor , there is " virtually a 100 percent chance " the suspect — who may be high on drugs or mentally impaired — will ignore the ticket , Bagshaw says .
Failing to pay the $ 50 fine or appear before a judge could result in a bench warrant , which could then result in jail or a misdemeanor conviction .
" I just know that what we are trying to do is make a more civil society , and I am not convinced at this very minute that we are there with this legislation , " Bagshaw says .
She says more foot patrols from uniformed officers , which Burgess 's proposal would not provide , may solve 90 percent of the problem .
" I want to address this without a big fight with us and the ACLU or the Defender Association , " says Bagshaw .
( For its part , the Defender Association tallied the 24 constituent e-mails Burgess cited as evidence of the need for the new law .
The organization found the law would address only five of the complaints , it may address two of the complaints , and is unlikely to address the remaining majority of the complaints . )
Burgess is n't yet sure if he will hold a special public hearing on his proposal — or only a public comment period at a committee meeting at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday , March 17 .
He says he 's " open " to modifying the law .
Which seems wise , since recent history tells us what can happen when a politician pushes a civility law that goes too far and then tries to run for mayor .
After all , Sidran lost .
A provision of the health - care bill that ’s gotten less attention than some , but is pretty big :
At the White House blog , Lynn Rosenthal , the President ’s adviser on violence against women , notes that victims of domestic violence need health care and that women “ need to be able to talk to their health care provider about the cause of their injuries without fear of losing their health insurance . ”
Did n’t we know that ?
Apparently not : >
Yet until last night , insurance companies in eight states and the District of Columbia could still discriminate against victims by declaring domestic violence a preexisting condition .
Domestic violence victims in those states faced the real risk of being denied health care at the very time when they needed it the most .
Just when you thought you had your mind around how bad our current system is , you read something like that .
You ’re denied health coverage for being in ( or trying to leave , or having left ) a bad relationship ?
Among all the other things a woman in that situation has to fear , she has to worry that if she told her doctor where she got those bruises she might lose her health insurance ?
How about her children ’s insurance , as that is often tied to that of the parents ?
What if a woman who was battered had cancer — would she have to choose between seeking help for one problem or dying of the other ?
( Or dying of both — Rosenthal notes that domestic violence causes twelve hundred deaths a year , and two million injuries . )
And , if she did make some excuse for her injuries , could whoever caused them use that against her if she went to court ?
During the final debate on the bill , Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey , noting that prior pregnancies and Cesarean sections “ and most unbelievable of all ” domestic violence could be considered preëxisting conditions , said , “ We should all be ashamed . ”
The bill should change this , which is more than good .
( It ’s not clear that the fix will be instant ; exclusions for preëxisting conditions are set to end in 2014 , although in the interim insurance should be available through a high - risk pool . )
Despite the regrets about public options , the bill is sounding better all the time .

Are you a Jackass ?
Are you sure ?
I suspect many people are and simply do n’t know it .
That ’s why I ’ve over the years developed a theory that the world would be better if non-Jackass people carried around t- shirts and handed them out to all the Jackasses they meet .
Said t- shirts would come in two varieties — Jackass and Total Jackass .
What ’s the difference ?
I ’m glad you asked , as I have a few examples .
Everyone knows that only a Jackass would drive a Hummer , right ?
Unless you ’re patrolling Mogadishu searching for pirates , you really do n’t need a vehicle of that size .
No one does .
So today while driving to lunch a Hummer pulls out of a driveway ahead of me .
This person is officially a Jackass .
Just getting in their car earns them a t - shirt .
However , they are not yet a Total Jackass .
No , that distinction is earned once I see they have a custom license plate promoting the environment .
Now this person is a Total Jackass .
Just to make sure there is no confusion , less than three hundred yards from their house they pull into a gas station to refuel their monstrosity .
Look , buddy , you ’re trying too hard .
You ’ve more than earned your Total Jackass t- shirt .
Lunch was at Pizza
Hut for their buffet .
While the food is perfectly edible , let ’s not kid ourselves here .
It ’s nothing to stampede for .
However , that ’s exactly what the man behind me in line is revving himself up for .
When I finally get near enough to see what pizzas actually populate the bar , I mistakenly momentarily hesitate to examine my choices .
The man launches into a series of huffs and puffs until I allow him to pass ahead and he begins shoveling a random assortment of pizza onto his plate .
You might think this makes him a Total Jackass , but you ’d be wrong .
At this point he is still firmly in Jackass territory .
He could be promoted for any of the following actions : shoveling an entire pizza onto his three - inch plate , tackling me in the process of cutting in line , or ( and this actually seemed most likely ) removing food from my plate as I filled it .
Here are some other quick tidbits to distinguish between the two .
A Jackass is too arrogant to wear a helmet when riding any two wheeled vehicle .
A Total Jackass actively campaigns to get others to stop wearing their helmets .
A Jackass watches bad films to be “ ironic . ”
A Total Jackass actually does air quotes when saying “ ironic , ” thus proving they are both smart enough to know the usage is wrong , and stupid enough to think anyone is impressed .
A Jackass wears blue jeans with a blazer to show they ’re hip and professional , but do n’t take themselves too seriously .
A Total Jackass wears a blazer with cargo shorts .
Come to think of it , t- shirt orders will be available soon .
Following inhas confirmed that upcoming games from the publisher will include the very controversial " always on " scheme that forces gamers to be connected to the Internet at all times or lose the ability to play their games .
The first EA title to include the DRM will beWhile gaming , if you ever lose connection to the Internet , or even if EA 's servers go down for any reason , you will not be able to play C&C4 , not even in single player mode .
Ubisoft learned the hard way that the system is flawed and does nothing but push legitimate buyers over to pirated versions , which allow for full playback without DRM , but it seems clear that EA will have to learn the same lesson on their own terms .
We did this last week and it was so much fun , I decided to do this again .
This time the list of pictured games was provided by my brother Ark .
We grew up playing the same Amiga games and this is pretty much a list of our favorites ( sans the stuff I posted last week ) .
I actually think this is harder than last week , because a few of these games might have been Amiga exclusives and thus might be unknown to the PC crowd .
Anyway , let ’s see if you can get all of them .
As usual , post your guesses in comments .
For full effect , do n’t read any comments first and try to guess on your own .
Then read the comments and see if you failed to recognize some games that you played but did not recognize from the screen shot .

We bring you the vital news they do n't want you to know .
Strolling through the recent Bauhaus show at the Museum of Modern Art , I was struck by the paintings by Paul Klee .
In several , such as Contrasts in the Evening and Separation in the Evening , Klee painted bold arrows , crisply geometric with 90 - degree points and so modern they could have leapt from an airport wayfinding symbol set .
They could have been time - transported from a 1960s modernist drawing board and dropped into Klee 's dreamy , dusty - hued paintings of the 1920s and 1930s .
As contemporary as these arrows seem , the arrow is probably the oldest and most basic of graphic symbols .
Though it may have originated as a weapon for hunting , it is now the primary metaphor of direction that we use continually to navigate through virtual and physical worlds .
Arrows have important meaning in Klee 's universe .
I could see how the boldness of the arrow shape activated the softer watercolors of the fields and spaces of some his paintings .
I also read that the arrow for Klee symbolized activity .
For Klee the arrow was a symbol of tortured romanticism .
As construed by various critics and Klee 's own fevered Pedagological Sketchbook ( 1925 ) , based on his Bauhaus lectures , his arrows stood for energy , effort and spiritual yearning .
“ The father of the arrow is the thought , how do I expand my reach ? ” Klee wrote .
“ Over this river , this lake , this mountain ? ...
It is the contrast between power and prostration that implies the duality of human existence .
Half winged , half imprisoned — this is man !
Thought is the mediary between earth and the universe . ”
An art history student thesis from 2007 on the arrow in Klee 's work puts it quite succinctly .
While we use in the arrow on road signs and as a symbol on our computer screens , “ In [ the1922 painting Good Place for Fish ] , and in many more by Klee , the arrow functions not in the ways it does in daily life by showing purposeful direction , but rather in a manner that is wholly unique to Klee 's artistic production and enters into the realm of metaphysics and phenomenology . ”
Klee 's arrows have a ruler - rigid 90 - degree point , rather than the aerodynamic acuity of the more common sharper point .
Some arrows seem soft and fluid , even protoplasmic .
Some resemble flatworms from my high school biology text .
Some suggest minarets or other towers .
More than a few inevitably evoke the penis .
Klee 's arrow is to be found as an abstract image more explicitly in the work of his disciples and students Saul Steinberg and Jean Folon .
But it is in signage and “ user interface ” that we encounter the arrow most often .
Henry Dreyfuss 's Symbol Sourcebook offered a system based on the arrow for describing automobile accidents , presumably for police and insurance representatives .
Squiqqly arrows indicate skidding , while arrows that meet indicate a sideswipe , for instance .
The vast compendium of international computer symbols , Unicode , includes standards for dozens of arrow variations .
There are arrows in signs on city streets , like the S and Y of the Subway sandwich shop logo .
Or out on the highway strip , they were sharply angled as in the In - N - Out burger , crooking its elbow at the passing motorist urging a sharp turn .
Or boiled down to a simple triangle of frosty Lucite above elevators — and reduced to a black triangle on CD player and iPod controls .
On our latest , smallest devices , the arrow is just a tiny triangle .
It radiates a sense of direction by its very shape , which is optimized for smooth passage , one way , through air and flesh .
But the basic message of direction can be built on and played with .
So the arrow curves back on itself in the “ undo ” icon and arrows chase their tails in the recycling symbol .
The arrow as symbol must have begun in extreme literalness .
As a graphic element , it shows up in a few 18th - century diagrams , historians tell us , but with little detail .
But its use must go back to when some putative primitive ancestor of ours decided draw an arrow on the ground directing his fellow hominids toward prey or cave .
Surely there is no sign more basic except perhaps the image of the hand with pointing finger .
Tracking the use of the arrow as a graphic element over the centuries is not easy .
It figures in the compass rose , the key arrangement of the cardinal directions that was the center of the navigation revolution that among other things produced voyages from Europe to America .
But the compass has been documented to only a couple of centuries B.C. , the arrow must be far older — the bow and arrow succeeded the atlatl long , long ago — perhaps dating back roughly 25,000 to 50,000 years .
The arrow in literal symbolism , in painting , say , is often tied to Cupid or to war , as when clutched in the claws of the eagle .
But the arrow is about that abstract idea — direction .
Looking at all the arrows in our world , I was amazed not at how abstract they are but how literal : how many have long shafts and fins or feathers like the first aerodynamic incarnations .
The arrow was assumed to be so universal that distant alien civilizations would understand it .
In the famed plaque Carl Sagan helped design for the Pioneer probe , an arrow shows the connection between Earth and the spacecraft as it heads off into deep space .
We often speak of time 's arrow , a concept that has deeper meanings in physics .
The idea that time has direction is basic to all our thinking .
But the display of time in spatial terms may be less universal than we think .
“ We in the West see time as a river , ” declaimed my high school friend Gary , a heavy reader of Hermann Hesse .
“ In the East they see it as a lake . ”
Some argue that alternative Asian representations place the past , not the future , ahead of us on time 's arrow .
The notion that the future is “ ahead , ” the past “ behind , ” turns out to be not just a graphic convention , but a cultural one .
Zeno 's arrow is a much - cited paradox from Plato .
The paradox is definitional : if you divide in half the distance remaining between the arrow in flight and the target , the result will always be a positive amount .
Does that mean the arrow will never reach its target ?
For mathematicians , it is perplexing .
For graphic designers , it is clearer cut : we will always lead with and be led by the arrow .

Update at bottom : Raids before rally aimed to ‘ intimidate ’ marchers , claims activist
Protesters from around the country gathered here Sunday for a march expected to draw tens of thousands of people to push Congress to move on a long - delayed immigration reform .
Organizers hope the “ March for America ” will put immigration reform , which failed in Congress in 2006 and 2007 , back on the agenda after a year dominated by health care reform , the economy and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .

“ The question for our leaders is what they will do starting Monday , March 22 to deliver on the promise of reform .
We have heard promises before , ” said Clarissa Martinez of the Hispanic organization La Raza on Friday , at a news conference previewing the march .
President Barack Obama promised to reform immigration laws during his campaign for the presidency , but a crush of other priorities has set back efforts to legalize immigrants and offering a path to citizenship .
Just last week , however , two senators outlined a bipartisan framework for comprehensive immigration reform legislation , drawing immediate praise from Obama .
The bill from Democratic Senator Charles Schumer and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham would lay the path to legalization for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants , reinforce border controls and create a process to admit temporary workers and produce biometric Social Security cards .
Undocumented immigrants would also have to pass background checks and demonstrate they are proficient in English before they can earn lawful permanent residence and eventually citizenship .
ADVERTISEMENT
Obama called on the senators to turn their plan into legislation , urging Congress to act “ at the earliest possible opportunity . ”
Mary Giovagnoli , director of the Immigration Policy Center , said of the latest effort : “ We encourage the president and Senators Schumer and Graham to go beyond words and produce legislation .
The White House however has acknowledged that it does not yet have the votes to advance a new bill .

But ahead of key mid-term elections in November , the issue has been drawing more attention .
In the 2008 elections Obama won 67 percent of the vote of the record 10 million Hispanics who went to the polls .

Raids before rally aimed to ‘ intimidate ’ marchers , claims activist
In Monday ’s Washington Post , staff writer David Montgomery explores how immigration raids have cast a shadow on such events .
Weeks ago , as Gustavo Torres , executive director of the Latino and immigration advocacy and assistance organization , CASA de Maryland , was set to shake President Obama ’s hand , he was alerted to multiple raids back home .
ADVERTISEMENT
It was just after midday , Thursday , March 11 , and it seemed like an auspicious moment for Torres , executive director of CASA of Maryland , and a dozen other immigrant - rights leaders granted the 75 - minute presidential audience .
The president reaffirmed his commitment to reforming the broken immigration system .
And the advocates looked forward to flexing the movement ’s grass - roots muscles during the upcoming march on the Mall .
Torres ’s job in the meeting was to raise the subject of workplace raids , which he believes sweep up people whose only crime was crossing the border in search of work .
The Obama administration has significantly reduced the number of workplace raids , but most immigrants removed through all enforcement measures continue to be non-criminals .
Focus on people who ’ve committed crimes , Torres urged the president , according to participants .
Obama replied that he must enforce existing law , but he directed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to meet with the leaders to discuss ways to lessen the impact on hardworking immigrants .
Torres received an urgent text message alerting him that “ [ p ] olice vans , unmarked SUVs and squad cars had wheeled into the driveways and parking lots of two restaurants , an office and several residences in Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties .
Dozens of ICE agents and local police surrounded the properties and secured the exits . ”
“ At the raided locations , 28 men and one woman from Guatemala , Ecuador , El Salvador , Honduras , Mexico and Bangladesh were detained , ” the Post article continues .
“ So far , none has been charged with a crime .
All are suspected of ‘ administrative ’ violations of immigration law .
All but six were released by Friday .
The six are those who have prior immigration violations .
The fates of the others will be decided by immigration officials in coming weeks . ”
Torres charged that the timing looked like an attempt to “ intimidate ” the marchers .
Meanwhile , administration officials used back channels to try to convince advocates that the timing was coincidental .
They characterized these raids as fitting the administration ’s policy of targeting alleged criminal violators , including employers .
“ It was part of an ongoing criminal investigation into worker exploitation , ” said a federal law enforcement official who declined to be identified in order to discuss the case .
The increasing acidification of the oceans is measured in pH units , but its impacts on people will be measured in dollar signs , says Sarah Cooley .
Commercial and recreational fishing , tourism , the protection of shorelines by coral reefs — all could be harmed by ocean acidification that is already well under way .
Not to mention the hard - to - quantify - but - significant cultural and lifestyle changes that communities will have to make to adapt to changing marine ecosystems .
In other words , ocean acidification is not just a problem for corals and other marine life .
It has the potential to change the way humans feed themselves , earn their livings , run their communities , and live their lives .
“ What goes around comes around , ” said Cooley , a postdoctoral researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) .
“ Ocean acidification is definitely an anthropogenic problem [ resulting from human activities ] but it will come back and influence human communities . ”
A marine chemist by training , Cooley sought a way after graduate school to apply her scientific know - how to socioeconomic problems .
Working with WHOI marine chemist Scott Doney and Hauke Kite - Powell from the WHOI Marine Policy Center , she is trying to predict what ocean acidification will do to the marine resources that people living in New England , or western Africa , or island nations depend on , and she is looking toward what we can do to prepare for those changes and perhaps mitigate the worst of them .
“ We ’re working on ways to put a dollar value on the potential losses that could occur due to ocean acidification , so we can go to policy - makers and say , ‘ It ’s going to cost X many dollars in lost jobs and lost fishing revenues , but if we do Y money ’s worth of planning now , we ’ll be in good shape , ’ ” she said .
Shell game
Like climate change , ocean acidification is a global problem that results from the enormous increase of carbon dioxide , or CO 2 , released into the atmosphere , primarily from burning fossil fuels .
Although ocean acidification and global warming stem from the same source , they are different problems , said Cooley ; acidification is a matter of simple chemical reactions that have been understood for more than 100 years .
Excess CO 2 in the air dissolves in seawater and forms carbonic acid and , through a series of other reactions , reduces the amount of carbonate in seawater .
That is bad news for many of the so - called calcifying sea creatures that use carbonate and calcium to build their shells or skeletons .
“ The waters are becoming less and less welcoming for shelled organisms , ” Cooley said .
Experiments done at WHOI and elsewhere show that in seawater containing high levels of CO 2 , corals have difficulty making new skeleton and may have existing skeleton dissolve away ; many calcifying plankton struggle ; mollusks such as oysters and scallops find it harder to build and maintain shells ; and juvenile mollusks grow more slowly and have more abnormalities and lower survival rates .
Among calcifying organisms , only crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters appear to tolerate low carbonate levels ; some even make thicker exoskeletons under such conditions .
On the whole , though , more acidic seas and lower carbonate levels could spell trouble for hundreds of species , the ecosystems they belong to — and the human communities that depend on them .
‘ Not just a dollar thing ’
In a paper in the December 2009 issue of Oceanography , Cooley and her coauthors described how ocean acidification could endanger some “ ecosystem services ” — the benefits to human societies provided by healthy ecosystems .
Coral reefs , for instance , bring tourism income , protect shorelines from erosion , and provide habitat for fish that may be the main source of protein for local people .
Trying to put a dollar value on the benefits provided by coral reefs is difficult , said Cooley .
“ If my property does n’t get destroyed by storms because the reef is there , does that save the entire property value ?
How do I count it over time ?
Do I amortize it ?
It ’s a squishy thing to value . ”
Squishy or not , one thing is certain :
The figure is very , very high .
Cooley found that the worldwide value of shoreline protection by coral reefs has been estimated at $ 9 billion a year ; shoreline protection plus reef - supported fisheries was valued at $ 30 billion a year .
For island nations , the exact figure could be less important than the proportion of the economy that depends on the reefs .
In 2006 , direct income from coral reef tourism provided 15 percent of the gross domestic product of the Caribbean island of Tobago .
Add indirect income — “ dinners tourists ate , tchochkes they bought , umbrella drinks they bought ” — and the total comes to 30 percent of the GDP .
“ Without that [ reef tourism ] , the economy of Tobago would be one - third smaller , ” Cooley said .
“ And how many people would be out of work ? ”
Healthy reefs and mollusk populations also are a key element in the cultures of many island and maritime societies .
“ Quality of life is not just a dollar thing , ” Cooley said .
“ Even if we ca n’t put this into an equation , there ’s still an intrinsic value that we need to preserve .
“ Think about coming to Cape Cod .
You go into every gift shop , and there ’s the little shell - related doodads .
If [ in the worst - case scenario ] there ’s no more scallops because they ’ve all been acidified , well then there are no more shell - related doodads , and we will have lost something on the Cape . ”
People , protein , and pressures
Cooley found that ocean acidification ’s likely impacts on the seafood industry are easier to predict .
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , the first - sale value of ocean fisheries worldwide was more than $ 91 billion ; aquaculture of marine organisms generated another $ 79 billion .
Although the oceans are global , ocean acidification is n’t uniform , and its effects are not the same everywhere and on every species .
Fisheries that depend heavily on mollusks , such as those in New England , would likely be hit harder .
Fisheries in Hawaii and Alaska should be less vulnerable , because mollusks make up a tiny fraction of the catch there .
Then again , Cooley said , the finfish catch may also decline , because many of the fish we like to eat , such as haddock , halibut , herring , flounder , and cod , depend heavily on mollusks for their own nourishment .
Even top predators , the animals that eat the haddock , herring , and cod , could be affected .
Swordfish , tuna , shark , and salmon are on that list .
Cooley said ocean acidification might be especially harmful to island nations and parts of the developing world where seafood is a major source of protein .
Established models show that carbonate will become increasingly scarce in the oceans over the next 90 years , squeezing most calcifying organisms into a shrinking zone of tropical waters where carbonate levels will be highest ( though still much lower than today ’s levels ) .
Working with estimates of human population growth and food needs , Cooley determined that tropical regions will come under simultaneous stresses from ocean acidification and increasing demand for dietary protein .
These stresses occur in combination with other environmental pressures , such as temperature rise , watershed changes , and pollution .
“ We ’re layering pressure upon pressure , and as a result , in 20 years or 30 years — within our kids ’ lifetime — things are not going to be the same any more , ” said Cooley .
In particular , “ more people may be going hungry . ”
Coping with the changes
Ocean acidification wo n’t lead to empty oceans , Cooley said .
Some animals will tolerate higher acidity ; some may even thrive on it .
But there will probably be fewer species overall , and the mix of species in a given locale will almost certainly change .
Already , along the coast of Washington state , upwelling currents have brought more acidic water from offshore into near - shore areas and are suspected to have contributed to a drop in shellfish hatchery yields .
At the same time , in a nearby coastal area , a pH decrease of about half a pH unit was associated with a shift from a thriving community dominated by mussels and calcifying algae to one dominated by seagrasses , non-calcifying algae , and invertebrate species that do n’t make shells — and that humans do n’t like to eat .
Similar changes have been observed elsewhere .
“ The world is probably going to march on without these species , but it might be darn uncomfortable ” for us , forcing our economic and cultural systems to change , she said .
“ The [ natural ] communities are going to be very , very different .
And different might be OK — maybe .
There still is an ecosystem to be had .
But a lot of the things that we really enjoy , that our communities depend on , are not going to be there .
We may be able to find other awesome things about the new communities , but chances are , the options will be limited . ”
The only long - term remedy for ocean acidification is to reduce the amount of CO 2 we discharge into the atmosphere .
That will involve the same sorts of actions touted to combat climate change : conserve energy , use renewable energy sources , and so forth .
But , Cooley said , even if we were to end CO 2 emissions tomorrow , there is so much already in the atmosphere that the oceans would continue to acidify for centuries to come .
In other words , we have no choice but to deal with ocean acidification .
“ We need to make adaptations first , as we look toward [ longer - term ] solutions , ” Cooley said .
One example , she said , is establishing and maintaining marine protected areas that provide refuges for species that might be under a number of stresses .
Another is to shift from single - species to ecosystem fisheries management strategies — for example , to focus less exclusively on managing one species , such as cod , and instead consider the many factors , such as weather , human - caused pressures , and interactions with other organisms , that affect the ecosystem where the cod live .
Aquaculture operations , which could become a major source of protein for human communities , could begin cultivating species that are fairly resistant to ocean acidification ; or they could join forces to adjust the pH of ocean water brought into their facilities .
“ I think it ’s feasible if several aquaculturists were to get together now and think , ‘ OK , in the next 10 years we want to do a larger facility that treats incoming water before we rear the spat .
That ’s going to be a better use of our resources than competing individually and some of us going out of business , ’ ” Cooley said .
Global problem , regional answers
And when people are put out of work by ocean acidification and other pressures on ocean ecosystems , said Cooley , “ we need to have community measures in place to retrain them and help them move into [ jobs ] that are equally valuable for themselves and the community . ”
If a person who has lost his maritime job “ is flipping burgers or greeting people at a big - box store , is he going to be a happy guy ?
No , because he went into fishing as a career because he loved the water and he loved doing that .
And some kind of dramatic shift from what his traditional role has been may not be all that satisfying to him . ”
Any proposed strategies will have to be regional , because impacts from ocean acidification are regional , said Cooley .
Policy - makers and communities in each locale will have to ask , “ How are we going to manage our fisheries in the face of this additional pressure ?
There ’s definitely no one - size - fits - all answer , unfortunately . ”
Cooley said she ’s glad communities and policy - makers are starting to think about ocean acidification .
“ Our ultimate goal is to talk to people about ocean acidification and how it might affect their endeavors , ” she said .
“ One of the best currencies to do that , no pun intended , is economics .
Because people always want to know when their interests are at stake . ”

Krasnoyarsk is one of the largest cities in Russia , the largest cultural , educational , economic , and industrial center of Eastern Siberia , the administrative center of Krasnoyarsk Krai ( the second largest subject of the Russian Federation ) .
Local time in Krasnoyarsk city is October 1 , 12:00 pm ( +7 UTC ) .
History of Krasnoyarsk
Foundation of Krasnoyarsk
Krasnoyarsk is one of the oldest cities in Siberia .
People began to settle in the territory of Krasnoyarsk from the Upper Paleolithic era ( about 28 - 32 thousand years ago ) .
Before the arrival of the Russians , it was part of the Yezher Principality of the Yenisei Kyrgyz .
This area became known to the Russians in 1608 , when the Cossacks went up the Yenisei River with the intention of finding new lands and annexing them to the possessions of the Moscow Tsar .
Local tribes refused to pay yasak ( tribute ) to the Russians and bothered them with raids .
Therefore , the Cossacks decided to turn to the Yenisei voivode with a request for help and protection .
The Yenisei voivode Yakov Khripunov sent a nobleman Andrei Dubensky to inspect the land occupied by the Cossacks and find a place to build a fortified settlement .
Dubensky found it at the confluence of the Kacha River into the Yenisei , made a plan , and with it went to Moscow .
The presented plan was approved and he was allowed to proceed with the construction of the settlement .
At the end of 1627 , after returning from Moscow , Dubensky with three hundred Cossacks left Yeniseisk to found a new fortified settlement .
On August 19 , 1628 , the construction of a small fort called “ Krasnyy Yar ” ( literally meaning “ red steep bank ” ) was completed below Krasnoyarsk , opposite Tatyshev Island .
It was named after the red color of marl of the left high bank of the Kacha River .
This day is considered the day of foundation of Krasnoyarsk .
More Historical Facts …
Initially , the most important function of the fort was the defense of the main Russian settlements of Siberia from the south .
The Yenisei Kyrgyz and tribes subordinate to them repeatedly attacked the fort of Krasnyy Yar and the villages located next to it .
The most devastating raids were in 1630 , 1634 , 1635 , 1636 , 1640 , 1665 , 1667 , and 1679 .
In 1673 , Krasnoyarsk under the name “ Krasnagair ” was first mentioned in Western European literature - in “ The Description of Siberia ” by German author Albrecht Dobbin .
In 1690 , the settlement was granted town status .
Krasnoyarsk in the 18th - 19th centuries

The US space shuttle has made its final night launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
The Endeavour orbiter soared into the Florida sky on a 13 - day mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
It is delivering a connecting node and a large window module in what will be one of the last ISS assembly flights .
The US space agency ( Nasa ) plans just four further shuttle missions after this one - and all of them are planned to launch in daylight hours .
The blast - off occurred at 0414 local time ( 0914 GMT ) , 24 hours behind schedule .
Endeavour should have left Earth on Sunday but was held on the pad because of a thick layer of cloud blanketing Florida 's Space Coast .
Monday 's weather was much more obliging , and the shuttle 's ascent to orbit made for quite a spectacle .
NODE 3 - ' TRANQUILITY '
Key unit connects and helps manage other ISS modules Multiple docking ports for visiting vehicles or future modules 7 m by 4.6 m ; a mass of 14 tonnes , but will be fitted out in orbit Sophisticated life support systems will include air cleaning unit Cupola to be fixed to an Earth - facing port once in orbit Panoramic views provide ideal control room for robotic arm Named after Sea of Tranquility , the Apollo 11 landing site " It lit up the Kennedy Space Center , " said shuttle flight director , Mike Leinbach .
" I saw it very clearly through solid rocket booster separation , and then it disappeared behind some clouds and I got kinda disappointed .
But then it broke out of those clouds and that 's when I was able to see it all the way out to seven minutes in flight .
For the last night launch , it treated us well . "
Endeavour 's mission is an important moment for the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) contribution to the station project .
Both the new modules were manufactured in Italy by Thales Alenia Space .
Node 3 , also known as Tranquility , will house the station 's core life - support systems .
It will also store a treadmill the crew must use regularly to exercise their bodies and maintain bone density .
One of the risks of living in microgravity conditions is that bones tend to lose strength over time .
The Cupola is an observation tower that will be used to control robots working on the exterior of the platform .
It is constructed in the shape of a dome , with six trapezoidal side windows and a circular top window of a little under 80 cm , making it the largest window ever built for space .
The Cupola is travelling into orbit attached to the end cone of Node 3 but once in orbit will be transferred to a berthing point that looks straight down to Earth .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The spectacular views from the Cupola mean it is likely to become a popular place on the station for astronauts to relax .
Esa 's project manager on Node 3 and the Cupola , Philippe Deloo , told the BBC : " I heard that on orbit the most favourite past - time of the crew when they 're off duty is to watch out the window and look at Earth .
" The psychological effect of being able to look outside , to look at the Mother Earth , is something that has long been put forward as an argument to have windows on the station . "
Endeavour 's crew is commanded by George Zamka , a colonel in the US Marine Corps , and includes the British - born mission specialist Nicholas Patrick .
Dr Patrick will conduct the three spacewalks to install the two modules with colleague Bob Behnken .
The Cupola will afford spectacular views of Earth

Editor 's note : Nicholas Deleon is a technology journalist from New York who has written about everything from processors to phones to plastic video game guitars since 2005 , starting at Gizmodo and now at CrunchGear .
New York ( CNN ) --
Let 's imagine this terrifying scenario for a moment .
You come home from a long day of work and sit in front of your computer to try out your newly purchased copy of the video game Assassin 's Creed 2 , and then ... nothing happens .
You face an immobile title screen .
You check to make sure everything 's plugged in -- yup , sure is -- and simply cannot figure out what 's going on .
" Why does n't this game work ?
It cost me $ 60 ! "
Meanwhile , on the other side of town , some no - good 12 - year - old is illegally downloading the game from the Internet and playing it way past his bedtime .
Whom do you blame ?
You blame the game 's publisher , Ubisoft , for implementing the most egregious form of digital rights management ( DRM ) ever seen by mere gamers ; in order for the game you bought at a store to work , it has to interact at all times with the company 's server online .
Consumers , naturally , are the ones to suffer .
Thanks , Ubisoft .
The French video game giant has created a form of DRM that made its big debut this week with the highly anticipated release of the PC version of Assassin 's Creed 2 .
( The game came out for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November . )
DRM is an " access control technology " used by publishers and other content owners to prevent piracy by placing limitations on how you use their products .
It is always annoying , almost by definition , but Ubisoft 's latest implementation is particularly onerous and has caused a giant kerfuffle in the gaming world .
The most glaring problem is the requirement that you always be connected to the Internet for the game to work .
Now , in today 's environment of widely available broadband , that might not seem like such a big deal .
But unless you have a perfectly flawless Internet connection ( or live in the middle of nowhere ) , you 're going to run into problems -- namely that you wo n't necessarily be able to play the game when you want .
The Wi-Fi routers typically used by consumers are cheap , flimsy things , and it's not uncommon for the signal to frequently " die . "
( I have a D - Link wireless router , and it dies four or five times per day . )
Without a constant connection to Ubisoft 's servers , the game disconnects ; you lose your game and have to wait for your connection to come back to start again .
This is an offline - only game , mind you , not an online multiplayer game like World of Warcraft .
You should n't have to connect to any server at all .
Imagine putting a new Blu-ray disc into your player and having the movie play for five minutes and then returning to the title screen because the player decided it did n't like the color of your shirt .
Would you tolerate that ?
Yes , you can almost understand where Ubisoft is coming from .
It 's merely taking the only course of action that it and other publishers think will stymie piracy .
( It wo n't . )
Ubisoft is part of a lucrative industry that is doing everything it can to protect its content .
Video games made $ 20.2 billion in 2009 and $ 22.11 billion the year before ( the industry blames the recession for the slight dip ) .
Estimates abound on what piracy costs the industry :
The best - selling game of 2009 , Activision 's Modern Warfare 2 , is said to have been illegally downloaded more than 5 million times , according to BitTorrent news site TorrentFreak .
At $ 60 per copy , that 's $ 300 million down the drain for the company .
Even going back to the days of floppy discs , publishers have made users do such things as inputting ( only once , and not over the lifetime of the product , as Ubisoft now requires ) a unique serial number at installation to prevent the disc from being passed around the office or university computer club .
Up until very recently , the only music Apple sold on its iTunes Store was wrapped tightly with DRM ; songs could be played on only one iPod at a time .
The music industry thought this would help ensure its survival , but it had long since alienated its customers with years of higher - than - necessary CD prices and uninspired pop acts hogging the spotlight ( a discussion for another day ) .
And plain old DVDs have always had DRM , too .
Ever try to copy a DVD to your laptop ?
It 's impossible without special ( and illegal , I might add ) software .
As a consumer , your options with Assassins Creed 2 are fairly limited , which has caused the ongoing uproar on gaming Web sites .
The new DRM cannot be circumvented legally -- you could pirate the game , but that would be stealing from the game developers ' tables -- and Ubisoft has said the system is here to stay .
Good luck trying to return the game , too , since many stores have a policy of only allowing a direct , one - to - one exchange of opened PC games .
The best part ?
The DRM has already been hacked !
That means unscrupulous pirates are able to play the game without having to deal with DRM at all .
They get off scot - free while legitimate customers have to jump through hoops to use what they actually paid for .
That 'll teach you to spend your money like an honest person .
[ A Ubisoft representative said that gamers who download and play a hacked version " will find that their version is not complete . " ]
All of this , of course , assumes that Ubisoft 's DRM servers are even working to begin with .
This past weekend , the servers were down for several hours .
Ubisoft initially claimed that it was because of " exceptional demand " but later admitted to being the victim of a denial of service attack , leaving legitimate customers completely unable to play the game .
Think of all the time , money and effort that Ubisoft invested in coming up with this DRM , only for it to be broken before the big game even came out , and then for the servers themselves to go down .
That 's time , money and effort the company could have put toward , you know , just making a good game .

The future of Jerusalem is one of the most emotive issues in the Middle East
By Jeremy Bowen
BBC Middle East editor
The Middle East is full of talk of war .
Not today , tomorrow or perhaps even next year but the horizon is dark , and people who have to live with the Middle East 's grim collection of smouldering problems are finding it hard to look ahead with anything other than foreboding .
By the end of this year , if sanctions have not persuaded Iran to stop what many countries insist is a nuclear weapons programme , the war party in Israel will be pushing for military action .
South Lebanon is once again looking like a tinderbox .
Insults and threats have been bandied back and forth between Syria , Israel and Hezbollah .
In Washington DC , where I have been this week , analysts say Syria has been shipping bigger and better weapons to Hezbollah , its Lebanese ally .
' Disastrous visit '
Israel assumes that there will be another war in Lebanon , and has been training its army to win it , which it could not do last time in 2006 .
And then there is the crisis between the United States , Israel and the Palestinians .
Benjamin Netanyahu's disastrous visit to Washington DC has exposed just how bad this crisis and current US - Israeli relations are .
What is even more serious is that it is centred on the future of Jerusalem , which is about the single most emotive issue in the entire Middle East .
Mr Netanyahu returns home weakened , though his ministers are declaring their support .
US President Barack Obama seems to see him as part of the problem .
The precise details of what happened in Washington between Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu are emerging only slowly .
But it is clear that the Americans want Israel to freeze building for Jews in those parts of the holy city that Israel occupied and annexed in 1967 .
The Obama administration has concluded that it will be impossible to negotiate peace while Israel continues to settle its people on occupied land .
Mr Netanyahu insists , long and loud , that he wants a peace deal if it guarantees Israeli security .
The Americans agree with that , but not with his insistence that Israel has the right to build whatever and wherever it wants in Jerusalem .
Israel 's claim that that the city is its sovereign capital is not accepted by its allies .
Political vacuum
The Americans want to start peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Their plan was to wring concessions out of Mr Netanyahu while he was in Washington that they could take to the Palestinians to persuade them to take part .
Relations between the US and Israel have dipped sharply
The president of the Palestinian authority , Mahmoud Abbas , pulled out after the Israelis announced a big building project at the Ramat Shlomo settlement in occupied East Jerusalem .
The US Vice - President Joe Biden was in Jerusalem at the time to get the talks going .
Embarrassed and angry , he condemned Israel 's plans .
Mr Netanyahu 's visit to Washington - far from ending the crisis between Israel and its most important ally - seems to have made things worse .
What is now forming around the row over Jerusalem is an old - fashioned Middle Eastern political vacuum .
When there is no political process to absorb some heat and give people even a glint of hope for the future , the result tends to be violent .
King Abdullah of Jordan , whose father made peace with Israel in 1994 , has told newspapers in Amman that Israel needs to decide between war and peace .
American pressure
If it wants peace , he says it has to stop settling Jews on occupied land .
The US State Department and the White House employ many Middle East experts who know that even if they manage to start negotiations the chances of success are low .
They are trying anyway , because the alternatives seem much worse .
But the reality is that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians are in good shape to negotiate , even assuming that they want to try ( in fact they have only dabbled with the idea because of American pressure ) .
Mr Netanyahu 's coalition government depends on the votes of nationalists who want no compromise with the Palestinians .
Mr Abbas is isolated and weak .
It is hard to see how he could deliver any agreement he made when the Palestinian national movement is split down the middle between Fatah , his faction , and Hamas , which controls Gaza .
Mr Obama has declared that Middle East peace is a strategic priority for the United States .
But just glance across the region , from Jerusalem to Beirut , then on to Damascus , Baghdad , Tehran and further east to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Never mind making peace , just avoiding war in the places that are not already fighting is going to be hard enough , and perhaps impossible .

Dear Edmonton Oilers Fans :
It is with a heavy heart that I write this letter to you today .
I know it has n't been easy for you lot this season .
What with players getting hurt all year and your team not performing as well as you had hoped .
Even with some quality players it just did n't work out .
Now you 've been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs with a league low 49 points as of this writing , your season is pretty much over .
In fact in speaking with some of your fans and reading your posts you gave up on this season some time ago .
That 's never a fun feeling .
We Coyote fans have been there many times .
It 's not a fun feeling watching your season slip away from you .
But that sadness is n't why i'm writing to you today .
No , I want to invite you back to watching and enjoying hockey again .
And to do so watching the Phoenix Coyotes both for the rest of the season and into the Playoffs .
After the Jump I 'll give you some reasons why this could be a good fit ...
Let me outline just some of the reasons that you might want to make the Coyotes your team this postseason .
These are n't meant to make fun but are real bonding reasons why we can make this work .
We hate Chris Pronger .
Yep .
We really do .
Not nearly as much as I get the feeling you do , but still it 's some common ground .
It may not have much to do with the rest of the season since he 's been banished to Philadelphia , but its a starting place for us to get to know each other .
We booed him every time he touched the ice here in Phoenix .
We understand the frustration with Nikolai Khabibulin .
There he signed a silly contract and promptly got hurt .
Here just wanted a big payday and when we said no he bolted .
He 's a decent guy , but just disappointing in a lot of ways .
We understand .
We get how absolutely infuriating inept ownership and management is .
I mean look at our team .
Up until recently this place was a friggin gong show .
When Mike Barnett ran things we just could n't get anything right .
Our contracts were all insanely dumb .
We had terrible players locked into terrible deals and no one knew what the hell they were doing .
But with that also comes hope .
Someone had the good sense to bring in Don Maloney and slowly things began to change .
Those bad players and contracts got sent off .
We started drafting better and developing players .
We stopped signing over the hill players that just were n't cutting it anymore .
Things got better .
So we 're a picture of what your team could be when Tambellini gets canned .
We both hate the Flames .
You hate them because they 're your neighbors .
We hate them because they 're jerks .
Well , to be fair you probably hate them because they 're jerks too .
We want them out of the playoffs , but we have extra motivation to do so .
See we have the Flames first round pick so the harder they fall the more we benefit .
There 's a reason beyond hate to cheer for the demise of the Flames .
Shane Doan is a great Canadian .
He was robbed not being on the Olympic team , but that 's alright .
He 's a great leader and has led Team Canada in the past .
He 's really easy to like and you already know him !
Those are just some of the things we have in common .
The biggest reason you should watch though is that this is one fun team to cheer for right now .
Despite the ownership mess they 're a really good team .
Dave Tippett has made one good team out of some parts no one thought would work .
We 're beating down on nearly everyone in the league .
Besides all the hype we 're not moving to Canada anytime soon though so do n't make that a part of you decision .
We hope you 'll get in on the ground floor and adopt our team .
Besides it 's only temporary .
You can go back to the Oilers as soon as the playoffs end .
But for now you could use a team and we could use the support .
Former WEC bantamweight champion , Miguel " Angel " Torres , today went back under the knife for the second time in little more than a week to revise the cut that Joseph Benavidez delivered to his forehead in their match at WEC 47 .
Dr. Harris Sterman of Teaneck , N.J. -- a plastic surgeon and a specialist in this type of surgery -- performed the operation .
Torres was taken to the local hospital emergency room shortly after his second round submission loss last weekend , receiving 16 stitches on the outside and seven on the inside to close the gash .
However , because he makes a living as a fighter , he and his advisers opted to revise the cut and perform a more detailed closure of the wound to ensure that it does not give him problems down the road .
Sterman , therefore , performed what is known as a four - layer closure rather than settle for the regular closure performed after the fight .
The procedure calls for the following steps :
Reopen the cut down to the bone .
Cut away on each side of the area to expose fresh skin and matter to work with and provide a very good fit to put the wound back together .
Perform a four - layer suture , which will close the posterium , the muscle , the dermis and then the epidermis .
Instead of the 23 total stitches that he received initially , this procedure will see Torres receive more than 100 stitches with small gauge sutures .
Not only will he be able to fight with no worry in the future , but he 'll be able to have an acting or modeling career , too .
Mullet and all .
Check out some of the pictures from the procedure below .

Because Congress failed to adopt a bipartisan deficit commission on its own , President Obama created one through executive order on Thursday .
This comes as a disappointment to members of both parties who had endorsed the Conrad - Gregg bill : that proposal would have forced the Congress to vote on the commission ’s recommendations , while the administration ’s initiative does not .
The failure of Conrad - Gregg was surprising as well as troubling .
By last December , the bill had garnered almost three dozen cosponsors across party lines and seemed to be gaining momentum .
Although Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell had not formally signed on , he had made a number of favorable public statements .
( Last May , for example , he proclaimed on the Senate floor that the Conrad - Gregg proposal was “ the best way to address the crisis ” and that it “ would provide an expedited pathway for fixing these profound long - term challenges . ” )
And just days before the vote , President Obama endorsed the bill .
But it was n’t enough .
On January 26 , the bill went down to defeat : 53 senators voted in favor , but it needed 60 to pass .
Democrats assembled a solid majority of 37 votes , while Republicans could muster only 16 .
As has been widely reported , seven of the bill ’s Republican cosponsors ended up voting against it ; had they remained resolute , it would have passed .
Reversing his earlier position , the minority leader also voted against the bill .
So what happened between December and January ?
Put simply , the forces within the conservative movement who oppose any and all tax increases mobilized against legislation that might have produced the long - sought grand bargain — significant entitlement reform coupled with additional revenues .
On December 9 , Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform sent a letter to Conrad and Gregg expressing his opposition to their proposal .
“ Despite the appearance of protection for taxpayers , ” he wrote , “ this commission would guarantee a net tax increase . …
In order to make this commission acceptable from a taxpayer perspective , language must be included that explicitly removes tax increases and / or new taxes from commission consideration . ”
The substantial anti-tax coalition Norquist leads then swung into action with a steady drumbeat of op - eds and open letters to elected officials .
I ’ll tell you something — I ’m really blown away by the way people have responded to AT&T ’s bastardly behavior over bandwidth usage .
Our engineers are friggin livid .
And , because they ’re engineers , which means they ’re basically evil little pricks , they ’ve come up with a plan to teach AT&T a lesson .
They ’re calling it Operation Chokehold .
Last night I got this email that they ’ve been sending around inside Apple , encouraging people to join the crusade :
Subject : Operation Chokehold
On Friday , December 18 , at noon Pacific time , we will attempt to overwhelm the AT&T data network and bring it to its knees .
The goal is to have every iPhone user ( or as many as we can ) turn on a data intensive app and run that app for one solid hour .
Send the message to AT&T that we are sick of their substandard network and sick of their abusive comments .
THe idea is we ’ll create a digital flash mob .
We ’re calling it in Operation Chokehold .
Join us and speak truth to power !
The engineers have asked me to serve as a kind of communications director for their efforts — soliciting ideas on what apps to use ( Pandora may not be the best ) and how to refine the attack on the network .
If anyone has ideas , use the comment strings .
Tell your friends .
Get people involved .
We have five days to create a movement and plan a major assault .
As the Portuguese said during the Obama campaign : Si , se puede .
FWIW , many of you probably know that Woz and I got our start by selling boxes that hacked the old phone system back in the 1970s .
I hate these idiots more than you can imagine .
The idea of spanking them like this just gives me tingles all over .
Two teens and a 12 - year - old girl are suspected of hitting a Good Samaritan in the head with a hammer and stealing her car .
The incident happened early Saturday in Colorado Springs , according to the police department ’s crime blotter .
The victim , a 35 - year - old woman , was entering a grocery store about 1 a.m. when she was approached by three juveniles , police said .
The trio told her they were stranded and needed a ride home .
The woman agreed to give them a ride after she finished her shopping .
When the woman left the store , the boy and two girls were waiting outside .
She gave them a ride to the the Winfield Apartments in the 5400 block of Grantsville Grove , police said .
The trio talked the woman into coming to their apartment to tell their parents that they had indeed been stranded .
The woman was led behind a building to a grassy area and struck on the head twice .
She fell to the ground and was kicked several times .
“ The victim was told to ‘ stay on the ground or be killed , ’ ” the blotter said .
The suspects “ forcibly ” stole the woman ’s car keys and drove off in the 2004 Honda Accord Coupe .
The victim contacted a resident at the apartment complex who called police .
A police officer spotted the car about one mile from the assault scene and stopped it at Charlotte Parkway and Anna Lee Way .
A 17 - year - old boy , a 14 - year - old girl and a 12 - year - girl were taken into custody and held on suspicion of aggravated robbery and assault .
The boy was in possession of a hammer , which investigators believe was used in the assault .
The victim was treated for her injuries at a local hospital and released .

Even dead financial institutions , it appears , are eligible for tax refunds from the federal stimulus .
Today 's Wall Street Journal lead with a report that J.P. Morgan
Chase was nearing a deal for a tax refund of nearly $ 2.6 billion , the latest example of a company taking advantage of a little - known part of President Obama 's economic stimulus program .
The stimulus law allows companies to apply losses from 2008 or 2009 to taxes paid five years ago , instead of the current two - year look back .
Another entity that may qualify for the stimulus refund is the estate of defunct Lehman Brothers .
The firm said in a December 2009 securities filing said that it " was currently evaluating the potential impact of the five - year net operating loss carry - back provision recently enacted into federal law . "
Lehman already collected a $ 350 million refund in 2009 by carrying back losses to previously paid taxes .
Several international networks have said that Iran is disrupting theirFarsi- language satellite transmissions , Israel Radio reported Friday .
BBC Radio , The Voice of America and the German network Deutsche Welledefined the interference as electronic disturbances from Iran .
The report said that the regime began to disrupt the transmissions on Thursday with the beginning of celebrations on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The Islamic nation has also been blocking GMail since Thursday .
And irony of ironies , at another hearing , a witness had just gotten to the part of her statement about “ improving access to government information ” when the chairman told her that the 2 o’clock buzzer had gone off and they were compelled to close up shop and go home .
Patrick Leahy , the Judiciary Committee chairman , was enraged because his hearing on judicial nominations could n’t go forward .
Although really , Leahy should count his blessings .
At least Jim Bunning did n’t put a hold on the nominations because of some antismoking initiative in Finland .
Carl Levin , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , begged the Senate to allow him to go ahead and hear testimony from military commanders who had come from as far as South Korea to talk about the defense budget .
Even the new , unimproved version of John McCain  the one who vowed there would be “ no cooperation for the rest of the year ”  was willing to allow an exemption for that one .
But another Republican gave a thumbs down , and the officers were dismissed for the day .
“ Disappointed , ” tweeted Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri , who had to cancel a hearing on police training contracts in Afghanistan .
Bad as we think the Republicans ’ behavior has been , it should not be taken as an excuse for senators to take out their frustrations on Twitter .
No good can come of political tweets .
Over on the Senate floor , everyone was debating the caboose to the health care train , a bill full of fixes that unfortunately was not entitled “ Act to Eliminate Embarrassing Things Feckless Senators Stuck in the Health Care Reform Act . ”
The Senate Democrats wanted to approve the exact same version that the House has passed so this debate will be over and everyone can move on to congratulating victorious college basketball teams and discussing why Republicans are opposed to a consumer protection agency for financial products .
But the Republicans drew up a slew of amendments , many of which made no sense but offered opportunities for spectacular election - year attack ads .
The most instantly famous , from Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , was the classic “ No Erectile Dysfunction Drugs to Sex Offenders . ”
This could go on for some time .
Meanwhile , feel free to remind Rush Limbaugh that he promised to move to Costa Rica if health care reform gets implemented .
Once you ’re done , you can go back and remind him that Costa Rica has national health care .
A Phoenix police sergeant was taken to the hospital Thursday night after he was attacked and bitten by a man who refused to be subdued near a Church 's Chicken parking lot , authorities said Friday .
Police were originally called out in order to respond to a fight .
Two men , one of which fled before officers arrived , walked up to the Church 's Chicken drive - through window near 4200 West Thomas Road and began assaulting a 17 - year - old female employee , according to a Phoenix police news release .
Investigators believe the two men were trying to steal the teenager 's car , which was parked across the street in a QVC pharmacy parking lot .
The sergeant , whose name has not been released , was the first to respond .
He could see a man attacking the teenager , according to the release .
The sergeant , wearing undercover clothing , approached the man in an attempt to arrest him .
The man attacked the officer .
The fight became so intense that the sergeant drew his gun and shot the man , who was believed to be 30 years old .
However , even after the man had been shot , he " did not respond to pain or commands to stop fighting , " according to authorities .
Five officers arrived , and the man continued to fight .
The man bit the sergeant on the forearm through his long - sleeved shirt , breaking the skin .
The suspect tried to grab at an officer 's gun during the fight , but he was soon subdued .
The fire department was called and , moments later , the man was fastened to a gurney , according to authorities .
At one point he was able to maneuver his handcuffs out from behind his back by sliding them under his legs .
Once his hands were in front of him , the man soon began to fight with the authorities again .
Fire personnel used a handheld Taser to subdue the man twice before they finally gained control over him .
The man was taken to the hospital where he was treated for non-life - threatening injuries .
The sergeant who was bit on the forearm was also taken to the hospital .
The condition of the suspect or any of the officers is not known at this time .
UPDATE Monday , March 8 : As more information emerges about Mr. Bedell , the less it appears that any coherent ideology was behind his actions , except that he was deeply antigovernment .
The Monitor has changed the headline , subhead , and first paragraph of this story , which originally suggested a right - wing motive .
John Patrick Bedell , whom authorities identified as the gunman in the Pentagon shooting on Thursday , appears to have been an extremist with virulent antigovernment feelings .
If so , that would make the Pentagon shooting the second violent extremist attack on a federal building within the past month .
On Feb. 18 , Joseph Stack flew a small aircraft into an IRS building in Austin , Texas .
Mr. Stack left behind a disjointed screed in which , among other things , he expressed his hatred of the government .
( For more on this incident , click here . )
Details of Mr. Bedell ’s case are still emerging .
But writings by someone with his same name and birth date , posted on the Internet , express ill will toward the government and the armed forces and question whether Washington itself might have been behind the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
However , law enforcement officials have yet to publicly state their theories as to Bedell ’s motives .
“ I have no idea what his intentions were , ” said the chief of Pentagon police , Richard Keevill , in a Friday press conference .
According to Mr. Keevill , Bedell was a California native who slowly made his way to Washington by car over the past several weeks .
At about 6:40 p.m. on Thursday , Bedell , dressed in a business suit , approached an entrance to the Pentagon that is linked to the Washington ’s Metro system .
Asked for identification , he pulled out a semiautomatic weapon and opened fire .
At that time of day , that particular Pentagon entrance is teeming with people , as it is a main connection with both subway and buses and with the building ’s vast commuter parking lots .
Because of this , it is one of the most fortified points of a fortified building .
Bedell would have had to make his way past several lines of security to reach the Pentagon interior .
He did not get far .
Two officers immediately returned fire , with a third running to their assistance .
Bedell was fatally wounded in the exchange .
Two officers were wounded but have since been released from the hospital .
“ He just reached in his pocket , pulled out a gun , and started shooting ” at point - blank range , ” Pentagon police chief Keevill said .
“ He walked up very cool .
He had no real emotion on his face . ”
According to the Associated Press , an Internet posting made by someone using the name JpatrickBedell expressed a determination to see justice served in the case of Marine Col.
James Sabow , who was found dead in his California home in 1991 .
Authorities have ruled this case a suicide , but it has become a cause célèbre among extremists who consider that ruling a coverup by the government .
The posting expressed general hatred of Washington and added that exposing the Sabow case would be “ a step toward establishing the truth of events such as the September 11 demolition , ” according to the AP .
The Pentagon attack and the destruction at the IRS building in Austin , Texas , come at a time of explosive growth in extremist - group activism across the United States , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks such organizations .
The number of US extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009 , according to a just - released SPLC annual report .
So - called “ Patriot ” groups , steeped in antigovernment conspiracy theories , grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 – an increase that the SPLC report judges as “ astonishing . ”
Bank of America Corp. approved more than $ 4 billion in 2009 pay for its investment bankers and traders , meaning those workers will collect an average of $ 300,000 to $ 500,000 for the year , according to a person familiar with the matter .
The payout represents about 19 % of the roughly $ 23 billion in revenue generated by investment - banking and capital - markets activities , this person said .
The 2009 average will be close to what the bank paid during its peak compensation year of 2006 , this person said .
The ratio of bonuses to total revenue was 27 % during that year , with investment bankers and traders receiving a total of $ 6.5 billion .
A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment about bonuses paid to specific workers for their 2009 performance .
" We tried in determining year end compensation to balance the need to pay competitively with the need to recognize the general concerns about the level of compensation on Wall Street , " he said .
Unlike some rivals , Bank of America does n't disclose bonuses for its investment bankers , who typically are among the highest - paid employees at the nation 's largest bank in assets .
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said last month it set aside $ 9.3 billion for its investment - banking employees , or $ 378,600 per person .
Bank of America 's investment - banking and global - markets units were top performers , fueling the company 's overall net income of $ 6.3 billion .
The investment - banking unit has stabilized following several high - profile departures in early 2009 as the bank absorbed securities firm Merrill Lynch & Co .

PAINKILLER USE RISING PAINKILLER USE RISING WASHINGTON 
The military is trying to curb the volume of narcotics given to troops as the number of prescriptions for painkillers and instances of drug abuse continue to soar , according to Pentagon data and recent congressional testimony .
Military doctors wrote almost 3.8 million prescriptions for pain relief for servicemembers last year — more than four times the 866,773 doses handed out in 2001 , according to data from the Pentagon health office .
VIDEO : Caregiving strains families of injured vets INTERACTIVE : A look at U.S. lives lost in Iraq , Afghanistan " These are stunning statistics , " says Sen. Jim Webb , D - Va. , who intends to look into the issue next week during a Senate subcommittee hearing that he will chair .
Surgeons general of the Army , Navy and Air Force will testify .
" I would really like to dig down in the data here and get their thoughts about what is driving this . "
Military officials and analysts say the increase in the use of narcotic pain medication reflects the continuing toll on ground troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , often through more than one combat deployment .
In addition to those who are wounded , larger numbers of soldiers and Marines develop aches and strains carrying heavy packs , body armor and weapons over rugged and mountainous terrain .
" Clearly the stress on the force , because of these continuous deployments , is a component ( in the increasing of prescriptions ) , " says Webb , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and decorated Marine veteran of Vietnam .
The Army , which has done most of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan , is examining how it gives pain relief pills to its soldiers , says Assistant Army Secretary Thomas Lamont .
A multiservice task force will outline how to limit prescription medication use and ensure that Army hospitals all use the same procedure for dispending medicine , he said .
" Our soldiers are coming back ( from combat ) wounded , sore , injured , in need of rehab , " Lamont told a Senate subcommittee last week .
" We found every Army medical center was dealing with pain in altogether different ways , all individual ... but not an Army - wide program at all , " Lamont says .
" There was no consistency . "
One in four soldiers admitted abusing prescribed drugs , mostly pain relievers , in the 12 months prior to a Pentagon survey in 2008 , according to the results released this year .
Fifteen percent said they had abused drugs in the 30 days before the survey .
" I think what we do n't understand ... is what the motivation is , " says Jack Smith , head of the clinical and program policy for the Pentagon 's Health Affairs office .
More study is needed to understand why and how troops are abusing prescription medications , he says .
Pentagon records show the abuse of prescription drugs is higher in the military than among civilians .
Five percent of civilians reported abusing prescription drugs in a 30 - day period in 2007 , compared to 11 % of military personnel surveyed in 2008 .
" The No. 1 thing we have to be focusing on here is the long - term well - being of the ( troops ) , " Webb says .
" They have no options in terms of deciding when , and how long , and how repeatedly they 're deployed .
And so it 's up to the top ( military ) leadership and us over here ( in Congress ) to make sure we 're taking care of their well - being . "

" The golden age of the Web is coming to an end .
Prepare for the Splinternet . "
Thus announces Josh Bernoff in an interesting post about how new gadgets designed for surfing the Web -- our smartphones , e-readers , tablets and even TVs -- are fighting with each other to redefine how we access information online .
But what is the " Splinternet " and why should the answer even matter to you ?*
Let 's take a step back and think about some of the new gadgets on the market .
Smartphones and e-readers are not like laptops , where each computer lets you interact the same Web .
For example , Apple iPad wo n't support Flash software , which supports most online videos .
Ben Kunz of BusinessWeek suggests this is a blatant move to force iPad users to satisfy all their video cravings through Apple stores .
Similarly , in the e-reader arms race , Apple , Sony and Amazon are competing with different libraries of books and products .
If the last 10 years were a heyday for open content on the Web , the next ten years could be the age of platforms .
Today to reach the universe of new mobile browsers , you can't assume that your audience is using only a laptop to access the same version of your content .
So it wo n't be enough to have just a magazine website .
Instead you 'll need a website and a Kindle App and an iPhone / iPad app and another app for another device that has a distinct audience and requires a specific template .
Kunz sums up the problem for content providers like this :
The device - portal tie - up is n't necessarily bad for consumers , who have plenty of choices for media consumption .
But it creates a thorny puzzle for businesses striving to build audiences .
How do you compete when your potential customers are using devices and content systems that lock one another out ?
Let 's bring this back to advertising , because money is at the heart of this platform battle .
The first wave of the ad war was fought on a couple fronts , dominated by display ads on content pages and search ads on search pages .
Google 's great revenue revelation was that you could make a bazillion dollars selling online ads next to search results , because you 're putting ads through an obvious filter : what the user wants to find .
Google has parlayed that discovery into $ 23 billion business .
It is the success story in advertising in the last five years .
China 's main science fiction magazine , Kehuan Shijie ( Science Fiction World ) , is facing a revolt from its best - known authors , because circulation dropped from 150,000 to 130,000 .
At least it 's still got some gorgeous covers , as you can see below .

Kehuan Shijie is n't alone , of course — U.S. magazines have seen steep circulation drops in recent years as well .
What 's unusual here is that the country 's top authors are incensed enough to protest about it .

The leading SF writers in China have joined a movement to remove Li Chiang as president of the magazine 's editorial board .
They 've joined a movement to unseat Li that includes an open letter signed by the magazine 's other editors , and has the support of thousands of Chinese SF fans .
Among their number is Wang Jikang , six - time winner of China 's prestigious Galaxy Award for science fiction .
( Wang 's best - known works include Life Of Ants and Cross , the story of a devastating biological warfare attack on the United States . )
According to the Xinhua News Agency :
Such editorial rebellions are rarely heard of in China as the publication sector is firmly controlled by the Communist Party and the president or editor - in - chief of a magazine is appointed by the superior administrative department ...
SFW had a circulation of 150,000 copies a month when Li took over at the beginning of 2009 , but the latest figures showed the figure has fallen to 130,000 , said a senior editor of the magazine .
" The circulation had been declining in recent years .
We are all anxious , but Li took no positive action and it kept declining , " said the editor .
Li was appointed SFW 's president and chief editor by the Sichuan Association for Science and Technology ( SAST ) , an organization of scientists and technicians under the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China .

A man has died after a 200 - kilogram pallet loaded with computer equipment fell on him at a Melbourne warehouse .
Ambulance Victoria said the man , aged in his 50s , died at the scene in Laverton North just after 3:00 pm ( AEDT ) yesterday .
" It appears the man was helping others unload a large computer server from the back of a truck , " ambulance spokesman Mark Lamb said .
" The equipment has started to slip from a forklift and it appears the man has tried to stop it .
" It has then fallen on him and he has suffered critical head and chest injuries . "
Workmates applied CPR before fires crews and paramedics arrived , but the man died a short time later .

A federal appeals court is ordering a university student to pay the Recording Industry Association of America $ 27,750 – $ 750 a track – for file sharing 37 songs when she was a high school cheerleader .
The decision Thursday by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a Texas federal judge who had ordered defendant Whitney Harper to pay $ 7,400 , or $ 200 per song .
The lower court had granted her an " innocent infringer 's " exemption to the Copyright Act 's minimum of $ 750 per track because she said she did n't know she was violating copyrights and thought file sharing was akin to internet radio streaming .
The appeals court , however , said the woman was not eligible for such a defense – even if it was true she was between 14 and 16 years old when the infringing activity occurred on Limewire .
The reason , the court concluded , is that the Copyright Act precludes such a defense if the legitimate CDs of the music in question provide copyright notices .
" Harper can not rely on her purported legal naivety [ sic ] to defeat the … bar to her innocent infringer defense , " the New Orleans - based appeals court ruled unanimously , 3 - 0 .
Harper , now 22 and a Texas Tech senior , said in 2008 interview that she did n't know what she did was wrong when she file shared Eminem , the Police , Mariah Carey and others as a teen .
" I knew I was listening to music .
I did n't have an understanding of file sharing , " she said .
Scott Mackenzie , the woman 's attorney , said Friday that " She 's going to graduate with a federal judgment against her . "
The RIAA , which has sued thousands of people for infringement , labeled Harper as " vexatious " when she refused to settle the case .
Harper 's case moved up the judicial ladder without a trial .
Mackenzie said he was mulling whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Only two RIAA cases against individuals have gone to trial , both of which earned the RIAA whopping verdicts .
Most of the thousands of RIAA file sharing cases have settled out of court for a few thousand dollars .
The RIAA is winding down its 6 - year - old litigation campaign targeting individual file sharers and instead is working with internet service providers to adopt rules that could cut off or hinder internet access to copyright scofflaws .
The first RIAA case to go to trial against an individual concerned Jammie Thomas .
A Minnesota jury ordered the woman to pay $ 1.92 million for file sharing 24 songs .
The judge in the case reduced the award to $ 54,000 – $ 2,250 a track .
The second case concerns Joel Tenenbaum , a Boston University grad student who a jury ordered to pay $ 675,000 for file sharing 30 tracks last year .
Tenenbaum has asked the judge in the case to lower the award .
A decision is pending .

Many people are somewhat familiar with Google Adsense , Yahoo , Bidvertiser , Chitika , Adbrite ...etc .
However , most of them actually do n't know what they are and how their system is working .
All of those mentioned above are advertising programs pay per impression , pay per click or sales .
How can we make benefit from these programs ?
To make money by advertising , we should have own website or at least a blog .
Before designing a website , we should purchase a hosting and a domain .
So , to do this we should spend money .
By roughly guess , it costs nearly 100$ .
What about blogs ?
They are completely free to use .
No need spend money .
Before stepping to blogs huge world , you should determine what blog program you should choose .
Blogger , Typepad , Livejournal and Wordpress are the most well - known ones .
However , adding advertising codes may be problematic for them .
Blogger has many advantages when compared to others .
For example , it lets you add codes freely .
Wordpress has no option for this if you use its own domain .
Prior to blogging , you should be specific on your blog .
All of the publishings are based on the general concept of your blog .
For example , if your blog is about travel , you had better not to add food or art related contents .
Before adding advertsing codes , you should be sure about your blog has enough article or publishing .
Generally , 10 is enough to be accepted by advertisers .
If you believe you are ready , it is the time to join the programs and add their codes .
Adbrite , Google Adsense , Yahoo and Bidvertiser work in a similar manner .
However , Yahoo is an option only for USA , Canada and Australia .
Bidvertiser is good but their advertisements is limited .
The god way is it acceptes many languages and pays via Paypal .
I do n't like Adbrite because their payment rates are quite low and they pay only by cheque .
Adsense , the most popular one among them , is open to whole world and accepts all languages as in Bidvertiser .
They pay via Cheque , Direct transfer to a valid bank account and Western Union .
If you reach the minimum payout amount , probably you will get a payment from Google at the end of next month .
To join Google Adsense , you should simply fill the form in Adsense page .
You have give your identity information , address and url of your site or blog .
Google engineers will check your site in at most 1 week and send a message about your approval .
After being approved , every click will be money for you and turned to an extra income one day .

Ultimately , she decides to stay in Iowa .
It ’s only years later after her death that her children discover her diaries and learn about this time in their mother ’s life .
23 . WALL-E
“ Eeeee … va ? ’’
Though we would n’t classify “ WALL - E ’’ as a “ romantic ’ ’ film per se , the story line between WALL-E , a Waste Allocation Lift Loader , and EVE , an Extra - terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator , is particularly heartwarming .
WALL -E is in awe of EVE — sleek , shining , New Age — a counterpoint to his version 1.0 technology .
It all comes together for the pair when , mimicking a scene from “ Hello , Dolly ! ’’ he ’s watched ( presumably ) hundreds of times , WALL - E reaches out to hold EVE ’s “ hand . ’’
22 . SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE
“ This is our destiny ’ ’
From the time they were children living in the slums of India , Jamal ( Dev Patel ) has always felt compelled to protect Latika ( Freida Pinto . )
After they get separated , Jamal spends the rest of his life searching for her and finally appears on a “ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ’ ’ type game show as a way to bring her to him .
It is their destiny , after all .
21 . BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S
“ Did I tell you how divinely and utterly happy I am ? ’’
For all her fancy clothes and parties , beneath the facade of her Upper East Side lifestyle , effervescent socialite Holly Golightly ( Audrey Hepburn ) is lonely .
When the writer Paul Varjak ( George Peppard ) moves in to her building , they find in each other what they ’ve been looking for .
Perhaps the most romantic scene is at the film ’s closing , when Paul arrives in a cab to pick up Holly from prison , her nameless cat in tow .
20 . SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
“ Like a sickness and its cure together ’’ Like a storyline out of one of the Bard ’s plays , Viola de Lesseps ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) disguises herself as a man so she can act in a William Shakespeare production ( back then , women were n’t allowed to act in plays . )
In the meantime , the real Viola falls for “ Will ’’ ( Joseph Fiennes ) , as he ’s referred to throughout , and their story bleeds into his scripts .
The film won seven Academy Award nominations , garnering Paltrow her first Oscar nomination and subsequent win .
19 . BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN
“ I wish I knew how to quit you ’’
Set in the 1960s , Ennis ( Heath Ledger ) and Jack ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) are sheep herders who spend months of the year living in isolation atop the rugged Brokeback Mountain .
When they develop feelings for each other , it ’s something neither of them can ignore and each will spend decades torn between what society expects from them and their passion for each other .
Based on the short story by Annie Proulx , the film won three Academy Awards .
18 . LEGENDS OF THE FALL
“ I ’ll wait for you .
However long it takes .
I ’ll wait for you forever ’’
This sprawling epic set in Montana tells the story of the Ludlow family ’s heartbreak and sacrifice in the early 1900s .
Tristan ( Brad Pitt ) is tortured and distraught after his brother Samuel is killed in WWI .
Soon after Tristan ’s return , he begins a relationship with Samuel ’s fiancee , Susannah ( Julia Ormond ) .
But Tristan is restless and leaves , ending their relationship in a letter .
When back again , he discovers that Susannah has married his other brother , Alfred , so Tristan marries Isabel , and with her builds the life that Susannah always wanted .
17 . LOVE ACTUALLY
“ To me , you are perfect ’ ’
This 2003 holiday film is laced with all different stories of love : puppy love , lost love , unrequited love , and great big declarations of feelings .
The most romantic scene ( for us ) is perhaps also the most heartbreaking .
Mark ( Andrew Lincoln ) , long smitten with his best friend ’s girl ( Keira Knightley ) , appears at her door with a series of hand written posters expressing what he ’s always wanted to say : “ To me , you are perfect . ’’
He gets us every time .
16 . JERRY MAGUIRE
“ You had me at ‘ Hello ’ ’
Is there anything as heartbreaking and frustrating and yet at the same time completely fulfilling and joyous as the relationship we have with sports ?
At least that ’s the case for football agent Jerry Maguire ( Tom Cruise ) , who ’s trying to rebuild his career after getting fired for pointing out the moral corruption in his company .
Along the way he falls for Dorothy ( Renee Zellweger ) and is forced to admit — to himself and to her — that there ’s more than just one love in his life .
“ You complete me , ’’ he tells her , and boy , do we believe him .
15 . SAY ANYTHING
“ I gave her my heart , and she gave me a pen ’ ’
Admit it : if the person you were crushing on stood outside your window blasting Peter Gabriel ’s “ In Your Eyes ’ ’ like Lloyd Dobler ( John Cusack ) does in “ Say Anything , ’’ you ’d be smitten too .
Not only is this one of the best expressions of love on film , but it ’s also become an icon in its own right , spoofed by countless TV shows and movies .
It ’s a brazen , unabashedly romantic display of affection and it ’s the perfect way to kick off our countdown .
14 . GONE WITH THE WIND
“ Frankly , my dear , I do n’t give a damn ’’
Based on the Pulitzer Prize - winning novel by Margaret Mitchel , “ Gone With the Wind ’’ tells the story of the selfish Southern belle Scarlett O’Hara ( Vivien Leigh ) and the hardships she must endure — the Civil War , loss , dead husbands .
She ’s rather opportunistic , but so is Rhett Butler ( Clark Gable ) , her third husband and the first man who wo n’t play her games .
It ’s a sprawling , epic story about love and loss , disappointment and heartache .
13 . TITANIC
“ I ’ll never let go , Jack ’ ’
She was upperclass , well - bred , and educated , while he rode in steerage with the rest of the poor .
James Cameron ’s 1997 epic about Rose ( Kate Winslet ) and Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) was a tearjerker for sure : these two were doomed from the start .
Any obstacles their polarizing life stations may have incurred were null and void as soon as the ship hit that iceberg .
12 . AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER
“ There must be something between us , even if it ’s only an ocean ’’
Leaving it all up to fate is a dangerous gamble , especially when it comes to matters of the heart .
Though they ’re both involved with other people , Nicky ( Cary Grant ) and Terry ( Deborah Kerr ) ca n’t help but fall for each other aboard a cruise bound for New York City .
Is it their destiny to be together ?
They plan to meet six months later at the top of the Empire State Building — if it ’s meant to be , then both will be single by then .
But fate has other plans .
11 . BULL DURHAM
“ You ’re playing with my mind ’’ A pitcher , a catcher , and one adoring fan … a little too adoring .
The game of baseball turns into a love triangle when Annie Savoy ( Susan Sarandon ) goes after two players on the same minor league team , the Durham Bulls : Crash Davis ( Kevin Costner ) and Ebby Calvin “ Nuke ’’ LaLoosh ( Tim Robbins ) .
Romance , and comedy , ensue .
10 . ROMEO + JULIET
“ You kiss by the book ’’
There ’s a moment during Baz Luhrmann ’s 1996 adaptation of William Shakespeare ’s play about star - crossed lovers where we hope ( in vain ) that it just might work out .
In the film ’s final moments , Juliet lays comatose , having swallowed a potion to fake her own death .
But Romeo missed the message and presumes her dead , ending his own life just as his love wakes .
The two lock eyes knowing the huge mistake that ’s been made , leaving Juliet with only one option : to follow suit .
9. ROMANCING THE STONE
“ You ’re the best time I ’ve ever had ’’
What ’s more romantic than getting lost in your own love story ?
Romance novelist Joan Wilder ( Kathleen Turner ) embarks on a journey to Colombia to save her kidnapped sister .
She winds up in her own action - adventure tale packed with danger .
But when she gets lost in a jungle , she meets Jack Colton ( Michael Douglas ) , the alluring adventurer who says he ’ll get her out of harms way — a passionate reality for one fiction writer and her daring companion .
8. BEFORE SUNRISE
“ I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away ’’
What if you only had one day to spend with a stranger you just met who you ca n’t stop thinking about ?
Carpe diem !
American tourist Jesse ( Ethan Hawke ) meets French student Celine ( Julie Delpy ) on a train to Vienna .
Sparks fly , so they decide to spend the day in the city before Jesse leaves the next morning .
A kiss , intimate glances , shared laughs — and an intensity caused by the shortage of time .
Can they tear themselves away ?
That ’s the hook that draws us in and does n’t let go ( oh to be on such a trip ourselves ) .
7. PRETTY WOMAN
“ You and I are such similar creatures Vivian .
We both screw people for money ’’ Edward Lewis ( Richard Gere ) is handsome , charming , rich — and alone .
Vivian Ward , a pretty prostitute with a loud mouth , walks the streets in tatters , wears a wig , is broke , and never kisses on the lips .
Edward picks her up one lonely night , and to Vivian ’s surprise and delight , he asks her to spend the week with him in his luxury hotel for money .
She eventually transforms into a beauty , both outside and in .
And Edward , the ruthless businessman , finds his softer side .
While this appears a Cinderella story , they really save each other .
6. GHOST
“ I love you , Molly .
I ’ve always loved you ’’ Sam Wheat ( Patrick Swayze ) loves Molly Jensen ( Demi Moore ) so much that he just ca n’t seem to leave her side — even after death .
When a mugging goes wrong , Sam is killed , and Molly is devastated .
An unsuspecting stranger , Oda Mae Brown ( Whoopi Goldberg ) , can communicate with Sam ’s ghost , leading her to find Molly at Sam ’s beckoning .
Molly ’s in danger , and Sam will do anything to save the woman he loves .
When Molly is safe and Sam goes toward the light , they finally say good - bye .
The duo may let each other go , but their passion ( remember the pottery scene ? ) can never be forgotten .
5. DIRTY DANCING
“ Nobody puts Baby in a corner ’ ’
Is there anything more romantic than a guy who will go to bat for the girl he adores ?
Despite a class division laden with socioeconomic tension , Johnny ( Patrick Swayze ) sums up what we ’ve all been thinking with his famous line .
He escorts Baby ( Jennifer Grey ) away from her mother and father and onto the stage for one last dance as a celebration of their summer together and as an acknowledgment that what they had was real .
Cue that Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes song .
4. THE PRINCESS BRIDE
“ As you wish ’’ After Westley ’s one true love — Buttercup — is nabbed by Prince Humperdink , he sets out to rescue her .
It ’s your typical fairytale framework : sword fights , royals , dungeons , and wizards all factor into this 1987 flick .
But it ’s Westley ’s tenacity in the face of endless difficulty and his sheer will to rescue the woman he loves that bumps “ The Princess Bride ’ ’ toward the top of our list .
As you wish , indeed .
Pictured : Robin Wright Penn as Buttercup and Cary Elwes as Westley .
3. THE NOTEBOOK
“ It was n’t over – it still is n’t over ’’
Just try not to cry while watching this 2004 flick based on a Nicholas Sparks novel .
It ’s a tearjerker for sure , but there ’s an underlying sentimentality that rings true .
What really does us in is the juxtaposition of Noah ( Ryan Gosling ) and Allie ’s ( Rachel McAdams ) story of young love set against the modern reality of Allie ’s deteriorating health .
2. WHEN HARRY MET SALLY
“ When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody , you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible ’’
The thing that puts this 1989 film ( written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner ) so high on our list is that its story is true to life .
The romance here is in the waiting .
It takes Harry ( Billy Crystal ) and Sally ( Meg Ryan ) years — filled with broken hearts , false starts , and other people ’s weddings — before they realize what they ’ve needed all along is each other .

1000 Rabbis Warn : Open Homosexuality in the Military is a Disaster and May Cause Further Natural Disasters
Contact : Rabbi Yehuda Levin , Spokesman , Rabbinical Alliance of America 718-469-6999
MEDIA ADVISORY , Feb. 2 / Christian Newswire / -- Rabbi Yehuda Levin , spokesman for the Rabbinical Alliance of America issued the following statement :
" When Americans are suffering economically and millions need jobs , it 's shocking that the Administration is focused on its ultra-liberal militantly homosexualist agenda forcing the highlighting of homosexuals and homosexuality on an unwilling military .
This is the equivalent of the spiritual rape of our military to satisfy the most extreme and selfish cadre of President Obama 's kooky coalition .
We agree with Eileen Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness that this will hurt the cohesiveness of the military , cause many to leave the army , and dramatically lower the number of recruits , perhaps leading to the reinstatement of a compulsory draft .
" Thirteen months before 9/11 , on the day New York City passed homosexual domestic partnership regulations , I joined a group of Rabbis at a City Hall prayer service , pleading with G-d not to visit disaster on the city of N.Y .
We have seen the underground earthquake , tsunami , Katrina , and now Haiti .
All this is in sync with a two thousand year old teaching in the Talmud that the practice of homosexuality is a spiritual cause of earthquakes .
Once a disaster is unleashed , innocents are also victims just like in Chernobyl .
" We plead with saner heads in Congress and the Pentagon to stop sodomization of our military and our society .
Enough is enough . "

Youtube poster Media Matters Action Network says that Wolf Blitzer was " surprised " by Jack Cafferty ’s viewer criticisms of Israel , and this is the case .
Cafferty takes an atypically - sober tone , cautiously criticizing the Israel - US special relationship , suggesting that we should " start cutting back on the approximately 2.5 billion in aid we give to Israel every year …. " and quoting Maureen Dowd saying that the White House is " appalled by Israel ’s self - absorption . "
Then he polls viewers .
The letters Cafferty reads are critical of Israel , 6 - 1 .
The 1 is repulsive : " We should be helping Israel occupy as much Arab land as possible . "
" You got a lot of emails ? " Blitzer asks .
" And most of it was anti-Israel , you would say ? "
Cafferty then says this was a helluva way to treat Biden , the 1600 new settlements .
Blitzer agrees : " I think a lot of people were very , very upset about it , including by the way in Israel . "

James Brown 's body is ' missing from its crypt ' , alleges singer 's daughter
James Brown 's daughter has claimed the singer 's body has gone missing from its crypt .
LaRhonda Pettit , 48 , alleges the body of Brown , who died in December 2006 aged 73 , is being hidden to prevent a full autopsy being carried out .
Ms Pettit said the official cause of death , which was said to be a heart attack brought by pneumonia , is not the real reason behind the Godfather of Soul 's passing .
James Brown 's daughter believes the singer 's body has gone missing from its crypt
She said : ' My daddy 's body has disappeared .
I have no clue where it was taken , but I need to know where .
' I'm convinced his death was suspicious and I want the people responsible brought to justice .
' The only way to do that is to exhume his body and have an autopsy .
I cannot understand why one was never conducted .'
Brown 's body was said to have been embalmed following his death , and was reportedly contained in a sealed casket at his South Carolina home
Ms Pettit , who underwent a DNA test in 2007 to prove she was Brown 's daughter , believes there were several people involved in Brown 's death .
She added to America 's Globe newspaper : ' It was common knowledge that my daddy took illegal drugs .
' He was also hooked on various prescription painkillers .
At the very least there were enablers who helped cause his death . '
Ms Pettit , who is 99.99 per cent likely to be Brown 's daughter , said the singer had a relationship with her mother after meeting her at one of his performances in the 1960s .
She is one of 12 people who came forward following Brown 's death claiming to be one of his illegitimate children .
Brown 's body is said to have been sealed in a temporary crypt at his daughter Deanna 's South Carolina
Home while arrangements are made for his permanent burial .
Nachdem sich die Zentralstelle für private Überspielrechte ( ZPÜ ) zum Jahreswechsel mit einer kleinen Gruppe von PC - Herstellern – die eigens den Bundesverband Computerhersteller e.V. ( BCH ) gründet hatten – auf die Höhe und Modalitäten der Urheberrechtsabgabe auf PCs geeinigt hatte , legten die Verwertungsgesellschaften auch bei den Abgaben auf Speichermedien gleich noch nach .
Wie aus einer Veröffentlichung im Bundesanzeiger vom Jahresende 2009 hervorgeht , werden die Abgaben auf Medien wie CD - und DVD - Rohlinge aber auch Blu-rays zum Teil drastisch angehoben – bei CD - Rs sei es beispielsweise der dreifache Satz , erklärt Ralf Schnur , Geschäftsführender Gesellschafter beim Großhändler Software Partner GmbH , gegenüber heise resale .
Ralf Schnur , Geschäftsführer , Software Partner ( Bild : Software Partner )
Dem Vorstoß der ZPÜ war – wie schon im Fall der PC - Abgabe – ein Scheitern der Verhandlungen mit den zuständigen Branchengremien , in erster Linie dem Informationskreis Aufnahmemedien , vorausgegangen .
Und auch hier sind sich die betroffenen Medien - Anbieter und - Importeure uneinig über die künftige Vorgehensweise im Hinblick auf die von der ZPÜ verlangten Abgaben .
Nach Informationen von Schnur wenden unter anderen Bestmedia ( mit der Marke Platinum ) und Philips die neuen Sätze bereits an , während der japanische Hersteller Verbatim noch kein Einlenken signalisiert – der Anbieter ist offensichtlich bereit , es auf eine gerichtliche Auseinandersetzung mit der ZPÜ ankommen zu lassen .
Denn nachdem der bisher gültige Gesamtvertrag für CD - und DVD - Rohlinge , der nur bis 31 .
Dezember 2007 ( für Audio - CD - R bis Ende 2008 ) lief und gemäß Übergangsregelung nach dem Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz ( UrhWG ) bis zum 31 .
Dezember 2009 gültig blieb , muss nun ein neuer Vertrag geschlossen werden .
Dieser scheiterte bisher an den auseinander klaffenden Ansichten der Verhandlungsparteien .
Daher muss die zuständige Schiedsstelle des Deutschen Patent - und Markenamtes ( DPMA ) eine Lösung finden – mit einem Urteil rechnen Branchenvertreter frühestens im März .
Aber auch ein Urteil der Schiedsstelle muss noch keine endgültige Entscheidung in der Sache bedeuten .
Herstellern und Handel steht anschließend noch immer der Weg der Klage gegen die Tarifforderungen der Verwertungsgesellschaften offen .
Gegebenenfalls muss sich dann noch das Oberlandesgericht München oder gar der Bundesgerichtshof mit dem Streit um die Urheberrechtsabgabe auf Speichermedien auseinandersetzen .
Abgaben auf Speichermedien steigen zum Teil drastisch
Unterdessen wird die unkoordinierte Einführung der neuen Abgabensätze nach Einschätzung von Vertretern des Handels hierzulande zu einer weiteren drastischen Wettbewerbsverzerrung führen , da es durch die unterschiedliche Vorgehensweise verschiedener Anbieter zu erheblichen Preisunterschieden kommen werde .
So sieht der neue Tarif der ZPÜ , der den bis Ende 2009 gültigen alten Gesamtvertrag ablöst , für Blu-ray - Discs mit 25 GByte Speicherkapazität beispielsweise eine Abgabe von 3,47 Euro vor .
Der aktuelle Verkaufspreis inklusive Mehrwertsteuer liegt bei ungefähr 4 Euro – damit droht eine Verdopplung des Preises .
Wie ZPÜ - Sprecherin Gaby Schilcher auf Anfrage von heise resale mitteilte , würden die Abgabensätze stets rückwirkend ermittelt , sodass auch andere Verkaufspreise zugrundegelegt werden mussten .
Im Falle von Blu-ray beispielsweise sei die Kalkulation auf Basis der Daten zum 1 .
Januar 2008 erfolgt , als der Medienpreis noch bei knapp 14 Euro gelegen habe .
Die ZPÜ wolle jedoch die aktuelle Preisentwicklung und eine etwaige Anpassung des Tarifs prüfen .
Generell werden aber die durch empirische Studien ermittelte Nutzung der einzelnen Medien sowie der Verkaufspreis für die Festlegung des Tarifs herangezogen – dabei orientiere sich die ZPÜ exakt an den Vorgaben der Paragrafen 54 und 54a des Urheberrechtsgesetzes ( UrhG ) .
Den jüngsten Studien und Berechnungsmodellen der Verwertungsgesellschaften zufolge habe sich eine zum Teil deutliche Änderung des Nutzungsverhaltens im Hinblick auf die privaten Kopien urheberrechtlich geschützter Daten gezeigt – daraus ergeben sich die Abgabenerhöhungen für einzelne Medientypen .
Im Falle der CD - R beispielsweise galt nach dem alten Gesamtvertrag lediglich eine Abgabenpflicht von 7,2 Cent je " Spielstunde " des Mediums – und das auch nur für 30 Prozent aller CD - Rohlinge .
Der neue Tarif sieht nun eine Abgabe von 6,2 Cent vor – für jeden CD - Rohling .
Damit ergibt sich annähernd eine Verdreifachung der Abgabe auf CD - Rs .
Noch deutlicher fällt die Erhöhung bei CD - RWs aus , für die bisher der gleiche Tarif wie für CD - Rs galt .
Die Abgabe steigt auf 19,7 Cent pro Stück – versechsfacht sich also in etwa .
Begründet wird diese Differenzierung von Seiten der ZPÜ mit dem Verweis auf die empirischen Studien , die gezeigt hätten , dass auf wiederbeschreibbaren Medien " weitaus mehr vergütungspflichtige Privatkopien " gemacht würden .
Für DVD - Rohlinge galt nach dem alten Tarif eine einheitliche Abgabe von 8,7 Cent je " Spielstunde " .
Künftig verlangt die ZPÜ pro Medium 13,9 Cent bei DVD +/-R ( 4,7 GByte ) , 27,1 Cent bei DVD +/-RW ( 4,7 GByte ) und 55 Cent bei DVD - RAM ( 4,7 GByte ) . ( map )
i usually do n’t get up early enough during the week for breakfast , but on the weekend , all bets are off .
i like 2 eggs , home fries , sausage , toast , orange juice , coffee … you get the idea .
sometimes we switch it up and make waffles , but nothing beats homemade pancakes .
if you do n’t like getting up early even on the weekends for breakfast , you can do what we often do around here , which is make breakfast for dinner .
in fact , the very first time i had the girl over to my place in college ( on valentine ’s day if i remember correctly ) , i made her pancakes , sausage , home fries and eggs…ok , maybe a little too much food for a romantic evening in retrospect , but it must have worked at least a little bit .
so back to these pancakes .
i know , i know , bananas , and bacon , and buttermilk .
but here ’s the good thing – you can leave out ( or substitute in the case of buttermilk ) any of these and still have a seriously delicious breakfast ( or dinner ) .
the basis for them comes from mark bittman , and in a cookbook with millions of recipes , his basic pancake recipe is one of the few i have bookmarked .
the crumbled bacon does give the pancakes a smoky flavor without being too overwhelming , but what really helps push the pancakes over the top is actually cooking them in bacon fat .
needlessly decadent ?
possibly , but in addition to providing flavor , the fat gives the pancakes a perfectly crispy outside .
as i write this , dc is scheduled to get a ridiculous amount of snow over the next few days , so there ’s a good chance we ’ll be stuck around the house .
i’m predicting some snow day pancakes in our immediate future …
bacon banana buttermilk pancakes
makes 4 - 6 servings .
adapted from How to Cook Everything .
2 cups all - purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp sugar
2 eggs
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
2 Tbsp melted and cooled butter
2 bananas , smashed
3 pieces crumbled bacon
bacon fat for greasing the pan ( or butter if bacon fat is not available )
1. cook up bacon and crumble .
reserve and strain the fat .
y0u can do this a day or two before , keeping the bacon fat in the refrigerator .
2. melt the butter and let cool to room temperature .
3. mix the flour , baking soda , salt and sugar in a bowl .
set aside .
4. combine the buttermilk , eggs , cooled melted butter , smashed bananas , and the crumbled bacon .
mix in the dry ingredients until just combined .
it is ok if there are some small bits of flour .
let the batter sit for 5 minutes .
5. heat up a skillet and spoon on just enough bacon fat or butter to coat the surface .
ladle on a spoonful of batter and cook until bubbles begin to appear on the top of the pancake .
flip and let cook for another few minutes , until both sides are golden brown .
note : if you do n’t have buttermilk , you can substitute regular milk but increase the baking soda to 1 Tbsp .
THE government 's decision to formulate a new population policy , emulating China 's single - child families by 2015 , to avoid a serious socio- economic debacle due to ever - increasing population is an eminently sensible one .
According to the draft policy , couples having only one child will be given preference in all state facilities , including the government 's assistance during admission to educational institutions .
China implemented the " one child per couple " policy in 1979 , which was the most aggressive family planning policy in modern times .
It was aimed at boosting economic development , optimising use of resources and improving welfare of the people .
At the outset , most couple had , on average 2.75 children .
But this figure had fallen to 1.72 by 2006 .
The draft policy , which is reported to be in the final stage with the health and family welfare ministry , wishes to engage 20 other ministries for its implementation .
The health ministry will lead the population control program while the education ministry is likely to include family planning issues in the academic curriculum , while the religious affairs ministry may ask the religious leaders to speak for family planning and the information ministry would direct the media for wide publicity of the program .
A National Population Council ( NPC ) , headed by the prime minister , has already been formed to formulate the policy .
The council includes the ministers and secretaries concerned , divisional chiefs , heads of leading NGOs , population experts , sociologists and public health experts .
Bangladesh is not on the right track as far as its population growth is concerned .
More than 150 million people are virtually elbowing one another in about 55 thousand square miles .
It is the most densely populated country in the world , where more than 1,100 people on average live in 1 sq km .
The country will not be able to sustain such a huge population even with faster economic development .
Population growth poses a major social , economic and political challenge to the government , and is a barrier to all socio- economic progress including healthcare , education , accommodation and employment .
Things are growing worse with massive migration of rural people to cities and towns in search of jobs as the rural economy is unable to provide them with the bare necessities of life .
China had to face a series of unwanted events .
The major problem among Chinese couples was the tradition in which all families must have a boy to carry on the family name .
As there is a preference for boys in Bangladesh too , tighter control on population would that mean more and more female infants would be eliminated before they were born .
The one child policy was enforced in China by imposition of steep penalties in the form of " social compensation fee " for having a second child .
This was possible as a communist government was in power .
Recent surveys among young urban Chinese show many of them prefer to have only one child because of the cost of raising children and their busy new lifestyles .
Health Minister A.F.M. Ruhul Haque told the Parliament on January 17 that the government was planning to offer various facilities to parents who had only one child .
The government will give a reception to the parents of one child to encourage people to have one child .
Only reception is not likely to allure couples belonging to the poor and uneducated section of the society to have one child .
In China those who volunteer to have one child are awarded a Certificate of Honour for Single Child Parent .
The Bangladesh government may seriously think of issuing Social Security Cards to the parents of single child to assure them free treatment in public hospitals , free journey by public transports , social security in old age and stipend for education of the child .
Millions of couples in Bangladesh are compelled to bank on more children for old age support .
The first population policy was formulated in 1976 , which identified the population problem as the number one national problem .
Fertility rates declined significantly and the country achieved remarkable success in family planning after implementation of the policy .
The population control program is now faltering , and the fatal effects are being palpably felt everywhere in the country .
The new population policy should focus on improving the living conditions of the overwhelming masses in rural areas , and providing them productive employment and other essential inputs to help them get out of their chronic poverty .
It must also contain a provision to prevent early marriage and premature pregnancy .
The draft policy should be made available to the public for evaluation and expert opinion .
The population boom in Bangladesh is like a time - bomb waiting to explode sooner than one realises unless drastic actions are taken to arrest it .
Extreme overpopulation warrants an extreme measures like the single - child policy to save the country from demographic disaster .
But the implementation of such a policy in a country like Bangladesh is a gigantic task .
Given Bangladesh 's social and religious traditions , the government must put in place the right kind of action plans supported by dedicated and devoted field workers .
Motivational door - to - door campaigns and service delivery at the field level would be more helpful in attaining the goal of population control than the city - based media campaigns .
As the country cannot afford to bear such a demographic burden , the government should seriously consider setting up a separate ministry fully capable of delivering the goods .
Any dilly - dally in doing so will be literally dangerous for the nation .

The Elusive Canadian Housing Bubble , Submitted by Alec Pestov
This paper explores the subject of a possible housing bubble in Canada .
It examines a diverse array of factors that may have contributed to the rise in house prices in Canada .
The paper evaluates each factor individually and determines the health of the Canadian housing market using common valuation techniques .
Results suggest that economic fundamentals in Canada provide little explanation for the Canadian house price dynamics .
Market fundamentals have become insignificant in affecting house prices , and the price - momentum conditions characteristic of a bubble now exist .
The extreme decoupling of the market prices from the underlying fundamentals suggests an upcoming correction in housing prices in Canada .
In fact , I contend that with a bit of savvy , patience and a willingness to forgo steel - handle knives , copper pots and other extravagant items , $ 200 can equip a basic kitchen that will be adequate for just about any task , and $ 300 can equip one quite well .

To prove my point I put together a list of everything needed for almost any cooking task .
I bought most of the equipment at Bowery Restaurant Supply , 183 Bowery Street ( Delancey Street ) , where the bill came to just about $ 200 .
Throw in a few items the store did n’t have and a few extras , and the total would be about $ 300 .
( New York happens to have scores of restaurant supply shops , but every metropolitan area has at least one . )
I started with an eight - inch , plastic - handle stainless alloy chef ’s knife for $ 10 .
This is probably the most essential tool in the kitchen .
People not only obsess about knives ( and write entire articles about them ) , but you can easily spend over $ 100 on just one .
Yet go into any restaurant kitchen and you will see most of the cooks using this same plastic - handle Dexter - Russell tool .
( Go to the wrong store and you ’ll spend $ 20 or even $ 30 on the same knife . )
Video
I found an instant - read thermometer , a necessity for beginning cooks and obsessive - compulsives , for $ 5 .
Three stainless steel bowls — not gorgeous and maybe a little thin — set me back about $ 5 .
You are reading that right .
Sturdy tongs , an underappreciated tool : $ 3.50 ( do n’t buy them too long , make sure the spring is nice and tight , and do n’t shop for them at a “ culinary ” store , where they ’ll cost four times as much ) .
For less than $ 6 I picked up a sturdy sheet pan .
It ’s not an ideal cookie sheet but it ’s useful for roasting and baking ( not a bad tray , either , and one of the more common items in restaurant kitchens ) .
A plastic cutting board was about the same price .
For aesthetic purposes I ’d rather have wood , but plastic can go into the dishwasher .
EARLIER this year , Nasser al - Neyadi from the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) leapt off Dubai 's newly opened Burj Khalifa , the tallest building in the world .
He descended 672 metres ( 2,205 feet ) in less than a minute , his fall broken by a parachute which opened ten seconds into the jump .
From the heady heights it reached in 2008 , Dubai , one of seven members of the UAE , has fallen almost as far and as fast .
Its hopes for a soft landing have always rested with its wealthy neighbour , Abu Dhabi , which sits on over 90 % of the UAE 's oil reserves .
But for a few horrible weeks at the end of last year , Dubai 's parachute refused to open — or perhaps the emirate simply fumbled as it reached for the ripcord .
In November Dubai threatened to default on a $ 4.05 billion sukuk , or Islamic bond , issued by Nakheel , a troubled property developer belonging to Dubai World , one of three government - owned conglomerates that set the pace for Dubai 's development .
The announcement threw the emirate and the global credit markets into a vertiginous free - fall .
As the ground approached , Abu Dhabi released more funds and the sukuk was eventually paid on time .
But Dubai World 's other debts remained to be restructured .
It was not clear who would get paid , how much or when .
However , on Thursday March 25th Dubai provided some answers to those questions .
It announced no new money from its neighbour or anywhere else .
But it spelled out in greater detail than before how its existing bail - out funds would be divvied up among companies , creditors , customers and suppliers .
This process will be overseen by the Dubai Financial Support Fund , which holds the purse strings and no doubt takes many of its cues from Abu Dhabi .
The fund introduces crucial distance between the people who run Dubai and the commercial ventures they sponsor .
It has been called a “ value - for - money committee ” .
The plan involves pumping a total of $ 9.5 billion into Dubai World and its offshoot .
Nakheel will get $ 8 billion , as well as having an earlier $ 1.2 billion loan converted into equity .
Dubai World will get $ 1.5 billion in new money plus the conversion of $ 8.9 billion of debt into equity .
Of the fresh funds , $ 5.7 billion will come from loans already provided by Abu Dhabi .
The remainder will come from the Dubai government 's own resources .
What will the companies do with this money ?
Dubai World says its outstanding debts to outside creditors amounted to $ 14.2 billion at the end of 2009 , not counting the money it owes to the Support Fund or the money owed by Nakheel .
It says it will repay the principal on its debts with new IOUs maturing in five or eight years .
It said nothing about interest .
Nakheel itself still owes about $ 9.3 billion , including loans , bonds and payments due to suppliers .
Holders of publicly traded debt instruments , such as its sukuk due this year and next , will be repaid as scheduled .
For everyone else it is a bit more complicated .
Nakheel 's bankers , including bilateral and syndicated lenders , will be paid in full but not on time .
The company 's individual contractors and suppliers , who have suffered silently but deeply in this crisis , will soon get a cash payment of up to 500,000 dirham ( $ 136,000 ) .
That should clean Nakheel 's slate with half its contractors , the firm says .
The other half will have their claims settled by a mix of cash and a tradable IOU .
The deal also addresses Nakheel 's customers .
Many provided money upfront for properties , some of them to be developed on artificial islands off Dubai 's coast , whose prospects are unclear .
The company will either pay customers back over time ( without interest ) , or offer them an alternative property that is closer to completion .
Dubai will now try to sell the deal to its creditors .
They are likely to buy it .
Indeed , many of them were on the co-ordinating committee that helped negotiate it .
The restructuring broadly conforms to what bankers were expecting in October , before all the fumbling , flapping and falling at the end of last year .
That ungainly descent should now come to an end .
But it is still an awfully long way back up to the top .
Do n't panic .
Many purchases are unplanned and based on emotions .
Pause .
Think .
Then buy , or not .
Often by the end of a waiting period we have ceased to desire the item altogether .
Beware of emotional foreplay .
Do n't be seduced by consumer culture advertising / programming that appeals to lower brain functions and promotes reflexive behaviours .
Beware of PPD ( premature purchase disorder ) .
Do research to increase awareness .
Consumers can increasingly access information that will assist in making ethical purchasing decisions .
Webs sites such as GoodGuide , SkinDeep , and EnvironmentalHealthNews offer a wealth of information for the concerned consumer .
Also , check labels on products to find information such as point of origin , potentially dangerous ingredients such as unhealthy fats , high fructose corn syrup , MSG , diacetyl , suspected carcinogens etc. Support Fair Trade and Organic Certified products .
Fair trade products promote equity and well - being throughout the system by helping consumers make ethical choices .
Entire cities are designating themselves fair trade zones .
Be aware of the lifespan of products .

Plan for the entire life cycle of things you buy .
Choose non-toxic alternatives .
If there are are n't any , ask why .
Buy local .
If there is a local , healthy alternative , support your community .
Plan ahead and make a list .
Know what you need and limit yourself to those things .
Buy quality and make things last .
With proper use and maintenance quality products can be made to last , reducing the overall price per use while saving resources .
Question your desires and promote good health when desires are met .
Being aware of what motivates your consumption habits will make you more mindful when making purchases .
You will be doing the least amount of harm possible , and that in itself promotes personal health .

How can I become a more mindful consumer ?
We are questioning our purchasing habits .
As we become aware of the externalities involved in the things we buy , we can choose products and companies that cultivate personal , environmental and social well - being .
The following are 10 tips I use to become more mindful in my consumption habits :

Have you or a loved one been injured in a boating or personal watercraft accident ?
If so , you may have cause to pursue legal action if the injury was a result of someone else ’s negligence .
Boating accidents can result from many situations : Excessive Speed , Reckless Driving , Distracted Driving , Lack of Safety Gear , Improper Boat Maintenance , Collision with Another Boat / Object , Use of Alcohol / Drugs , Bad Weather , Fuel Fires / Explosions , Passenger Recklessness
In these cases , injured victims may be entitled to monetary compensation for medical treatments , lost wages , property damages , and for pain and suffering .
However , it is important to have a lawyer who has the experience and knowledge to advocate for you and make sense of the legal jargon so you understand everything you need to know throughout the process .
For more than three decades , the attorneys at The DeFeo Law Firm have helped numerous clients across the nation who have been in boating or personal watercraft accidents to receive the compensation for their injuries and losses .
These cases can include many boating laws and insurance issues , which can make them more difficult , but The DeFeo Law Firm has the experience needed to handle the complexity of these cases to give you the best outcome .
We have received high praise and reviews from our past clients and strive to help current and future clients get the compensation they deserve .

They are also harnessing a lot of market - related rage .
The gruesome stock plunge of late 2008 and early 2009 was a searing , fool - me - twice moment for many people .
The market again seemed hopelessly treacherous , a mug ’s game .
And if you had an account with the brokerage arm of any number of Wall Street stalwarts — like Lehman Brothers , Citigroup or Merrill Lynch — your losses were doubly galling .
Your team helped put a sleeper hold on the economy , the near - collapse of which then ravaged your portfolio .
Even many of those who took the safe route and years ago bought index funds have seen little upside .
Look at the performance of the Standard & Poor ’s 500 , the most popular index out there .
If you put $ 1,000 in it in 1999 , you now have slightly less money in your account ( about 0.3 percent less , actually ) .

“ There ’s this idea out there that retail investors are dumb , ” says Howard Lindzon , the co-founder of StockTwits , which curates a gusher of stock tips and financial news alerts tweeted by 20,000 regular contributors .
“ Well , it turns out that the institutional investors are pretty dumb .
They nearly blew us all up with leverage . ”
Of course , anyone hoping to join the day - trade caravan had better wear a seat belt , as Mr. Lindloff ’s experience on this Wednesday morning demonstrates .

IT is hard to say how many day traders are currently plying their craft , if that is the right word , in this country .
Brokerage firms track the activity and demographics of their customers , but they have been reluctant to share that data .
About the most we know is that the day traders skew male , and the number of trades per $ 100,000 in client dollars is a little less than half what it was back in 2000 , according to the Charles Schwab brokerage firm .
Even that figure seems high .
As a job , “ day trader ” registers in roughly the same way as “ disco ball manufacturer ” or “ Brooklyn farmer . ”

A Princeton University research team has demonstrated that all sweeteners are not equal when it comes to weight gain : Rats with access to high - fructose corn syrup gained significantly more weight than those with access to table sugar , even when their overall caloric intake was the same .
In addition to causing significant weight gain in lab animals , long - term consumption of high - fructose corn syrup also led to abnormal increases in body fat , especially in the abdomen , and a rise in circulating blood fats called triglycerides .
The researchers say the work sheds light on the factors contributing to obesity trends in the United States .
" Some people have claimed that high - fructose corn syrup is no different than other sweeteners when it comes to weight gain and obesity , but our results make it clear that this just is n't true , at least under the conditions of our tests , " said psychology professor Bart Hoebel , who specializes in the neuroscience of appetite , weight and sugar addiction .
" When rats are drinking high - fructose corn syrup at levels well below those in soda pop , they 're becoming obese -- every single one , across the board .
Even when rats are fed a high - fat diet , you do n't see this ; they do n't all gain extra weight . "
In results published online March 18 by the journal Pharmacology , Biochemistry and Behavior , the researchers from the Department of Psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute reported on two experiments investigating the link between the consumption of high - fructose corn syrup and obesity .
The first study showed that male rats given water sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup in addition to a standard diet of rat chow gained much more weight than male rats that received water sweetened with table sugar , or sucrose , in conjunction with the standard diet .
The concentration of sugar in the sucrose solution was the same as is found in some commercial soft drinks , while the high - fructose corn syrup solution was half as concentrated as most sodas .
The second experiment -- the first long - term study of the effects of high - fructose corn syrup consumption on obesity in lab animals -- monitored weight gain , body fat and triglyceride levels in rats with access to high - fructose corn syrup over a period of six months .
Compared to animals eating only rat chow , rats on a diet rich in high - fructose corn syrup showed characteristic signs of a dangerous condition known in humans as the metabolic syndrome , including abnormal weight gain , significant increases in circulating triglycerides and augmented fat deposition , especially visceral fat around the belly .
Male rats in particular ballooned in size : Animals with access to high - fructose corn syrup gained 48 percent more weight than those eating a normal diet .

" These rats are n't just getting fat ; they 're demonstrating characteristics of obesity , including substantial increases in abdominal fat and circulating triglycerides , " said Princeton graduate student Miriam Bocarsly .
" In humans , these same characteristics are known risk factors for high blood pressure , coronary artery disease , cancer and diabetes . "
In addition to Hoebel and Bocarsly , the research team included Princeton undergraduate Elyse Powell and visiting research associate Nicole Avena , who was affiliated with Rockefeller University during the study and is now on the faculty at the University of Florida .
The Princeton researchers note that they do not know yet why high - fructose corn syrup fed to rats in their study generated more triglycerides , and more body fat that resulted in obesity .
High - fructose corn syrup and sucrose are both compounds that contain the simple sugars fructose and glucose , but there at least two clear differences between them .
First , sucrose is composed of equal amounts of the two simple sugars -- it is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose -- but the typical high - fructose corn syrup used in this study features a slightly imbalanced ratio , containing 55 percent fructose and 42 percent glucose .
Larger sugar molecules called higher saccharides make up the remaining 3 percent of the sweetener .
Second , as a result of the manufacturing process for high - fructose corn syrup , the fructose molecules in the sweetener are free and unbound , ready for absorption and utilization .
In contrast , every fructose molecule in sucrose that comes from cane sugar or beet sugar is bound to a corresponding glucose molecule and must go through an extra metabolic step before it can be utilized .
This creates a fascinating puzzle .
The rats in the Princeton study became obese by drinking high - fructose corn syrup , but not by drinking sucrose .
The critical differences in appetite , metabolism and gene expression that underlie this phenomenon are yet to be discovered , but may relate to the fact that excess fructose is being metabolized to produce fat , while glucose is largely being processed for energy or stored as a carbohydrate , called glycogen , in the liver and muscles .
In the 40 years since the introduction of high - fructose corn syrup as a cost - effective sweetener in the American diet , rates of obesity in the U.S. have skyrocketed , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
In 1970 , around 15 percent of the U.S. population met the definition for obesity ; today , roughly one - third of the American adults are considered obese , the CDC reported .
High - fructose corn syrup is found in a wide range of foods and beverages , including fruit juice , soda , cereal , bread , yogurt , ketchup and mayonnaise .
On average , Americans consume 60 pounds of the sweetener per person every year .
" Our findings lend support to the theory that the excessive consumption of high - fructose corn syrup found in many beverages may be an important factor in the obesity epidemic , " Avena said .
The new research complements previous work led by Hoebel and Avena demonstrating that sucrose can be addictive , having effects on the brain similar to some drugs of abuse .
In the future , the team intends to explore how the animals respond to the consumption of high - fructose corn syrup in conjunction with a high - fat diet -- the equivalent of a typical fast - food meal containing a hamburger , fries and soda -- and whether excessive high - fructose corn syrup consumption contributes to the diseases associated with obesity .
Another step will be to study how fructose affects brain function in the control of appetite .
The research was supported by the U.S. Public Health Service .

" Dry " cleaning is set to become a domestic activity with a washing machine that uses 90 % less water than a normal laundry cycle and could be available by the end of 2011 .
The device , developed by Leeds - based Xeros Ltd , replaces water with tiny plastic beads that suck up stains and its producers claim it will shift stubborn pounds from household energy bills as well .
The Xeros process uses 3 mm - long nylon beads that can get into all the crevices and folds of clothing and can also be re-used hundreds of times .
The beads flood the machine 's drum once the clothes are wet and the humidity is at the right level .
After the washing cycle is complete , the beads drain away in the same way as water in a conventional machine .
The chief executive of Xeros , Bill Westwater , said : " The net saving in water , detergent and electricity and including the cost of the beads , we calculate , is about a 30 % cost saving for the user . "
He claims the machine has been tested successfully on a range of fabrics stained with everything from mud , red wine and curry stains to ink from ballpoint pens .
According to the Energy Saving Trust , just under one - third of household energy is used to heat water .
Laundry washing also accounts for 15 % of all household water consumption ; meaning if everyone in the UK converted from normal washing to the Xeros system , the carbon emissions saved would be the equivalent of taking 1.4 m cars off the roads .
Another perk of the device is that it should allow many delicates to be " dry " cleaned at home .
Xeros has already received research and development funding from Yorkshire Forward and has just returned from a government - sponsored " Clean and Cool " trade mission to the United States , aimed at securing investment from venture capitalists in Silicon Valley in California .
The idea for polymer - based cleaning came from Stephen Burkinshaw , a polymer chemist at Leeds University who spent 30 years working out how to improve the dyeing of plastics used in fabrics .
A few years ago he realised that the stains on clothes acted in a similar way to dyes , and he wondered if he could use plastics to attract away the stains .
After experimenting with a range of plastics , he settled on nylon .
Thanks to a natural property of the material , nylon beads attract stains to their surface and , in 100 % humidity , the molecular structure of the plastic becomes amorphous , so the stains diffuse into the centre of the beads .
" Not only are you able to suck the stain off the clothes , you 're also able to ensure there 's no deposition back onto the clothes , " said Westwater .
When the beads are at the end of their life , saturated with dirt and stains , they can be collected and recycled into , for example , dashboards for cars .
Eventually Westwater wants to design a closed - loop recycling system for his washing machines , where saturated beads can be refreshed and re-used in Xeros machines .
Westwater has already built a prototype washing machine and aims to have a product ready for the commercial laundry market by the end of next year , with a consumer version coming to market shortly afterwards .
" There is more of a technical challenge [ in development ] as you compact the system .
But it 's not just about that - there 's also consumer inertia .
For millenia , people have been washing their clothes with water and a bit of detergent and suddenly we 're coming along and saying that most of that water can be replaced by these beads .
That 's a big leap in the consumers ' minds . "
Claire Cunningham , a spokesperson for the government - backed Technology Strategy Board , said Xeros had an " interesting and innovative product " and the environmental and financial savings were of particular interest when it was selected to take part , along with the 18 other British clean technology companies , in the Clean and Cool trade mission .
I can hardly believe that Princeton sent out a press release yesterday announcing the results of this rat study .
The press release says : “ Rats with access to high - fructose corn syrup gained significantly more weight than those with access to table sugar , even when their overall caloric intake was the same . ”
How they came to these conclusions is beyond me .
Here ’s the original paper .
It has long been known that feeding sugars to rats makes them eat more and gain weight .
But , as summarized in Table 1 in the paper , the researchers did only two experiments that actually compared the effects of HFCS to sucrose on weight gain , and these gave inconsistent results .
Their other experiments compared HFCS to chow alone .
The study is extremely complicated and confusingly described .
As best as I can tell , here ’s what they found :
1 . The first study used 10 male rats in each group and observed them for 8 weeks .
At the end of the study , the rats fed chow alone weighed 462 grams .
The rats fed sucrose plus chow weighed 477±9 grams .
The rats fed HFCS plus chow weighed 502±11 grams .
The authors say the difference between 477 and 502 grams is statistically significant .
But these rats were offered the sugars for 12 hours per day .
The rats fed HFCS for 24 hours per day , which should be expected to be fatter , were not .
They weighed less ( 470 grams ) than the rats fed sucrose for 12 hours per day .
So these results are inconsistent .
2 . The second study did not compare rats eating HFCS to rats eating sucrose .
It just looked at the effects of HFCS in groups of 8 male rats .
3 . The third study used female rats ( number not given ) and observed them for 7 months .
At the end of the study period , female rats fed HFCS plus chow for 12 hours a day weighed 323±9 grams .
Female rats fed sucrose plus chow under the same conditions weighed 333±10 grams .
This result is not statistically significant .
Although the authors say calorie intake was the same , they do not report calories consumed nor do they discuss how they determined that calorie intake was the same .
This is an important oversight because measuring the caloric intake of lab rats is notoriously difficult to do ( they are messy ) .
So , I ’m skeptical .
I do n’t think the study produces convincing evidence of a difference between the effects of HFCS and sucrose on the body weight of rats .
I ’m afraid I have to agree with the Corn Refiners on this one .
So does HFCS make rats fat ?
Sure if you feed them too many calories altogether .
Sucrose will do that too .

Historic .
Unprecedented .
Landmark .
These are just some of the lies the liberal press are using to describe Barack Obama ’s healthcare changes .
But the legislation is a con , a massive transfer of working people ’s wealth to private insurers .
Reforms they are n’t .
These changes are worse than doing nothing .
The new laws will force the poor who are uninsured into private insurance .
The insurance the poor are to be forced to purchase , under threat of a $ US750 fine , will be crap with a capital C .
Their money will go down the drain – or rather into the insurers ’ pockets .
The US group Physicians for a National Health Program rightly calls the insurance offerings “ defective products ” .
Falling sick in the US can be a bad wealth move as well as a bad health move , even for the insured .
Often the insurance they purchase for exorbitant amounts does n’t cover all the costs or cuts out after a short time .
At the moment insurers often cut people off when they become sick , and refuse to insure those with pre-existing conditions .
It is only profitable to insure the healthy .
Obama ’s reforms will only worsen the trend to higher prices for poor products .
As Physicians for a National Health Program say :
“ Millions of middle - income people will be pressured to buy commercial health insurance policies costing up to 9.5 per cent of their income , but covering an average of only 70 per cent of their medical expenses , potentially leaving them vulnerable to financial ruin if they become seriously ill .
Many will find such policies too expensive to afford or , if they do buy them , too expensive to use because of the high co-pays and deductibles . ”
The new laws wo n’t stop increases in premiums .
In fact they are likely to encourage an explosion in rubbish products at higher and higher prices since insurers now have a captive consumer audience and no regulation over their offerings and charges .
Obama ’s changes , because they are not based on universal coverage but profit , will mean that the premiums on the old , the infirm and the like will be at much higher rates than those for the fit and healthy .
On top of all this Obama will give $ 447 billion to insurance companies to subsidise their sub-standard products .
So how is Obama going to pay for his gifts to the insurers ?
He will tax workers currently in so - called Cadillac schemes ( or what we might call Rolls Royce schemes ) .
They are no such thing .
These are just schemes which provide halfway decent benefits to workers .
Obama will also rip $ US500 billion out of the federal government ’s current free health scheme – Medicare for over 65 - year - olds .
And he wo n’t regulate the pricing or quality of the insurance .
What about the extra 32 million Americans who will be covered ?
That will take ten years to achieve .
In the richest country in the world , 23 million Americans will still be uninsured in a decade .
This translates into an extra 23,000 deaths a year , according to Physicians for a National Health Program .
Abortion has been specifically excluded from the insurers ’ subsidised health plans .
Women of child - bearing age will have to get an extra policy costing more to cover the possibility of having an abortion .
It wo n’t be a problem for rich women to have abortions .
It will however under Obama ’s regime be even harder for poor and working - class women to get one .
Obama ’s reforms do not address the issue at the heart of healthcare – putting profit before people .
Here ’s how Michael Moore put it in an interview with Democracy Now !
“ The healthcare bill that was passed ultimately will be seen as a victory for capitalism .
It protected the capitalist model of providing healthcare for people – in other words , we are not to help unless there is money to be made from it . ”
Universal healthcare guaranteed by government and funded by taxes on the rich and the companies who will benefit from healthy employees puts people before profit .
This , coupled with a commitment to spend more on nurses , doctors and hospitals , would address America ’s healthcare woes .
But because a single - payer option , as such a scheme is known in the US , would have put people before profits Obama dumped it very early on .
He even dumped a public option which would have had a government insurer competing with private insurers .
Why have the liberals in the US and here been so keen to paint Obama ’s changes as major reforms ?
Partly it has to do with the immediate political needs of the day .
Obama ’s reformist project was always a lie .
He has furthered George W Bush ’s agenda both at home and abroad , not challenged it .
For example , unemployment stands at almost ten per cent and will remain high for the foreseeable future , while Obama has done nothing to address the needs of the millions he has given trillions to address the needs of the banks .
Blacks are worse off now than when Obama came to power .
The “ yes we can ” President has doubled the number of troops in Afghanistan and ordered more drone bombings in one year than Bush did in eight .
Millions who voted for him are now deeply disillusioned with Obama .
So the liberal façade of change needed a victory .
Hence the raptures about Obama ’s sick healthcare changes .
When it came to the vote this week , Dennis Kucinich , the most vocal left - wing Congressional opponent of Obama ’s scheme – precisely because it would n’t provide universal healthcare – caved in .
He voted , and he knows it , for what the Physicians for a National Health Program described as “ aspirin dispensed for the treatment of cancer ” .
This is the role of the reformist left – to abandon principles to enable reaction disguised as reform to win .
But there is something deeper in all of this .
The era of progressive change is dead in the United States and , as Bill Clinton ’s rule - for - the - rich Presidency shows , has been for some time .
Stagnant profit rates since the 1970s have meant that the priority of all politicians and business has been increasing profits , not providing real social benefits or increased living standards to workers .
In fact given this underlying economic stagnation , “ reforms ” have become the Trojan horse for attacks on working people , a way of making them pay for the crises of capitalism .
So workers as providers and workers as patients will bear the burden of Obama ’s health “ reforms ” in the United States .
There can be no other result without a mass movement demanding universal healthcare .
But it is not only in the United States that the adequacy of healthcare depends on the size of your wallet , and where attacks dressed up as reforms are occurring .
Here in Australia Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott had a debate of sorts on March 23 at the National Press Club on hospitals and healthcare .
Rudd has a plan – to further privatise healthcare and make workers pay for it .
Abbott did n’t have a plan but also wants to further privatise health and pass the costs on to workers .
Kevin Rudd ’s hospitals plan is about making working people pay for the healthcare mess .
His “ case mix ” proposals will cut healthcare costs ; that ’s because they will cut services and make nurses , doctors and others in the system work even harder .
And they will cut jobs .
So although the specifics of the debate in the US and Australia are different , the underlying driver is the same .
As Physicians for a National Health Program said , in words that also apply to Australia :
“ Instead of eliminating the root of the problem – the profit - driven private health insurance industry – his costly new legislation will enrich and further entrench these firms . ”
Australia ’s universal health scheme began in 1975 after a successful battle against the conservatives who vehemently opposed the “ socialist ” health measures ( much like the Republicans currently in America ) .
This was during a period of militant trade union activity winning major pay increases and just after Whitlam ’s election in 1972 on a program of capitalist reform to benefit bosses and workers .
It was only a few years after the turmoil of the anti-Vietnam war protests .
Since then , the last 35 years have been a battle by politicians and vested groups like insurers and private hospitals to whittle away and undermine the modest health system gains of 1975 and suck even more on the public teat of our money .
The end result is that today in Australia we have a private health system with a public add - on .
Those who ca n’t afford the private system can wait years for treatment or queue in hospitals for basic assistance .
There are not enough beds , or doctors and nurses .
The lessons from Australia and the United States seem clear .
Universal healthcare for all , paid for by the rich , will only be won by a struggle against the vested interests and their reformist political mates .
That means fighting to put people before profit .

Sherlock Holmes stars Jeremy Brett ( r ) as the sleuth Eight advertisements shown during an episode of Sherlock Holmes were so loud that they breached regulations , the industry watchdog has ruled .
The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the slots on digital channel ITV3 were " excessively strident " .
But it said complaints about noisy advertisements have gone down since rules were tightened two years ago .
ITV3 said the series was made in the 1980s and had many silent pauses so the commercials seemed louder .
But the watchdog upheld a complaint from a viewer about eight adverts during a break .
Loudness meter
It ruled : " We noted that the programme had a wide dynamic range , with periods of quiet suspense punctuated by short , louder bursts .
" We noted that the maximum subjective loudness of ads was consistent with other ads during the break , but that it was not well matched to the overall sound levels of the programme . "
But it recognised that ITV3 , along with other broadcasters , were now working harder to keep noise levels down .
ITV3 said all their adverts were checked against a loudness meter and believed the loudness of the ones in question were " appropriate and consistent in the context of the overall loudness of the channel " .
But it recognised there might have been an issue with the programme material .
Since television began , viewers have often complained about advertisements being louder than the programmes .
In response to complaints down the years , the broadcasting watchdog published a new rule on sound levels in 2008 .
The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice , which is responsible for writing the TV Advertising Code , said " advertisements must not be excessively noisy or strident " .
" The maximum subjective loudness of advertisements must be consistent and in line with the maximum loudness of programmes and junction material , " it said .
The ASA received 100 complaints about perceived sound imbalances between programmes and advertisements in 2007 .
In 2009 , there were just 45 complaints .
In the US , the House of Representatives recently passed a bill to curb loud advertisements .

Communities Predator control , Alaska - style
In Alaska , it 's once again time for one of the state 's major rites of spring -- the aerial shooting of wolves .
In five management areas around the state , Alaska 's Department of Fish and Game has decided that there are n't enough moose and caribou , and that the answer is to shoot more wolves .
In the Fortymile Region near Tok , the state hopes that a total of about 185 wolves will be killed ( about two - thirds of the present wolf population in the area ) .
On Wednesday , Fish and Game employees killed four wolves from the air , including two that National Park Service biologists had recently fitted with tracking collars as part of a 16 - year study -- despite the state 's promise that it would not kill any collared wolves .
Oops .
Fish and Game 's explanation , reports the Anchorage Daily News , is that a " collar malfunction " prevented employees from ID 'ing the collared wolves before killing them .
The NPS supervisor in charge of the collaring project does n't buy it :
Yukon Charley Superintendent Greg Dudgeon said he 'd spoken to David James , regional supervisor , on Wednesday night .
" My understanding from the phone call last night was that the shooter , whoever that person was , did see the collars , " Dudgeon said .
" They were aware of the collars . "
Perhaps the shooting was a not - so - subtle statement of states ' rights .
The National Parks Traveller blog reports that Alaska has recently made other moves to assert its right to control wolves across the state , even in national parks :
The shootings come less than two weeks after a particularly contentious Alaska Board of Game meeting when it comes to wolves and national parks .
While the board was asked at one point to expand a no - take wolf buffer zone in an area surrounded on three sides by Denali National Park and Preserve , the board completely removed the buffer .
And the state agency also did away with a regulation that required Alaska game officials to obtain Park Service permission before they conduct any predator control on parklands .
Meanwhile , in other predator - control news , the state just shot two more wolves near Chignik Lake ; they were suspected of having killed a local schoolteacher .
Testing determined they did n't have rabies .
And a 76 - year - old Anchorage man shotgunned his neighbor 's chihuahua this week after it came sniffing around his yard one time too many :
Lowell Mueller leveled a semiautomatic .410 - bore shotgun loaded with bird shot out an opened window and shot the chihuaha on the street at a corner of his property , police Lt. Dave Parker said .
" I really did n't mean to make a killing shot on it .
I just wanted to tickle it , is all I did , and I missed tickling it , " Mueller said .
Since Alaska 's predator control program began in 2003 , aerial gunners have " tickled " more than 800 wolves out of a statewide population of 7,000 to 10,000 .
No word on the chihuahua total .
THE BI - NAT - VISA SEE NEW ARTICLE UPDATED 3/28/10 http://gayusathemovie.com ; and http://oblogdeeoblogda.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/lgbt-foreign-policy-applauded-and-human-rights-should-start-at-home-with-fiance-visas-and-greencards-for-same-sex-couples/
While we wait for immigration equality under the US Immigration and Naturalization Act - to sponsor our foreign - born spouses , we endure unconscionable and inhumane situations on a day to day , hour by hour basis .
Our partners are persecuted at our airports by the profiling of ICE officials and arbitrarily turned away , despite having visas ; our relationships are denied through our inability to live together in the US , or we live in fear , hiding or exile .
We lose jobs , we lose homes , we lose our time with extended family , we give up our pensions .
We are detained and deported .
Gay and lesbian ( same - sex ) foreign fiances and spouses cannot enter the USA and stay here under the family petition for a green card , in the same way as heterosexual couples can .
This has resulted in detention of spouses , exile of Americans , having to choose between their beloved and their country , and also unimaginable separations and expense .
Our exiles and exiles - to - be cannot wait for the impending immigration reform battle , for UAFA to garnish more co-sponsors before accomplishing some rights under the immigration law .
There is every reason for interim measures to serve the same - sex spouse community as DOMA is heading toward a repeal in the Congress , which in essence could be years long .
Recently Immigration Equality posted this statement on their BLOG when referring to Immigration reform : " The Senate immigration reform bill will be followed by a House bill , too .
In - between , there will be countless steps , challenges and opportunities that must be addressed .
As we have seen in the current healthcare debate , legislation does not move easily , or without hard work .
Immigration reform will be similar :
It is imperative that we build grassroots support for our families , Congressional support for UAFA and broad public support for fair immigration policies . "
So just in case UAFA becomes the public option of immigration reform , in case DOMA 's repeal takes another 8 years ...
I believe that this makes the argument for a stop gap measure to help keep our families together in the USA .
We want a SPECIAL VISA .

DALLAS --
The speculation surrounding whether the Dallas Cowboys are shopping starting running back Marion Barber is just that .
Multiple team sources said Tuesday that the Cowboys have n't discussed trading Barber , who is coming off two injury - filled seasons where he failed to rush for more than 1,000 yards .
The NFL Network reported Monday that NFL executives have said Barber is available via trade .
Barber is scheduled to get a $ 4 million roster bonus and a $ 3.8 million base salary in 2010 .
If the Cowboys trade Barber , another team would have to pick up that contract or try to rework the deal .
The only definitive information about Barber 's status has come from Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones , who said the organization has thought about starting Felix Jones .
" I see the advantages the way we 've done it , " Jerry Jones said last week about having started Barber with Felix Jones in a reserve role .
" But it was a pretty close decision , really .
I know it was a consideration . "
Barber , who does n't give interviews , has been working out at the Michael Johnson Performance Center in McKinney , Texas , to get in better shape .
Last season , Barber suffered from a plethora of injuries -- a bruised left thigh , fractured thumb and a bruised left knee -- but missed just one game , Week 3 versus Carolina .
Jerry Jones is not concerned about Barber 's health .
" It would [ concern me ] if we did n't have the depth there , " Jones said .
" But by having the depth , we can feel good about [ it ] .
Maybe [ if ]
Marion had n't [ had ] a couple of unfortunate seasons there , maybe we 'll get a big year out of him .
If you did that , you 've hit a home run . "
Backup running back Felix Jones finished his second season with 685 yards and three touchdowns on 116 carries .
In two playoff games , he led the Cowboys ' rushing attack with 217 yards and a touchdown on 30 carries .
Tashard Choice , the No. 3 back , is used on third down and in the Razorback formation , but he would like to get more carries in the offense .
Choice has expressed frustration with his role , but he has n't asked for a trade .
The Cowboys have been scouting running backs for the upcoming draft .
If they select one , it would create a logjam at an already - crowded position .
Stephen Jones , the Cowboys executive vice president , said last month he expected the team to keep all three of its running backs .
" I know this :
We 've been doing what we ought to be doing and that 's evaluating the running game and how we 're the most productive ... what plays , what formations give us the most production , " Jerry Jones said .
" Based on preliminary input from our coaches , you could certainly see Felix in there earlier . "

Mr Morrison used the 1950s ' space - age craze to market the Pluto Platter The man who invented the Frisbee , one of the world 's most popular toys , has died at his home in Utah aged 90 .
Walter Frederick Morrison conceived and developed his aerodynamic plastic disc in the 1950s , and hundreds of millions have been sold worldwide since .
Frisbee historian Phil Kennedy said Mr Morrison and his future wife , Lu , got the idea from playing with a metal cake pan on the beach in California .
He originally called his toy the Pluto Platter and sold it at local fairs .
The platter 's novel aerodynamic shape allowed it to hover briefly or travel surprisingly long distances , kept aloft by its rotation .
In pictures : Decades of Frisbee fun In 1957 Mr Morrison sold the rights to the California firm Wham - O , which discovered that youngsters were calling the toy a " Frisbie " after the name of a well - known pie .
The company changed the spelling to avoid trademark infringement and the Frisbee was born .
On the official Frisbee website , Wham - O paid tribute to Mr Morrison , who was known as Fred .
" As Frisbee discs keep flying though the air , bringing smiles to faces , Fred 's spirit lives on .
Smooth flights , Fred , " it read .
Mr Morrison 's son , Walt , told the Associated Press that his father had suffered from cancer , and that " old age had caught up " with him .
How would you get through your youth without learning to throw a Frisbee ?
Kay McIff , lawyer for Walter Frederick Morrison
" He was a nice guy .
He helped a lot of people .
He was an entrepreneur .
He was always looking for something to do , " he added .
Lawyer Kay McIff , who represented Mr Morrison in a royalties case , said : " That simple little toy has permeated every continent in every country .
As many homes have Frisbees as any other device ever invented .
" How would you get through your youth without learning to throw a Frisbee ? "
Mr Morrison , who died at his home in Monroe , on Tuesday , is survived by three children .
Walt Morrison said the family planned to hold a memorial service on Saturday at the Cowboy Corral in Elsinore , Utah .

The recently unveiled secret agreement that Apple makes iPhone developers sign supports what many have suspected all along : Apple is trying to control the universe .
Much has been written anecdotally about the Apple app - approval process , with the words " arcane " and " Kafkaesque " coming up a lot .
But the letter ( and crimping spirit ) of the agreement was a matter of pure speculation until the Electronic Frontier Foundation had the clever idea of making one developer an offer he could n't refuse .
That developer was NASA — a government agency that can't exactly keep all the secrets it might want to — and the offer was really a demand under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a nonprofit organization that defends free speech , privacy , innovation and consumer rights .
Senior staff attorney Fred von Lohmann used an FOIA request to compel NASA to release Apple 's nondisclosure agreement for iPhone developers .
Apple forces developers to sign the NDA before they can access the software development kit for the iPhone OS , which also powers the iPad .
Apple is possibly one of the most tight - lipped companies on the planet , so glimpses like this into its inner workings are rare .
Making matters worse , the agreement itself bars developers from making " public statements " about the agreement 's terms , so without this confluence of events , it may never have come to light .
As Wired.com 's Dylan
Tweney tweeted , " The first rule of the iPhone developer program is : You do not talk about the iPhone developer program . "
A full recounting of the contract is reported by Gadget Lab's Brian X. Chen .
Judging from the March 17 , 2009 , revision of the agreement ( .pdf ) , Apple 's treatment of app developers does n't come near putting them in a virtual sweatshop , and indeed , some of them should probably thank Apple for creating the platform that made them rich .
That said , Apple exerts total control over which programs are allowed to run on the iPhone OS run by the iPhone , iPod Touch and the upcoming iPad , from the early development stage all the way to the marketplace .
As I pondered last week , " Who would have thought that in 2010 everyone would be so excited about a computer that only runs software approved by its manufacturer ? "
The iPod was a music player , but an iPad is a computer .
As Apple migrates its App Store model from MP3 players and cellphones onto a computing platform that for some , could replace a laptop , the company 's rules about what those app developers can and can't do are coming under increasing scrutiny .
Just think about what would happen if Microsoft were to demand such authority over the software that runs on its tablet PCs .
One can only imagine the backlash .
With the iPad , however , many seem willing to lock themselves in a walled garden of approved software and throw away the key .
( Yes , we know , you can jailbreak the iPhone OS and install whatever you want , but that comes with its own set of trade - offs . )
Terms of service often bar signatories from all sorts of normal - seeming behavior , so the non-lawyers among us should take these with a grain of salt .
Nonetheless , Apple 's choice to sell devices that only run approved software , and only software sold in its own store , could ultimately make people wonder whether the cameras in the company 's infamous " 1984 " commercial may have been pointed in the wrong direction .

I know it sounds counter intuitive , but one of the best things you can do to increase meeting productivity is to plan on doing less .
Why ?
Because by stuffing your meeting agenda you do n’t allow time to focus .
This means when you uncover a tough spot , you wo n’t work though it , you will “ address that later , ” which means next month ( and , let ’s face it , probably the month after that ) it will be back on the agenda .
If you want your meeting time to be spent doing the work that ca n’t be done in any other way , try this instead : Aside from “ housekeeping ” items like an icebreaker , agenda review and meeting evaluations , allow only one agenda item per meeting hour .
That ’s Impossible !!!
If you are used to traditional marathon meetings with 10 agenda items ( not that anyone has seen the agenda ) , tons of reports by people who talk to hear themselves talk , and no clear direction on what is supposed to happen after the meeting , I ’m sure a meeting with only 1 - 2 main topics seems crazy .
But I assure you , it is possible and it is better .
Here ’s how to to make the transition .
Trim the fat
Remove everything from your agenda that does n’t benefit from face - to - face interaction .
The most likely suspect ?
Reports .
Do n’t spend any time in your meetings presenting information that can be distributed in advance .
Send the reports in writing , save a bit of time for questions if you must , and move on .
Not sure what to cut ?
Be on the lookout for times when one person is talking and everyone else is doodling or trying to check their e-mail without getting caught .
Get the “ talker ” to deliver his info in some other way ( outside the meeting ) and spend your meeting time on the work that you must do together .
Be prepared
No one should come to a meeting wondering what is going to be discussed .
Send the agenda a week before the meeting , include any reports or background materials that are required for full participation , and expect that everyone will do the work in advance .
It ’s better to cancel meetings for which people are n’t prepared than build a culture where it ’s alright not to do the pre-work because “ we can just go over it again in the meeting . ”
Additionally ,
If there are specific questions that need to be answered , or decisions that need to be made–make that clear in the pre-meeting materials .
This gives participants every opportunity to come prepared for the work at hand and also gives people who need more time to reflect a chance do start their work before the meeting .
Clarify next steps
How will you know if the meeting was a success ?
Who will do what after the meeting ?
Make sure you know–and make sure your participants know .
If everyone is pulling in the same direction and knows where her responsibilities lay , it ’s much more likely that problems will get solved ( and stay solved ) in your next meeting .
Finally , you may not be able to make the leap all at once–but baby steps will help .
Change one element of your meetings at a time and before you know it you too will be getting more done by focusing on less !!

Abstract
Many of the pressing policy issues facing us today require confronting the unknown and making difficult choices in the face of limited information .
Economists distinguish between “ uncertainty ” ( where the likelihood of the peril is non-quantifiable ) and “ risk ” ( where the likelihood is quantifiable ) .
Uncertainty is particularly pernicious in situations where catastrophic outcomes are possible , but conventional decision tools are not equipped to cope with these potentially disastrous results .
This Article describes new analytic tools for assessing potential catastrophic outcomes and applies them to some key policy issues : controlling greenhouse gases , adapting to unavoidable climate change , regulating nanotechnology , dealing with long - lived nuclear wastes , and controlling financial instability .
More specifically , economic modeling and policy analysis are often based on the assumption that extreme harms are highly unlikely , in the technical sense that the “ tail ” of the probability distributions is “ thin ” – in other words , that it approaches rapidly to zero .
Thin tails allow extreme risks to be given relatively little weight .
A growing body of research , however , focuses on the possibility of fat tails , which are common in systems with feedback between different components .
As it turns out , fat tails and uncertainty often go together .
Economic theories of “ ambiguity ” deal at a more general level with situations where multiple plausible models of reality confront a decision maker .
Ambiguity theories are useful in considering systems with fat tails and in other situations where the probabilities are simply difficult to quantify .
The Article considers both the policy implications of fat tails and the use of ambiguity theories such as α-maxmin .

You 've heard of hiding in plain sight .
Well , a fashion designer has come up with a more colourful way for
worried women to blend into a busy street to elude a pursuer .
We 've had mini-skirts , skorts , pencils and midis .
Now there 's the
vending machine skirt .
It 's definitely not the real thing , but Aya Tsukioka 's skirt doubles as
a disguise to make the wearer look like a Coca Cola machine .
Scroll down for more ...
Ms Tsukioka , 29 , unveiled her design in Tokyo by claiming she
hopes it will help ease women 's fear of crime .
She lifted a flap on the skirt to expose a large sheet of cloth printed
with the familiar bright red Coca Cola logo .
By unfolding the sheet and stepping to the side of the street , she
showed how a woman walking alone could hide behind it to outfox a
potential attacker .
Scroll down for more ...
Her deluxe model even boasts four sides for a more complete cover .
The experimental clothes designer has already sold 20 of the
£ 400 hand - sewn vending machine skirts and it hoping to market the design
worldwide .
She says the idea was inspired by a trick used by Japanese ninja
assassins , who cloaked themselves in black blankets so they could n't be
seen at night .
Scroll down for more ...
If the fizzy drink machine seems a little elaborate , not to mention
impractical , she has also come up with the ' manhole bag ' which is
supposed to look like a sewer cover when you put it down so unwitting
thieves walk right by without noticing it .
For children , she has a backpack that transforms into a fire hydrant .
While British women might prefer to take self - defence classes , Ms
Tsukioka said : " It is just easier for Japanese to hide .
Making a scene
would be too embarrassing . "
She admits that making the switch from skirt to vending machine might
prove a little tricky " especially when your hands are shaking " .
But she told the New York Times : " These ideas might strike foreigners
as far - fetched , but in Japan , they can become reality . "

Hate Mail from Third Graders
" It 's not easy being a public enemy , " writes Neil deGrasse Tyson in his book The Pluto Files .
When Neil 's museum grouped Pluto not among the planets but rather with icy comets in an obscure region called the Kuiper Belt , he heard from thousands of outraged Pluto defenders .
It 's tough being called a heartless Pluto - hater , particularly by a dismayed eight - year - old .
Below , peruse a few of the letters elementary schoolkids sent Neil , and see how their tone shifted over the years , as the public slowly came to accept Pluto 's fall from planethood .
—Susan K. Lewis Note :
The correspondence in this slide show originally appeared in The Pluto Files ( Norton , 2009 ) .
Will 's lament
March 25 , 2000
The American Museum of Natural History opened its new Rose Center for Earth and Space on February 19 , 2000 .
A month later , Neil received this letter from a perceptive seven - year - old named Will Galmot , who had noticed Pluto 's conspicuous absence from the exhibit area featuring models of the planets .
He was the first person to write about the matter , which would otherwise remain out of the limelight for almost a year .
Will 's lament
( with illustration )
In case Neil and his colleagues needed assistance to make a model of Pluto , Will provided a drawing .
John 's poll
November 18 , 2004
On January 22 , 2001 , nearly a year after the exhibit opened , the New York Times ran a front - page story headlined : " Pluto 's Not a Planet ?
Only in New York . "
An all - out media frenzy ensued , and for several years thereafter , Neil 's in - box overflowed with e-mail from upset Plutophiles .
Six - year - old John Glidden even took it upon himself to conduct a poll .
Madeline 's protest
September 19 , 2006
The debate over Pluto 's status continued to percolate , but in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union took a key vote that officially knocked Pluto out of the pantheon of planets .
Young Madeline Trost of Plantation , Florida disagreed .
Emerson 's exclamations !!!
November 6 , 2006
Emerson
York 's letter to Neil came packaged with a stack of similar missives written by Mrs. Debbie Dalton 's third - grade class in the Warren L. Miller Elementary School , in Mansfield , Pennsylvania .
Note the teary - eyed planets at bottom .
Taylor 's apology
March 26 , 2008
By the spring of 2008 , the mail Neil received from schoolkids and scientists alike generally had a conciliatory tone .
With some notable exceptions ( including the states of New Mexico and Illinois , both of which passed legislation declaring Pluto 's full - planet stature ) , the public was coming to terms with Pluto 's reclassification as a dwarf planet .
Taylor Williams ' note to Neil was particularly sweet .
Siddiq 's wisdom
March 26 , 2008
Perhaps Siddiq Canty , a second grader at the Roland Lewis Elementary School in Tampa , Florida , summed up the brouhaha over Pluto best : " thats [ sic ] Science . "

The iPhone is currently available with just one data plan : $ 30 per month for " unlimited " data attached to a minimum two - year contract — though AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega believes some users should be charged more .
The iPad , on the other hand , offers two pre-paid , no contract plans : $ 15 per month for 250 MB , or $ 30 per month for unlimited data .
During the introduction of the iPad , Apple CEO Steve Jobs indicated that 250 MB should be more than enough for practically anyone , and many watchers took exception to this claim , noting that they use plenty of data on their iPhones already and the iPad is sure to be much worse .
AT&T does n't provide an easy way to track your data usage in real - time , but the iPhone does keep track of how much data goes in and out of it via the 3G network .
You can find this by going into Settings > General > Usage .
Under " Cellular Network Data , " you 'll see stats for sent and received .
Chances are you 've never reset this , so you could add up the two values and know how much data you 've pumped over AT&T 's network since you got your iPhone .
If you divide the value by how many months you 've owned your iPhone , you should have a pretty good idea of your average monthly data use .
The total on my own iPhone is 1.48 GB .
Since I bought my iPhone in July 2008 , my average monthly usage is approximately 80 MB per month .
So , even if I were to use three times the number of data on - the - go , I could get away with a $ 15 per month data plan for an iPad .
Even better , why does n't AT&T offer a similar plan for the iPhone users ?
I 'm not the only person that could get by just fine with a 250 MB limit for a lower price , but we 're wondering what usage patterns are like for our readers .
Are you a light data user , or a heavy data user ?
Take our poll , and let us know .

“ THERE is no place in the world where there are no business travelers , ” said Patrick Deroose , the manager of the corporate assistance division of the worldwide crisis response company International SOS .
That includes Haiti , of course .
Last week , when the calamitous earthquake devastated Port - au - Prince , workers at the company ’s international alarm center in suburban Philadelphia counted more than 100 clients from private companies , government agencies and nonprofit groups  with about 2,500 individual travelers  in Haiti .
Within hours , a crisis team was on the move .
“ We keep a deployment kit in the office , everything we need to go on a moment ’s notice , ” said Alex Puig , the regional security director .
Mr. Puig , a former agent for the Central Intelligence Agency who later worked as an international corporate security chief , said he dispatched two crisis specialists to the Dominican Republic less than two hours after the first news flash went out about the Haiti earthquake .
“ They always have their documents and their flyaway travel bags ready , ” he said .
A phone call to an airline yielded two hard - to - get seats from Philadelphia to Santo Domingo , the capital of the Dominican Republic , the nation that shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti .
Within 24 hours , the two - man advance team was on the ground establishing communications in devastated Port - au - Prince as a vanguard for medical and other emergency teams that followed .
The White House wants to abandon NASA ’s Constellation programme , which was intended to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 ( Illustration : NASA )
See also : Space 2020 : what NASA will do next
NASA ’s Constellation programme , which was going to fly manned capsules to the International Space Station in ( maybe ) 2015 , to the moon in ( maybe ) 2020 , and to Mars someday , is dead .
Some people are mourning it .
I ’m not .
Is manned space exploration important ?
Yes – not least because it simply works much better than sending robots .
When you look past the rhetoric and superstitions and compare the results , today ’s robots ( and tomorrow ’s too ) are pitifully limited , painfully slow , and not really all that cheap .
( Case in point – NASA recently gave up trying to free the Mars rover Spirit from a sand pit it had been stuck in for nine months .
But when the Apollo 15 crew ’s lunar rover got bogged down in loose soil , the astronauts got off , picked it up , moved it , got back on , and drove away – all in maybe two minutes .
Robots do fine when everything goes as planned , but that ’s rarely true on complex , poorly - known planetary surfaces . )
Exploring with robots looks cheaper only because we set our expectations so much lower .
Bolder goals need humans on the scene .
Nevertheless , I ’m not shedding tears for Constellation .
Why not ?
Because it was n’t going to get us there .

First , it probably was n’t going to work .
Even so early in its life , the programme was already deep into a death spiral of “ solving ” every problem by reducing expectations of what the system would do .
Actually reaching the moon would probably have required a major redesign , which was n’t going to be funded .
Second , even if all went as planned , there was a money problem .
As the Augustine committee noted , Constellation was already underfunded , and could n’t ever get beyond Earth orbit without a big budget increase .
Which did n’t seem too likely .
Finally , and most important , even if Constellation was funded and worked … so what ?
The programme was far too tightly focused on repeating Apollo , which was pointless : we already did Apollo !
Early ideas of quickly establishing a permanent lunar base had already been forgotten .
Constellation was going to deliver exactly what Apollo did : expensive , brief , infrequent visits to the moon .
That was all it was good for .
Sure , there were hopes that Constellation ’s systems could later be adapted to support more ambitious goals .
But Apollo had those hopes too .
It did n’t work in 1970 , and it was n’t going to work in 2020 .
The demise of Constellation is not the death of a dream .
It ’s just the end of an illusion .
The proposed replacements are a mixed bag , with reason for optimism but some reason for concern .
More R&D is good .
Space flight technology has stagnated badly in recent decades ; for example , we badly need a robust , fully - reusable , low - maintenance heat shield system for atmospheric re-entry , and promising concepts from 50 years ago are still awaiting flight tests .
My one concern is that when money gets tight , it ’s easy to cut R&D funding that is n’t tied to a specific project – look at what ’s happened to NASA ’s aviation research .
Switching to commercial space transportation , for both cargo and crews , is long overdue .
For over 20 years , NASA has been legally required to use commercial space transportation whenever possible – and has used every possible excuse not to .
It ’s high time to end this .
Opponents ’ main argument is that NASA will have trouble assuring astronaut safety if it uses commercial launch services .
Hogwash .
To be blunt , NASA has no financial incentive to build safe spaceships – the shuttle , on average , has killed its entire crew about every 50 to 60 flights , and yet it has kept going .
( Indeed , after the Challenger disaster , NASA ’s shuttle budget increased ; compare that to what happened after Boeing ’s first two launches of its Delta III rocket failed – no one bought more launches and the rocket programme folded . )
Spaceship builders who have a direct financial interest in safety should do better , not worse .
At the very least , safety assessments should be done by an independent authority , with no vested interest in the answer .
When NASA was considering launching its Orion capsule on Atlas or Delta rockets five years ago , its safety standards ( pdf ) were very strict indeed – and the commercial rockets ended up losing out .
But when NASA started applying those standards to its own rocket when development of the Ares rocket and Orion crew capsule got well underway a few years later , suddenly the standards were in need of revision , and the revised ones ( pdf ) were much less demanding .
It ’s time to give commercial space flight a fair trial .
The one aspect of the announcement that is worrisome is the vagueness of the long - term plans .
“ We ’ll do neat stuff someday ” is a recipe for going back into the holding pattern NASA has been stuck in for many years , driving endlessly around the parking lot without ever getting out onto the road .
Even if the transportation is going to come from commercial providers and the details will depend on them , they need some rough idea of what NASA wants to do and when .
A clearer explanation of NASA ’s new exploration goals is urgently needed .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Sarah Palin is closer to landing a deal for a reality show .
Sources say A&E Networks and Discovery Communications want to acquire Palin ’s project , which focuses on the ex-governor giving a guided tour of her native Alaska -- visiting fishing boats and taking a trip to a gold mine , to cite a couple of examples .
Mark Burnett is executive producer of the project , whose working title is “ Sarah Palin ’s Alaska . ”
A&E Networks has n’t officially put in a bid for the show , but sources indicate that the company is interested in the project for several of its brands -- A&E , History or Lifetime .
Discovery Communications is likewise vying for the project for one or more of its outlets , such as TLC .
Some sources say the flagship Discovery Channel is no longer in play , while others say otherwise .
The former vice presidential candidate is asking for between $ 1 million and $ 1.5 million per episode , a hefty amount for a first - year cable series .
Palin initially pitched the show to broadcast networks .
Given the show ’s laid - back nature theme and lack of high - stakes drama that tends to typify broadcast reality hits , industry executives see cable as a better fit .
A&E is the home of bold reality fare like “ Intervention ” and “ Dog the Bounty Hunter , ” while Discovery has compatible outdoors series , such as Alaska - set “ Deadliest Catch . ”
“ It will sell , ” predicts one insider .
“ One way or another . ”
A&E and Discovery had no comment .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Shots fired at a congressman 's campaign headquarters .
Windows smashed at Democratic offices across the country .
A coffin placed on a lawmaker 's lawn .
Hate - filled voice mail messages left on members of Congress ' phone lines .
Those are just some of the incidents reported since the House passed historic health care reform legislation Sunday -- a bill that became the law of the land .
The issue has unleashed a deep - seated anger from those worried about a government takeover of health care , and what they deem as the process being " rammed through " Congress .
James Leach , with the National Endowment for the Humanities , said that while many of the acts may be protected under First Amendment rights , " that does n't mean that they 're morally justified . "
" And we have to think of ourselves as , ' what kind of people are we ? ' " Leach said .
" Are we one people working together with rival thoughts , or are we enemies within ?
And I think there 's something that 's been let loose in American politics that has to be thought about . "
That anger was visible in unruly protests by health care activists at the Capitol over the weekend .
Republican
House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery , some of whom carried messages like " Vote no or else " or " If Brown wo n't stop it , a Browning will " -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen.
Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol .
But the anger has boiled over into physical and verbal threats .
Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states , and federal agents are investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman 's brother was related to the lawmaker 's yes vote .
Republicans have the right to be angry over the Democrat 's health care bill , but " resorting to violent measures is exactly the wrong way to send a message , " Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Thursday night .
Rep. Anthony Weiner , D - New York , confirmed Thursday that his district office in Queens received an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter .
Later Thursday , Weiner told CNN that initial tests indicated the powder was not a biological agent , but that he still was awaiting final word from the New York Police Department .
Workers at the office turned over their clothes for testing and were given protective suits before being allowed to go home a few hours later , Weiner said .
The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are now looking into the threats , and at least 10 House Democrats have been given extra security .
The voice mail has been vicious toward Michigan 's Bart Stupak , who switched his vote to seal the deal for the bill .
He has released one of the voice mails .
Listen to the voice mail
" Stupak , you are a lowlife , baby - murdering scumbag , pile of steaming crap .
You 're a cowardly punk , Stupak , that 's what you are .
You and your family are scum , " an unidentified caller said .
" That 's what you are , Stupak .
You are a piece of crap . "
" Go to hell , you piece of [ expletive deleted ] " another caller said .

On Sunday , Democratic Rep. Russ Carnahan of Missouri had a coffin placed on his lawn , said his spokeswoman , Sarah Howard .
She said Tea Party protesters at his office in St. Louis had a coffin with them and later brought it to his house .
The coffin was later removed , she said .
Democratic congressional leaders have demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday 's vote on the health care system overhaul .
The top Republican in the House , Minority Leader John Boehner , condemned the threats and vandalism , telling reporters Thursday that it " should not be part of a political debate . "
" There are ways for people to channel their anger , and they should do it in a constructive way , " he said .
Liz Mair , a Republican consultant , said protesters " are unfortunately crossing a line . "
" When we 're talking about violence , vandalism , threats , that crosses a legal line , in addition to being in plain old bad taste , " Mair said .
" And I think that there 's a lot that is in plain old bad taste that is going on . "
Democrats are n't the only ones being targeted .
Rep. Eric Cantor , the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives , said Thursday that a bullet had been fired through a window at his campaign office in Richmond , Virginia .
Watch Cantor warn against Democrats " fanning flames "
A Richmond police spokeswoman confirmed to CNN that a bullet was fired at the congressman 's office .
" We are investigating the circumstance surrounding it , " spokeswoman Karla Peters said .
Cantor also said that he had received threatening messages but that he would not publicly release the messages out of concern that doing so would only incite further violence .
He also accused Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- a member of the Democratic House leadership -- of " fanning the flames " of violence by using threats that have been made against Democratic members " as political weapons . "
iReport : ' Violent Threats after the Healthcare Signing '
" Enough is enough , " Cantor said .
" It has to stop . "
Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse hit back against Cantor 's claims .
" We disagree with the charge made by Rep. Cantor today that Democrats are using acts of violence for political gain , " he said .
" Let 's be clear : Calling on Republican leaders who have contributed in part to this anger by wildly mischaracterizing the substance and motives of health reform to condemn these acts is entirely appropriate . "
Another Republican -- Rep. Ginny Brown - Waite of Florida -- said in a news release Thursday that she received what appeared to be a death threat on her district office 's voice mail .
" Just wanna let you know I have 27 people that are going to make sure that this b**** does not live to see her next term .
Goodbye , " the voice mail said , according to the release .
Brown - Waite said she contacted both the Capitol Police and the Hernando County sheriff , and they are " looking into the matter and subpoenaing telephone records . "
At least one of the threats aimed at lawmakers appears to be racially based .
House Democratic Majority Whip James Clyburn , who is African - American , said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home .
" We 're giving aid and comfort to these people , and this stuff gets ratcheted up , " Clyburn told CNN .
" We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down .
It does n't make sense .
That 's not what a democracy is all about . "
Democratic officials and liberal Web sites are also upset that Sarah Palin used an image of crosshairs in a Facebook post this week listing 20 vulnerable Democrats who voted for the legislation .
She plans to target them this election year with money from her political action committee .

Palin 's team is fighting claims that she is encouraging threats of violence .
One House member mentioned her Facebook posting during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns , a Democratic source told CNN's Dana Bash .
Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room , the source said .
An adviser to Palin responded by pointing to several instances in which the former Alaska governor has urged supporters to focus their energies on civil debate and action at the ballot box , not extremist activities .
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh , Dana Bash , Peter Hamby , Ed Hornick , Lesa Jansen and Tom Cohen contributed to this report .

A Colorado State Patrol trooper , in uniform and driving a marked patrol car , was pulled over this morning by sheriff ’s deputies and arrested on suspicion of drinking and driving .
The incident happened at about 7 a.m. after the Douglas County Sheriff ’s Office received “ multiple calls ” reporting that a state patrol car was “ driving erratically ” on northbound I - 25 near Castle Rock , the sheriff ’s office said in a media release .
The trooper has been identified as 21 - year - veteran David Dolan , assigned to a unit in Colorado Springs .
Response to the calls this morning was transferred to the State Patrol because it was on the interstate and involved a State Patrol cruiser .
But a short time later the State Patrol called sheriff ’s dispatchers “ asking for our assistance in locating the vehicle and checking on the welfare of the driver , ” according to a media release from the sheriff ’s office .
“ Around 7:05 a.m. , a Douglas County deputy spotted the vehicle on westbound C- 470 at Santa Fe and was able to pull the vehicle over at Platte Canyon and C - 470 , ” the release said .
“ After contacting the driver , who was confirmed to be a Colorado State Trooper in full uniform , he was taken into custody for investigation of driving under the influence of alcohol . ”
Dolan , 48 , was handcuffed and taken to the Douglas County Jail where he was booked on suspicion of DUI , DUI per se , and prohibited use of weapons .
He has been placed on unpaid administrative leave by the patrol as the incident is investigated by the sheriff ’s office .
The state patrol is conducting a concurrent investigation as well .
“ While any violation of law is serious , this alleged act is very concerning given the nature of the mission of the Colorado State Patrol , ” Col. James Wolfinbarger , chief of the CSP , said in a statement .
“ We have a 75 - year history of combating impaired and drunken driving and are deeply committed to eradicating this senseless crime on our roads . ”

For centuries biologists have known that bird bones are hollow , and even elementary school children know that bird skeletons are lightweight to offset the high energy cost of flying .
Nevertheless , many people are surprised to learn that bird skeletons do not actually weigh any less than the skeletons of similarly sized mammals .
In other words , the skeleton of a two - ounce songbird weighs just as much as the skeleton of a two - ounce rodent .
Bird biologists have known this for a long time , but it took a modern bat researcher , Elizabeth Dumont of the University of Massachusetts Amherst , to explain how bird skeletons can look so delicate and still be heavy .
The answer is that bird bones are denser than mammal bones , which makes them heavy even though they are thin and sometimes even hollow .
Her findings , supported by bone density measurements , are published in the March 17 issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society B . As Dumont explains , " The fact that bird bones are denser than bones in mammals not only makes them heavier for their size , but it may also make them stiffer and stronger .
This is a new way to think about how bird skeletons are specialized for flying and solves the riddle of why bird skeletons appear so lightweight and are still relatively heavy .
This has never been explained fully and so has never gotten into the textbooks .
I 'd like to see that change . "
Dumont measured the density of the cranium , the upper arm bone or humerus and the thigh or femur bones in song birds , rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume .
" I found that , on average , these bones are densest in birds , followed closely by bats .
Many other studies have shown that as bone density increases , so do bone stiffness and strength .
Maximizing stiffness and strength relative to weight are optimization strategies that are used in the design of strong and stiff but lightweight man-made airframes , " she points out .
Density is a measure of mass per unit of volume ; dense bones are both heavier and stronger , much as a titanium toothpick would be stronger than a wooden one .
Over time bird bones have evolved specializations that maximize stiffness and strength , Dumont says .
These specializations include high bone density , a reduction in the total number of bones , fusion of some bones , and changes in bone shape .
For example , a long history of studies have shown that the main bone in the bird wing , the humerus , is quite round in cross-section .
This makes it stiffer in the same way that a round toothpick is harder to snap than a flat one .
Galileo described bird bones as lightweight in 1683 , Dumont says .
Her new data help to dispel the common misconception that bird skeletons are lightweight relative to body mass .
Instead , bird and bat skeletons only appear to be slender and delicate -- because they are dense , they are also heavy .
Being dense , strong and stiff is one more way that birds ' and bats ' bones are specialized for flight .
In his book Remembrance of Repasts : An Anthropology of Food and Memory , Sutton observes that during the memorial liturgy for the deceased , ' the bowl of kollyva is usually placed in front of a picture of the dead person as if he or she were offering it to the attendant congregation . "
He supposes that the deceased shows his or her " food - based generosity , " since the family makes the sweet offering on the dead person 's behalf .
Those who taste kollyva are not supposed to thank the person who offer it but instead make the sign of the cross , saying , " God forgive his " — or her — " sins . "
The custom seems somewhat lost today , though .
Recently , as my husband and I were walking down the steep path to Hora from the cemetery after the solemn one - year memorial for my late cousin Leonidas , only an old lady responded properly to our offering , while most people politely thanked us .
Some scholars say kollyva was the Christian version of sacrificial food , in contrast to the pagan custom of slaughtering animals to please the gods .
Others will tell you that kollyva ( in ancient Greek the word meant " small coin " or " small golden weight , " as well as " small cakes " ) is the continuation of polysporia , the mixture of grains symbolically offered by ancient Greeks to some of their gods , especially Demeter ( Ceres ) , the goddess of agriculture .
The Turkish ashure ( or Noha 's pudding ) is a similar age - old sweet , in which the wheat berries are not drained but are simmered with sugar together with beans and chickpeas , until the cooking liquid thickens .
Nuts and dried fruits are added , and the soupy ashure is served in bowls decorated with pomegranate seeds .
It solidifies when it cools .
I have found similar sweets in Israel and throughout the Middle East , with the grains cooked in milk and sweetened with honey .
Obviously , they all share the same ancient roots .
In Athens and the other big cities , most women do n't prepare the kollyva at home anymore .
Instead , they have it made by professionals who cover the wheat with a thick sugar paste and make elaborate decorations using silver - coated almonds and dragées .
After blessing , portions of the sweet pilaf are handed out in small white paper bags printed with a cross and the name of the deceased .
In Mount Athos , a secluded community of monasteries in eastern Macedonia , the monks make magnificent decorations for their kollyva , producing fabulous ephemeral pictures of their patron saints with colored sugars .
Unfortunately , I have seen only photographs of these extraordinary edible icons , because no women are permitted to visit Mount Athos .
The recipe I give you here is my adaptation of the kollyva I learned from Koula Maroupa , from Paros .
Instead of throwing away the cooking liquid , Koula pours it into individual bowls and refrigerates it after it has cooled .
It becomes an additional sweet , a delicious jelly full of vital nutrients that can be served sprinkled with cinnamon and a little confectioner 's sugar .
Parsley , which looks somewhat out of place , can be added to kollyva to symbolize the " green pastures " where the souls rest .
Whenever pomegranates are in season , a cup of their seeds imparts color and freshness .
This fruit symbolizes fertility , and we feel we must add it " gia to kalo . "
For good luck .

May I be boring ?
Or , if you ’re a regular reader , more boring than usual ?
Bear with me .
There ’s some eye - glazing numbers and whatnot .
In 2003 , Washington blessed a grateful citizenry with the Medicare prescription drug benefit , it being generally agreed by all the experts that it was unfair to force seniors to choose between their monthly trip to Rite - Aid and Tony Danza in dinner theater .
However , in order to discourage American businesses from immediately dumping all their drug plans for retirees , Congress gave them a modest tax break equivalent to 28 percent of the cost of the plan .
Fast forward to the dawn of the Obamacare utopia .
In one of a bazillion little clauses in a 2,000 - page bill your legislators did n’t bother reading ( because , as Congressman Conyers explained , he would n’t understand it even if he did ) , Congress voted to subject the 28 percent tax benefit to the regular good ol ’ American - as - apple - pie corporate tax rate of 35 percent .
For the purposes of comparison , Sweden ’s corporate tax rate is 26.3 percent , and Ireland ’s is 12.5 percent .
But just because America already has the highest corporate tax in the OECD is no reason why we ca n’t keep going until it ’s double Sweden ’s and quadruple Ireland ’s .
I refer you to the decision last year by the doughnut chain Tim Hortons , a Delaware corporation , to reorganize itself as a Canadian corporation “ in order to take advantage of Canadian tax rates . ”
Hold that thought : “ In order to take advantage of Canadian tax rates ” – a phrase hitherto unknown to American English outside the most fantastical futuristic science fiction .
Ask yourself this :
If you impose a sudden 35 percent tax on something , are you likely to get as much of it ?
Go on , take a wild guess .
On the day President Barack Obama signed Obamacare into law , Verizon sent an e-mail to all its employees , warning that the company ’s costs “ will increase in the short term . ”
And in the medium term ?
Well , U.S. corporations that are able to do so will get out of their prescription drugs plans and toss their retirees onto the Medicare pile .
So far just three companies – Deere , Caterpillar and Valero Energy – have calculated that the loss of the deduction will add a combined $ 265 million to their costs .
There are an additional 3,500 businesses presently claiming the break .
The cost to taxpayers of that 28 percent benefit is about $ 665 per person .
The cost to taxpayers of equivalent Medicare coverage is about $ 1,200 per person .
So we ’re roughly doubling the cost of covering an estimated 5 million retirees .
Now admittedly the above scenario has not been , as they say , officially “ scored ” by the Congressional Budget Office , by comparison with whom Little Orphan Annie singing “ The Sun ’ll Come Out Tomorrow ” sounds like Morrisey covering “ Gloomy Sunday . ”
Incidentally , has the CBO ever run the numbers for projected savings if the entire CBO were laid off and replaced by a children ’s magician with an assistant in spangled tights from whose cleavage he plucked entirely random numbers ?
Just a thought .
This single component of “ health ” “ care ” “ reform ” neatly encompasses all the broader trends about where we ’re headed – not just in terms of increased costs ( both to businesses and individual taxpayers ) and worse care ( for those retirees bounced from company plans into Medicare ) , but also in the remorseless governmentalization of American life and the disincentivization of the private sector .
As we see , even the very modest attempts made by Congress to constrain the 2003 prescription drug plan prove unable to prevent its expansion and metastasization .
The one thing that can be said for certain is that , whatever claims are made for Obamacare , it will lead to more people depending on government for their health arrangements .
Those 5 million retirees are only the advance guard .
And , if you ’re one of those optimistic souls whose confidence in the CBO is unbounded , let ’s meet up in three years ’ time and see who was correct – the bureaucrats passing out the federal happy juice , or the real businesses already making real business decisions about Obamacare .
Can we afford this ?
No .
Even on the official numbers , we ’re projected to add to the existing $ 8 trillion in debt another $ 12 trillion over the next decade .
What could we do ?
Tax those big bad corporations a bit more ?
Medtronic has just announced that the new Obamacare taxes on its products could force it to lay off 1,000 workers .
What do those guys do ?
Well , they develop products such as the recently approved pacemaker that ’s safe for MRI scans or the InterStim bladder control device .
So that ’s a thousand fewer people who ’ll be working on new stuff .
Well , so what ?
The public wo n’t miss what they never knew they had .
So , again , the effect is one of disincentivization – in this case , of innovation .
If existing tax structures can’t cover the costs , what can we do ?
Start a new tax !
The VATman cometh .
VAT is Euro - speak for “ value added tax . ”
Americans often carelessly assume it ’s merely a sales tax , but , in fact , it ’s far more cumbersome than that , being levied at each stagethat “ value ” is added to a product or service .
The consumer ca n’t claim back the VAT , but intermediate businesses in the production chain can .
So self - employed individuals with relatively modest income wind up both charging VAT to their clients ( 25 percent in Scandinavia ) and then claiming back the VAT they spent on the stamp and stationery they used to mail out the invoice .
This is yet another imposition on businesses , taking time away from wealth creation and reallocating it to government paperwork .
If the Democrats hold Congress this fall , I would figure on VAT sooner rather than later .
All of the above is pretty much a safe bet .
What about the imponderables ?
Even Obama has n’t yet asked the CBO to cost out , say , what happens to the price of oil when the Straits of Hormuz are under a de facto Iranian nuclear umbrella – as they will be soon , because the former global hyperpower , which now gets mad over a few hundred housing units in Jerusalem , is blasé and insouciant about the wilder shores of the mullahs ’ dreams .
Or suppose , as seems to be happening , the Sino - Iranian alliance were to result in a reorientation of global oil relationships , or the Russo - Iranian friendship bloomed to such a degree that , between Moscow ’s control of Europe ’s gas supply and Tehran ’s new role as Middle Eastern superpower , the economy of the entire developed world becomes dependent on an alliance profoundly hostile to it .
Which is to say that right now the future lies somewhere between the certainty of decline and the probability of catastrophe .
What can stop it ?
Not a lot .
But now that your “ pro-life ” Democratic congressman has sold out , you might want to quit calling Washington and try your state capital .
If the Commerce Clause can legitimize the “ individual mandate , ” then there is no republic , not in any meaningful sense .
If you do n’t like the sound of that , maybe it ’s time for a constitutional convention .

One woman in Wales will be killed by a partner or relative this month A draft plan to tackle domestic abuse is " inadequate " and does not do enough to protect victims , a women 's campaigning group has warned .
The assembly government is to expected publish its final strategy - to protect both male and female victims - shortly .
The Wales Violence Against Women ( VAW ) Action Group say the strategy has no measurable targets or outcomes and will leave Wales behind other UK countries .
The social justice minister said the strategy was a priority for him .
To highlight the urgency of a new strategy , the action group said 160 women would be turned away from refuges in February alone , because they are virtually at capacity .
VIOLENCE IN ONE MONTH
One woman will die at the hands of a family member / partner 16 women will be raped and the case taken to court 35 sexual assaults will be taken to court 356 domestic abuse cases will be prosecuted 150 women and 132 children will go to a refuge 160 women will be turned away from full refuges
Five women will be victims of trafficking
Three women will report forced marriage
Violence against women in Wales in a month .

More than 350 cases of domestic abuse would be prosecuted , the group added .
The Wales VAG has been working with the assembly government on the strategy but says the shape and content of the final strategy remains unclear .
The group wants the government to look at the strategies published in Scotland and England VAW chair Naomi Brightmore said : " The current draft strategy for Wales is not even specifically designed to tackle violence against women , includes no measurable targets or outcomes and is not a government - wide response . "
" In England , teachers in all schools will be better trained in order to help girls facing abuse and gender equality will be part of the curriculum .
" The public sector will receive guidance about tackling violence against women in the workplace , and local authorities will be given a stronger remit and better tools in order to commission better services for victims .
" The effort wo n't be focused mainly on domestic abuse - but on all forms of violence , including sexual assault , stalking and harassment , forced marriage and female genital mutilation . "

Natalie suffered abuse for nine years before she managed to escape from a violent relationship .
She lived in an isolated house in the countryside with her partner and said the abuse began as soon as he walked through the door .
" He would start just hitting me , just kicking me and sometimes he'd say I would have to sleep in the garage , " she told BBC Radio Wales .
" I would be locked in the garage for the night .
The next morning , if he was still in a mood , he would take my car keys , my mobile phone and the phones in the house and I was completely cut off from the world . "
The social justice minister , Carl Sargeant AM , said he was determined to do more to prevent violence against women and change attitudes following his recent appointment .
He said £ 300,000 for publicity campaigns and £ 250,000 for an IT system at Welsh refuges had been allocated on top of an extra £ 1 m to implement the new strategy .
" [ It ] will focus on the wider violence against women agenda and include actions to address issues such as prostitution , sexual assault , female genital mutilation , forced marriage and honour based crime , " he added .
" The message from this government is clear - violence against women is not acceptable and we will do everything to tackle it . "

Russia ’s Terror Goes Viral
On March 2 , when his hideout in the Ingush village of Ekazhevo was surrounded by Russian special forces backed with armor , Said Buryatsky took out his mobile phone and recorded a final video for his young followers across Russia , the North Caucasus , and Central Asia .
The standoff that followed lasted several hours , ending with Buryatsky and five others dead and 11 captured .
After the raid , the Russian Federal Security Service ( FSB ) retrieved his phone ( with the video on it ) along with weapons and a substantial quantity of explosives .
Then , after a few days of hesitation , the insurgents finally admitted their man was dead .
Immediately , the tributes began to flow in by the hundreds on jihadi websites –farewells from Azerbaijan and Afghanistan , Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan , Germany and Turkey .
Some were defiant , some from rueful , self - described " Internet mujahideen . "
The story of Said Buryatsky , aka Said the Buryat , born Alexander Tikhomirov in 1982 in the western Siberian city of Ulan - Ude , thousands of miles from where he died , illustrates the dramatic speed with which the Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus is changing .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin still dreams of killing the last guerrilla , the last commander .
But as the bombings in Moscow this morning show , that goal might still be far off .
Buryatsky ’s story is a graphic demonstration that jihad in the North Caucasus has gone viral .
In the coming days , the FSB will be looking online , perhaps as much as anywhere else , to figure out what happened on the Moscow subway .
The computer has long played a role in the North Caucasus guerrilla warfare .
Ten years ago , Ibn al - Khattab , the Saudi volunteer and former comrade in arms of Osama bin Laden , would deploy his satellite phones and computers when he set up camp for the night in the highland forests of Vedeno , in southern Chechnya .
One of his lieutenants used to fret that the Russians would intercept Khattab ’s signal sooner or later , as they did when they killed independent Chechnya ’s first leader , a former Soviet air force general named Djokhar Dudayev .
He was wrong ; Khattab was killed by a double agent who infiltrated one of his bases with poison .
Still , until Buryatsky , the computer ’s and the Internet ’s roles were somewhat conventional .
Grim , drawn - faced guerrilla leaders , unaccustomed to public speaking , recorded wooden statements of menace to the regime , usually in Chechen .
Jumpy videos , the film always either under - or overexposed , depicted the militants ’ successful ambushes on country roads .
Buryatsky was different .
He was an assured speaker — relaxed , a city boy .
He was fluent in Russian , having been educated in Moscow and the Middle East , later performing the hajj in 2007 in Saudi Arabia , where he also recorded lectures .
Buryatsky ’s target was an audience yet untapped by the Chechen rebels ’ media :
The young , well - educated urban youth in the Muslim areas of the former Soviet Union .
And he reached them .
His teachings are all over the Web ; so are his ring tones .
His DVDs can be found for sale outside mosques in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan .
So successful were his recruiting messages that , according to some reports , young Kazakhs have been driven to come to the region to fight , dying in armed clashes with Russian authorities in the North Caucasus .
A young gunman shot dead in Dagestan a few weeks ago , for example , was identified as a Kyrgyz .
At a trial in Kazakhstan this year , the angry parents of three young men who had just been sentenced for trying to slip into the North Caucasus to join the jihad shouted as their detained children were exiting the courtroom , " Why did the authorities allow Said Buryatsky to come freely to Kazakhstan ?
Why were his teachings allowed to be distributed here ? "
Maybe part of the proselytizer ’s success came from how he got into the business in the first place .
Buryatsky spent less than two years in the forests .
He was already a major Internet personality for young Muslims when , the story goes , an Arab commander in the North Caucasus challenged him to give up his easy life and join them .
He did so in the first part of 2008 .
After that , he turned his brief career as a guerrilla into a seamless Internet narrative .
He admitted his initial apprehension toward joining the guerrillas .
Would he be up to it ?
Was it a trap ?
In the end , he apparently did n’t hesitate long and quickly emerged as a key face in the movement — " the main ideologue , " as Russian officials called him .
Buryatsky continued his Internet preaching and groomed suicide bombers .
Last June , Yunus - Bek Yevkurov , president of Ingushetia , a federal republic in southwestern Russia , was badly injured by a suicide bomber said to have been trained by Buryatsky .
In a talk a few months later , Buryatsky disdainfully referred to what he called Yevkurov ’s low IQ and " provincialness . "
In August , more than 20 policemen died when another Buryatsky disciple drove a minibus filled with explosives into a police compound in the Ingush city of Nazran .
Buryatsky , wearing a black T - shirt and blue jeans with a large handgun tucked into them , contributed an introduction to the film of the attack .
His later videos had a more frenetic edge :
As he talked of jihad , Buryatsky simultaneously loaded weapons for some unexplained combat .
Now that he is gone , Buryatsky is quickly becoming an online legend , reinforced by his letters , now being selectively released by guerrilla websites .
They depict his hatred for " dying Russia " and the " pigs " who serve it , and his own growing obsession — a " wild hunger " as he called it in one letter — to become a shahid , or martyr .
It would not be surprising if his last message — the one filmed on his phone and later confiscated by the FSB — surfaces on some guerrilla website , leaked by sympathizers inside the local police .
Even with the absence of what he said in his final moments , however , Buryatsky ’s story catches the profound changes that have taken place in the North Caucasus in the past decade .
The first Chechen war , from 1994 to 1996 , was largely a secular struggle waged by people who wanted to live independently from Russia .
The current conflict is being fought for an Islamist state across the North Caucasus , and ultimately beyond .
The soldiers this time are fighters who , like Buryatsky , dream of dying a martyr ’s death .
Perhaps for this reason , no one on the Russian side — not even those with a personal score to settle — showed much relief at Buryatsky ’s death .
His old nemesis Yevkurov remarked that another ideologue is bound to emerge to take his place .
Maybe next time , he said , it will be " some Said the Chinese . "
Unfortunately , for the Ingush president , Buryatsky ’s message of jihad may well have traveled that far .
Bushmen mark eight years without water
March 21 , 2010

As the world marks World Water Day , the Gana and Gwi Bushmen of Botswana are marking eight years without access to a regular supply of water in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve .
In 2002 , the Botswana government cut off and sealed a borehole , which the Bushmen relied on for water , in an attempt to drive them out of the reserve .
Despite the Botswana High Court ’s 2006 ruling that the Bushmen have the constitutional right to live in the reserve , the government has refused to allow them to re-commission their borehole , even though they have offered to raise the costs themselves .
At the same time as forcing the Bushmen to make 300 mile round trips to fetch water , the government has allowed the opening of a safari lodge in the reserve , complete with a swimming pool for tourists , and has drilled new boreholes for wildlife only .
The government ’s treatment of the Bushmen was recently condemned by the UN Special Rapporteur for indigenous peoples , who accused it of falling short of ‘ the relevant international human rights standards ’ .
He also found that those Bushmen who have returned to the reserve ‘ face harsh and dangerous conditions due to a lack of access to water ’ and urged the government to reactivate the Bushmen ’s borehole ‘ as a matter of urgent priority ’ .
Since the ruling , many Bushmen have returned to their ancestral lands inside the reserve .
However , without access to their borehole , they face severe water shortages ; at least one woman has died from dehydration since the borehole was cut off .
Many more languish in the resettlement camps where they were dumped by the government , anxious about returning to their lands without access to a regular supply of water .
Over 2,000 days since their water supply was cut off , the Bushmen have now launched legal proceedings against the government in a bid to gain access to their borehole .
Survival ’s director , Stephen Corry , said today , ‘ The government ’s continued refusal to allow the Bushmen access to their borehole is nothing short of malicious .
All the Bushmen want is to be able to use their borehole as they did before they were illegally evicted from their lands .
How can Botswana call itself ‘ a shining light ’ of democracy when it is denying its oldest inhabitants their fundamental right to water ? ’
As Feargal Sharkey , head of UK Music , speaks of his confidence that the massively controversial Digital Economy Bill will be passed before the general election , the Open Rights Group has revealed that in the last 3 days more than 10,000 outraged citizens have written to MPs demanding a debate on the issue .
The UK Government continues to push forward the Digital Economy Bill ( DEB ) that aims to protect copyright holders from online pirates .
On 15th March the House of Lords approved the bill and handed it over to the House of Commons .
To the absolute dismay of most outside the music and movie industries , some of the most controversial elements of the Bill are unlikely to receive any major scrutiny and will be dealt with quickly under the so - called “ wash - up ” , a short period between the announcement of an election and parliament being closed down .
“ It ’s a deeply unsatisfactory and very worrying development , ” a senior executive from an ISP told The Guardian .
“ The fear is that no one will know what is being cooked - up before it becomes law .
It ’s legislation on the hoof . ”
But this situation suits the BPI just fine .
This week a leaked memo from the BPI fell into the hands of Cory Doctorow which showed that the “ LibDem amendment ” – a proposal under the DEB which would allow for websites to be blocked if , essentially , the BPI did n’t like their activities – was in fact written by the BPI .
Very cosy .
But the controversies do n’t end there .
Doctorow also received an internal document prepared by the BPI ’s Director of Public Affairs and prospective Labour parliamentary candidate , Richard Mollet .
In the document he admitted that the only reason the DEB had a chance of passing is because MP ’s are resigned to voting on it without debate .
“ Translation : if MPs got to debate the Bill , they would tear it to unrecognizable pieces as they realized what terrible rubbish it really is , ” wrote Doctorow .
The scandals go on and on , but we have to stop somewhere .
Nevertheless , UK Music head Feargal Sharkey says that he is confident that the DEB will be passed before the general election , although others are not so sure .
“ It will still be nip and tuck to get the Digital Economy Bill onto the statute book before the election so the battle is not won yet , ” wrote Shadow Culture Minister , Jeremy Hunt , on his blog this week .
According to Jim Killock at the Open Rights Group , UK citizens are n’t leaving anything to chance with 10,000 of them having written to their MPs in the last three days to demand a debate on the Digital Economy Bill .
“ It is outrageous for corporate lobbyists including the BPI , FAST and UK Music to demand that MPs curtail democracy and ram this Bill through Parliament without debate , ” says Killock , adding : “ The British people did not elect UK Music and the BPI to write our laws . ”
Killock says that what is making the 10,000 so angry is the pushing through of the DEB without debate , an act he describes as “ undemocratic and dangerous ” .

Elan Microelectronics filed suit against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission today , alleging that certain Apple ( s aapl ) products violate a multitouch patent previously awarded to the Taiwanese company .
Elan in April of last year filed a related suit with the U.S. District Court in Northern California over the same patent — No. 7,274,353 — which it calls “ a fundamental patent to the detection of multi-fingers that allows for any subsequent multi- finger applications to be implemented . ”
By going to the ITC in addition to filing a patent infringement suit , Elan seeks to block Apple from importing its products into the U.S. that use multitouch , including the iPhone , iPod touch , MacBook , Magic Mouse and the iPad , which is due for release on April 3 .
Since Apple products are designed in Cupertino but assembled outside of the U.S. , Elan is courting the appropriate trade commission that has authority to stop such products from reaching America ’s shores .
Notably , any ITC findings will be binding regardless of the patent lawsuit outcome , thanks to a loophole in U.S. patent law .
Ironically , Apple is using this same strategy to try and block HTC from importing phones that Cupertino alleges violate its patents .
Elan is no stranger when it comes to protecting its intellectual property — in 2008 , the California district courts deemed that some Synaptics touchpads violated this very same patent .
The result of that suit was a licensing agreement between Elan and Synaptics ( s syna ) .
Although possible , I doubt that Elan v Apple will result in a similar deal .
I wonder how many of those iPad pre-order customers like myself are hoping the slow delivery boat from China speeds up , just in case of some unlikely quick legal action ?

After last night 's piss - poor display , is this the reaction you want from your head coach ? :
" Well I think the one thing that really did n’t help us tonight is the fact that we had about four or five players really battling the flu . "
If these guys were as sick as he claims , why not dress Brad Marchand , Jeff Penner , or Trent Whitfield .
At least these guys might have played with some hunger and passion , since they have something to prove .
I 'm tried of this guy making excuses and spitting out the same old clichés night after night .
Julien lost this team a long time ago .
When all the players were saying a few months ago when they were in their slump " this is n't the coach 's fault .
This is on us . " , I wanted to believe them .
Now , it is obvious that Claude is a big part of the problem .
One of the biggest problems I have had with Julien this year is that he does n't hold his players accountable .
Look at Dennis Wideman .
He is second only to Zdeno Chara in ice time with 23:41 a night .
You can not motivate players when you are rewarding them for playing poorly .
Claude Julien had a team that opponents feared playing against last year because they knew they were in for a tough game against the B's .
That team toughness has been non-existent this year .
They do n't skate hard , they do n't hit hard , and they do n't create offense by going the the danger areas on the ice .
Maybe this is just the coaching product life - cycle of Claude Julien and it looks like we are into the decline phase .
Take a look at his past .
He has never kept a job with a team for longer than three years .
Even more telling is the fact that the Devils fired him while they were in first place and three games away from the start of the playoffs .
Coaches in first place do n't get fired right before the playoffs unless there is a major concern about his ability to motivate his team .
Of course , it would be a bit hypocritical for Peter Chiarelli to fire Julien , because he is equally at fault .
Chiarelli did n't give Julien the right group of players to work with .
He never replaced the goals that left town with Phil Kessel , crippled the team 's ability to make moves with high - priced long - term contracts and did next to nothing to improve this team at the deadline .
The Bruins need to make some big changes to motivate this team and win back the fans in this town .
A shake up is needed and it is needed now .
Claude has to go .
Fun Fact : Pat Burns ( 4 years ) is the only Bruins head coach to last more than 3 seasons behind the bench in last 25 years .
And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
48 And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
" Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .

Sally Birnie worked for Edinburgh City Council
A council revenue and benefits boss who embezzled almost £ 70,000 has been ordered to carry out 240 hours of community service .
Sally Birnie , 42 , paid the cash into bogus accounts over five years as a section leader within Edinburgh City Council 's finance department .
Birnie , from Balerno , admitted embezzling £ 67,780 while working at Chesser House in Gorgie Road .
She carried out the offence between 1 September 2003 and 3 November 2008 .
At an earlier hearing , at Edinburgh Sheriff Court , fiscal depute Gerard Drugan said Birnie was caught when a revenue and benefits officer spotted an irregularity in a claim for benefits for a woman in a hostel .
Serious debt
He said : " There appeared to be no supporting documentation for this claim and the benefits from that claim were debited to a bank account , which was not a normal procedure for those claiming from a hostel , usually it is to the accommodation provider . "
During a disciplinary hearing Birnie admitted what she had done and was dismissed from her position .
When interviewed by police Birnie said she had found herself in serious debt including loans for a sister who passed away and credit card bills .
Defence agent Kenneth Sinclair said : " She does not seem to have any significant financial benefit from these activities .
" She felt responsible for her deceased sister 's debts and she has had tragedies in her family and is the carer for her elderly parents who have serious health problems . "
Sheriff Kathrine Mackie told Birnie it was a serious matter for the reasons highlighted by Mr Sinclair and a custodial sentence would be appropriate .
But she also said she had considered the reasons for the crime and felt in the circumstances there was the alternative of community service .

Traditional gowns allow easy access but can leave patients exposed
The traditional draughty and backless hospital gown is getting a Hollywood - style makeover by one of the world 's top designers .
Ben de Lisi , famed for creating red-carpet frocks for stars like Kate Winslet , says his " aspirational " new design will preserve patients ' modesty .
The old gowns have been criticised for leaving patients laid bare .
The Design Council will unveil the design next month as part of a project to improve dignity across the NHS .
Health Minister Ann Keen said the designer gowns would be introduced into NHS hospitals in England by early 2011 .
The old hospital gown was hideous , embarrassing , ill - fitting and probably ill - making too
Designer Ben de Lisi
She said : " As a nurse , I know that when patients visit hospital , the gown they wear is exceptionally important .
" Patients need to feel confident and comfortable in what can be difficult situations . "
De Lisi told the BBC News website that he designed the gowns with comfort in mind .
Ben de Lisi 's early concepts met with great approval " The old hospital gown was hideous , embarrassing , ill - fitting and probably ill - making too .
" You are away from home , ill , and in hospital and you have to wear this horrific garment with your arse hanging out .
Give me a break .
" I wanted the new gowns to feel fabulous and aspirational .
" They are made from beautiful cotton shirting which is very smooth , cool and lux . "
Dignified
He said his design means patients can have their modesty covered but still allow medics immediate access through clever " entrance points " in the gown .
" It 's infinitely dignified , yet practical .
And Velcro does n't enter into the equation . "
De Lisi's NHS collection , in his signature printed fabric , also includes pyjama bottoms , nightwear and slippers .
Design Council chief executive David Kester said the designs , funded by £ 25,000 from the Department of Health , were a great and affordable improvement .
" The new designs are going to be very competitively priced and within the current price range for the NHS , even with the designer connection . "
He said teams of designers and architects were working on other projects to redesign NHS hospitals in England to improve the experience for patients .
Several hospital trusts are already switching to more dignified wraparound gowns , albeit without the designer label .
Katherine Murphy , director of the Patients Association , said the news would be welcomed by patients .
" Very often when people are admitted to hospital they do n't have enough time to bring some pyjamas or a dressing gown with them and have to wear hospital gowns .
" But when you are ill , the last thing you need is to be embarrassed as well . "

A Labour politician visiting the Gaza Strip has called the blockade of the Hamas - ruled territory by Israel and Egypt " evil " .
Sir Gerald Kaufman also spoke in support of attempts by pro-Palestinian groups in Britain to have arrest warrants issued against Israeli politicians involved in Israel 's war on Gaza last winter .
Human rights groups have alleged that Israel , along with Hamas , committed war crimes , citing among other things the use of white phosphorous flares in densely populated areas .
Mr Kaufman , who is MP for Manchester Gorton , said " anybody who uses white phosphorous should be arrested and should be tried for war crimes " .
The politician led a group of 60 parliamentarians from 13 European countries who arrived in Gaza .

The Federal Communications Commission is set to unveil a sweeping proposal tomorrow to overhaul the U.S. broadband policy in order to bring affordable , high - speed Internet connections to all Americans .
The plan could be stalled if the FCC can’t find the funding , corporate support or legal clearance to move forward .
Part of the goal is to increase current Internet speeds as well as provide web access to 100 million Americans .
A coalition of consumer groups and public interest advocates is specifically urging the FCC to include increased access to underserved communities .
The coalition includes : the Consumer Federation of America , Media Access Project , Public Knowledge , Consumers Union , New America Foundation ’s Open Technology Initiative , and the Free Press .
They are proposing the following recommendations :
Increasing U.S. broadband adoption of networks at “ world class speeds ” to 90 percent by 2020 ;
Substantially improving the level of competition between providers of broadband Internet access by the end of 2012 ;
Establishing real consumer protections for broadband customers within 12 - 18 months ;
Implementing new broadband data collection standards and rules for utilizing that data in market analyses by the end of 2010 ; and
Quickly , establishing rules protecting open markets for speech and commerce on broadband networks .
According to a recent report by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration the overall use of high - speed Internet has increased , yet there ’s still a dramatic digital divide in America .
While Black and Latino access has risen significantly over the last few years , access to high - speed Internet remains uneven particularly in low - income , rural and minority communities .
Asian non-Hispanic ( 67.3 percent ) and white non-Hispanic users ( 65.7 percent ) are more likely to have broadband in their home than Black non-Hispanic ( 45.9 percent ) , Hispanic ( 39.7 percent ) , and Native American / Alaska Native users ( 42.6 percent ) .
Civil rights groups argue the federal government must address the problem given the serious consequences the result could have for disadvantage minority groups especially as computer skills become increasingly important in all aspects of American life .
The wide disparity in Internet access is quickly becoming a matter of grave social and political importance where more than 40 percent of all homes are not connected , critics charge .
Many households use antiquated ‘ dial - up ’ technology , analysts note , and as high - speed Internet becomes increasingly expensive , middle - and low - income families are less able to afford it .
“ The digital divide extends beyond connectivity , ” explains Megan Tady in a Color Lines article last year .
“ Many people do n’t have the training , skills or equipment to get online , or they live in an area that has been redlined by Internet service providers who find little incentive to build out to their communities , ” she writes .
“ No matter how many companies enter the market , the fight for customers in high income communities will always be more rewarding for the industry than providing access to low - income communities . ”
However many note the FCC ’s plan could mark the biggest opportunity to restructure and regulate the way American ’s access the Internet .
The FCC will make a series of recommendations to Congress aimed at spurring the ever - changing communications industry to bring more and faster online services to Americans as more turn to the Internet to communicate , pay bills , make travel plans or for news and entertainment .
The FCC also wants to make sure that anchor institutions – government buildings , schools , libraries and health care facilities – get speeds of about 1 gigabit per second by 2020 .
FCC officials say some of the goals are “ aspirational ” and should be viewed as a “ living , breathing ” document for the next decade in hopes of helping 93 million Americans without broadband get connected .
Meanwhile the Obama administration has touted the plan as a way to create jobs and make energy use more efficient .

Long - delayed plans by the US to deploy a small robot space shuttle appear now to be approaching fruition , according to reports .
The US Air Force has now stated that the X - 37 unmanned spaceplane will be launched into orbit on April 19 .
Falling with style .
The X - 37 began life as a NASA project , intended perhaps to lead to a manned " lifeboat " re-entry craft for the crew of the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
In the event NASA did little more than get the ball rolling , and the ISS lifeboat is actually an ordinary Russian Soyuz capsule .
But the X - 37 project at Boeing carried on , passing from NASA into military hands and becoming a robotic spaceplane able to remain in orbit for substantial periods before re-entering the atmosphere and coming in for a runway landing automatically .
It is now run by the US Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office , which at one point hoped to make the first space flight as early as 2008 .
The X - 37 has already flown in various in - atmosphere tests , sometimes being dropped from high in the stratosphere by the " White Knight " mothership used to carry the famous X - Prize - winning SpaceShipOne suborbital rocketplane on the first stage of its journeys .
Reportedly the X - 37 suffered some hiccups during these tests , on one occasion running off the end of the runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California .
Now , according to written answers supplied by the Air Force to Spaceflight Now , the X - 37 has been shipped to Florida where it will be mounted atop an Atlas V launch rocket for despatch into orbit next month .
The airforce spokesmen are n't revealing anything more about the X - 37's mission - not even the date for its return to Earth , far less anything regarding the payload .
According to the Rapid Capabilities Office :
The X - 37B has the requirement to be on - orbit up to 270 days .
Actual length for the first mission will depend on the meeting the mission objectives , which consists of checkout and performance characteristics of the spacecraft systems .
Objectives of the OTV [ Orbital Test Vehicle ] program include space experimentation , risk reduction and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies .
The X - 37's cargo bay is believed to be a large - coffin sized 7 ' by 4 ' . ®
China 's demographic challenges are well known and largely self - imposed ( the one - child policy , the anti-girl policy ) and it remains something of a mystery how these will play out and affect the country 's economic future .
Here 's some perspective on the issue rom Waverly Advisors , looking at workforce composition :
In the wake of Lunar new year , local Chinese media outlets have been full of discussions of labor shortages as migrants failed to return after their annual visit home .
According to anecdotal accounts migrants have been choosing to remain closer to home as more competitive employment opportunities created by the stimulus surge become available in central and western .
The worker deficit has been reported at two million in the Pearl River Delta region and almost a shortfall of almost a million in Wenzhou .
The Guangzhou daily reported Thursday that the provincial government there had increased the minimum wage by 20 % in response to rising competition for migrant labor , with base wage levels there now surpassing those in Beijing .
In the near term , wage inflation may start to be a symptom of overinvestment last year just as commodity inflation is .
In the long term this short term labor tightness , though caused by regional industrial dynamics , serves as a reminder that China faces a declining working age population in the decades ahead as the impact of the one child policy .
The one child rule helped fuel the rapid growth of the past three decades of growth as workers outnumbered dependents but now , with that cycle currently peaking , the total real labor force is expected to contract by more than 20 % by 2050 .
For China a declining work force raises critical issues .
As the current work force ages the impact on consumer demand will be significant given the dreadful state of social benefits for pensioners that has encouraged high savings rates .
This underscores the need for Beijing to make good on its pledge to increase social welfare programs as pledged during the National People 's Congress earlier this month .
First , the transcript :
Sen. Sanders ( I - VT ) : " Let me begin by saying something to my friend Senator Gregg , through the chairman , through the chairman .
I really do n't like being lectured on deficits when you ( Sen. Gregg ) and many members of your party ( Republicans ) helped cause the situation we are in right now . " " People voted , Senator Gregg , I believe you are one of them , for a war in Iraq , which some people will think will cost two or three trillion dollars , but you forgot to pay for that war .
You and other people voted for tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 % , costs $ 600 billion dollars , forgot to pay for that .
You voted for a prescription drug medicare bill which will cost $ 400 billion dollars but does n't negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry , forgot to ask how that was going to be paid for , you voted for the bailout and I believe you want to repeal the inheritance tax , which will cost a trillion dollars over a ten year period , benefiting the top 3/10 ths of 1 % .
I voted against all of those things , so please , please , spare the lectures on deficit reduction . "
Later in the video , Senator Sanders mentions the fact that America 's top 1 % of wealthiest citizens earns more income the bottom 50 % COMBINED .
RNC Chairman Micheal Steele says that a million dollars after tax is n't that much money , but it is , a lot more than it was before George W. Bush 's and the so called Fiscal Conservatives passed tax cuts for the rich without considering how that would affect America 's ability to raise the revenue needed to balance the budget .
Of course , Fiscal Conservatives will claim that all one needs to do is cut spending too , unless it is for war .
But if war is so necessary why is n't health care reform , or cutting back on pollution , or a number of other issues .
Maybe it is because the only thing fiscally conservative about so called fiscal conservatives is the fact that they insist on calling themselves fiscal conservatives .
In the real world , taking something without paying for it is called STEALING .
It 's like Robin Hood in reverse , fiscal conservatives like to rob from the poor and give to the rich .
But what so called fiscal conservatives are really trying to do can be best summed up by the example I have provided below .
Imagine sharing an apartment with someone and going grocery shopping and then watching your roommate , who did n't spend a dime of his own money , clean out the fridge while you are at work .
When you get home and discover what has happened your roommate immediately blames you for the mess and then insists that whatever food is left must be rationed between the two of you .
And your roommate will not let you cook what you want , only what he wants .
The same story works with booze as well , and would be appropriate , because the so called Fiscal Conservatives of the GOP and their BushDog / ConservaDem counterparts have spent like drunken sailors on shore leave when in power , and only when they are out of power and beginning to sober up do they start actually caring about deficits and debt , but fortunately , they do n't ever remember what caused those deficits .
How can they remember that THEY caused the deficits if they are trying to blame it on Democrats and the current Administration ?
The best way to counter this move by Conservatives to try and blame Democrats for our deficits and hamstring our ability to pass our agenda is to simply tell the truth .
The truth is that so called Fiscal Conservatives such as George W. Bush , Ben Nelson , Judd Gregg and Eric Cantor did n't even try to pay for any of their plans , instead they left all of their deficits on the White House front door in a burning bag for the next administration .
My advise to Democrats and the White House , if I might dare to advise on the matter , is to NOT try and stamp out the burning brown deficit bag .
Instead , we should make sure everyone in America knows where this deficit came from ( the Iraq War crime , Tax cuts for the rich and other anti-working class Conservative Corporatist policies that DO NOT WORK ) .
Otherwise Democrats will take the blame for all of the GOP 's policy disasters .
Blame the GOP , blame George W. Bush , who was supported by every Republican right up until the moment when McCain / Palin lost the Presidential Election .
But most of all , DO NOT attempt to stamp out the Brown Burning Bag of Bush / Conservative deficit , it is not as important as putting Americans back to work and once the shit gets on your shoes you will own it , dear Democrats .
Like a pack of irresponsible school kids , the GOP should not surprise us anymore .
Good thing we have strong voices such as Senator Bernie Sanders to call the so called " fiscal conservatives " out when they try to pass off their flaming bag of deficit crap on someone else .

How 's that for the truth ?

No matter who you are one of the biggest obstacles and considerations when planning a trip is cost .
Out of all of the reasons regularly given for why people “ can’t ” travel , cost is the one I ’ve found to be the most common and frankly , it ’s with good reason .
Jumping on a plane , flying across the world and spending several weeks away from our normal day - to - day infrastructure has the potential to not only be stressful , but also quite expensive .
Especially if you treat your travel time as a vacation “ splurge ” as most Americans do .
The great news is , it does n’t have to be .
Ultimately , it comes down to how you ’re willing to travel .
Splurge travel is terribly expensive but often reflects how we ’ve been told we “ need ” to travel .
The truth is , budget travel is all about re-framing your normal day - to - day lifestyle so it works for international travel .
By doing this I was able to spend 36 days abroad in 2009 on two separate trips while holding down a normal salaried job while limited to two weeks paid vacation .
The final cost for both trips including airfare and all ancillary expenses ?
Less than $ 5500 dollars .
The exciting part ?
If I ’d truly wanted or needed to , I could have easily done the trips for $ 1,000 less .
As is , I ’ve found that Ive historically averaged about $ 2700 for a 16 - 18 day trip to Europe and about $ 2300 for a 20 day trip to Central America .
How To Do It
Most people will tell you that budget travel starts when you hit the road .
It does n’t .
It starts at home , months before you begin a trip .
The key to being able to afford to travel at all is managing your expenses and eliminating areas where you ’re throwing away money .
Once that ’s done , it ’s important to look through your daily lifestyle expenses in order to identify which expenses are flexible and which expenses are fixed .
More on this in a second .
First :
What you DON ’T want to do is book a ticket , and put your entire trip on your credit card , planning to pay it off once you get home .
What you DO want to do is eliminate all credit card debt .
If you ’re a 20 something reading this blog , there ’s a decent chance that you ’re not paying your credit card off fully every month .
If you ’re in this category , you ’ve got a HUGE expense that you can easily eliminate .
Interest costs money especially if you ’re paying 15 - 20 % APR .
A lot of money – as in hundreds if not thousands of dollars extra each year .
By paying off their credit card debt and adopting a policy of paying off your total in full each month – you ’ll find yourself with a lot of extra money for future trips .
Second :
Cut out major splurge expenses .
It never ceases to amaze me how the people who constantly complain about lack of money turn around and spend ridiculous sums of money .
I regularly see these people spend hundreds of dollars on tickets to see a musical performance or at sporting events .
If not some sort of live , one time event , it ’s usually hundreds of dollars spent on things like electronics , designer furniture , expensive hair salons or overpriced clothing .
Eliminating a few of these expenses a year may be enough save up for the trip of a lifetime .
Third : Food and Bar tabs .
If you ’re in your 20s or 30s and live a social life style , you ’re probably spending a lot of money on food and drink .
As a single , 20 something male , I know that this is the area where I ’m able to make the biggest cuts .
Bar tabs can be insanely expensive .
If you ’re one of those people spending $ 60 - $ 200 on bar tabs a weekend , a few basic changes will add up quickly .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m not saying do n’t go out .
I ’m saying drink smarter and spend less .
Significantly less .
Like to eat out ?
Consider trading fancy high end eateries for often equally delicious , albeit significantly cheaper local venues and dives .
For the average person , following the tips I ’ve outlined above should save you at least $ 1,500 a year .
For most , it ’ll result in saving significantly more .
The Next Step
After re-evaluating your current expenses and identifying areas where you can make cuts , it ’s important that you identify different types of expenses .
Some expenses are location specific and are n’t flexible .
From trips under a month in duration you ’re pretty much stuck with things like your monthly rent check , cell phone bill and car insurance .
However , other expenses – like food , gas , entertainment and bar tabs – are flexible .
This is the exciting part , because by re-allocating those expenses during your trip , you ’re actually going to be depleting your savings far less than you expect .
Tally up your average weekly expenses in this category and pay special attention to the final number .
I know that I average about $ 12 / day on lunch , $ 10 / day on dinner , $ 40 / week on Gas , $ 20 / week on entertainment and $ 50 / week on bar tabs and random meals .
That alone accounts for about $ 264 in expenses a week and leaves out a number of similar expenses .
It also means that I can spend at least $ 528 over a 14 day period on the road without changing my cost of living , a single penny .
You ’ll also need to take into consideration your type of employment .
Are you paid hourly or are you on salary ?
Again , this is significant because it dictates the extent of your opportunity cost .
An individual on salary taking paid time off has a major advantage over someone who works hourly for tips .
The unfortunate reality is that the opportunity cost for the salaried individual , who ’ll have an uninterrupted revenue stream is dramatically lower , than that of the hourly worker who wo n’t be able to work / collect a pay check while abroad .
The trade off , however , is that it ’s significantly easier for the hourly employee to take off several weeks at a time .
Regardless , do n’t forget to take your type of employment and opportunity cost into account .
The Trip
Travel for less – How ?
By picking a time for the trip that is slightly off season .
This is important because airfare , accommodation and even food can be much , much cheaper .
Remember , the more money you save on each of these ( within reason ) the sooner you can take your trip and the more trips you ’ll be able to budget for .
Keep it Regional – Let ’s assume you ’re like most Americans and you ’ve budgeted for a relatively short trip ( 20 days or less ) .
The temptation is to try and visit as many locations and countries as you can possibly squeeze into one trip .
Honestly ?
Do n’t .
I regularly talk to friends who plan on seeing London , Paris , Berlin and Rome in a two week trip .
Unfortunately , these types of schedules are a horrible idea .
Traveling costs time and money – especially when you ’re covering large distances and crossing international borders .
Cut your expenses dramatically by planning regional trips that avoid long leg voyages .
By doing this you ’ll save a lot of money , see more , and get more out of the experience .
Unfortunately , capital cities are capital cities .
They ’re typically big , industrial and modern .
Sure , each has it ’s own flavor and unique draw but the real adventures and beauty lies in a country ’s other cities and towns .
After all – what would you think of America if all you came and saw was Los Angeles , Detroit and Philadelphia ?
Be Reasonable –
You do n’t need to stay in a 4 star hotel to be happy and get a lot out of your experience .
Remember , your goal is to minimize a - typical expenses .
Besides , the truth of the matter is you ’re going to enjoy yourself far more in a hostel then you would in a hotel .
Book hostels , and consider couch surfing as a way to reduce accommodation expenses and increase socialization .
Remember , there ’s no better place to meet friends and travelers than in a hostel common area or bar .
Besides , most hostel bars and restaurants have food for far cheaper than the surrounding area .
Feeling the need to splurge a bit ?
Then splurge on a smaller room at the hostel – instead of blowing your daily budget on a private room at a hotel .
Eat and Drink Smart – Your three major expenses on the road will be food / drink , accommodation and travel .
In fact , these three should / will probably make up some 2/3 of your daily expenses .
Be smart about it and push your boundaries .
Identify the local budget foods ( Indian in the UK , Gyros in Greece , Kebabs in Europe , Beans and Rice in Belize , Tacos in Mexico etc. ) and eat those regularly .
Heading to the pub ?
Stop at the supermarket first and pre-game .
Alcohol is expensive , be smart and remember – other travelers are on their own budget , so there ’s no reason to be a big spender .
If you ’re going to buy someone a drink keep it to locals - only as a thank you for their hospitality , no reason to go off and buy round after round .
Do n’t Shop – Sure , everyone asked you to pick them up something before the trip .
Not to mention , the shoes sold in Paris are – I ’m told – quite fantastic .
But , let ’s be frank .
You ’re there to experience the culture , meet people , see amazing things , and maximize an already stretched budget .
Not buy worthless shit .
If you ’re going to pick up a keep sake or two – go for it when you find them on sale .
If you need a shirt or jumper while on the road ?
Then pick one up – but do n’t go off on a silly spending spree .
I ca n’t tell you how often I see people start a trip , arrive at their first destination and blow a small fortune on crap – before they ’ve even gotten up and going .
Above all – Get out there and have fun .
The biggest obstacle to travel and taking a trip is excuses .
If you make the decision to take the trip , stop making excuses , and prioritize – you ’ll be able to enjoy the wonders of the road in no time .
Stop wishing and start doing !

We rounded up all of the design shows we attended in 2018 so you can revisit them or catch up on what you missed .
A Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon says a woman 's size - D breast implants might have saved her life when a gunman opened fire at her office .
Lydia Carranza was working at the Simi Valley dental office July 1 when her co-worker , the gunman 's wife , was shot and killed .
Carranza was just a few feet away .
She survived a gunshot to the chest , but the the bullet left a scar and deflated the implant .
" She 's just one lucky woman , " Dr. Ashkan Ghavami told the LA Times .
" I saw the CT scan .
The bullet fragments were millimeters from her heart and her vital organs .
Had she not had the implant , she might not be alive today . "
Ghavami told the Times he will perform the reconstructive surgery at a reduced cost .
He 'd like implant companies to donate supplies .
But a spokeswoman for the hospital at which Carranza was treated said it 's not a medical issue .
" It 's a ballistics issue , " Kris Carraway , a spokeswoman for Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks , told the Times .
" The emergency physician who treated the patient was not aware of the breast implant having any impact or whether or not it saved her life . "
An LAPD firearms instructor told the Times it 's possible the implant interrupted the velocity of the bullet .
" I do n't want to say a boob job is the equivalent of a bulletproof vest , " Scott Reitz told the Times .
" So do n't go getting breast enhancements as a means to deflect a possible incoming bullet . "

NASA is spending more than it should to cater conferencesfor space agency events ?
at one point spending $ 66 a day for each person tomake sure attendees have enough sodas , bagels and other snacks , according to anew report .
The 26 - page report , submitted Tuesday by NASA ?
sInspector General office , found that NASA spent $ 62,611 on snacks alone during aDecember 2008 training conference on procurement issues ?
or how best to spend taxpayermoney on agency needs .
That boils down to $ 66 a day for each of the 317 people attending the conference , the report stated .
Thosecosts , which were just part of the overall $ 495,173 price tag of the conferencein Baltimore , Md. , were ?
excessive , ?
according to the report , which reviewedeight NASA conferences held in the 2009 fiscal year .
NASAshould set up guidelines for the costs ofmeals and other services for agency - sponsored conferences similar to thoseused by the U.S. Justice Department , which sets a cap for meal - spending perperson for each day , based on the total daily expenses , the report stated .
NASAalso overspent on meals for a different conference , this one focused onaeronautics , in Atlanta , the report went on to say .
There , NASA spent $ 58,450 of the total $ 535,149 conference price tag on meals for the conference ?s 650 attendees , but the space agency should have only spent about $ 26,000 , the InspectorGeneral office found .
Thespace agency could also have saved nearly $ 50,000 on those meals if it had justpaid for the meals of NASA workers and contractors , instead of everyone whoattended the conference , the report said .
Thereport also criticizedNASA for not seeking out the most affordable location for the conferencesreviewed by soliciting estimates for other venues .
NASAofficials agreed with many of the findings and recommendations made in the newreport , and stressed that the space agency will do better in planning futureconferences .
New guidelines should be drawn up to better manage costs withinthe next month or so , they added .
Theeight meetings studied in the report were organized before NASA overhauled itsconference planning after an earlier review in 2008 , the officials added .
? Sincethen , NASA has improved its conference planning and cost controls along thelines recommended in the report , ?
NASA ?s deputy chief financial officer TerryBowie wrote in the response .
The conservative establishment is looking to eliminate the appearance of extremism within the GOP .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Conservatives target their own fringe
After months of struggling to harness the energy of newly engaged tea party activists , the conservative establishment — with critical midterm congressional elections on the horizon — is taking aim for the first time at the movement ’s extremist elements .
The move has been cast by some conservatives as a modern version of the marginalization of the far - right , anti-communist John Birch Society during the reorganization of the conservative movement spearheaded by William F. Buckley Jr. in the 1960s and 1970s .

“ A similar effort will be required today of conservative political and intellectual leaders , ” former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote in his column in The Washington Post .
“ It will not be easy .
Sometimes it takes courage to stand before a large crowd and proclaim that two plus two equals four . ”
But for Gerson and other conservatives , this is not just an intellectual exercise .
They have a very specific political goal : to deprive Democrats and their allies of a potentially potent weapon to use against the GOP in November .
“ I do n’t believe we should be giving [ extremists ] a platform or empowering them to do anything based off their conspiracy theories , ” said Ned Ryun , president of American Majority , “ because they give the left ammunition to try to define the tea party movement as crazy and fringy . ”
The attempt “ to clean up our own house , ” as Erick Erickson , founder of the influential conservative blog RedState , puts it , is necessary “ because traditional press outlets have decided to spotlight these fringe elements that get attracted to the movement , and focus on them as if they ’re a large part of this tea party movement .
And I do n’t think they are . ”
Until recently , organizers and activists mostly seemed content to ignore , or in some cases tolerate , extremists in their ranks , confident they ’d be drowned out by the hundreds of thousands of activists who took to congressional town halls and marches around the country to protest big-spending initiatives pushed by President Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress .
But inflammatory rhetoric such as former congressman Tom Tancredo ’s racially tinged speech at this month ’s tea party convention , reports of the involvement of right - wing militia groups and the continued propagation of conspiracy theories about Obama have sometimes cast the movement in an unfavorable light .
Erickson has advised new tea party organizers on how to avoid affiliations with extremists and this month banned birthers — conservatives who believe that Obama was not born in the United States and is , therefore , ineligible to be president — from his blog .
( He has long blacklisted truthers , those who believe that the U.S. government was complicit in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — a conspiracy theory with devotees across the political spectrum . )
“ At some point , you have to use the word ‘ crazy , ’ ” said Erickson .
Ryun ’s American Majority , a group that trains tea party activists and others around the country , has done much the same thing .
Its website has moved to close its sessions to activists who identify themselves with the birther , truther or militia movements or the John Birch Society .
Ryun conceded that extremists are involved in the tea party movement .
But he said , “ It ’s just such a small percentage , and it should not be portrayed as representative of the broader movement . ”
The fringe fighters ’ methods range from censuring signs at rallies or banishing unruly participants completely to challenging the media ’s focus on the fringe and highlighting the movement ’s diversity and tolerance .
They have gone out of their way , for example , to promote activists and movement - backed candidates of color , including tea party stars Marco Rubio and Allen West , running for U.S. Senate and House , respectively , in Florida , and Texas Senate candidate Michael Williams — all Republicans .
Ryan has another strategy .
He has commissioned a poll that he thinks will show that tea partiers share with independent voters a commitment to reducing taxation and government spending and prove that the tea party movement is “ very much mainstream . ”
But the tea party movement ’s decentralized structure , vaguely defined goals and anti-establishment tone make it an attractive place to channel angry feelings .
Mainstream media organizations such as The New York Times , which recently ran a 4,500 word story on the infiltration of the movement by a militia - linked group called Oath Keepers , have recently focused on these aspects of the movement .
Independent of their actual numbers , it ’s in both political parties ’ interests to inflate the influence of the other side ’s fringe , said Tom De Luca , a Fordham University political science professor who studies political movements and wrote the 2005 book “ Liars !
Cheaters !
Evildoers !
Demonization and the End of Civil Debate in American Politics . ”
“ That creates this dynamic that seems to exaggerate the influence of the extremes , ” De Luca said .
Much as conservatives have sought to link Democrats to environmental extremism or socialism , he said , it ’s an obvious countermove for the left to try to link Republicans with the more extreme elements that have gained traction around — and sometimes within — the tea partiers .
So it was that liberals have demanded to know where Republicans stood on Obama ’s citizenship , or that last week found left and right debating which side had more in common with Andrew Joseph Stack III , the software developer who crashed his plane into the IRS offices in Austin , Texas .
The left seized on a comment by hard - line conservative Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) , reportedly expressing his empathy for the pilot ’s anti-tax views .
Rush Limbaugh retorted that Stack “ sounds like he 's blaming Bush and Reagan , " asserting that he sounded “ almost word for word [ like ] Nancy Pelosi .
Almost word for word [ like ] Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama . ”
De Luca predicted that another “ Bill Buckley moment ” will occur only when the political damage done by extremists outweighs the boost the tea party movement has provided to conservatives generally and the Republican Party specifically .
“ My guess is their basic stance will be to try to juggle as long as they can , ” he said .
That approach — and its drawbacks — were on display at last week ’s Conservative Political Action Conference , the annual gathering of Washington ’s conservative establishment .
It featured the John Birch Society as a co-sponsor .
And while conference organizers nixed a panel on Obama ’s citizenship , a birther contingent still made its presence felt , as did the Oath Keepers , who co-sponsored the conference .
After filming a brief segment at the conference , liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow , a leading tea party antagonist , concluded on her show that “ the conservative movement right now is really not afraid to let its freak flag fly .
…
They ‘re happy to show off the ‘ we want another revolutionary war , ’ ‘we think the black president is arrogant , ’ ‘ we think the apocalypse is nice ’ side of themselves . ”
Liberal commentators similarly highlighted the extremism on display at this month ’s National Tea Party Convention in Nashville , Tenn. , which included a speech by WorldNetDaily Editor Joseph Farah questioning Obama ’s citizenship and one by Tancredo asserting Obama was elected because " we do not have a civics , literacy test before people can vote in this country . "
A blogger on the liberal site Daily Kos asserted Tancredo ’s speech revealed the “ REAL reason ” tea partiers are upset : “ A black man is President and their White Privelege [ sic ] is fading . ”
Tancredo ’s speech was not widely condemned by conservative intellectuals or media , but immediately after Farah delivered his , he was confronted in a hallway outside the convention hall by conservative media entrepreneur and fellow convention speaker Andrew Breitbart , who said it was a disservice to the tea party movement to infer its activists are “ all obsessed with the birth certificate , when it ’s not a winning issue . ”
Others cited the jeering of an anti-gay activist at CPAC who condemned organizers for inviting gay Republican group GOProud to participate .
Conservative author and TownHall columnist Ashley Herzog said it was proof that “ CPAC , and the conservative movement in general , is n’t a haven for haters after all , ” and urged the left to view a video of the incident , which she said is evidence of “ a lack of bigotry [ that ] must be painfully puzzling to liberals . ”
Conservatives similarly pushed back against a New York Times blog post that accused a CPAC speaker of ripping Obama “ in racial tones , " partly by affecting a " Chris Rock voice " to mock the president .
They noted that the speaker — like comedian Rock — is from Brooklyn and speaks with a regional accent , and demanded an apology .
And in a clever Web video that went viral this week , the Dallas Tea Party called out MSNBC host Keith Olbermann , who had mocked the mostly white makeup of the Nashville convention of what he called the " Tea Klux Klan , " comparing its racially diverse leadership to MSNBC ’s mostly white host lineup .
Judson Phillips , the Nashville tea party activist who organized this month ’s convention , said it ’s incumbent on local tea party leaders across the country “ to control the message and to prevent the tea party movement from being hijacked . ”
In the run-up to a July tea party convention he ’s planning in Las Vegas , Phillips said , he ’s planning to ask speakers “ to stick to our message , which is unity headed into the fall . ”

Click through for a selection of highlights from his new book …
The Big Squeeze : piece for an article on the oil gains to be made from Iraq
As a follow up to Guess Who ? , which largely contained portraits ( and was blogged about here ) , new book Negative Space looks at how Bar has tackled weightier subjects such as global warming , race relations and national identity .
It features many examples of editorial work for The New York Times , The Economist and The Guardian .

Bar has referred to his editorial work as a form of “ pain relief ” – a kind of buffer against the issues contained within a particular article – but his eking out of a discernable whole from a range of minimalist elements is certainly painstaking work in itself .
As Buzz Poole asserts in his introduction to this new collection , Bar ’s art is attuned with that of the writer ’s .
It ’s one of showing , not telling .

North Korea , which has no diplomatic relations with Washington , informed the United States through its mission to the United Nations in New York .
The United States has asked Sweden , which handles US interests in Pyongyang , to look into the case , Mr Crowley said .
A local GP has left the Prime Minister a little red-faced by suggesting he take a leaf out of Cuba 's book when formulating the Federal Government 's public health overhaul .
Kevin Rudd visited Queanbeyan Hospital in New South Wales on Monday to announce that the Government will spend an extra $ 632 million over the next 10 years to train a record number of doctors .
But the so - called picture opportunity did n't quite go to plan , with Dr Jeannie Ellis , the GP in charge of the hospital 's emergency department , telling Mr Rudd to look to Cuba for a solution to Australia 's ailing health system .
" Maybe Australia should take a leaf out of the Cuban healthcare system 's book where they have something like $ 20,000 less per capita and they have exactly the same healthcare indicators as Australia , " she said .
" I 've lived in Cuba for a long time and I can tell you that they run a very , very good healthcare system and they get a lot of bang for their buck over there . "
Mr Rudd says the extra funding announced today will mean the doubling of GP training positions available for medical graduates from 600 to 1,200 places a year by 2014 .
The number of specialist training places will also go up from 360 to 900 positions .
And there will be a doubling of GP work experience places for junior doctors up to 975 places a year by 2013 .
The Prime Minister says the policy will target rural areas experiencing doctor shortages .
" This pattern across rural and regional Australia has not been getting better .
It 's probably been getting worse , " he said .
" So what can you do about it ?
The first thing is to make sure your overall supply of trained GPs increases .
This is a very big step forward .
We 're talking about 5,500 GPs .
" The second is that the distribution of both those GP training places and the distribution of the specialist training places will be very mindful of the needs of regional and rural Australia . "
Mr Rudd says the plan will be fully off - set and the details associated with the funding will be outlined in the May budget .
Not enough
Dr Ellis says she welcomes the extra numbers announced by the Government but says it is not enough to fix the problem .
" You ca n't just put a whole bunch of new medical graduates out into rural areas and expect that you 're going to have the same level of health care provided , " she said .
" You need supervision .
You need to maintain standards .
So you need senior clinicians . "
The Rural Doctors Association of Australia agrees , but the association 's president , Dr Nola Maxfield , says the Government needs to pay bonuses to encourage doctors to regional areas otherwise , she says , the shortages will continue .
" We want to be able to show young doctors when they come out and they think about where they 're going to work , what they 're going to do in the longer term , that we are actually price competitive with other parts of the medical profession , " Dr Maxfield said .
" Otherwise they may well choose to be emergency medicine specialists in the city and we wo n't get our rural GPs . "
Dr Andrew Pesce , the president of the Australian Medical Association , says the states need to make sure they fulfil their part of the bargain .
" We now need the states and territories to come on board and make sure the funded positions are used for the purposes that is intended , and that is to make sure that we do train enough doctors in the future , " Dr Pesce said .
" In the past , funding has n't been translated to adequate training positions and now the states and territories have to come on board and make sure the junior [ doctors ] have access to this training . "
' Bullying game '
The new doctor numbers are part of the Government 's carrot to tempt the states and territories into supporting its hospital overhaul ahead of next month 's special leaders ' meeting to discuss it .
Some premiers have deep reservations about the plan , with state and territory leaders scheduled to have a phone hook - up later this week .
Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott , who was the health minister for four years in the Howard government , says he is sceptical of Mr Rudd 's plans .
" What we 've seen from this Prime Minister over the last few weeks , in particular , is ending the blame game to be sure .
It 's been replaced by the bullying game , " Mr Abbott said .
" Anyone who has been watching the footage of the Prime Minister and the state premiers would know that cooperation between them has all but broken down .

Enlarge By Bill Ingalls , AFP / Getty Images NASA Administrator Charles Bolden speaks during a luncheon co-hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Women In Aerospace on Dec. 9 at the Ritz - Carlton in Arlington , Va. WASHINGTON  President Obama will chart a course for NASA within weeks , based on the advice of a handful of key advisers in the administration and Congress .
Obama , who met Dec. 16 with NASA Administrator Charles Bolden , has n't said when or how he 'll announce his new policy .
The announcement likely will come by the time the president releases his fiscal 2011 budget in early February , because he must decide how much money the space agency should get .
In determining NASA 's future policy , Obama must decide whether to increase the agency 's budget to pay for goals such as sending astronauts to the moon or Mars in missions that could be decades away .
" The next authorization will really set the path of NASA for the next 10 to 20 years , " said Rep. Bart Gordon , D - Tenn. , chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee , which oversees space policy and research .
In an October report , the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Committee said NASA 's current funding puts it on an " unsustainable trajectory " to undertake ambitious missions .
It urged Obama to increase the agency 's budget by $ 3 billion a year — above the nearly $ 19 billion per year it receives now — to finance circumnavigating the moon and Mars , landing on one of Mars ' moons , and landing on or docking with an asteroid during the next 15 years .
The question is whether Obama will embrace one of those options or any of the others the committee suggested .
Besides top NASA officials and members of Gordon 's committee , other key figures offering Obama advice will be Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , and John Holdren , director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy .
Nelson , who flew aboard the shuttle in 1986 , is perhaps NASA 's most vocal supporter in Congress .
He acknowledged that only the president can inspire the nation to support the space program and find the money that the " severely underfunded " agency needs .
" He 's going to have to put the juice to the program , " Nelson said at a Sept. 16 hearing on the spaceflight committee 's report .
At his confirmation hearing in February , Holdren said research and development related to space exploration is crucial to national defense , civilian and military communications , weather forecasting and the study of the land and oceans .
At his initial meeting with Bolden , Obama described his passion for NASA by recalling that his grandfather took him to Pearl Harbor to wave at Apollo astronauts aboard an aircraft carrier that had picked them up after splashdown .
During the past six months , Obama has hosted a White House stargazing party for students , a teleconference with the International Space Station and two shuttle crews in the Oval Office .
He also has telephoned the shuttle and met with the crew of Apollo 11 .

Relief workers in Haiti received an emergency text message Tuesday about a collapsed school , with children still alive in the rubble .
A search - and - rescue team on the scene , however , could n't find the right location .
- Join Reddit ’s Haiti relief fundraising drive with Direct Relief International .
Contribute to Haiti Rewired , a community for discussing tech , infrastructure , and the future of Haiti .
Then a group of volunteers in Boston pinpointed the origin of the message , sent using the 4636 SMS shortcode .
They rapidly relayed the information back to Eric Rasmussen , a former top naval medical officer working with rescue teams in Haiti .
A team was then dispatched to the correct grid location .
The coordinates were accurate to five decimal places .
That small vignette , provided in e-mail update from Rassmussen , shows how volunteers are using social networking tools to aid relief efforts in Haiti .
It 's not a fix - all , but it does suggest that something new and unprecedented is happening in humanitarian response .
One of the biggest challenges is getting SMS messages translated rapidly from French and Creole , and relayed to international rescuers .
Rob Munro , a graduate fellow at Stanford who works with the nonprofit Energy for Opportunity , was pulled into the effort :
He specializes in computer - aided methods for managing and processing medical SMS messages in multiple languages .
He has been coordinating volunteers around the world who are translating the messages sent to 4636 , categorizing the messages , and – where possible – plotting the exact coordinates .
" The average turnaround for us receiving a message and having a geo- coordinated and translated report to teams on the ground is about 10 minutes , " he told Danger Room by e-mail .
" The total number of texts is in the thousands , and they arrive every five seconds in busy times , to every 10 minutes overnight . "
Some of the messages are urgent pleas for help .
Others are requests to relay simple messages to loved ones .
Rescuers shared a few examples of translated messages .
[ They asked that we redact all numbers and family names to protect privacy , and to prevent the relatives of victims from being deluged with calls . ]
" Please tell Mrs Maxime ____ of Boston that by the grace of God that everyone is okay .
Her number is ____ .
It is Lubin ____ that sent the message . )
" Someone please I have a brother in France can someone call and tell him that I am not dead only my house got destroyed the number is ___ "
" My name is Jean ____ my brother is working in Unicef and I live in C__ 11 A___ I have 2 people that is still alive under the building still !
Send Help ! "
Organizations are sharing information in other ways .
The Sahana Software Foundation has set up a Haiti 2010 disaster - relief portal that serves as a repository for over 500 organizations now on the ground in Haiti .
It lists contact information , as well as activities by geographic area and sector .
In an e-mail , Sahana President and CEO Mark Prutsalis told Danger Room the foundation 's request - management system was being fed by two streams : one through text messages sent to 4636 and processed by Ushahidi , and the other through Twitter ( they call it , " tweak the tweet " ) .
Requests are categorized and searchable by aid agencies .
" Registered users can make pledges to fulfill requests and mark them as completed or alter their status , " Prutsalis said .
" We are working on developing reporting and tracking and ticketing capabilities for this , as well as the ability to process and handle requests that come in by e-mail or those that are manually entered by aid agencies into the system . "
Sahana also has a mapping system , which provides an annotated map of what is going on the ground .
Base layers include imagery drawn from OpenStreetMaps , Digital Globe high - resolution imagery , Ikonos satellite imagery and Google Maps .
Sahana adds info from its registry and locations database , Ushahidi events , 4636 SMS messages and other information .
They can also provide feeds in a variety of formats , so organizations can effectively use the data being collected on the scene and remotely .
Obviously , this is all still a work in progress , and it remains to be seen if it can be sustained over the long term .
The Ushahidi situation room is already looking to train volunteers .

Schwarzliberale Zensur Florian Rötzer
Fastenprediger vom Nockherberg tritt zurück , das Bayerische Fernsehen beugt sich der Staatsgewalt
Nicht - Bayern sind die Fastenpredigt vom Bruder Barnabas und das anschließende Singspiel auf dem Nockherberg zum Starkbieranstich – der fünften Jahreszeit - vielleicht gar nicht bekannt .
Gepflegt wird hier das Politiker - Derblecken , schließlich hatten die Bayern unter der langen CSU - Dominanz ansonsten wenig zu lachen .
Aber das geht nicht immer gut .
2007 durfte Django Asül einmal auftreten , aber der türkische Staatsbürger mit dem niederbayerischen Dialekt war wohl zu frech und wurde schnell abserviert .
Der Nachfolger Michael Lerchenberg trat nun nach dem dritten Mal zurück .
Scharf ging er mit den Politikern zu Gericht .
Das bekam nicht , führte zu scharfer Kritik und nicht nur zum Rücktritt von Lerchenberg , sondern auch zur Zensur im Bayerischen Fernsehen bei der Wiederholungssendung am gestrigen Abend – und das ist wohl auch ein Ausdruck der Stimmung in diesem Land .
Symptomatisch auch , dass weiterhin suggeriert wurde , es handle sich um einen Live - Mitschnitt , aber nicht mitgeteilt wurde , dass die Zensurschere am Werke war .
Anlass war vor allem der Angriff auf den FDP - Parteichef und Außenminister Westerwelle , der mit seiner Polemik gegen Hartz - IV - Empfänger , die in " anstrengungslosem Wohlstand " leben sollen , was Ausdruck einer " spätrömischen Dekadenz " sein soll , ganz gezielt durch Diffamierung für Aufmerksamkeit gesorgt hat .
Bruder Barnabas kommentierte :
Nachdem sich aber " Leistung wieder lohnen muss " , sinkt also die FDP von 15 auf 11 , 9 , 8 , 6 Prozent .
Und wenn die Umfragewerte so schnell weitersinken , wird die FDP die erste Partei , die regiert , obwohl sie unter 5 Prozent ist .
Zehn Jahre will er regieren , der Herr Westerwelle , derweil g'langt 's so net amal für 365 Tag .
Und darum dreht er jetzt völlig durch , der Herr Guido , und schwingt seine sozialpolitische Abrissbirne .
Soviel blieb erhalten , das Folgende wurde nun vom Bayerischen Fernsehen zensiert ( allerdings nicht online , das scheint in Lederhosen - mit - Laptop - Bayern - noch - nicht so wichtig zu sein ) :
Alle Hartz IV - Empfänger sammelt er in den leeren , verblühten Landschaften zwischen Usedom und dem Riesengebirge , drumrum ein großer Zaun .
Zweimal am Tag gibt's a Wassersuppn und einen Kanten Brot .
Statt Heizkostenzuschuss gibt's zwei Pullover von Sarrazins Winterhilfswerk , und überm schmiedeeisernen Ausgang , bewacht von jungliberalen Ichlingen im Gelbhemd steht : " Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen . "
Manuskript
Lerchenberg hatte den im Manuskript stehenden
Text allerdings bei seiner Rede noch einmal verstärkt :
Alle ' Hartz IV '- Empfänger sammelt er in den leeren , verblühten Landschaften zwischen Usedom und dem Riesengebirge , drumrum ein Stacheldraht - haben wir schon mal gehabt .
Zweimal am Tag gibt's a Wassersuppn und einen Kanten Brot .
Statt Heizkostenzuschuss gibt's zwei Pullover von Sarrazins Winterhilfswerk , und überm Eingang , bewacht von jungliberalen Ichlingen im Gelbhemd , steht in eisernen Lettern : Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen .
Das war zunächst der Vorsitzenden des Zentralrats der Juden in Deutschland , Charlotte Knobloch , zu viel : " Scherze , die das Leid der Opfer in den Konzentrationslagern verharmlosen oder gar der Lächerlichkeit preisgeben , sind eine Schande . "
Auch indirekte Anspielungen auf die NS - Zeit sollen weiterhin tabu sein , auch wenn es nicht um die Vernichtungslager ging , sondern um die Perversion der Nazis , dass Arbeit auch in Gefangenschaft frei machen soll .
So weit sind manche Vorstellungen , Arbeitslose zum Arbeiten – in einer Art Arbeitsdienst – zu zwingen , davon freilich nicht .
Westerwelle , der ansonsten gerne mal die eigene " Zuspitzung " ganz legitim findet und meinst , man müsse dieses und jenes doch einfach sagen können , entrüstete sich und schrieb einen Brief an den Paulanerchef vom Nockherberg , dass er keine Einladung mehr bekommen wolle : " Mit einem KZ - Wächter verglichen zu werden , geht zu weit . "
Offenbar gab es immensen Druck , Lerchenberg , der gerne mal spontan vom Manuskript abweicht , teilte mit , dass er – und sein Koautor Christian Springer , bekannt als " Fonsi " - zwar " aus der Bevölkerung für die Fastenpredigt 2010 unzählige zustimmende Reaktionen erhalten " habe , aber der " politische und öffentliche Druck auf uns und die Paulaner - Brauerei so groß geworden " sei , dass er lieber geht .
" Mein ' Bruder Barnabas ' hat mit seiner Form der politischen , auch zu Teilen ernsten und durchaus manchmal provokanten Fastenpredigt sicherlich Maßstäbe gesetzt .
Nichts und niemanden hat er geschont " , sagte Lerchenberg und machte damit deutlich , dass er weiterhin zu seiner satirischen Kritik steht .
Die Anspielung auf die Konzentrationslager und die Arbeitsideologie der Nazis war aber nur der Aufhänger , zumindest für das Bayerische Fernsehen , um schnell noch weiter weitere Passagen zu zensieren , die der bayerischen Landesregierung nicht genehm gewesen sein dürften .
Da ducken sich das öffentlich - rechtliche Fernsehen und der Paulanerchef wie schon bei Asül schnell weg , um es sich mit CSU und FDP nicht zu verscherzen .
Das weist auf mangelnde Zivilcourage hin oder auf die schwarz - gelbe Vorstellung von Meinungsfreiheit .
Weil man schon dabei war , kürzte man im BR auch gleich noch klammheimlich folgende Passage :
Ach , Herr Herrmann !
In ihrem Büro müssen sich ja die Dankbarkeitsbriefe der Waffenindustrie , vom Sportschützen - und Jagdverband nur grad so stapeln .
" Ausführungsbestimmungen " zum neuen Waffengesetz hat er erlassen , der königl .
privilegierte Schützenbruder Herrmann .
Aber was für oa !
Da wenn amal wieder einer Ihrer Schützenfreunde seine Pistolen unter 'm Kopfkissen rauszieht , und im Blutrausch über andere herfallt , dann ham Sie mit Ihren " Ausführungsbestimmungen " den Straftatbestand der Beihilfe mühelos erfüllt .
Inzwischen weiß man auch : Ihr Lieblingsbuch ist " Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit " .
Und die bayerische Polizei hält sich daran .
Wenn ein Verrückter über ein Ansbacher Innenstadt Gymnasium herfällt , da braucht die Polizei elf langsame Minuten !
Ein Freiwilliger Feuerwehrler hat inzwischen vor Ort gehandelt .
Aber wenn in Regensburg zwei überforderte Polizisten zwölf Mal auf einen Geisteskranken schießen , davon vier Schuss wie einst beim Jennerwein von Hinten , dann wird gaaanz langsam ermittelt – wenn überhaupt !
Dafür häufen sich die unrühmlichen Prügelauftritte des Amnesty International bekannten Münchner USK .
USK heißt : das " Unidentifizierbare Schläger Korps " , dessen Wirken dann von Staatsanwalt und willfährigen Richtern alimentiert wird .
Da kann man nur sagen : Bayerns Bürger , wenn ihr wollt , dass Euch schnell , zuverlässig und effizient geholfen wird , dann ruft 's besser glei die Feuerwehr !
Prost Gemeinde !
" Humor ist , wenn man trotzdem trinkt ! "
Wenn wir grad schon bei der Verbrechensbekämpfung sind : Grüß Gott , Herr Mappus , Sie sind ja jetzt der Ersatz - Öttinger von Baden - Württemberg .
Ganz neu im Amt , und schon glei in die Hosen gmacht , weil es ja jetzt eine neue Steuer - CD zu kaufen GÄBE .
Gekürzte Passage
( Florian Rötzer )
As further proof that a trade of Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb has become inevitable , the Associated Press reports that the team will consider only an offer than includes a pick among the top 42 in the 2010 draft .
It ’s unclear why or how 42 became the cutoff point , especially since the 42nd selection , held by the Buccaneers , falls 10 picks into round two .
Under the official draft order , the Bills own the 41st pick , the Raiders have the 39th selection , the Browns hold the 38th pick , and the Redskins possess the 37th pick .
( We ’d be shocked if the Eagles would be willing to trade McNabb within the division , and there ’s no indication that the Redskins would want him .
But , you know , Jason Campbell and Rex Grossman . )
It previously was believed that the Eagles wanted at least a first - round pick , possibly more .
But with no one offering a first - round pick three weeks into the 2010 league year , the Eagles have had to relax their expectations .
Now that the cat is fully out of the bag , the Eagles might have to relax their expectations even further .

Does
God or some other type of transcendent entity answer prayer ?
The answer , according to a new Arizona State University study published in the March journal Research on Social Work Practice , is " yes . " David R. Hodge , an assistant professor of social work in the College of Human Services at Arizona State University , conducted a comprehensive analysis of 17 major studies on the effects of intercessory prayer -- or prayer that is offered for the benefit of another person -- among people with psychological or medical problems .
He found a positive effect .
" There have been a number of studies on intercessory prayer , or prayer offered for the benefit of another person , " said Hodge , a leading expert on spirituality and religion .
" Some have found positive results for prayer .
Others have found no effect .
Conducting a meta - analysis takes into account the entire body of empirical research on intercessory prayer .
Using this procedure , we find that prayer offered on behalf of another yields positive results . "
Hodge 's work is featured in the March , 2007 , issue of Research on Social Work Practice , a disciplinary journal devoted to the publication of empirical research on practice outcomes .
Hodge noted that his study is important because it is a compilation of available studies and is not a single work with a single conclusion .
His " Systematic Review " takes into account the findings of 17 studies that used intercessory prayer as a treatment in practice settings .
" Some people feel Benson and associates ' study from last year , which is the most recent and showed no positive effects for intercessory prayer , is the final word , " said Hodge , referring to a 2006 article by Dr. Herbert Benson of the Harvard Medical School that measured the therapeutic effect of intercessory prayer in cardiac bypass patients .
" But , this research suggests otherwise .
This study enables us to look at the big picture .
When the effects of prayer are averaged across all 17 studies , controlling for differences in sample sizes , a net positive effect for the prayer group is produced .
" This is the most thorough and all - inclusive study of its kind on this controversial subject that I am aware of , " said Hodge .
" It suggests that more research on the topic may be warranted , and that praying for people with psychological or medical problems may help them recover . "
The use of prayer as a therapeutic intervention is controversial .
Yet , Hodge notes that survey research indicates that many people use intercessory prayer as an intervention to aid healing , which raises questions about its effectiveness as an intervention strategy .
" Overall , the meta - analysis indicates that prayer is effective .
Is it effective enough to meet the standards of the American Psychological Association 's Division 12 for empirically validated interventions ?
No .
Thus , we should not be treating clients suffering with depression , for example , only with prayer .
To treat depression , standard treatments , such as cognitive therapy , should be used as the primary method of treatment . "
Morality is modified in the lab
How complex is our sense of morality ?
Scientists have shown they can change people 's moral judgements by disrupting a specific area of the brain with magnetic pulses .
They identified a region of the brain just above and behind the right ear which appears to control morality .
And by using magnetic pulses to block cell activity they impaired volunteers ' notion of right and wrong .
The small Massachusetts Institute of Technology study appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
To be able to apply a magnetic field to a specific brain region and change people 's moral judgments is really astonishing
Dr Liane Young
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lead researcher Dr Liane Young said : " You think of morality as being a really high - level behaviour .
" To be able to apply a magnetic field to a specific brain region and change people 's moral judgments is really astonishing . "
The key area of the brain is a knot of nerve cells known as the right temporo - parietal junction ( RTPJ ) .
The researchers subjected 20 volunteers to a number of tests designed to assess their notions of right and wrong .
In one scenario participants were asked how acceptable it was for a man to let his girlfriend walk across a bridge he knew to be unsafe .
After receiving a 500 millisecond magnetic pulse to the scalp , the volunteers delivered verdicts based on outcome rather than moral principle .
If the girlfriend made it across the bridge safely , her boyfriend was not seen as having done anything wrong .
In effect , they were unable to make moral judgments that require an understanding of other people 's intentions .
Previous work has shown the RTPJ to be highly active when people think about the thoughts and beliefs of others .
Electric currents
The MIT team pinpointed the region in volunteers using a sophisticated functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain scan .
They then targeted the area using a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) to create weak electric currents that temporarily stop brain cells working normally .
In one test , volunteers were exposed to TMS for 25 minutes before reading stories involving morally questionable characters , and being asked to judge their actions .
In a second experiment , volunteers were subjected to a much shorter 500 millisecond TMS burst while being asked to make a moral judgement .
In both cases , the researchers found that when the RTPJ was disrupted volunteers were more likely to judge actions solely on the basis of whether they caused harm - not whether they were morally wrong in themselves .
Morally dubious acts with a " happy " ending were often deemed acceptable .
Sarah - Jayne Blakemore , a brain expert at University College London , said the findings were insightful .
" The study suggests that this region - the RTPJ - is necessary for moral reasoning .
" What is interesting is that this is a region that is very late developing - into adolescence and beyond right into the 20s .
" The next step would be to look at how or whether moral development changes through childhood into adulthood . "

11 NJ schools in 7 counties have had COVID outbreaks
New Jersey on Wednesday unveiled a new reporting dashboard for COVID - 19 in schools , but the data is high - level and reports outbreaks by county .
It might be pleasant for writers and publishers to suppose that First Amendment principles of freedom of speech and freedom of the press are absolute and will prevail in every circumstance .
But that is clearly not the case .
For one thing , the Supreme Court has specifically excluded obscenity , child pornography , and certain other forms of communication from First Amendment protections .
( See “ Freedom of Speech and Press : Exceptions to the First Amendment ” ( pdf ) , Congressional Research Service , updated October 16 , 2009 . )
Moreover , courts have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of prohibitions in the Espionage Act against the unauthorized disclosure of certain types of classified information ( most recently in a 2006 ruling [ pdf ] in the AIPAC case , USA v. Rosen and Weissman ) .
The intersection of national security law and ordinary newsgathering remains a bit murky , and is contested in some quarters even where it is fairly clear .
Although “ the right of the press to publish confidential information is well established , [ t ] here is … a paucity of constitutional doctrine protecting newsgathering activities that seek the leaking of confidential information , ” according to a recent law review article .
“ Ethics codes for news organizations state that reporters must not commit crimes such as trespassing or stealing information but are silent on inchoate crimes such as solicitation , ” wrote Prof. William E. Lee of the University of Georgia last year .
“ And while news organizations have elaborate rules about relations with confidential sources , they do not address the propriety of promising confidentiality as an inducement to the disclosure of classified information . ”
“ Although there are practical and political difficulties in prosecuting reporters for solicitation or conspiracy , there is little First Amendment precedent in support of the argument that reporters should be exempt from generally applicable criminal laws . ”
See “ Probing Secrets : The Press and Inchoate Liability for Newsgathering Crimes ” by William E. Lee , American Journal of Criminal Law , vol. 36 , no .
2 , Spring 2009 .
The longstanding conflict over press publication of national security information is revisited in the forthcoming book “ Necessary Secrets ” by Gabriel Schoenfeld ( Norton Books , May 2010 ) .
It 's 27 days to the election and persistent Bush critic Lou Dobbs has a new book out detailing what he sees as the " War on the Middle Class . "
While Dobbs faults both the GOP and Democrats for policies he disagrees with , the lion 's share of his criticism has fallen to President Bush and the Republicans , particularly for tax cuts and free trade policies .
So perhaps it's no surprise that CNN is ramping up Dobb 's TV time .
Not only will the business reporter / commentator have a role in election night coverage , but :
Associated Press television writer David Bauder noted in an October 10 article that anchor “ Dobbs ’ weeknight news show will expand to seven days a week , with the two weekend editions presenting highlights of the week ’s reporting beginning Oct. 28 . ” “ Dobbs is also anchoring three pre-election special reports : ‘ War on the Middle Class ’ on Oct. 18 , ‘ Broken Borders ’ on Oct. 25 and ‘ Democracy at Risk : E-voting 's Threat ’ on Oct. 29 , ” Bauder noted .
But viewers do n’t have to wait that long for even more Lou .
With an October 10 appearance on “ Larry King Live ” and an interview the next day on “ American Morning , ” the business reporter has already begun peddling his just - published “ War on the Middle Class . ”
While King is famous for his decidedly non-hardball approach to interviewing , Dobbs received a similarly soft reception on the October 11 “ American Morning . ”
Anchor Soledad O’Brien began by urging Dobbs to give viewers some election advice .
“ Is there one direction you think politically the middle class is leaning or should be leaning , ” O’Brien wondered .
Dobbs insisted he is frustrated with both Democrats and Republicans before slamming the Bush tax cuts “ since 2001 , have all benefited , disproportionately , the wealthy in this country . ”
“ Not exactly a surprise there , ” O’Brien quipped before asking Dobbs for “ ways in which the middle class has been underserved or poorly served by Republicans . ”

EL CAPITALISMO QUIERE CERRAR Y PROHIBIR LA DESCARGA DE MUSICA Y PELICULAS PARA QUE CONSUMAMOS SU BASURA .
QUIEN SE AGUANTE ES RESPONSABLE DE LA TOMADURA DE PELO A LA HUMANIDAD POR EL
MIRAD LO QUE HACE EL CAPITALISMO CON SU DESMESURADO AFAN UN ESCAPE DE PETROLEO EN EL FONDO DEL MAR , TENEMOS LA SENSACION QUE NO SE PODRA CORREGIR TAMAÑO DESAFUERO , PRONTO SE VERAN GRAN PARTE DE LOS OCEANOS DE NUESTRA MADRE TIERRA , LLENA DE CADAVERES DE PECES , Y DE HUMANOS QUE IRAN A PROBAR TONTERIAS , Y A OTROS QUE COMERAN ALGUN PEZ QUE QUEDE LLENO DE METALES TOXICOS , TODO ESE CARBURO QUITARA EL OXIGENO AL AGUA Y AUMENTARA AUN MAS EL EFECTO INVERNADERO , Y QUITARA ESE MARAVILLOSO COLOR AZUL ESPIRITUAL A NUESTRA QUERIDA MADRE .
LA INICIATIAVA PRIVADA COMO NOS QUIEREN HACER CREER NO CREA RIQUEZA DE NINGUNA MANERA POR EL CONTRARIO LO QUE HACE ES LLENARSE LOS BOLSILLOS ESPECULANDO .
CUANDO HAN HECHO LAS FECHORIAS Y TIENEN QUE PONER MAS DINERO , LE PIDEN AL PAPA ESTADO QUE SOMOS TODOS PARA QUE PAGEMOS SUS ERRORES , PERO CUANDO LOS ASALARIADOS SE LO PIDEN LES LLAMAN COMUNISTAS .
POR ESO OS DIGO QUIN VOTE CAPITALISMO , NEOLIBERALISMO ETC , ETC COMO SE HA DICHO CAERAN LAS PIEDRAS SOBRE SU CABEZA .
Y DEBEN DE SALIR DE LA UNION CADA UNO A SU SITIO Y TODO IRA MEJOR , SOLO DESDE UN PENSAMIENTO HOMOGENEO SE PUEDE IR MEJOR , PERO COMO EN LA UNION HAY PAISES HETEROGENOS , SIEMPRE IREMOS A RASTRAS DE LOS QUE MAS TIENEN .
CAPITALISMO Y LAS GUERRAS PARA EXPOLIAR A OTROS PAISES
RIQUEZAS ETC
EL CAPITALISMO ES ILOGICO E INCOMPATIBLE CON LA DEMOCRACIA SOLO SABE DE GUERRAS Y DE ESPECULACIONES ASESINATOS ETC .
PODIAMOS A QUI PONER PAGINAS ENTERAS , NO HAY QUE HACERLE CASO.EL PARTIDO POPULAR POR EJEMPLO DE CESPAÑA HA SALIDO ESTOS DIAS DICIENDO QUE EL MEJOR SINDICALISTA ES EL QUE NO EXISTE , YA SOBRAN LAS PALABRAS PARA DESCRIBIR A ESTA FORMACION , NO YA PARTIDO POLITICO PUES EN SUS GENES NO ACATAN NI COMPRENDEN LA DEMOCRACIA . ,
RECORDEMOS LO QUE DIJOEL IRRESPONSABLE DE AZNAR  CUANDO GOBERNABA QUE A LOS SINDICATOS HAY QUE TENERLOS CALLADOS POR VARIOS SIGLOS 
EL CAPITALISMO VA DE CRISIS EN CRISIS Y NI SQUIERA SABEN POR QUE ES , PERO SI SABEN LLENARSE Y VACIAR A LOS MAS DEBILES , TANTA TINTA CON LA SANIDAD POR EJEMPLO ENTONCES PORQUE VDE VEZ EN CUANDO SALE UNA LEY PARA REBAJARLE A LOS EMPRESARIOS LA CUOTA QUE DEBEB APORTAR A LA SEGURIDAD SOCIAL , QUIEN LOS VOTE QUE CAIGA SOBRE SU CONCIENCIA .
NECESITARIAMOS UN DISCO DE 500 GIGAS PARA HABLAR DE TODO ESTO , PERO YA SE PUEDEN IMAGINAR TODO Y QUE LA UNICA ALTERNATIVA ES UN COMUNISMO  BIEN ESTRUCTURADO  ALGUNOS COCEPTOS Y NORMAS ESTAN BIEN DEL COMUNISMO PASADO PERO OTRAS HAY QUE RECTIFICARLAS .
Y PARA LLEGAR A ESE COMUNISMO , NOSOTROS TENEMOS ESTRUCTURADO ALGUNAS REGLAS PERO NO QUEREMOS DAR RECETAS Y POR AQUÍ TAMPOCO COJEN , PARA LLEGAR A ESE COMUNISMO BIEN ESTRUCTURADO , SOLO SE PUEDE HACER CURTIENDOSE EN UN ESTADO UNITARIO DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS  REPUBLICA SI O REPUBLICA NO , PERO LO PRIMERO ES LOI PRIEMEO CURTIRSE EN IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS  LO MISMO QUE NO PUEDE EXISTIR DEMOCRACIA SIN VARIOS PARTIDOS DEMOCRATICOS , LO MISMO NO PUEDE EXISTIR REPUBLICA SIN ANTES NO HABERSE CURTIDO EN UN PAIS UNITARIO DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS  CLARO SI NO SE QUIERE UNA REVOLUCION DE YA Y POR CONSIGUIENTE VIOLLENTA

SE ACUSA AL CAPITALISMO DE PRESIONAR A LOS GOBIERNOS Y A LOS ESTADOS DE SU AREA O A ESTOS DE HACERLE CASO DE QUE CENSUREN , CLAUSIREN Y PENALIUCEN ETC LAS DESCARGAS DE MUSICA ETC , CLAUSURAR Y PENALIZAR LAS WEB Y LAS REDES P2P .

WPx Y VEAN UN POLO LA FILOSOFIA DEL NUEVO COMUNISMO
EL CAPITALISMO QUIERE CERRAR Y PROHIBIR LA DESCARGA DE MUSICA Y PELICULAS PARA QUE CONSUMAMOS SU BASURA .
QUIEN SE AGUANTE ES RESPONSABLE DE LA TOMADURA DE PELO A LA HUMANIDAD POR EL CAPITALISMO , Y LAS GUERRAR PARA EXPOLIAR A OTROS PAISES DE SU RIQUEZAS ETC
EL CAPITALISMO ES ILOGICO E INCOMPATIBLE CON LA DEMOCRACIA SOLO SABE DE GUERRAS Y DE ESPECULACIONES ASESINATOS ETC .
PODIAMOS A QUI PONER PAGINAS ENTERAS , NO HAY QUE HACERLE CASO .
CONTRA LA CRISIS 30 HORAS SEMANALES SIN COBRAR MENOS PARA QUE HAYA TRABAJO PARA LOS JOVENES .
SUBIDA DE LAS PENSIONES Y DE LOS SUELDOS DE UN 50 % PARA COBATIR EL IPC SUBRREALISTA Y EL DESFASE DE MONEDA .
5 DIAS LABORABLES PARA QUE HAYA TRABAJO PARA LOS JOVENES .
NO EMIGRANTES .
2 MESES DE VACACIONES PARA QUE HAYA TRABAJO PARA OTROS .
PROHIBICION DE HACER HORAS EXTRAORDINARIAS Y CASTIGAR A CUALQUIER EMPRESARIO QUE LAS CONCEDA ETC , ETC ASI SE TERMINARA CON LA CRISIS .
NO FIAROS DEL CAPITALISMO , MIRAD LA CRISIS QUE HA ORIGINADO EN GRECIA EL ANTERIOR GOBIERNO CONSERVADOR ( AUNQUE ESTE SOCIALDEMOCRATA NO ES MUY DISTINTO COMO YA HEMOS DICHO ) EN ESPAÑA LA CRISIS QUE ORIGINO EL PARTIDO POPULAR CON LA VIVIENDA , ETC , ETC .
LOS NEOLIBERALES SON IGUAL COMO DECIMOS QUE LOS FASCISTAS QUE LOS SOCIALDEMOCRATAS .
SON TONTOS CON LA VIVIENDA LO UNICO QUE PUEDEN HACER ES ESPECULAR PUES NO SE PUEDE VENDER MAS VIVIENDAS QUE LOS HABITANTES QUE HAY EN UN PAIS , SEGURAMENTE UN 2 O 3 % MAS PARA LOS TURISTA EN LA COSTA Y DEMAS PERO CON ESO NO SE COMPITE CON OTROS PAISES , NI SE PRODUCE SOLO SE ESPECULA ..
NO NOS CANSAMOS DE DECIR QUE EL BIPARTIDISMO ES MALO VOTEMOS PARTIDOS DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS
COMO LA VIDA MISMA .
¿ ACASO LA VIDA NO ES UNA REVOLUCION .
DERECHA=IZQUIERDA
ACTUALES POR LO TANTO NI UNA NI OTRA BUSQUEMOS OTROS PARTIDOS CREEEMOSLOS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SALUD AMIGOS , COMO SE DIJO TIEMPO HA QUE AZNAR DEBE DE SER PROCESADO Y CONDENADO , EL PARTIDO POPULAR ES ANTIDEMOCRATICO Y VIOLENTO , SE DIJO QUE YO DABA TESTIMONIO POR RAZONES PERSONALES , AHORA SE ESTA VIENDO CON LA CORRUPCION , CUANDO NO CON LA ESPECULACION DE LA VIVIENDA Y TANTAS FECHORIAS .SI NO HEMOS LEIDO OU OIDO MAL LA CORRUPCION EMPEZO CON AZNAR Y SIENDO MINISTRO 1 ª RAJOY Y ESTANDO ZAMPLAANA , TRILLO , ACEVES , RODRIGO RATO FRAGA ETC , ETC
POR LO QUE LOS QUE ESTA AHORA EN ACTIVO DE LA POLITICA DEBEN DE DIMITIR Y HAY MAS MOTIVOS PARA PROCESAR AL GRAN GUILIPOLLAS .
SON BASURA , SSON MISERABLES , SON INEPTOS PARA CUALQUIER COSA CUANDO MAS PARA GOBERNAR UN PAIS , POBRE PAIS , RAJOY APOYA A CAMPS , BARCENAS , DEFIENDE AL BIGOTES , LA COSPEDAL ACUSA A LA POLICIA RICARDO COSTA ACUSA A RAJO , CORREA APOYA A AGUIRRE , ESTE APOYA O DISCULPA O APOYA AL OTRO , ETC , COMO SE DIJO ESTO ES UNA TOMADURA DE PELO A LOS CIUDADANOS Y ATENTA CONTRA LA INTELIGENCIA , LA LOGICA Y LA RAZON , LOS MAXIMOS RESPONSABLES DEL PARTIDO DEBEN DE DIMITIR Y SER PROCESADOS Y QUE SE DISUELVA EL PARTIDO LADRON COMO TAMBIEN SE DIJO , ALGUNOS QUIZAS TENGAN MIEDO COMO EL PSOE ( CUANDO SE PARECE AL P.P. COM UNA GOTA DE AGUA ) A QUE SEA MALO PARA LA DEMOCRACIA , NADA DE ESO , SURGIRAN SIN DUDA MAS PARTIDOS , ES LOGICO E INEVITABLE , ESE MIEDO ES PORQUE PSOE Y P.P. SON IGUALES COMO SE VE EN EL BIPARTIDISMO ES MALO , ES EL CANCER DE LA DEMOCRACIA SE MIRE POR LOS PUNTOS QUE SE MIRE , POR LO TANTO LO MAS IMPORTANTE ES QUE HAYA MAS PARTIDOS A NIVEL ESTATAL CON REPRESENTACION PARLAMENTARIA 6 O 7 SERIA LO IDEAL SEGUIENDO LOS REGIONALISTAS QUE HAY , SOBRE TODOS PARTIDOS DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS COMO LA VIDA MISMA .
¿ ACASO LA VIDA NO ES UNA REVOLUCION ?.
ESTA GENTE DEL P.P. ES BASURA COMO SE DIJO TAMBIEN CUANDO EL CASO DEL YAK - 42 .
LOS RESPONSABLES SON LOS POLITICOS TRILLO , AZNAR , ETC Y DESPUES LOS EJECUTORES MILITARES POR LEY , EN TODOS LOS CASAS LOS RESPONSABLES SON LOS MAS ALTOS , LOS QUE MANDAN Y EN MENOR MEDIDA LOS QUE EJECUTAN LOS MANDATOS QUE NO DISTINGUEN ENTRE MORAL O INMORAL ENTRE INEPTOS O NO ETC .
YA VEIS DONDE NOS HA LLEVADO EL CAPITALISMO A LA CRISIS POR NO SUBIR LOS SALARIOS EN LA MEDIDA QUE SUBIO EL EURO , EL I.P.C. SUBRREALISTA QUE PUBLICA EL GOBIERNO , EL LIBRE MERCADO ETC .
LA SOCIALDEMOCRACIA ES UNA PALABREA EXTRATERRESTRE PUES NO EXISTE EN NINGUNA FILOLOGIA Y YO ASEGURO QUE VIOLA LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS IGUAL QUE UNA DICTADURA O IGUAL QUE LA DERECHA-NEOLIBERALISMO ETC .
POR CONSIGUIENTE NEOLIBERALISMO=CAPITALISMO=FASCISMO=SOCIALDEMOCRACIA 
O LA SOCIALDEMOCRACIA ES QUE LE TIENE MIEDO AL NEOLIBERALISMO Y ESTA SUPEDITADA EN TODOS LOS PAISES .
POR LO TANTO NEOLIBERALISMO=SOCIALDEMOCRACIA . EN TODAS LAS ELECCIONES NI NEOLIBERALISMO NI SOCIALDEMOCRACIA  Y TODO IRA MEJOR .
ES CONVENIENTE PUES VOTAR A MAS PARTIDOS CON QUE HUBIERA 7 O 8 DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS A NIVEL ESTATAL , SIN MENOS CABO DE LOS REGIONALISTAS QUE HAY ACTUALMENTE LA DEMOCRACIA SERIA MAS SOLIDA .
VOTEMOS PUES A ESTOS PARTIDOS Y EXIGAMOS QUE SE CAMBIE LA LEY ELECTORAL .
SERGUIREMOS
ROJOS NO SON LOS REVOLUCIONARIOS , SI NO LOS FACISTAS PORQUE LE LLAMAN ROJOS A LOS COMUNISTAS , POR EL COLOR DE SU BANDERA , PUES LOS ROJOS SON LOS FASCISTAS QUE SE HAN ENSUCIADO LAS MANOS CON SANGRE DE LOS HUMANOS .
LA SANGRE ES MAS IMPORTANTE QUE UIN TRAPO PUES LOS FACISTAS , SON FASCISTAS +ROJOS ETC
SALUD AMIGOS , COMO SE DIJO TIEMPO HA QUE AZNAR DEBE DE SER PROCESADO Y CONDENADO , EL PARTIDO POPULAR ES ANTIDEMOCRATICO Y VIOLENTO , SE DIJO QUE YO DABA TESTIMONIO POR RAZONES PERSONALES , AHORA SE ESTA VIENDO CON LA CORRUPCION , CUANDO NO CON LA ESPECULACION DE LA VIVIENDA Y TANTAS FECHORIAS .SI NO HEMOS LEIDO OU OIDO MAL LA CORRUPCION EMPEZO CON AZNAR Y SIENDO MINISTRO 1 ª RAJOY Y ESTANDO ZAMPLAANA , TRILLO , ACEVES , RODRIGO RATO FRAGA ETC , ETC
POR LO QUE LOS QUE ESTA AHORA EN ACTIVO DE LA POLITICA DEBEN DE DIMITIR Y HAY MAS MOTIVOS PARA PROCESAR AL GRAN GUILIPOLLAS .
SON BASURA , SSON MISERABLES , SON INEPTOS PARA CUALQUIER COSA CUANDO MAS PARA GOBERNAR UN PAIS , POBRE PAIS , RAJOY APOYA A CAMPS , BARCENAS , DEFIENDE AL BIGOTES , LA COSPEDAL ACUSA A LA POLICIA RICARDO COSTA ACUSA A RAJO , CORREA APOYA A AGUIRRE , ESTE APOYA O DISCULPA O APOYA AL OTRO , ETC , COMO SE DIJO ESTO ES UNA TOMADURA DE PELO A LOS CIUDADANOS Y ATENTA CONTRA LA INTELIGENCIA , LA LOGICA Y LA RAZON , LOS MAXIMOS RESPONSABLES DEL PARTIDO DEBEN DE DIMITIR Y SER PROCESADOS Y QUE SE DISUELVA EL PARTIDO LADRON COMO TAMBIEN SE DIJO , ALGUNOS QUIZAS TENGAN MIEDO COMO EL PSOE ( CUANDO SE PARECE AL P.P. COM UNA GOTA DE AGUA ) A QUE SEA MALO PARA LA DEMOCRACIA , NADA DE ESO , SURGIRAN SIN DUDA MAS PARTIDOS , ES LOGICO E INEVITABLE , ESE MIEDO ES PORQUE PSOE Y P.P.

¿ ACASO LA VIDA NO ES UNA REVOLUCION ?.
ESTA GENTE DEL P.P. ES BASURA COMO SE DIJO TAMBIEN CUANDO EL CASO DEL YAK - 42 .
LOS RESPONSABLES SON LOS POLITICOS TRILLO , AZNAR , ETC Y DESPUES LOS EJECUTORES MILITARES POR LEY , EN TODOS LOS CASAS LOS RESPONSABLES SON LOS MAS ALTOS , LOS QUE MANDAN Y EN MENOR MEDIDA LOS QUE EJECUTAN LOS MANDATOS QUE NO DISTINGUEN ENTRE MORAL O INMORAL ENTRE INEPTOS O NO ETC .
COMO SE VE , ATIENDAEL PARTIDO POPULAR ESTA INCAPACITADO PARA GOBERNAR POR TODAS ESTAS FECHORÍAS , NO ES RESPONSABLE , ES UNA GENTE CACHONDA QUE SE CACHONDEA DE DIOS Y DE SU MADRE ATIENDAN PORQUE QUIZAS ESTO NO SE COMUNIQUE MAS , RECUERDELON PARA TODAS LAS ELECCIONES Y PARA SIEMPRE , NO HAY QUE TENER MIEDO QUE SE DISUELVA SURGIRAN OTROS PARTIDOS INCLUSO CON UNA IDEOLOGÍA PARECIDA COMO POR EJEMPLO FRAGA IRIBARNE  QUE SIENDO DE LA MISMA IDEOLOGÍA PERO TIENE MAS SENTIDO .
NOS SOLIDARIZAMOS PROFUNDAMENTE CON PEDRO CASTRO DEL PSOE QUE DIJO QUE QUIEN VOTARA AL P.P ERAN UNOS TONTOS .
TAMBIEN NOS SOLIDARIZAMOS PROFUNDAMENTE COM MANUEL COBO VICEALCALDE DE MADRID EN QUE DECIA QUE TENIA MIEDO POR SUS HIJOS DE LO QUE INAN A HEREDAR EL PAIS QUE IBAN A HEREDAR SUS HIJOS CON UN PENSAMIENTO ASI TAN RETROGRADO ETC , ETC .
POR OTRO LADO VEMOS QUE LA SOCIAL - DEMOCRACIA ES TIBIA ELLOS QUE SON SOCIALISTAS O SE LLAMAN SOCIALISTAS SON TIBIOS , NI SOCIALISTAS NI NADA , CREEMOS QUE ESTAN SUPEDITADOS AL NEOLIBERALISMO ES DECIR A LA DERECHA Y LE TIENEN MIEDO AL CAPITALISMO O , O QUIZAS QUIERAN SER CAPITALISTAS , ESTO DA U RESULTADO AMORFO RAMPLON GRIS EN QUE TODO ES IGUAL , DESGRACIADOS LOS QUE TIENEN HIJOS NOSOTROS NO LOS TENEMOS PERO PASARA A LA HISTORIA UN SISTEMA RAMPLON QUE INCLUSO SE IRA DETERIORANDO POR SU PROPIA IDEOLOGÍA , LO CUAL ES PROFUNDAMENTE NEGATIVO COMO DECIMOS QUE PASE AL INCONSCIENT COLECTIVO DE LA HUMANIDAD .
COMO UNA COSA AMORFA , GRIS , RAMPLONA , COMO UNA COSA INMORAL , COMO UNA COSA QUE QUIERE APARENTAR SER BUENA CUANDO ES UNA ESCORIA , VUESTRA U NUESTRA ES LA REPONSABLILIDA .
DEMOS UNA OPORTUNIDAD A ESTOS PARTIDOS DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS
COMO LA VIDA MISMA ¿ ACASO LA VIDA NO ES UNA REVOLUCION ?
NOSOTROS TAMPOCO PODEMOS DECIR BUENO QUE ENTREN LAS IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS , TENEMOS QUE CONTROLARLAS
POCO A POCO , LA LEY DICE Y ASI DEBE DE SER  LOS CIUDADANOS DEBERAN PARTICIPAR EN LA POLÍTICA POR SI MISMOS O POR MJEDIO DE SUS REPRESENTANTES  DEMOLES UNA OPORTUNIDAD , PRESIONEMOS PARA QUE CAMBIEN LA LEY ELECTORAL Y SEAN TODAS LAS FORMACIONES POR IGUAL CON RELACIÓN A LOS VOTOS QUE TENGAN .
HABRIA COMO DECIMOS MUCHO MAS POR DECIR PERO POR AQUÍ NO SE PUEDE MAS , TA , MBIEN TENEMOS UNAS POSIBLES ALTERNATIVAS COMO PENSAMOS QUE DEBERIA SER O NOS GUSTARIA QUE FUERA LA SOCIEDAD , LA ALTERNATIVA AL CAPITALISMO , QUIZAS MANDEMOS ALGUNOS ARTICULOS , , NO DAMOS RECETAS SOLO UNAS ORIENTACIONES DE LOS SENDEROS , PERO AQUÍ VEREMOS SI COJEN , CUANDO YA SE HAYA ARREGLADO PARTE DE LO QUE CREEMOS PRIORITARIO .
YO PUEDO ATESTIGUAR Y ATESTIGUO QUE LA SOCIALDEMOCRACIA VIOLA LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS Y TODO ESO Y EN LO ECONOMICO COMO DECIMOS LE TIENE MIEDO AL CAPITALISMO O QUIERE SER IGUAL QUE EL .
Y LA DERECHA NO DIGAMOS , LA LINEA QUE SEPARA AMBOS ES MUY TENUA SI ES QUE LA HAY , IMPERCEPTIBLE .
NOSOTROS PARTICULARMENTE CREEMOS QUE NO HAY NINGUNA LINEA QUE SON IGUALE CON EL TITULO DE ESTA PAGINA ADMINISTRACION DE LOS MEDICAMENTOS  NOS VINE OTRA IDEA QUE HA DE SER BASICA EN EL NUEVO COMUNIDMO .
SI UNA CAJA DE PASTILLAS PARA EL DOLOR DE LA CABEZA U OTRA COSA LE CUESTA AL PACIENTE EN LA FARMACIA 50 EUROS , QUE LUEGO EL ESTADO LE TIENE QUE PAGAR A LAS FARMACIAS O LABORATORIOS , SI LOS HICIERA ESTADO LOS PODIAN DAR O COBRAR EN LOS AMBULATORIOS GRATIS O POR 20 EUROS , ESTO ES OTRA DE LAS CAUSAS QUE HAY QUE IMPLANTAR PARA SANEAR Y POTENCIAR LA SEGURIDAD SOCIAL .
ASI COMO CADA VEZ QUE HAY CRISIS EL CAPITALISMO DICE DE REDUCIRLE LAS CUOTAS QUE LOS EMPRESARIOS PAGAN A LA SEGURIDAD SOCIAL , DE LA MISMA MANERA QUE HAY QUE SABER Y DISTINGUIR LOS AUTÓNOMOS QUE AL JUBILARSE NO CUENTAN MAS QUE CON SU POENSION QUE AQUELLOS OTROS QUE TIENEN RENTAS DE PROPIEDADES ANTERIORES .
TAMBIEN HAY QUE DESMANTELAR LA ECONOMIA SUMERGIDA QUE EL CAPITALISMO ESTA CHUPANDO Y ENGORDANDO EN TREIMIENTO DEL PUEBLO .
LAS ESTRUCTURAS POLÍTICO , ECONOMICAS , SOCIALES ETC QUE ANTES SE CREIAN INAMOVIBLES , YA NO SON NI POLVO PARA LOS PILARES DEL PORVENIR .
SE COMPRENDE QUE EL SISTEMA CAPITALISTA QUE HA SIDO HASTA AHORA HA SIDO VIRTUAL Y NO VALE .
NO COMPREBDEMOS .
EN ABSOLUTO PORQUE ENTRE LOS DEMÓCRATAS , ENTRE LOS VERDADEROS DEMÓCRATAS , NO HAY UN PLAN A , UN PLAB B  UN PLAN C  ETC HASTA UN PLAN Z  O MAS POR SI SURGE OTRO DICTADOR COMO FRANQUITO , QUITARLO DE EN MEDIO BUENO HACERLE QUE NO SEA TAN DEPOSTICO .
TAMPOCO SE COMPRENDE PORQUE NO HAY UN PLAN A ,  B , C  ETC PARA HACER DESAPARECER EL BIPARTIDISMO TANTO AL NEOLIBERALISMO COMO A LA SOCIALDEMOCRACIA QUE COMO SE SABE ES CASI UN CALCO DE LO OTRO .
VISTO QUE SE PERSIGUE ALQUAEDA , QUE SE PERSIGUE A LAS FARC DE COLOMBIA , QIUE SE PERSIGUE A E.TA .
Y A HENRRI BATASSUNA QUEB A LOS NAZIS  POR COSAS QUE AUN NO HAN HECHO PERO QUE HICIERON A LO MEJOR SUS ANTCESORES .
PORQUE NO MSE PERSIGUE A LA FALANGE  Y A TODOS SUS MEDIÁTICOS QUE SI SE SABE QUE SUS ANTECESORES HAN SIDO UNOS CRIMINALES .
ACASO ESTO ES JUSTO NI LO CONTEMPLA NINGUNA LEY , PARECE SER QUE NO LO SABEN LAS AUTORIDADES TACITAS , PERO LO SABRAn
Y YA POR ULTIMO AUNQUE ES OBVIO QUE QUEDAN MUCHAS COSAS HABRIA QUE LLENAR 2 O 3 CD - ROM , LA REPUBLICA ES TAMIEN ALGO MAS DEMOCRATICA , PERO PRIMERO ES PRECISO , ES NECESARIO CURTIRTE EN EN UN ESTADO UNITARIO DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS
Y REPETIMOS IZQUIERDASDE
IZQUIERDAS
SIEMPR , EL MARXISMO COMO MORAL Y ETICA  NO HAY OTRA COSA , DE LA MISMA MANERA QUE PARA QUE HAYA ALGO DE DEMOCRACIA SE NECESITAN PARTIDOS POLÍTICOS , CUANTOS MAS HAYAN MAS DEMOCRACIA HABRA , A SI CIERTAMENTE ANTE DE REPUBLICA COMO DECIAMOS ES NECESARIO CURTIRSE EN UN ESTADO UNITARIO DE IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS  SE HAN PREGUNTADO ALGUNA VEZ QUE ES LA REVOLUCION , LA VIDA NO ES UNA REVOLUCION ?
CADA VEZ QUE MIRAMOS ESTE ESCRITO TENEMOS UE PONERLE MAS COSAS , ES QUE MEJOR QUE VEAN REFLEXIONES  O SOLUCIONES  Y VEAN MAS Y POSIBLES ALTERNATIVAS .
HEMOS OIDO QUE LE HAN DICHO A GRCIA QUE VENDAN PARTE DE SU TERRITORIO PARA PAGAR LA DEUDA Y PONERSE CON LOS DEMAS , QUE VENDA ALGUNAS ISLAS , ESO ES INHUMANO , PARA QUE LUEGO AL FINAL PARA QUE , LO MEJOR ES QUE CADA MOCHUELO DE LA UNION VUELVA A SU OLIVO Y TODO IRA MEJOR .
YA QUE CREIAMOS CERRADO LO QUE PODEMOS DECIR POR AQUÍ , SURJE EL ESCAPE DE LA EXPLOTACION PETROLIFERA QUE TIENE EL CAPITALISMO EN AMERICA , SE AHOGARAN EN SU AMBICION , HAYA QUE PARARLOS PUES INDUDABLEMENTE NO TIENEN LIMITE , QUIEN NO LO HAGA LOS EFECTOS QUE CAIGAN SOBRE SU CABEZA .
PRESENTIMOS QUE ESA BOLSA DE PETROLO DONDE PUEDE HABER MILLONES DE TONELADAS O BARRILES NO LA PODRAN CERRAR , PRONTO VEREMOS GRAN PARTE DE LOS MARES CON PECES MUERTOS FLOTANDO , ESTA GENTE POR TODOS LOS SITIOS QUE PISA SOLO SE VE DESOLACION Y MUERTE Y NOSOSTROS OS DECIMOS , HAY QUE PARARLOS  PERO YA DE INMEDIATO , PUES EL OCEANO TAMBIEN ES MIO , LA ATMOSFERA TAMBIEN ES MIA Y NO SE PUEDE PERMITIR QUE HAGAN MAS FECHORIAS .
BUENO AUNQUE NO DIGAMOS MAS POR ESTA SABED QUE ELLOS NO PARAR EN HACER FECHORIAS , LAS PUBLIQUEN O NO LA PRENSA ESBIRROS DEL CAPITALISMO , PERO SABED QUE CADA DIA SE PUEDE ESPERAR LO PEOR CON ESTA GENTE .
YO DOY TESTIMONIO QUE LA MAYORIA DE LOS PAISES OCCIDENTALES VIOLA LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS Y MI TESTIMONIO ES IRREFUTABLE , VIOLA ADEMAS TODAS LAS LEYES NATURALES Y UNIVERSALES , OCCIDENTE SIMBOLICAMENTE Y REALMENTE ES LO NEGATIVO .
ES ESA GRAN BESTIA QUE SE HABLA EB EL APOCALIPSIS Y OTROS LIBROS
SANTE , FRATERNITE , EGUALITE , SOLIDALITE
QUE TODO LO SEMBRADO DE SUS FRUTOS
NO COMPRENDEMOS A LA GENTE SABIENDO COMO ES LA DERECHA Y EL CAPITALISMO LO VOTAN Y NO YA DE UNA GENERACION A OTRA QUE QUIZAS LO CONOZCA MENOS , SI NO LA MISMA GENERACION .
ALGO INHERENTE AL CAPITALISMO ES SU DOBLE LENGUAJE EL ARTE DE SEDUCCION ETC .
LUEGO CUANDO HAN CONSEGUIDO SU OBJETIVO SE VEN SUS FRUTOS .
COMO PUEDE DAR LA HIGUERA ALMEDRAS O UN VIÑEDO DAR MELONES O SANDIAS .
ASI EL CAPITALISMO POR MUCHO QUE DIGA DARA SOLO CORRUPCIO .Y FRUTOS AMARGOS
COMO PODRIAN CAMBIAR ASI POR LAS BUENAS .
¿ ACASO UN ARBOL PUEDE IRSE A 15 KILOMETROS ARRIBA O ABAJO POR SU PROPIA VOLUNTAD .
SOLAMENTE MEJORARIAN CON IZQUIERDAS REVOLUCIONARIAS
EN TODOS LOS PAISES .
The friend of information but the enemy of thought .
About two years ago , my online life began to be centered on a computer application : not my word processing program , or my email program , but my rss news reader .
rss ( which apparently stands for Really Simple Syndication , though there is some debate about that ) is a technology for capturing news headlines and summaries of stories , or their first few sentences , from websites .
A site that offers these headlines is said to be providing news " feeds " to those who ask for them .
The advantage of such syndication is that you can scan many headlines quickly , and open in your browser only the ones you really want to read .
Using NetNewsWire , I found I could get news from dozens of sources every day and thereby keep myself informed on pretty much everything I am interested in .
For me the most exciting features of NetNewsWire were two : first , I could set the frequency with which I wanted to check my sites for new items , as often as every half - hour ; and second , I could organize my sites in folders .
Pretty soon I had a Technology folder , a Macintosh folder , a News folder , a Culture folder , a Literature folder , a Christianity folder , and so on .
Some of these sites were from what online writers call the msm ( for " mainstream media " ) , but most of them were blogs , and with blogs you never know when someone is going to post except for Glenn Reynolds , the InstaPundit , who posts all day every day .
Normal people might write an entry three out of four days , and then go on a fortnight 's hiatus ; it gets tiresome to peek in at the website every day .
NetNewsWire did the peeking for me , and let me know when it found something .
At first my interest was in news whether about technology or politics or culture  but increasingly I became excited by the idea that the blogosphere could be a great venue for the exchange and development of ideas .
One of the first blogs I got really attached to was called Invisible Adjunct .
Now , alas , defunct , it was written by a woman who worked as an adjunct ( that ...
