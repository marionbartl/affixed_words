Editor ’s note :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of cyber intrusions detected by the security firm Solutionary in March .
It was 128 per minute .
The story also misidentified Kevin G. Coleman , a computer security specialist at Technolytics .
He is a consultant to the office of the director of national intelligence .
Both errors have been corrected in this version .
China has developed more secure operating software for its tens of millions of computers and is already installing it on government and military systems , hoping to make Beijing ’s networks impenetrable to U.S. military and intelligence agencies .
The secure operating system , known as Kylin , was disclosed to Congress during recent hearings that provided new details on how China ’s government is preparing to wage cyberwarfare with the United States .
“ We are in the early stages of a cyber arms race and need to respond accordingly , ” said Kevin G. Coleman , a private security specialist who advises the government on cybersecurity .
He discussed Kylin during a hearing of the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission on April 30 .
The deployment of Kylin is significant , Mr. Coleman said , because the system has “ hardened ” key Chinese servers .
U.S. offensive cyberwar capabilities have been focused on getting into Chinese government and military computers outfitted with less secure operating systems like those made by Microsoft Corp .
“ This action also made our offensive cybercapabilities ineffective against them , given the cyberweapons were designed to be used against Linux , UNIX and Windows , ” he said .
The secure operating system was disclosed as computer hackers in China - some of them sponsored by the communist government and military - are engaged in aggressive attacks against the United States , said officials and experts who disclosed new details of what was described as a growing war in cyberspace .
These experts say Beijing ’s military is recruiting computer hackers for its forces , including one specialist identified in congressional testimony who set up a company that was traced to attacks that penetrated Pentagon computers .
Chinese Embassy spokesman Wang Baodong declined immediate comment .
But Jiang Yu , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman , said April 23 that the reports of Chinese hacking into Pentagon computers were false .
“ Relevant authorities of the Chinese government attach great importance to cracking down on cybercrimes , ” Ms. Jiang said .
“ We believe it is extremely irresponsible to accuse China of being the source of attacks prior to any serious investigation . ”
Mr. Coleman , a computer security specialist at Technolytics and a consultant to the office of the director of national intelligence and U.S. Strategic Command , said Chinese state or state - affiliated entities are on a wartime footing in seeking electronic information from the U.S. government , contractors and industrial computer networks .
Mr. Coleman said in an interview that China ’s Kylin system was under development since 2001 and the first computers to use it are government and military servers that were converted beginning in 2007 .
Additionally , Mr. Coleman said , the Chinese have developed a secure microprocessor that , unlike U.S. - made chips , is known to be hardened against external access by a hacker or automated malicious software .
“ If you add a hardened microchip and a hardened operating system , that makes a really good solid platform for defending infrastructure [ from external attack ] , ” Mr. Coleman said .
U.S. operating system software , including Microsoft , used open - source and offshore code that makes it less secure and vulnerable to software “ trap doors ” that could allow access in wartime , he explained .
“ What ’s so interesting from a strategic standpoint is that in the cyberarena , China is playing chess while we ’re playing checkers , ” he said .
Asked whether the United States would win a cyberwar with China , Mr. Coleman said it would be a draw because China , the United States and Russia are matched equally in the new type of warfare .
Rafal A. Rohozinski , a Canadian computer security specialist who also testified at the commission hearing , explained how he took part in a two - year investigation that uncovered a sophisticated worldwide computer attack network that appeared to be a Chinese - government - sponsored program called GhostNet , whose electronic strikes were traced to e-mails from Hainan island in the South China Sea .
GhostNet was able to completely take over targeted computers and then download documents and information .
Some of the data stolen were sensitive financial and visa information on foreign government networks at overseas embassies , Mr. Rohozinski said .
The China - based computer network used sophisticated break - in techniques that are generally beyond the capabilities of nongovernment hackers , Mr. Rohozinski said .
Using surveillance techniques , the investigators observed GhostNet hackers stealing sensitive computer documents from embassy computers and nongovernmental organizations .
“ It was a do - it - yourself signals intelligence operation , ” Mr. Rohozinski said of the network , which took over about 1,200 computers in 103 nations , targeted specifically at overseas Tibetans linked to the exiled Dalai Lama .
Mr. Rohozinski , chief executive officer of the SecDev Group and an advisory board member at the Citizen Lab at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto in Ontario , said the GhostNet operation was likely part of a much bigger cyberintelligence effort by China to silence or thwart its perceived opponents .
A third computer specialist , Alan Paller , told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on April 29 that China ’s military in 2005 recruited Tan Dailin , a graduate student at Sichuan University , after he showed off his hacker skills at an annual contest .
Mr. Paller , a computer security specialist with the SANS Institute , said the Chinese military put the hacker through a 30 - day , 16 - hour - a - day workshop “ where he learned to develop really high - end attacks and honed his skills . ”
A hacker team headed by Mr. Tan then won other computer warfare contests against Chinese military units in Chengdu , in Sichuan province .
Mr. Paller said that a short time later , Mr. Tan “ set up a little company .
No one ’s exactly sure where all the money came from , but it was in September 2005 when he won it .
By December , he was found inside [ Defense Department ] computers , well inside DoD computers , ” Mr. Paller said .
A Pentagon official said at the time that Chinese military hackers were detected breaking into the unclassified e-mail on a network near the office of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in June 2007 .
Additional details of Chinese cyberattacks were disclosed recently by Joel F. Brenner , the national counterintelligence executive , the nation ’s most senior counterintelligence coordinator .
Mr. Brenner stated in a speech in Texas last month that cyberactivities by China and Russia are widespread and “ we know how to deal with these , ” including widely reported “ Chinese penetrations of unclassified DoD networks . ”
“ Those are more sophisticated , though hardly state of the art , ” he said .
“ Frankly , I worry more about attacks we can’t even see , which the Russians are good at .
The Chinese are relentless and do n’t seem to care about getting caught .
And we have seen Chinese network operations inside certain of our electricity grids . ”
Mr. Brenner said there are minimal concerns about a Chinese cyberattack to shut down U.S. banking networks because “ they have too much money invested here .
“ Our electricity grid ?
No , not now .
But if there were a dust - up over Taiwan , these answers might be different , ” he said .
Aggressive Chinese computer hacking has been known for years , but the U.S. government in the past was reluctant to detail the activities .
The CIA , for example , sponsored research in the late 1990s that sought to minimize Chinese cyberwarfare capabilities , under the idea that highlighting such activities would hype the threat .
Researcher James Mulvenon , for instance , stated during a 1998 conference that China ’s People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) “ does not currently have a coherent [ information warfare ] doctrine , certainly nothing compared to U.S. doctrinal writings on the subject . ”
Mr. Mulvenon stated in one report that “ while PLA [ information warfare ] capabilities are growing , they do not match even the primitive sophistication of their underlying strategies . ”
Mr. Mulvenon has since changed his views and has identified Chinese computer - based warfare as a major threat to the Pentagon .
Mr. Coleman said China ’s military is equal to U.S. and Russian military cyberwarfare .
“ This is a three - horse race , and it is a dead heat , ” Mr. Coleman said .
The National University of China is the strategic adviser to the Chinese military on cyberwarfare and the Ministry of Science and Technology , he said .
Several computer security specialists recently sounded public alarm about the growing number of cyberattacks from China and Russia .
China , based on state - approved writings , thinks the United States is “ already is carrying out offensive cyberespionage and exploitation against China , ” Mr. Coleman said .
In response , China is taking steps to protect its own computer and information networks so that it can “ go on the offensive , ” he said .
Mr. Coleman said one indication of the problem was identified by Solutionary , a computer security company that in March detected 128 “ acts of cyberagression ” per minute tied to Internet addresses in China .
“ These acts should serve as a warning that clearly indicates just how far along China ’s cyberintelligence collection capabilities are , ” Mr. Coleman said .
A Pentagon spokesman , Air Force Lt. Col.
Eric Butterbaugh , would not comment on Chinese cyberattacks directly but said “ cyberspace is a war - fighting domain , critical to military operations :
We must protect it . ”
The Pentagon ’s Global Information Grid is hit with “ millions of scans ” - not intrusion attempts - every day , Lt. Butterbaugh said .
“ The nature of the threat is large and diverse , and includes recreational hackers , self - styled cybervigilantes , various groups with nationalistic or ideological agendas , transnational actors , and nation - states , ” he said .
“ We have seen attempts by a variety of state and nonstate sponsored organizations to gain unauthorized access to , or otherwise degrade , DoD information systems . ”
Air Force Gen. Kevin Chilton , commander of the U.S. Strategic Command , said May 7 that a joint cybercommand is needed under the Pentagon to better integrate military and civilian cybercapabilities and defenses .
Gen . Chilton said he favors creating the joint command at Fort Meade , Md. , where the National Security Agency is located .
The command should be a subunit of Strategic Command , located at Offutt Air Force Base , Neb .
Mr. Gates said last month that the National Security Council is heading up a strategic review of U.S. cybercapabilties and is considering creating a subunified command within Strategic Command .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Mr. Gates has not decided on the subunified command to handle cyberwarfare issues and is waiting for the completion of the White House review of cyberwarfare and security issues , which is past due from the 60 - day deadline imposed by Congress .
Mr. Gates “ thought it would be prudent to wait for their work before looking at potential organization structures , ” Mr. Whitman said in an interview .

Fine , but what the heck is the problem with Congress ?
They should have been in front of this long ago but that might have required someone to take action .
The US government owns the damned company so start acting like it .
Heaven forbid they do something .
After watching this problem build for some time , it ’s amazing to see how poorly both Congress and Obama have read this situation .
Twenty state attorneys general announced investigations Friday into the $ 165 million bonuses paid by insurance giant AIG last week , with Connecticut ’s top lawyer issuing subpoenas to CEO Edward Liddy and 11 other executives .
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the Democratic chairman of the General Assembly ’s Banks Committee want Liddy and other executives to appear Thursday and bring with them “ original or copies of documents regarding the AIG Financial Products Corp. retention bonus plan and any related contracts or agreements . ”
“ Now living off supersized taxpayer - paid bonuses , these AIG employees have a moral and legal obligation to appear at this legislative hearing and disclose details about corporate compensation to employees as well as investment decisions by AIG Financial Products Corp.
involving credit derivatives and dealings that have led to market destruction , ” said Blumenthal , a Democrat .
AIG officials are citing a Connecticut law to justify their payment of the bonuses .
The law says that employees can sue in civil court for payments withheld that are due them and recoup double the amount of money .
Many AIG employees live in Connecticut .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is already investigating AIG ’s bonus payments , and on Thursday received a list of employees who received bonuses that he had demanded a day earlier .
Abstract
Numerous articles examine the relationship between men ’s hunting skill and other important biological and social traits .
We analyzed more than 14,000 hunter days during 27 years of monitoring the Ache of Paraguay by using resampling methods to demonstrate that large sample sizes are generally required in order to distinguish individual men by hunting skill .
A small published study on !
Kung hunters shows that large ‐game hunters are even more difficult to distinguish by individual skill level .
This is a serious problem because regressions using noisy hunting data as the independent variable systematically underestimate the association of hunting ability with other biosocial traits .
The analysis suggests that some coresidents in many small ‐scale societies will be unable to accurately distinguish hunters by skill level , possibly favoring groupwide meat ‐sharing conventions and biased cultural transmission that emphasizes prestige rather than perceived hunting skill .
Guest Post by Steven Goddard
From time to time we hear that various places on earth have been “ warming much faster than the rest of the planet – as predicted by “ the models . ”
One of the places commonly mentioned in that list is the Arctic , based largely on 30 years of satellite data .
Fortunately though , we are not limited by 30 years of satellite data , as the Danish Meteorological Institute has records going back to 1958 and GISSTEMP has even longer records .
Below is a visual comparison of DMI 1958 Arctic temperatures vs. 2009 , showing that temperatures have hardly changed since the start of their record .
1958 Daily Mean Temperatures North of 80 degrees and in 2009 …
2009 Daily Mean Temperatures North of 80 degrees
Below is an overlay directly showing that 2009 temperatures ( green ) are similar to 1958 ( red ) and close to the mean .
Blue is mean temperature for the 41 year record .
So if the Arctic has warmed since 1979 , how can it be the about same as 1958 ?
The answer can be seen in the GISSTEMP graph below of Godthab , Greenland .
Temperatures have warmed since the start of the satellite record , but they cooled even more between 1940 and 1980 .
Everyone ( including NSIDC ) quietly acknowledges that most of the Arctic was warmer in the 1940s than now – so they shift the warming argument to the Alaska side .
However , that argument also has problems .
Alaska temperatures rose at the positive PDO shift in 1977 , and have cooled again with the recent negative PDO shift – as seen below .
2008 was notable in that Alaska glaciers started to increase in size
If you look at only one leg of a cycle , you will come to the wrong conclusion about the shape of the graph .
Thus I would argue that Dr. Spencer ’s fourth order curves are much more meaningful than the nearly meaningless linear fits being used by most prominent climate scientists .
Climate is primarily cyclical , as every good climate scientist should know .

Type 1a supernovae like 2005ke , above , are known to go off when one member of a star pair exceeds critical mass and kickstarts a runaway fusion reaction .
Researchers have long puzzled over why some of the explosions happen so fast .
Now , a team of Chinese astronomers believes they ’ve arrived at a probable cause for the earliest of the blasts .
A team of astronomers , led by Bo Wang from the Yunnan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , have shown how the transfer of material from a ‘ helium star ’ to a compact white dwarf companion causes these cataclysmic events to take place .
The new results appear in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Most type
Ia supernovae are believed to occur when a white dwarf ( the superdense remnant that is the end state of stars like the Sun ) draws matter from a companion star orbiting close by .
Previous theories for the origins of a Type Ia include an explosion of a white dwarf in orbit around another white dwarf , or an explosion of a white dwarf in orbit around a red giant star .
When the white dwarf mass exceeds the so - called Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 times the mass of the Sun , it eventually collapses and within a few seconds undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction , exploding and releasing a vast amount of energy as a type Ia supernova .
Due to their high and remarkably consistent luminosities , astronomers use these events as ‘ distance indicators ’ to measure the distances to other galaxies and constrain our ideas about the Universe .
Scientists have confirmed more and more type Ia supernovae , and found that about half of them explode less than 100 million years after their host galaxy ’s main star formation period .
But previous models for these systems did not predict that they could be this young — so Wang and his team set out to solve the mystery .
Employing a stellar evolution computer code , they performed calculations for about 2600 binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a helium star , a hot blue star which has a spectrum dominated by emission from helium .
They found that if the gravitational field of the white dwarf pulls material from a helium star and increases its mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit , it will explode as a type Ia supernova within 100 million years of its formation .
“ Type Ia supernovae are a key tool to determine the scale of the Universe so we need to be sure of their properties , ” said research team member Zhanwen Han , also from the Yunnan Observatory .
“ Our work shows that they can take place early on in the life of the galaxy they reside in . ”
The team now plans to model the properties of the companion helium stars at the moment of the supernova explosions , which could be verified by future observations from the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectral Telescope ( LAMOST ) .

Electrical Power Misconceptions ( Part 1 )
PART ONE OF THREE PARTS
With these three posts , I hope to explain some of the misconceptions people have about the generation and supply of electrical power .
The invidious task I have is to try and counter the insidious creeping malaise that is slowly infecting us all , that being how solar power and wind power can be easily implemented so we can forever shut down those coal fired power plants that are contributing to global warming climate change by emitting Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) the single greenhouse gas that we are told is contributing to a disaster of unparalleled proportions .
I try and explain these things from the point of view of showing what the consequences will be .
The difficult part of my task is to explain something that is quite technical by its very nature , and to then try and reduce that highly technical content to something that can be easily understood .
The problem is that the other side has effectively reduced that technical content to tiny sound bytes that make it all sound as if it is quite a simple thing .
The public is unaware of the technical aspects , and have believed what they are being told without understanding the dire consequences , or just how marginal these forms of electrical power generation are , and in fact , cannot replace those large coal fired power plants .
The explanation of those technical aspects has led some readers to perceive that I have another agenda , not because I actually have that agenda , but that they just cannot understand those technical aspects when they have been confidently told that it is in fact quite a simple thing to do , and because of that , then anything I say in explanation goes completely against what they have heard and read from sources who themselves have no idea just how technical it really is .
So , what I will again try to do with these posts is to try and explain the complexities of some of those things that are really just misconceptions .
Keep in mind that if something is repeated often enough , then it reaches such a huge audience , that it then becomes the truth , making it harder to explain the reality of the facts behind it .
In the previous post I explained how the Solar option has been made to sound like it is the saviour in a situation like this , and how the simplicity of the argument has been accepted .
To follow on from that , I offer this simple idea that has gained traction here in Australia , so much so that it is actually looked upon as an attractive option .
The idea is to place a gazillion mirrors or solar cells in one of the hot deserts in Central Australia where the Sun shines all the time , ( even at night it seems ) and the power generated from this will be enough to power the whole of the Australian Continent .
That throws up the first of the misconceptions .
If something of this scale was done , ( and let ’s actually pretend a ridiculous idea like this could be implemented ) then it ’s just a matter of connecting all of Australia to that huge plant with the one gigantic electrical grid .
The same can be said of what President Obama first mooted during the election campaign , and then again since he has taken Office , and has also been included as part of the Economic Stimulus Package , that being that work should start on what has been termed ‘ A Smart Grid ’ .
The Smart Grid .
The idea of this is that realistically , the whole of the U.S. can be interconnected together so that all the power plants in the U.S. can supply all the power requirements for the whole of the U.S. the idea being that power that is surplus in some areas can be used in areas where they may be a deficit , or the threat of an approaching deficit , thus lessening the need for some of those power plants , the main targets being those large coal fired power plants .
It ’s a great idea but is actually impossible .
The nature of electrical power is that it cannot be transmitted across the vast distances that the intent of the statement might suggest .
This is because no matter how close to perfect that the wire conductors are , there is always a voltage drop along those wires because of the inherent electrical resistance of those wires .
On a smaller scale this can be demonstrated with an everyday electrical item used in some households .
In the U.S. your electrical power supply is 115 Volts AC supplied at 60 Hertz , while here in Australia , we use 240 Volts AC supplied at 50 Hertz .
So electrical items used in the U.S. can not be used here in Australia and vice versa .
I use the example of an electric line trimmer that some people use to trim the edges of their lawns .
These electric line trimmers have been known to have the electric motors burn out , mainly because the people using them have no idea about how electrical power is used by the items attached by power cords to the ‘ hole in the wall ’ , the idea being that if the hole in the wall supplies that 115 Volts , then it will be available at the item itself , which is no problem inside the house , because there are plenty of power points and any item is usually placed close to that point , negating the need for long extension leads .
However , outside the house , it is different .
There is usually only one point outside , or one in the garage , so to trim the edges with one of these items , you actually need an extension lead , and sometimes a long one if you wish to reach all the far points of the lawn and gardens .
An average length extension lead will suffice in most cases as the voltage drop along its length still leaves enough voltage to run the electric motor in items like this within the limits of the motor itself .
However , if you use a long extension lead , then some people might find that the trimmer runs slower , and some with really long leads find that the trimmer does not even turn over at all .
Further to this , some will actually burn out the electric motor that drives the whizzing line .
Why this happens is that even though the power at the wall is a dedicated 115 Volts , there is voltage dropped across the length of the extension lead , so at the motor in the tool itself , that voltage can be considerably reduced to the point that instead of driving the electric motor , it tries to turn it over , but the voltage is just too low , and the electric motor overheats , and eventually burns out , usually accompanied by an expensive brown odour .
The same applies on the much larger scale with high tension electrical transmission lines .
Even though the voltage is of an incredibly high value some of that voltage is lost in the transmission .
When it arrives to where it is used , sub stations have huge transformers to transform that power from the incredibly high number back down to the 115 Volts for the area supplied locally from that substation .
The concept being proposed leads into the idea that large solar plants can be constructed in areas where the Sun does shine constantly and the power generated can then be used across the whole of the grid , giving the impression that huge solar plants in places like Death Valley could effectively power areas in the North East where the largest amounts of power are used .
The same would apply for those large wind towers .
Put them all in really windy places , and then transmit the power the vast distances where it can be used .
It just cannot be done , no matter how smart the grid .
The power used in those areas actually needs to be generated in areas close by where it is actually used .
Hundreds of miles ….. yes .
Thousands of miles ….. no .
Some States actually source their power from neighbouring States , but the idea of a solar plant in Arizona providing power for Maine is totally out of the question .
If the grid is updated at immense cost , then it is true that savings in transmitted power versus delivered power can be found , and in some cases , where the grid has been allowed to degrade because of decades of inaction from Governments both State and Federal , then the upgrade of that grid will see more power available to consumers .
However , that amount is still only at the margins , and while overall power consumption in the US steadily increases by around 2.5 % a year , any amounts of ‘ new ’ power coming on line and available to consumers does not cover the slowly decreasing amount of available as older plants reach the end of their lives .
This is again a problem of Governments that have become complacent and not willing to invest in new power plants over the years , and now have reached the stage where those old plants have reached the end of their useful life , and there is nothing new to replace them with , because now , well intentioned people will veto any new plant of a large kind .
So , the underlying ‘ suggestion ’ that a smart grid can connect everybody to every plant is erroneous .
In the next post I will deal with some of the other aspects of electrical power generation that have been reduced to sound bytes that lead people to believe one thing when in actual fact , the opposite is the case .

Inside the Mind of a Sociopath
This excerpt is from : " The Sociopath Next Door : The Ruthless vs. the Rest of Us " by Martha Stout Ph.D. ( Broadway Books , New York , 2005 , ISBN 0-7679-1581 -X ) .
Martha
Stout is a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School and elaborates on the tales of ruthlessness in everyday life based on her 25 years of practice as a specialist in the treatment of psychological trauma survivors .
Imagine - if you can - not having a conscience , none at all , no feelings of guilt or remorse no matter what you do , no limiting sense of concern of the well - being of strangers , friends , or even family members .
Imagine no struggles with shame , not a single one in your whole life , no matter what kind of selfish , lazy , harmful , or immoral action you had taken .
And pretend that the concept of responsibility is unknown to you , except as a burden others seem to accept without question , like gullible fools .
Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological makeup is radically different from theirs .
Since everyone simply assumes that conscience is universal among human beings , hiding the fact that you are conscience - free is nearly effortless .
You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame , and you are never confronted by others for your cold - bloodedness .
The ice water in your veins is so bizarre , so completely outside of their personal experience that they seldom even guess at your condition .
In other words , you are completely free of internal restraints , and your unhampered liberty to do just as you please , with no pangs of conscience , is conveniently invisible to the world .
You can do anything at all , and still your strange advantage over the majority of people , who are kept in line by their consciences , will most likely remain undiscovered .
How will you live your life ?
What will you do with your huge and secret advantage , and with the corresponding handicap of other people ( conscience ) ?
The answer will depend largely on just what your desires happen to be , because people are not all the same .
Even the profoundly unscrupulous are not all the same .
Some people - whether they have a conscience or not - favor the ease of inertia , while others are filled with dreams and wild ambitions .
Some human beings are brilliant and talented , some are dull - witted , and most , conscience or not , are somewhere in between .
There are violent people and non-violent ones , individuals who are motivated by blood lust and those who have no such appetites .
Maybe you are someone who craves money and power , and though you have no vestige of conscience , you do have a magnificent IQ .
You have the driving nature and the intellectual capacity to pursue tremendous wealth and influence , and you are in no way moved by the nagging voice of conscience that prevents other people from doing everything and anything they have to do to succeed .
You choose business , politics , the law , banking or international development , or any of a broad array of other power professions , and you pursue your career with a cold passion that tolerates none of the usual moral or legal encumbrances .
When it is expedient , you doctor the accounting and shred the evidence , you stab your employees and your clients ( or your constituency ) in the back , marry for money , tell lethal premeditated lies to people who trust you , attempt to ruin colleagues who are powerful or eloquent , and simply steamroll over groups who are dependent and voiceless .
And all of this you do with the exquisite freedom that results from having no conscience whatsoever .
You become unimaginably , unassailably , and maybe even globally successful .
Why not ?
With your big brain , and no conscience to rein in your schemes , you can do anything at all .
Or no - let us say you are not quite such a person .
You are ambitious , yes , and in the name of success you are willing to do all manner of things that people with conscience would never consider , but you are not an intellectually gifted individual .
Your intelligence is above average perhaps , and people think of you as smart , maybe even very smart .
But you know in your heart of hearts that you do not have the cognitive wherewithal , or the creativity , to reach the careening heights of power you secretly dreams about , and this makes you resentful of the world at large , and envious of the people around you .
As this sort of person , you ensconce yourself in a niche , or maybe a series of niches , in which you can have some amount of control over small numbers of people .
These situations satisfy a little of your desire for power , although you are chronically aggravated at not having more .
It chafes to be so free of the ridiculous inner voices that inhibit others from achieving great power , without having enough talent to pursue the ultimate successes yourself .
Sometimes you fall into sulky , rageful moods caused by a frustration that no one but you understands .
But you do enjoy jobs that afford you a certain undersupervised control over a few individuals or small groups , preferably people and groups who are relatively helpless or in some way vulnerable .
You are a teacher or a psychotherapist , a divorce lawyer or a high school coach .
Or maybe you are a consultant of some kind , a broker or a gallery owner or a human services director .
Or maybe you do not have a paid position and are instead the president of your condominium association , or a volunteer hospital worker , or a parent .
Whatever your job , you manipulate and bully the people who are under your thumb , as often and as outrageously as you can without getting fired or held accountable .
You do this for its own sake , even when it serves no purpose except to give you a thrill .
Making people jump means you have power - or this is the way you see it - and bullying provides you with an adrenaline rush .
It is fun .
Maybe you cannot be a CEO of a multinational corporation , but you can frighten a few people , or cause them to scurry around like chickens , or steal from them , or - maybe , best of all - create situations that cause them to feel bad about themselves .
And this is power , especially when the people you manipulate are superior to you in some way .
Most invigorating of all is to bring down people who are smarter or more accomplished than you , or perhaps classier , more attractive or popular or morally admirable .
This is not only good fun ; it is existential vengeance .
And without a conscience , it is amazingly easy to do .
You quietly lie to the boss or to the boss 's boss , cry some crocodile tears , or sabotage a coworker 's project , or gaslight a patient ( or child ) , bait people with promises , or provide a little misinformation that will never be traced back to you .
Or now let us say you are a person who has a proclivity for violence or for seeing violence done .
You simply murder your coworker , or have her murdered - or your boss , or your ex-spouse , or your wealthy lover 's spouse , or anyone else who bothers you .
You have to be careful , because if you slip up , you may be caught and punished by the system .
But you will never be confronted by your conscience , because you have no conscience .
If you decide to kill , the only difficulties will be the external ones .
Nothing inside you will ever protest .
Provided you are not forcibly stopped , you can do anything at all .
If you are born at the right time , with some access to family fortune , and you have a special talent for whipping up other people 's hatred and sense of deprivation , you can arrange to kill large numbers of unsuspecting people .
With enough money , you can accomplish this from far away , and you can sit back safely and watch in satisfaction .
In fact , terrorism ( done from a distance ) is the ideal occupation for a person who is possessed of blood lust and no conscience , because if you do it just right , you may be able to make a whole nation jump .
And if that is not power , what is ?
Or let us imagine the opposite extreme :
You have no interest in power .
To the contrary , you are the sort of person who really does not want much of anything .
Your only real ambition is not to have to exert yourself to get by .
You do not want to work like everyone else does .
Without a conscience , you can nap or pursue your hobbies or watch television or just hang out somewhere all day long .
Living a bit on the fringes , and with some handouts from relatives and friends , you can do this indefinitely .
People may whisper to one another that you are an underachiever , or that you are depressed , a sad case , or , in contrast , if they get angry , they may grumble that you are lazy .
When they get to know you better , and get really angry , they may scream at you and call you a loser , a bum .
But it will never occur to them that you literally do not have a conscience , that in such a fundamental way , your very mind is not the same as theirs .
The panicked feeling of a guilty conscience never squeezes at your heart or wakes you in the night .
Despite your lifestyle , you never feel irresponsible , neglectful or so much as embarrassed , although for the sake of appearances , sometimes you pretend that you do .
For example , if you are a decent observer of people and what they react to , you may adopt a lifeless facial expression , say how ashamed of your life you are , and talk about how rotten you feel .
This you do only because it is more convenient to have people think you are depressed than it is to have them shouting at you all the time , or insisting that you get a job .
You notice that people who do have a conscience feel guilty when they harangue someone they believe to be " depressed " or " troubled . "
As a matter of fact , to you further advantage , they often feel obliged to take care of such a person .
If , despite your relative poverty , you can manage to get yourself into a sexual relationship with someone , this person - who does not suspect what you are really like - may feel particularly obligated .
And since all you want is not to have to work , your financier does not have to be especially rich , just relatively conscience - bound .
I trust that imagining yourself as any of these people feels insane to you , because such people are insane , dangerously so .
Insane but real - they even have a label .
Many mental health professionals refer to the condition of little or no conscience as " anti- social personality disorder , " a non-correctable disfigurement of character that is now thought to be present in about 4 percent of the population - that is to say , one in twenty - five people .
This condition of missing conscience is called by other names , too , most often " sociopathy , " or the somewhat more familiar term psychopathy .
Guiltlessness was in fact the first personality disorder to be recognized by psychiatry , and terms that have been used at times over the past century include manie sans délire , psychopathic inferiority , moral insanity , and moral imbecility .
Other books that analyse the condition are : " Without Conscience : The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us " , Robert D. Hare , Guilford Press , 1999 , ISBN 1572304510 .
Professor
Hare is one of the leading authorities on psychopaths .

The authors explore the infiltration into today 's corporations by psychopaths , or those with destructive personality characteristics that are invisible to many with whom they interact .
" Emotional Vampires : Dealing with People Who Drain You Dry " , Albert J. Bernstein , Ph.D. , McGraw - Hill , 2001 , ISBN 0-07-138167-8. Dr. Bernstein cleverly uses the vampire analogy to examine the condition .

If we look at the book of Proverbs , chapter 6 in particular rails against ' froward ' people ( King James Version ) .
A ' froward ' is translated from the Hebrew tahpukah ( tah - poo - kaw ' ) meaning a perversity or fraud .
Verses 12 to 19 describe some of the main qualities of a psychopath : A naughty person , a wicked man , walketh with a froward mouth .
He winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ; Frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy .
These six things doth the LORD hate : yea , seven are an abomination unto him :
A proud look , a lying tongue , and hands that shed innocent blood ,
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief , A false witness that speaketh lies , and he that soweth discord among brethren .

In the Mahaparinirvana Sutra the " icchantikas " ( i.e. , a species of being who can never attain Buddhahood ) are deeply evil .
They do n't believe that all beings have the Buddha - nature .
They wish to harm others .
They take pride in their twisted views , and live lives contrary to the Buddhist precepts .
Especially , the icchantikas conceal the evils they have done some of which are grave in nature .
Nor are they capable of repenting their sins .
As far as their spiritual capacity is concerned , they have " no capacity for saddharma " ( true Dharma ) .
The Buddha refers to icchantikas as " the incurable ones . " ...

Hindu resources :
In chapter 16 of Bhagavad Gita Krishna describes to Arjuna in some detail the nature of the negative personalities that the aspirant will have to deal with .
Many of these traits are those of the psychopath .
( Translation by Shri Purohit Swami , Faber & Faber , London 1935 ) ' All beings are of two classes : Godly and godless .
The Godly I have described ; I will now describe the other .
' The godless do not know how to act or how to renounce .
They have neither purity nor truth .
They do not understand the right principles of conduct .
' They say the universe is an accident with no purpose and no God .
Life is created by sexual union , a product of lust and nothing else .
' Thinking thus , these degraded souls , these enemies of mankind — whose intelligence is negligible and whose deeds are monstrous — come into the world only to destroy .
' Giving themselves up to insatiable passions , hypocritical , self - sufficient and arrogant , cherishing false conception founded on delusion , they work only to carry out their own unholy purposes .
' Poring anxiously over evil resolutions , which only end in death ; seeking only the gratification of desire as the highest goal ; seeing nothing beyond ; ' Caught in the toils of a hundred vain hopes , the slaves of passion and wrath , they accumulate hoards of unjust wealth , only to pander to their sensual desire .
' This I have gained today ; tomorrow I will gratify another desire ; this wealth is mine now , the rest shall be mine ere long ; ' I have slain one enemy , I will slay the others also ; I am worthy to enjoy , I am the Almighty , I am perfect , powerful and happy ; ' I am rich , I am well - bred ; who is there to compare with me ?
I will sacrifice , I will give , I will pay — and I will enjoy .
Thus blinded by Ignorance ; ' Perplexed by discordant thoughts , entangled in the snares of desire , infatuated by passion , they sink into the horrors of hell .
' Self - conceited , stubborn , rich , proud and insolent , they make a display of their patronage , disregarding the rules of decency .
' Puffed up by power and inordinate conceit , swayed by lust and wrath , these wicked people hate Me Who am within them , as I am within all .
' Those who thus hate Me , who are cruel , the dregs of mankind , I condemn them to a continuous , miserable and godless rebirth .
' So reborn , they spend life after life , enveloped in delusion .
And they never reach Me , O Prince , but degenerate into still lower forms of life .
' The gates of hell are three : lust , wrath and avarice .
They destroy the Self .
Avoid them .
' These are the gates which lead to darkness ; if a man avoid them he will ensure his own welfare , and in the end will attain his liberation .
' But he who neglects the commands of the scriptures , and follows the promptings of passion , he does not attain perfection , happiness or the final goal .
' Therefore whenever there is doubt whether thou shouldst do a thing or not , let the scriptures guide thy conduct .
In the light of the scriptures shouldst thou labour the whole of thy life . '
Current US Issues ( 2017 ) : With the recent election of Donald Trump as US President many are concerned that there is a sociopath in the White House .
Numerous signs are there - attempting to humiliate opponents into silence , the extensive use of soundbites to push peoples emotional buttons , the inability to tolerate criticism , the classifying of people as winners or losers , alternative facts , fake news and much more .
Depending on the level of threat , different cultures have different remedies .
The Inuit perceive the threat to a community as extreme and act accordingly as detailed in this Scientific American article by Scott O. Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz :
In a 1976 study anthropologist Jane M. Murphy , then at Harvard University , found that an isolated group of Yupik - speaking Inuits near the Bering Strait had a term ( kunlangeta ) they used to describe " a man who … repeatedly lies and cheats and steals things and … takes sexual advantage of many women - someone who does not pay attention to reprimands and who is always being brought to the elders for punishment . "
When Murphy asked an Inuit what the group would typically do with a kunlangeta , he replied , " Somebody would have pushed him off the ice when nobody else was looking . "
Caveats : Armed with this information , it is very tempting to label folks we just plain do n't get on with .
In particular , do n't call people sociopaths to their faces - if you 're wrong , you 've done them an injustice and if you 're right it will only make the situation worse as you 've given them another reason to bully or otherwise abuse you .
Try and get an independent verification of your suspicions .
The safest thing to do is to have nothing more to do with a sociopath .
If that 's not possible , start reading the books mentioned and use the strategies they describe .
Think only in terms of your survival - these people are a threat to your sanity , your career and your wallet .
Attempting psychotherapy on someone you know will make you both sicker ( Bernstein ) .
Sociopaths think they 're always right and will normally resist attempts at therapy .
If they do agree to therapy they will try and subvert the process , particularly in a group context .
Dr. William Higgins comments : " You ca n't negotiate or bargain with psychopaths " .
Agreements , like truth , are another commodity to be used to win .
They will be broken on a whim and the blame turned on the other party .
Bernstein notes that sociopaths are addicted to certain things such as excitement , aggression , deception etc. - not to mention the usual sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll .
This makes sense in that a person 's conscience is a strong inhibitor to such behaviour .
He also notes that they have repeat patterns of behaviour which are useful in diagnosing their condition .
Please remember that we are dealing with models of human behaviour - and models are not reality .
Models are useful tools for explanation and communication and are part of the scientific method .
Next month or next year , a better model may come along .
If it explains what is known and yields further insights , it 's a good candidate for acceptance .

Has your life ever been made miserable by a psychopath / sociopath ?
Most people have suffered at the hands of a perverse personality at sometime in their lives , be it in the workplace or at home .
It may take years before the lovable glib mask is penetrated and the destructive side exposed .
An estimated 1 in 25 of the population are sociopaths - which means that we all know a few .
Journalist John Simpson 's description of Robert Maxwell is a good illustration .
In a book review on Psychopathy by Millon et al , the reviewer quotes : " . . . it was not until Cleckley wrote
The Mask of Sanity in 1941 that we came to realize that psychopathy is a personality disorder that wreaks havoc on personal and societal institutions .
As reported in chapter 8 , Westman estimates that each sociopath costs society about $ 50,000 a year . "
The case of Robert Hendy - Freegard is one of the worst ones to emerge recently .
This extended excerpt from a book by Martha Stout gives a stark insight into the mindset of this type of personality .
When read slowly and carefully it can form the basis for understanding the phenomenon .
Listen to Ron Paul .

I have been very pleased with the progress of my legislation , HR 1207 , which calls for a complete audit of the Federal Reserve and removes many significant barriers towards transparency of our monetary system .
This bill now has nearly 170 cosponsors , with support from both Republicans and Democrats .
Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced a companion bill in the Senate S 604 , which will hopefully begin to gain momentum as well .
I am very encouraged to see so many of my colleagues in Congress stand with me for greater transparency in government .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Some have begun to push back against this bill , and I am very happy to address their concerns .
The main argument seems to be that Congressional oversight over the Fed is government interference in the free market .
This argument shows a misunderstanding of what a free market really is .
Fundamentally , you cannot defend the Federal Reserve and the free market at the same time .
The Fed negates the very foundation of a free market by artificially manipulating the price and supply of money — the lifeblood of the economy .
In a free market , interest rates , like the price of any other consumer good , are decentralized and set by the market .
The only legitimate , Constitutional role of government in monetary policy is to protect the integrity of the monetary unit and defend against counterfeiters .
Instead , Congress has abdicated this responsibility to a cabal of elite , quasi - governmental banks who , instead of stabilizing the economy , have destabilized it .
It took less than two decades for the Federal Reserve to bring on the Great Depression of the 1930’s .
It has also inflated away the value of our currency by over 96 percent since its inception .
It has invisibly stolen from the poor and given to the rich through this controlled inflation , and now openly stolen through recent bank bailouts .
It has predictably exacerbated the very problems it was meant to solve .
Detractors have also argued that the Fed must remain immune from the political process , and that that more congressional oversight would distort their very important decisions .
On the contrary , the Federal Reserve is already heavily entrenched in the political process , as the Fed chairman is a political appointee .
High - level officials routinely make the rounds between positions at the Fed , member banks , Treasury and back again , taking care of friends and each other along the way .
As far as the foolishness of placing complex monetary policy decisions in the hands of politicians — I could n’t agree more .
No politician or central banker , no matter how brilliant , is smart enough to know more than the market itself .
The failure of central economic planning has been witnessed over and over .
It is frankly beyond me why we ever agreed to try it again .
To understand how unwise it is to have the Federal Reserve , one must first understand the magnitude of the privileges they have .
They have been given the power to create money , by the trillions , and to give it to their friends , under any terms they wish , with little or no meaningful oversight or accountability .
Thus the loudest arguments against greater transparency are likely to come from those friends , and understandably so .
However , it is the responsibility of every member of Congress to represent the interests of the people that sent them to Washington and find out what has been happening with our money .
As the branch of government with the power of the purse , we really have no other reasonable choice when the economy is in the shape it is in .

Hackers have reportedly infiltrated restricted computer databases at the University of California Berkeley , putting the private data of 160,000 students , alumni , and others at risk .
According to UC Berkeley , computer administrators determined that electronic databases in University Health Services had been breached by overseas criminals on April 21 , 2009 .
UHS electronic medical records , including details of patients ' diagnoses , treatments and therapies were not affected in this breach because they 're stored on a separate system .
( Source : http://datatheft.berkeley.edu)
Social Security Numbers Included in Breach
Information contained on the breached databases included Social Security numbers , health insurance information and non-treatment medical information such as records of immunization and names of treating physicians .
( Source : berkeley.edu )
More than 160,000 individuals will be alerted by the university .
Victims include current and former UC Berkeley students , their parents or spouses ( if insurance coverage is linked ) and approximately 3,400 Mills College students who received or were eligible to receive health care at UC Berkeley .
97,000 Social Security numbers -- which can be used to access a victim 's credit history and other important financial accounts as well and used to open new financial accounts or get a driver 's license in the victim 's name -- were stolen according to UC Berkeley 's Chief information officer .
( Source : yahoo.com )
Taunting Messages Left by Hackers
The breach began on October 9 , 2008 and continued until April 9 , 2009 when computer administrators identified taunting messages left by hackers while performing routine maintenance .
The attacks appear to have been launched overseas .
The FBI and campus police are investigating the breach , which was traced to a number of overseas locations , including China .
UC Berkeley has also hired an outside Internet security firm to audit the school 's systems and security measures .
Victims were not notified until this past Friday because it took until April 21 to figure out which databases had been breached .
The university set up a website , http://datatheft.berkeley.edu, to help the victims of the breach , and established a 24 - hour Data Theft Hotline , 888-729-3301 , to answer inquiries .
Is the Third Time the Charm ?
This is the third time in five years UC Berkeley has had electronic information compromised .
In a previous episode dating back to March , 2005 , a thief walked into one of UC Berkeley 's offices and stole a laptop that contained personal information on almost 100,000 alumni , students and applicants .
In August 2004 , research being done by UC Berkeley for the State Department of Social Services was compromised by hackers .
That database breach put the information of about 600,000 people at risk .

For the fourth time since last September , a Microsoft spokesperson has contacted Betanews to suggest that our explanation of the remote application services deployment model brought closer by today 's release of Beta 1 of .NET Framework 4.0 might confuse some folks .
Thing is , we at least have reason to believe we understand the concept of it pretty well , having first spent up - front time with it last October at PDC .
So what exactly is going on ?
The big idea is that Microsoft is making it possible to design .NET applications that utilize Windows Communication Foundation ( WCF , its service - oriented model introduced with Vista ) and Windows Workflow Foundation ( WF -- just one " W , so as to avoid enraging the World Wildlife Fund ) , that can be distributed using an applications server .
The ideal of service - oriented logic is that an online application defines its services well so that its functions can be discoverable -- that client apps can discern how to utilize or " consume " those services .
This way an online service does n't have to be tailored exclusively for particular clients .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , WF is a way for applications to better define the way they will work by dividing their functions into discrete jobs .
One reason for doing this ( other than the fact that it lends to more logical design ) is so that the runtime schedulers can determine which of these jobs may be scheduled simultaneously with one another , and which require others to be completed first .
Both of these concepts , you 'd think , would be crucial for deploying an application remotely through an app server .
The truth is , we 're only just now getting around to them with regard to Microsoft .
Now , all technologies ever devised by Microsoft since it first got paid for that traffic light regulator , have been conceived and implemented in components .
Sometimes a component that pertains to a broader concept gets a funky code -name .
In this case , " Dublin " was created to pertain to the company 's Windows Applications Server project , which is a huge expansion of its app server capabilities to enable WCF and WF on a distributed scale .
. NET Framework 4.0 , whose Beta 1 was released to the general public today , contains the necessary expansions for programmers especially using the Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1 , also released today , to code apps on the local level that utilize WCF and WF , and that can eventually be deployed remotely .
VS 2010 adds the modeling tools a developer needs to get the concepts down , test them out , and deploy them once they 're whittled down .
You 've heard us talk about .
NET Services .
That 's Microsoft 's implementation of .NET in the cloud -- specifically , it 's own cloud , where Windows Azure reigns .
One big way to produce a distributed application is to devise it first for .NET 4.0 , then to deploy it over Azure where it 's managed by .NET Services .
Obviously there 's a difference between the two components regarding location ; . NET Framework 4.0 is on your system , while .NET Services is on Microsoft's .
It 's generally regarded that Dublin is the underlying technology behind .
NET Services .
Meanwhile , Dublin technology will eventually be distributed with the Application Server role of Windows Server , hopefully with the WS2K8 R2 release .
As Microsoft 's spokesperson told us this afternoon , " One clarifying point is that while Dublin and .NET Framework technologies are related parts of Microsoft 's application server investments , Dublin , .NET Services , and .NET 4 are three separate technologies .
Of course , as you might expect , customers will often see value in using them together from a use - scenario perspective , but they are not part of the same beta and will not ship together . "
Kind of , in the way different layers of an onion are separate parts of a salad , especially once you 've peeled it .
But they 're not really different vegetables .
Indeed , you wo n't be seeing the app server extensions of Dublin with .
NET Framework 4.0 Beta 1 ; and .NET Services , as you now know , is way out there .
But they all fit together and rely upon one another , which is why you 'll sometimes hear the " Dublin " umbrella extended to include technologies beyond its original purview .
An excellent article from Microsoft itself on this subject is " WCF and WF Services in the .NET Framework 4.0 and ' Dublin ' " by Aaron Skonnard .
Wheelchair - bound double - amputee Marilyn Holsten is clearing the air in her pot-puffing fight with her landlord .
Holsten , who faces eviction at the end of the month because she smokes marijuana inside her East Vancouver suite , was yesterday given a vapourizer by pot activist Marc Emery and his wife , Jodie .
Emery and his wife dropped the $ 750 German - made Volcano Vaporizer off at Holsten ’s suite on East 8th Avenue and she wasted no time in putting it to use .
Besides the donated vapourizer , Holsten was also given a baggie of Blueberry Island Sweet Skunk , a marijuana variant prized by pot puffers .
After a quick instructional session on using the high - end machine , Holsten took a few tokes and sang praise of the machine that allows her to get stoned while eliminating smoke .
“ Wow is this ever nice , it does n’t burn your throat , ” said Holsten , 49 , who uses marijuana to help with the unbearable pain she gets in the stumps of her legs .
Holsten is a diabetic and has lived for more than eight years in a building run by the nonprofit Anavets Seniors Citizens Housing Society .
After pot smoke was detected coming from her suite , she was given an eviction notice in April 2008 .
In order to stay , she was forced to sign a document promising to light up outdoors only .
Then last month Holsten was given a final eviction notice after management said the smell of pot was noticed in public areas of the building .
Despite having a doctor ’s note saying she needs to smoke marijuana to ease her pain , the landlord told her to find another place .
Emery , who faces possible extradition to the U.S. on drug charges next month , said he is hearing of cases similar to Holsten ’s .
“ We know of many people who are using medical marijuana who are running into problems with their landlords , ” he said .
Holsten has appealed her eviction and has a hearing June 9 with the Residential Tenancy Branch .

One of the more horrifying aspects of recent events was the realisation that the balance sheets of some major financial institutions were wholly misleading .
As Chris Patten puts it in his recent book , What Next ? , one week , a single mother in St Louis takes out a mortgage .
The next week , the mortgage is a triple - a rated security in London .
The week after that , it is a supposedly reliable asset in a German municipality 's pension fund .
This is not only a moral and intellectual problem .
It is also a financial one .
The international banking system will remain unstable until the so - called toxic assets are properly evaluated .
As that is a much less glamorous task than the grand - standing which went on last week , it has not received nearly enough attention , though there has been useful work in London , both in the Treasury and at Credit Suisse .
But even if the G20 Heads of Government could not have been expected to bring about the transvaluation of all toxic values , they could at least have set the banks a good example : honest accounting .
Under Gordon Brown 's malign tutelage , they did the opposite .
The fanfare figures in the final communique were as reliable as a Bernie Madoff prospectus .
Almost all the billions and trillions turned out to be a re-announcement of sums already committed .
That was probably just as well .
Otherwise , the consequences for public debt and inflation could have been hideous .
Even so , and especially in the context of calls for tighter financial regulation , it was hypocritical .

One international institution did obtain additional funds : the IMF , and this may prove significant .
Over the past few days , both in public and even more explicitly in private , British ministers have been softening up opinion in case the government has to have recourse to the IMF .
No disgrace in that , we are told ; it would be the same as a socialite with a cash - flow problem buying a dress at a charity shop : a mere trifling temporary expedient .
We should never underrate this government 's capacity for sheer effrontery .
In return , it should not underrate the public 's residual common sense .
All the talk of billions and trillions may wash over most voters , but they are looking for a touchstone : some secure foundation from which to make their moral judgments .
The IMF would provide one .
Mr Brown has shown unexpected powers of bouncing back , but there are limits .
If he had to resort to the IMF , any remaining credibility would be shattered .
Not even Lord Mandelson 's silvered serpentine tongue could talk him out of that one .
Yet a begging visit to the IMF would not necessarily prevent a partial recovery , starting with the stock market .
It might seem absurdly temerous to predict that the market has now stabilised .
There is a wise old stockbrokers ' adage : " Never try to catch a falling knife . "
Even so , one or two shrewd City chaps of my acquaintance are inclined to think that the knife has reached the tiles and are investing money on that basis .
For the past 18 months or so , there has been a lot of talk about " vulture funds " : cash - rich investors ready to buy distressed assets at fire - sale prices .
Up to now , the vultures have sat on their perches , waiting for the carrion to ripen , but one is beginning to hear the odd wing flapping .
There are technical obstacles in the way of a sustained rally .
A lot of people are still strapped for cash and it is much easier to sell shares than most other assets , especially houses .
So a recovery could be disrupted by profit - taking , or rather loss - minimising .
Yet it would not take much to move the FTSE back towards 5,000 .
Desperate to claim that his strategy is working , Gordon Brown will want to highlight any improvements .
But the housing market and the jobs market will be harder .
It would be amusing to hear a Labour Prime Minister boasting about a stock - market revival while the jobless figures were rising .
Unemployment has always been a lagging indicator , and matters have been made worse by the Government 's enthusiasm for EU regulations plus other means of increasing employers ' costs .
This is one of the most bewildering phenomena in contemporary politics .
Everyone knows that globalisation will lead to increased competition and therefore to pressure on domestic labour markets .
Everyone knows that youth unemployment creates lasting social problems .
But most EU governments impose measures which encourage employers to buy machines rather than hire workers .
It is not only the UK which is criminally deficient in joined - up government .
The Tories also have a problem , with joined - up opposition .
David Cameron could never be accused of panicking .
There were those who urged him to find a way of offering a counter - attraction during the G20 in order to interfere with Mr Brown 's dominance of the airwaves .
Rightly , Mr Cameron saw no point .
There are moments when a Prime Minister cannot be prevented from making the news and this was one of them .
David Cameron did at least have his half - hour with Barack Obama and that was by no means an automatic courtesy for a US President to extend to an opposition leader .
But Mr Cameron decided that he would wait for the captains and the kings to depart before striking his recessional note .
In so doing , he will have a number of narrow and tricky rhetorical paths to negotiate .
The Tories must find a way of discussing the present difficulties without appearing to revel in them : of being sombre without being thrown by unexpected signs of recovery .
They ought to be bold enough to encourage a degree of medium - term optimism , without sounding glib .
Above all , they must capture the voters ' confidence .
This requires three things : analysis , phrases and repetition .
The Tories ought to provide both an historical account of the degringolade and a sketch of the escape route .
In this , while eschewing facile partisanship , they should not be afraid of close reasoning and complex arguments .
The aim should to use seriousness to impress the serious - minded .
Needless to say , that is not enough .
It never is , in politics .
The Tories must also come up with some catchy phrases : their equivalent of " boom and bust " .
William Hague has made a start .
" Gordon Brown promised to abolish boom and bust .
He has kept half his promise . "
Having invented the phrases , it is vital to go on repeating them .
Often , it is only when the politicians are sick of repeating themselves that the voters at last begin to notice .
Apart from the state of the economy , the Tories have one advantage .
Mr Brown has already proclaimed his strategy for the next election .
He will declare that he is the only man who can save Britain ; that the Tories are only offering tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor .
As this is wholly dishonest , it should be equally ineffective , but Gordon Brown will not go down without a fight .
If the Tories lost that fight , they would have only themselves to blame .
Terrorists attacking our food supply is a nightmare scenario that has been given new life during the recent swine flu outbreak .
Although it seems easy to do , understanding why it has n't happened is important .
GR Dalziel , at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore , has written a report chronicling every confirmed case of malicious food contamination in the world since 1950 : 365 cases in all , plus 126 additional unconfirmed cases .
What he found demonstrates the reality of terrorist food attacks .
It turns out 72 % of the food poisonings occurred at the end of the food supply chain – at home – typically by a friend , relative , neighbour , or co-worker trying to kill or injure a specific person .
A characteristic example is Heather Mook of York , who in 2007 tried to kill her husband by putting rat poison in his spaghetti .
Most of these cases resulted in fewer than five casualties – Mook only injured her husband in this incident – although 16 % resulted in five or more .
Of the 19 cases that claimed 10 or more lives , four involved serial killers operating over several years .
Another 23 % of cases occurred at the retail or food service level .
A 1998 incident in Japan , where someone put arsenic in a curry sold at a summer festival , killing four and hospitalising 63 , is a typical example .
Only 11 % of these incidents resulted in 100 or more casualties , while 44 % resulted in none .
There are very few incidents of people contaminating the actual food supply .
People deliberately contaminated a water supply seven times , resulting in three deaths .
There is only one example of someone deliberately contaminating a crop before harvest – in Australia in 2006 – and the crops were recalled before they could be sold .
And in the three cases of someone deliberately contaminating food during packaging and distribution , including a 2005 case in the UK where glass and needles were baked into loaves of bread , no one died or was injured .
This is n't the stuff of bioterrorism .
The closest example occurred in 1984 in the US , where members of a religious group known as the Rajneeshees contaminated several restaurant salad bars with salmonella enterica typhimurium , sickening 751 , hospitalising 45 , but killing no one .
In fact , no one knew this was malicious until a year later , when one of the perpetrators admitted it .
Almost all of the food contaminations used conventional poisons such as cyanide , drain cleaner , mercury , or weed killer .
There were nine incidents of biological agents , including salmon­ella , ricin , and faecal matter , and eight cases of radiological matter .
The 2006 London poisoning of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko with polonium - 210 in his tea is an example of the latter .
And that assassination illustrates the real risk of malicious food poisonings .
What is discussed in terrorist training manuals , and what the CIA is worried about , is the use of contaminated food in targeted assassinations .
The quantities involved for mass poisonings are too great , the nature of the food supply too vast and the details of any plot too complicated and unpredictable to be a real threat .
That becomes crystal clear as you read the details of the different incidents : it 's hard to kill one person , and very hard to kill dozens .
Hundreds , thousands : it 's just not going to happen any time soon .
The fear of bioterror is much greater , and the panic from any bioterror scare will injure more people , than bioterrorism itself .
Far more dangerous are accidental contaminations due to negligent industry practices , such as the 2006 spinach E coli and , more recently , peanut salmonella contaminations in the US , the 2008 milk contaminations in China , and the BSE - infected beef from earlier this decade .
And the systems we have in place to deal with these accidental contaminations also work to mitigate any intentional ones .
In 2004 , the then US secretary of health and human services , Tommy Thompson , said on Fox News : " I can not understand why terrorists have not attacked our food supply .
Because it is so easy to do . "
Guess what ?
It 's not at all easy to do .

The rebels say civilians have nowhere left to go Sri Lankan government forces have shelled a hospital inside the conflict zone killing at least 49 people , Tamil Tiger rebel and hospital sources say .
The rebels said the makeshift hospital in Mullivaikal was hit in the morning .
The Sri Lankan government denied the army had caused civilian casualties or used heavy weapons in civilian areas , but said it had pierced rebel defences .
As it advanced south , it also said that all voices speaking from the Tiger - held zone amounted to misinformation .
Speaking in Geneva , the UN's top aid official , John Holmes , accused the Tamil Tigers of holding civilians against their will , adding that there was evidence that the government was continuing some use of heavy weapons despite its denials .
The claims are impossible to verify as reporters are banned from the area .
The staff can't work because of the fear
Dr Varatharaja of Mullivaikal 's hospital
Sri Lankan doctor describes shelling
More than 400 people were killed and over 1,000 injured over the weekend in what the UN has described as a bloodbath .
Many of those sick or injured were supposed to have been evacuated by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) on Tuesday
It said that it was unable to collect them because of continued heavy fighting .
See a map of the conflict region
The rebels say that the medical centre in Mullivaikal does not have enough food or medicine to treat scores of injured people .
Adam Mynott , World Affairs correspondent
As the human suffering has increased so has the clamour of the international community .
But the growing intensity of worldwide concern and demands for the killing to end has , so far , been powerless to stop or arrest the fighting .
Delegations of heavy - weight international politicians have beaten a trail to Colombo .
During the past month UN humanitarian chief John Holmes left after a three - day visit without being able to persuade Sri Lanka to open a humanitarian corridor to the rebel - held territory .
The British and French foreign ministers , David Milliband and Bernard Kouchner , led another delegation but apparently had little or no impact .
The UN Security Council has discussed the deteriorating situation but Sri Lanka has not been a full agenda item in a Security Council meeting because of a reluctance by Russia and China to include it .
They view the issue as an internal matter , and this has undoubtedly emboldened the government in Colombo to remain unmoved by international pressure .
War grinds on despite protests
Meanwhile , some foreign aid agencies say they are becoming increasingly concerned over the safety of their staff in the war zone .
One such agency contacted by the BBC said that they were " very worried " about three Tamil staff who they had not been in contact with for three days .
A spokesman , for the agency which did not want to be named , said that up until now the trio had been in daily contact .
In their last message they said that food shortages were acute and that the fighting had taken a turn for the worse .
The ICRC 's spokeswoman in Colombo , Sarasi Wijeratne , told the BBC that a ship which had been waiting off the rebel - held zone to deliver essential supplies and evacuate sick and wounded people was returning to the eastern town of Trincomalee .
" The prevailing ground situation has prevented aid workers on board a relief vessel to off - load supplies and to evacuate sick and injured people from the conflict zone , " she said .
" The vessel is expected to return to Mullivaikal area tomorrow . "
The last evacuation was on Saturday .
Ms Wijeratne said supplies had been getting through but they were not enough to meet people 's basic needs .
Thurairaja Varatharajah , a health official at the hospital , told the BBC Sinhala service it had been hit by a single mortar shell .
More than 80 people were injured , and he expected the death toll to rise because many of the injured had bad head and stomach wounds , he added .
However , military sources have suggested that doctors in the zone may be being forced to give statements at gunpoint by rebels .

More from BBC World Service Rebel spokesman Seevaratnam Puleedevan told the AP news agency that civilians were fleeing in all directions .
" There 's no place to seek shelter or protect themselves , " he said .
The Sri Lankan military has meanwhile blamed civilian deaths on the Tigers , saying they are using people as human shields .
Defence ministry spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella told the BBC he knew nothing of the incident but that the military was not deploying heavy weaponry in civilian areas .
The UN estimates that about 50,000 civilians are trapped by the conflict , in a three - sq - km strip of land .
Most of this area has been designated by the government as a safe zone which will not be attacked by air or by heavy weapons .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Monday he was appalled by the killings and called for an immediate halt to the fighting .
Diplomats from the UK , France and Austria said the Security Council should address the crisis , while the US said it was " deeply concerned " by the crisis .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war .

A few pieces of important data from the Clinton administration are missing after the National Archives apparently lost a computer hard drive .
What 's missing ?
Oh , just some Secret Service and White House operating procedures .
And some Social Security numbers and addresses -- including the SSN of one of former VP Al Gore 's three daughters .
And some logs of White House events , social gatherings and political records .
In all , that little missing hard drive contains about one terabyte of data -- the equivalent amount of information that can be found in millions of books , according to the Washington Post .
Oops .
The Post reported that the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into the missing data .
It vanished from the Archives facility in College Park between October and March , according to the Post .
[ An ] aide , who was not authorized to be quoted by name , said the hard drive was left on a shelf and unused for an uncertain period of time .
Later , the drive was found to be missing .
Committee staff members were told that there is a backup copy of all the information but that Archives officials have only just begun to learn what was on the drive .
[ Rep. Edolphus Towns ( D - N.Y. ) , ] said he would have the FBI and inspector general brief committee members so they can " begin to understand the magnitude of the security breach and all of the steps being taken to recover the lost information . "
You know things are bad when one official calls the breach in security both " outrageous " and " egregious " in back - to - back sentences in the Post .
So who has the hard drive ?
About 100 " badge - holders " had access to the area where it was last seen .
Janitors , visitors , interns and others also pass through the area .
Oh , and it's also a place where Archives workers pass through on their way to the bathroom , according to the Post .
So , you know , pretty much anyone .
Earth Day is this Wednesday , and all things “ green ” will be celebrated .
But it ’s worth asking : how environmentally friendly are “ green ” products , really ?
Consider , for example , this paragon of eco-virtue : the stainless steel water bottle that lets us hydrate without discarding endless plastic bottles .
Using a method called life cycle assessment , we have evaluated the environmental and health impact of a stainless steel thermos — from the extraction and processing of its ingredients , to its manufacture , distribution , use and final disposal .
There were some surprises .
What we think of as “ green ” turns out to be less so ( and , yes , sometimes more so ) than we assume .
So , is stainless steel really better than plastic ?
One stainless steel bottle is obviously much worse than one plastic bottle .
Producing that 300 - gram stainless steel bottle requires seven times as much fossil fuel , releases 14 times more greenhouse gases , demands the extraction of hundreds of times more metal resources and causes hundreds of times more toxic risk to people and ecosystems than making a 32 - gram plastic bottle .
If you ’re planning to take only one drink in your life , buy plastic .
But chances are buying that stainless steel bottle will prevent you from using and then throwing away countless plastic bottles .
And think of the harm done to the environment by making more and more plastic — the electricity needed to form polyethylene terephthalate resin into bottles , the fossils fuels burned to produce this electricity , the energy used and emissions released from mining the coal and converting crude oil to fuel , and on and on .
What it comes down to is this : if your stainless steel bottle takes the place of 50 plastic bottles , the climate is better off , and if it gets used 500 times , it beats plastic in all the environment - impact categories studied in a life cycle assessment .
It ’s important to keep in mind that the 21st century has inherited from the 20th ( and sometimes the 19th ) manufacturing processes and industrial chemicals that were developed when no one knew — or cared that much — about environmental damage .
But even though climate change demands urgent ecological action , this crisis also offers vast entrepreneurial opportunities ; we need to re-invent everything with an eye to protecting the planet .
Then again , some old solutions we should n’t discount .
Before stainless steel thermoses , before bottled water , we already had an eco-friendly method of getting water : drinking fountains .
We all know that gas prices are rising , but as you attempt to understand why they are rising , your answer depends on which “ News ” you read .
This is an excerpt from CNNMoney.com :
Gas prices on the rise ( CNN ) —
Gas prices nationwide jumped a bit over the past two weeks , according to a survey published Sunday .
January 25 , 2009
A gallon of self - serve regular cost , on average , $ 1.86 , said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the Lundberg Survey .
That ’s a rise of nearly 8 cents over the past two weeks .
Moderately higher crude oil prices contributed to the price increase , she said .
MORE
CNN ’s reporting on this issue seems to choose what the oil companies and Wall Street want the public to believe , however , if you bother to read MSNBC - which published an in - depth answer to rising gas prices seems to undermine CNN - by attempting to reveal the whole story rather than publishing half - truths on a matter that is far more complex than “ rising crude prices ” :
Crude oil falls as recession batters U.S. Corporate results keep investors pessimistic about demand Feb.
6 , 2009 NEW YORK - Oil prices sank below $ 41 a barrel Friday as the government reported that U.S. employers slashed more than a half million jobs last month , the most in 35 years .
Light , sweet crude for March delivery dropped a dollar to settle at $ 40.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Retail gas prices rose to almost $ 2 a gallon as refineries took units temporarily off - line for seasonal maintenance .
Oil traders see layoffs as an instant drag on oil demand .
People have less need for gasoline when they no longer have a daily commute .
They also stop buying toys , nonstick pans , raincoats and millions of other products that are made with petroleum .
“ You get the sense the market wants to go higher , ” he said .
“ Those who sell at $ 40 , they ’re going to get tired of doing that .
Eventually they ’re going to hop on board and push this thing to $ 50 . ” MUCH MORE
To be fair to CNN , I do take note that their article was published on January the 25th , and MSNBC published their story , compliments of the Associated Press , on February the 6th - so there is a thirteen day difference between the publication of both articles ; BUT , there are three facts that did not show - up in the CNN article that were still factors in rising gas prices !
As MSNBC pointed out :
Oil traders see layoffs as an instant drag on oil demand .
People have less need for gasoline when they no longer have a daily commute .
They also stop buying toys , nonstick pans , raincoats and millions of other products that are made with petroleum .

Worse : he launches verbal assault after assault on the men and women who succeeded him .
He accuses them of risking the lives of Americans , of making America less safe , and openly brags that his violation of the Geneva Conventions worked .
Not content with writing his memoirs and letting history judge , he flails around like some prize fish , flapping on the deck of the boat , opening and shutting his mouth as his career expires .
And as history slowly accepts that this man disgraced his office more profoundly than any before him , as it sinks in that this man did not merely make mistakes , as all flawed politicians do , but committed war crimes , with pre-meditation and elaborate subterfuge , he slowly realizes what 's happening to him .
He can feel it .
And so he resists the way he always resists - by lashing out , attacking , smearing , snearing , and grabbing every inch of the limelight he can .
Those of us who want him to face real accountability should , of course , welcome all this .
Cheney does not seem to understand that he is incriminating himself further with every interview , every time he adjusts his story , every time he moves from torture as a " no- brainer " to a " last resort " , every time he assaults yet another person who knows too much about him and what he did .
But does Cheney really believe that in a battle for the judgment of the American people , and for history , he will win a brawl with Colin Powell , with a man who is actually on record early on warning of the dire consequences of weakening or abandoning the Geneva Conventions ?
Cheney wants a war with him ?
Now ?
Judged in the theater of public opinion - outside the Hannity - Limbaugh - Coulter ghetto ?
They really do want to commit suicide , do n't they ?
Well , I 'm not in a rush to stop them .

Hoyer questions Pelosi's CIA charge UPDATED
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) is n't exactly rushing to support Nancy Pelosi 's claim she was " misled " by CIA officials during a 2002 intel briefing on waterboarding .
Hoyer -- a polished floor debater -- was drawn into an extended exchange with Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) on the issue this afternoon and said he did n't have enough information on the briefings to draw a conclusion -- and was n't inclined to doubt the CIA anyway .
Still , Hoyer said he regarded the entire matter as a distraction that the GOP was using to take attention off of their support of questionable interrogation procedures .
[ Rush transcript , via a GOP staffer ] :
Rep. Cantor : “ I share with the gentleman the notion we need to follow the law .
But if there is somehow a belief , and I 'd ask the gentleman whether he shares this belief , that somehow the CIA or others have intentionally misled this body , because that seems to be some concern that has been raised today ?
And I yield . ”
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer : “ I have no idea of that , do n't have a belief of that nature because I have no basis on which to base such a belief .
And I certainly hope that 's not the case .
I do n't draw that conclusion .
What I say to the gentleman once again is that to a degree that is a distraction .
It is not irrelevant , but it is a distraction from the central point .
And I will tell my friend that I think there is far too much discussion about what was said as opposed to what was done .
The truth commission I think has a responsibility or whatever we call a commission that would look at this issue , not so much for what was done but to ensure that what we do going forward is legal , consistent with our values , consistent with our morals , and consistent as the gentleman points out with protecting our nation and our people .
In my view , we have a responsibility to do all of those .
And in my view , we can do all of those .
They are not inconsistent with one another .
And that is what I think we ought to be looking at as we look at what happened so that what happens in the future , because certainly this nation is going to be under threat now and in the future .
And I think it 's very important .
I frankly think that upholding our values is consistent with also protecting our security . ”
UPDATE : Hoyer was in a more supportive mood during an appearance on MSNBC 's ED Schultz later in the day , telling the blue - collar lefty :
Said Hoyer : “ I believe the Speaker . … . She was n’t in that briefing .
But not withstanding that , I believe the speaker ’s assertions when she says them . …
What she knew or when she knew it -- that ’s a stalking horse .
That ’s a distraction .
We know things were done .
We know that the law – we believe – certainly – was broken , and we ought to find out whether the law was broken . …
I think she ’s accurate when she says what she said . ”

Men do n't have " guilty pleasures . "
We own , nay , celebrate what 's bad for us .
Our obsessions are points of pride , not shame .
Some men feel no shame in gobbling three slices of pizza at once if they want to .
You 'll never see a guy wolf down a small mountain of waffles with a side of bacon and squeal , " Oh my gosh , I can't believe I ate everything !
I 'm so ashamed . "
We will shamelessly sit in a nest of pizza crusts playing video games for endless hours .
Unabashed tears will crawl out of the corners of eyes when the hometown team chokes at the last minute .
Beer will be quaffed , their caloric potency mocked .
These are the things that make life worth living .
Feeling bad about feeling good , even if the good is short - term , is for puritan chumps .
If I could , I 'd go out everywhere in my sweat pants .
Of course , overindulging has its prices .
Sloth and gluttony are venial sins for a reason .
But the whole idea of " guilty pleasures " is something that is lady - specific .
Women feel shame over even tiny little hedonistic infractions .
I dated a woman once who was very much my type -- hot nerd -- who was deeply embarrassed over her celebrity trash magazine addiction .
She actually tried to hide her US Weekly 's from prying , judgmental eyes .
Eventually , I staged an intervention that went a little like this : " Please , woman , own your love of snickering over pictures of Hollywood stretch marks ! "
This is not to say men are n't susceptible to social pressures , and masculine stereotypes .
There are things that , while not " guilty pleasures , " are ... minor vices .
Things we are into that contradict standard male operating procedure .
After all , one cannot live on bacon and beer alone .
But a lot of guys find themselves infatuated with hobbies , media , and creature comforts that do n't really fit the lumberjack mold .
I 'll wager many ladies are the quiet guardians of their man 's not - really - secret , but not - really - public , quirks .
I am not ashamed of anything .
This is why I will admit to the following minor vices , and in the process , teach women that they can be loud and proud when it comes to the hours spent rehearsing pucker faces in front of the mirror .
Boldly rock your " guilty pleasures . "
Bubble baths
Anyone got a problem with that ?
I love bath salts , bubbles , fizzy stuff that promises to magically transform your bathtub into a sauna .
The whole kit and caboodle .
There is nothing I love more than a good , frou - frou soak .
Heck , maybe I 'll light a votive candle too .
Quiche
I ate it this past weekend , in fact .
That 's right .
I shoveled French egg pie into my mouth .
Yes , quiche , a food that sounds like an inappropriate bodily sound .
It was delicious .
It had spinach in it , and I washed it down with sparkling water .
Sure , I could have eaten something drenched in cheese , or deep - fried .
But the moment called for something sensible , delicate , and ... flaky , okay ?
Quiche is awesome .
Reality TV shows about shallow women
A recent minor vice has actually entered my life .
Every Tuesday , I eat Chinese food and watch " The Real Housewives of New York . "
Have you seen this show ?
It 's like an open invitation to hate on women .
Is this really popular female wish fulfillment ?
All that chattering , and glittering ?
They are a bunch of bedazzled banshees that suddenly make me understand why the French guillotined all the rich aristocrats !
Sigh .
While I 'm not overly susceptible to gender norms , I think I need to go to the comic book store , or hit the shooting range .
Oh , forget it .
See you next week , my beloved " Real Housewives . "

… and the case against bzip2
Compression is with us all the time .
I want to talk about general - purpose lossless compression here .
There is a lot of agonizing over compression ratios : the size of output for various sizes of input .
For some situations , this is of course the single most important factor .
For instance , if you ’re Linus Torvalds putting your code out there for millions of people to download , the benefit of saving even a few percent of file size is well worth the cost of perhaps 50 % worse compression performance .
He compresses a source tarball once a month maybe , and we are all downloading it thousands of times a day .
On the other hand , when you ’re doing backups , the calculation is different .
Your storage media costs money , but so does your CPU .
If you have a large photo collection or edit digital video , you may create 50 GB of new data in a day .
If you use a compression algorithm that ’s too slow , your backup for one day may not complete before your backup for the next day starts .
This is even more significant a problem when you consider enterprises backing up terabytes of data each day .
So I want to think of compression both in terms of resulting size and performance .
Onward …
Starting Point
I started by looking at the practical compression test , which has some very useful charts .
He has charted savings vs. runtime for a number of different compressors , and with the range of different settings for each .
If you look at his first chart , you ’ll notice several interesting things :
gzip performance flattens at about - 5 or - 6 , right where the manpage tells us it will , and in line with its defaults .
7za - 2 ( the LZMA algorithm used in 7 - Zip and p7zip ) is both faster and smaller than any possible bzip2 combination .
7za - 3 gets much slower .
bzip2 ’s performance is more tightly clustered than the others , both in terms of speed and space .
bzip2 - 3 is about the same speed as - 1 , but gains some space .
All this was very interesting , but had one limitation : it applied only to the gimp source tree , which is something of a best - case scenario for compression tools .
A 6GB Test
I wanted to try something a bit more interesting .
I made an uncompressed tar file of / usr on my workstation , which comes to 6GB of data .
My /usr contains highly compressible data such as header files and source code , ELF binaries and libraries , already - compressed documentation files , small icons , and the like .
It is a large , real - world mix of data .
In fact , every compression comparison I saw was using data sets less than 1GB in size — hardly representative of backup workloads .
Let ’s start with the numbers :
Tool MB saved Space vs. gzip Time vs. gzip Cost gzip 3398 100.00 % 100.00 % 0.15 bzip2 3590 92.91 % 333.05 % 0.48 pbzip2 3587 92.99 % 183.77 % 0.26 lzma - 1 3641 91.01 % 195.58 % 0.28 lzma - 2 3783 85.76 % 273.83 % 0.37
In the “ MB saved ” column , higher numbers are better ; in all other columns , lower numbers are better .
I ’m using clock seconds here on a dual - core machine .
The cost column is clock seconds per MB saved .
What does this tell us ?
bzip2 can do roughly 7 % better than gzip , at a cost of a compression time more than 3 times as long .
lzma - 1 compresses better than bzip2 - 9 in less than twice the time of gzip .
That is , it is significantly faster and marginally smaller than bzip2 .
lzma - 2 is significantly smaller and still somewhat faster than bzip2 .
pbzip2 achieves better wall clock performance , though not better CPU time performance , than bzip2 — though even then , it is only marginally better than lzma - 1 on a dual - core machine .
Some Pretty Charts
First , let ’s see how the time vs. size numbers look :
Like the other charts , the best area is the lower left , and worst is upper right .
It ’s clear we have two outliers : gzip and bzip2 .
And a cluster of pretty similar performers .
This view somewhat magnifies the differences , though .
Let ’s add cat to the mix :
And finally , look at the cost :
Conclusions
First off , the difference in time is far larger than the difference in space .
We ’re talking a difference of 15 % at the most in terms of space , but orders of magnitude for time .
I think this pretty definitively is a death knell for bzip2 .
lzma - 1 can achieve better compression in significantly less time , and lzma - 2 can achieve significantly better compression in a little less time .
pbzip2 can help even that out in terms of clock time on multicore machines , but 7 za already has a parallel LZMA implementation , and it seems only a matter of time before / usr / bin / lzma gets it too .
Also , if I were to chart CPU time , the numbers would be even less kind to pbzip2 than to bzip2 .
bzip2 does have some interesting properties , such as resetting everything every 900K , which could provide marginally better safety than any other compressor here — though I do n’t know if lzma provides similar properties , or could .
I think a strong argument remains that gzip is most suitable for backups in the general case .
lzma - 1 makes a good contender when space is at more of a premium .
bzip2 does n’t seem to make a good contender at all now that we have lzma .
I have also made my spreadsheet ( OpenOffice format ) containing the raw numbers and charts available for those interested .
Update
Part 2 of this story is now available , which considers more compression tools , and looks at performance compressing files individually rather than the large tar file .

For the unity of Canadian and American workers
Statement of D’Artagnan Collier and SEP candidate for Detroit mayor
26 May 2009
D’Artagnan Collier distributed this statement to striking city workers in Windsor , Ontario .
As the Socialist Equality Party ’s candidate for mayor of Detroit and a city worker myself , I want to express my solidarity and support for your struggle here in Windsor .
Workers on both sides of the border are facing a concerted attack on our jobs , wages and benefits — and we must stand together in a common fight .
The names of the political parties might be different — in the US , it is the Democrats and Republicans , in Canada , the Conservatives , Liberals and New Democratic Party — but the story is the same .
They all claim there is “ no money ” to pay living wages and benefits to workers or to fund vitally needed social programs .
Yet , these very same politicians have found unlimited resources to bail out the Wall Street and Bay Street bankers and fund the criminal wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In Detroit , the newly elected mayor , wealthy businessman David Bing , is determined to sell off public assets , privatize services and end what he calls the “ entitlement mentality ” of city workers .
Earlier this week , the “ emergency financial manager ” of the Detroit schools announced 900 layoffs , just weeks after outlining plans to close 50 schools over the next two years .
Far from representing a “ change , ” the Obama administration has spearheaded the attack on the working class .
While guaranteeing the fortunes of the financial speculators responsible for the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , the Democratic president is demanding that auto workers accept poverty - level wages and sweatshop conditions , in order to make the auto industry profitable for Wall Street .
In Canada , the government and the employers are exploiting the economic crisis to rollback the living standards of auto workers and other workers .
In Windsor , you are engaged in a bitter six - week strike against demands for a wage freeze , the gutting of pension benefits and the establishment of a two - tier system for new hires .
In the early struggles against the auto corporations , workers on both sides of the Detroit River joined in a common struggle .
In the 1980s , however , the United Auto Workers broke up into two nationally based organizations , with each committed to defend the profits of their “ own ” bosses by voluntarily lowering labor costs .
On this basis , the UAW and CAW pit US and Canadian workers against each other — with devastating consequences .
It is time for workers to reject all forms of economic nationalism .
As the global scope of the economic crisis makes clear , the entire world economy is more closely linked together than ever before — making it all the more imperative that workers bind together in united struggle to defend jobs and living standards .
In both countries , this means rejecting the bankruptcy politics of the unions , which tie workers to the capitalist system and the bought - and - paid - for big business parties , including the New Democratic Party .
I am running in the elections to champion the building of a new mass political party of the working class , the Socialist Equality Party , to fight for the reorganization of economic and political life to meet the needs of working people , not the financial elite .
The working class is not responsible for the breakdown of the capitalist system and must not be made to pay for it .
I call for the nationalization of the banks and large industries under the democratic control of the working class .
On this basis , the vast wealth created by workers can be used to end social inequality and guarantee a decent paying job , health care , housing and education for all .
I urge you to read our web site , the World Socialist Web Site , and help build our sister party here in Canada .
Last month an e-mail message washed up at the offices of The Cook Islands News in the South Pacific .
It was a request to place a half - page advertisement in the newspaper , which has a circulation of 2,500 .
The cost was $ 370 .
“ We were amazed  it came from out of nowhere , ” the newspaper ’s editor , John Woods , said in a telephone interview .
“ We are very skeptical of ads like that . ”
Even more surprising was who was paying for it : Google .
Google , the online giant , had been sued in federal court by a large group of authors and publishers who claimed that its plan to scan all the books in the world violated their copyrights .
As part of the class - action settlement , Google will pay $ 125 million to create a system under which customers will be charged for reading a copyrighted book , with the copyright holder and Google both taking percentages ; copyright holders will also receive a flat fee for the initial scanning , and can opt out of the whole system if they wish .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A former head of the CIA slammed President Obama on Sunday for releasing four Bush - era memos , saying the new president has compromised national security .
Former CIA chief Michael Hayden said Sunday it is wrong to make interrogation methods public .
Michael Hayden , who served as former President Bush 's last CIA director from 2006 to 2009 , said releasing the memos outlining terror interrogation methods emboldened terrorist groups such as al Qaeda .
" What we have described for our enemies in the midst of a war are the outer limits that any American would ever go to in terms of interrogating an al Qaeda terrorist .
That 's very valuable information , " Hayden said during an appearance on " Fox News Sunday . "
" By taking [ certain ] techniques off the table , we have made it more difficult -- in a whole host of circumstances I can imagine -- for CIA officers to defend the nation , " he said .
But Sens. Claire McCaskill , D- Missouri , and Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , said certain techniques should not have been allowed in the first place .
McCaskill called them " a great recruitment tool for those who want to do harm to our country . "
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel dismissed Hayden 's assertion that releasing the memos had undermined U.S. intelligence efforts by giving al Qaeda critical new information .
" One of the reasons the president was willing to let this information out was that already the information was out , " he said on ABC's " This Week . "
" Go get the New York Review of Books .
It 's there . "
Hayden said he called several senior White House officials to express his opposition before the president released the documents .
Hayden also noted that four previous CIA directors , as well as current agency director Leon Panetta , opposed the release .
The memos said , among other things , that interrogation tactics such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain .
Obama prohibited the use of so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " such as waterboarding shortly after taking office in January .
Such techniques " undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer , " he said Thursday , when the White House released the memos .
The Obama administration has said it wo n't pursue charges against CIA officers who used those tactics against prisoners in their custody .
And Emanuel told ABC that the people who crafted the policy " should not be prosecuted either . "
But in a sharply worded editorial Sunday , The New York Times called for the impeachment of Jay Bybee , a federal appeals court judge who was a Justice Department official when he wrote one of the memos that authorized those techniques .
" These memos make it clear that Mr. Bybee is unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the Constitution , " the newspaper editorialized .
The memos " were written to provide legal immunity for acts that are clearly illegal , immoral and a violation of this country 's most basic values , " it stated .
Asked about that call on " Fox News Sunday , " McCaskill said : " I think we have to look at it . "
McCaskill , a member of the Senate 's standing investigative subcommittee , said the Obama administration made the right decision by agreeing not to prosecute intelligence officers .
But she added : " A lawyer that 's responsible for this kind of advice that clearly went too far in terms of stretching what our law is -- it worries me that he 's sitting on the federal bench right now . "
Graham , however , said seeking to punish lawyers who advised the Bush administration " is a very bad precedent . "
" I think it would be disaster to go back and try to prosecute a lawyer for giving legal advice that you disagreed with to a former president , " said Graham , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a lawyer in the Air Force reserve .
Hayden said the administration 's decision to release the Bush administration memos will make CIA officials less willing to engage in interrogation tactics now sanctioned by the federal government .
" The basic foundation of the legitimacy of the agency 's action has shifted from some durability of law to a product of the American political process .
That puts agency officers in a horrible position , " he said .
" The really dangerous effect of this [ decision ] is that you 'll have agency officers stepping back from the kinds of things that the nation expects them to do .
...
You 're going to have this agency -- on the front line of defending you in this current war -- playing back from the line , " he said .
Hayden also said that , contrary to the assertions of many critics , the interrogation techniques in question had forced suspected terrorists to reveal valuable information and made the country safer .
He predicted that the release of the memos would be " just the beginning . "
" There will be more revelations , more commissions , there will be more investigations , " Hayden said .
McCaskill told " Fox News Sunday " that the United States will be better off in the long run by clearly prohibiting interrogation techniques such as waterboarding .
And Graham said that while he was concerned that the release of the memos was a " huge tactical and strategic mistake done for political reasons , " the decision to allow certain enhanced interrogation techniques was a mistake as well .
Graham added that he always thought waterboarding " was a procedure that would come back to haunt the country , and quite frankly it has . "

I still remember my first exposure to teletext .
Â
It would have been the early eighties when I went to visit one of my uncles .
Â
He had just got a new TV ( which he rented from Radio Rentals ) and it made our TV at home look old fashioned .
Â Whereas our TV had big push buttons to change channels and was encased in wood , my uncles new telly was made of plastic and came with a remote control .
This was the first time I had ever seen a remote control , and I was initially fascinated how this little box , with no wire connecting it to the TV , could switch the channels .
Â Impressed , my jaw hit the ground when my uncle pressed one of the other buttons and BBC1 was replaced by a page of text with the magical sounding word CEEFAX written in big yellow letters across the top .
Ten minutes later I had learned how this amazing new feature worked , and I spent the rest of that evening glued to the TV exploring all the various pages available .
Â
My excitement grew when I realised that flicking the TV over to ITV gave me a whole new set of pages called ORACLE to explore .
Â
When it became time to go home , I did n’t want to leave , and spent most of the journey home asking Mum and Dad if we could get a TV with teletext .
Teletext services were originally invented back in the early 1970 ’s though , when the TV companies were looking to find a way to provide written captions for the hard of hearing .
Â
The BBC were first to the market with the CEEFAX service ( see facts – geddit ) but ITV followed soon after with their ORACLE offering ( which was an acronym for the rather long winded and technical sounding nameÂ Optional Reception of Announcements by Coded Line Electronics ) .
Â
It was n’t until the 1980 ’s though that enough people had TV sets capable of displaying the teletext pages that things really took off .
So how does teletext work then ?
Â
Well , in those days the teletext information was sent as part of the TV signal during the space between frames .
Â Between each frame of a television picture there is a period called the vertical blanking period .
Â
This time is needed for the TV set to return the electron beam gun inside it back to the top left of the screen .
Â During this time a page of information could be encoded and sent , and the TV set could decode and display it .
Since only a small amount of data could be sent in the vertical blanking period this was why you had to sit and wait for your chosen page to appear , as all pages were sent in a repeating loop one after another , which could be seen by the page number display at the top of the screen that kept incrementing and then starting again .
When Channel 4 started broadcasting they launched their own service called 4 - Tel , and this quickly became a favourite with kids .
Â CEEFAX always had a few kids pages but 4 - Tel had loads more , with puzzles , games , news and best of all a cartoon strip .
Â
It may have been crudely drawn given the graphical capabilities of teletext , but the adventures of 4 - T the dog became compulsive viewing .
Â 4 - Tel also had a rather good videogames magazine called Digitiser , which was written in quite an entertaining style , and was n’t afraid to tell you when a new game was rubbish !
The windows leak at the Mattapan Community Health Center , which serves thousands of people in one of Boston 's most impoverished neighborhoods .
The foundation of Freedom House in Dorchester is cracked so badly that water pours in and flows down a hallway when it rains .
The elevator breaks once a month at Family Service of Greater Boston in Jamaica Plain , sometimes stranding the center 's clients .
But while the state is laying plans to spend billions of federal dollars on highways and other infrastructure around the state , nothing so far has been set aside to fix up community centers in Boston that survive on a shoestring and are crucial to strengthening urban neighborhoods .
There are few provisions of the federal legislation that specifically provide funds for such nonprofits , forcing groups to find creative ways to compete for the funding .
" We 're trying to stay on the governor 's case , " said Hubie Jones , an activist who chairs a group advocating for federal stimulus money for nonprofits .
Jones recently submitted a list of projects , totaling $ 5.4 million , to fix up the facilities of five neighborhood nonprofit groups serving areas around Roxbury , North Dorchester , and Mattapan .
" I have no confidence that the governor even knows about this request and what we 've been pursuing , " Jones said .
" This is just a fly on the hide of this whole thing . "
Representatives of the nonprofit groups , who have met with administration officials - including Patrick 's stimulus czar , Jeffrey Simon - say the organizations are vital to the community during a down economy , yet have serious physical infrastructure needs that jeopardize the delivery of services .
The lobbying by community activists also spotlights the delicate relationship between the state 's first black governor and city neighborhoods with large numbers of African - Americans .
While Patrick administration officials declined to discuss the issue , they said the governor 's office has agreed to work with the nonprofits , with no guarantees .
" We are working to see which of the recovery funds could be used for such worthwhile projects , as long as they fulfill the governor 's primary recovery goal of job creation , " Simon , who declined a request for an interview , said in a statement .
The state is planning to use several billion federal dollars to pay for items ranging from basic sidewalk repairs to bridge construction .
The state will get $ 760 million during the first wave of stimulus spending to dedicate to roads , bridges , and public transit .
The Patrick administration announced last week the first eight road resurfacing and traffic sign replacement projects , totaling about $ 30 million and stretching across Massachusetts .
Meanwhile , Freedom House in Dorchester - which offers after - school programs , discussion groups , and provides meeting space for senior groups and churches - is asking for $ 68,329 to repair the building 's foundation and prevent leaks .
The water seeps into the girl 's bathroom , flows down the hallway , and into the auditorium .
" The water just pours in ; it 's awful , " said Gail Snowden , the organization 's chief executive officer .
" It 's small dollars , big impact , " she added .
" Our auditorium is used by students .
We have a church group that 's in here on Sundays and a senior group that meets twice a week .
The ripple impact of the money supporting Freedom House is going to touch 1,000 people or more . "
At Family Service of Greater Boston , which is asking for $ 800,000 , the only elevator in the five - story building requires frequent repairs and breaks down once or twice a month .
" It immediately cuts back on our handicapped accessibility , " said Sam Solomon , the center 's director of development .
" Our employees can take the stairs , but it is a problem when we have someone in the building who is n't able to walk up the stairs . "
It is unclear what type of funds Patrick could distribute to the nonprofit groups .
Federal legislation provides funding for energy conservation and weatherization projects , which could be used for some of the infrastructure improvements .
There are also community development block grants , which could be utilized for some of the nonprofits .
" Everyone is trying to figure out how to access these funds in an appropriate way , " said Tim Delaney , president of the National Council of Nonprofits in Washington .
" This is a common dilemma right now , as people try to learn what this complex package is , what the limitations are , what the possibilities might be . "
Jones said he met last month with Simon and Doug Rubin , the governor 's chief of staff .
" All they 've said is , ' We 're going to try to be helpful , ' " Jones said .
" I can't take that to the bank .
I do n't think this is on their high order of priorities right now .
And I think it has to be . "

DAVIS COUNTY -- A Utah Highway Patrol mannequin featured prominently on a DUI enforcement billboard is missing something : his clothes .
The billboard along northbound I - 15 near the Salt Lake / Davis County line reads , " I see you Mr. Drunk Driver . "
The Utah Highway Patrol says the mannequin trooper is a popular guy .
Somebody got up on the billboard late Sunday and ripped his clothes off .
Sgt. Ted Tingey said , " Pretty much , I do n't know whether it was a practical joke , or they were holding a grudge . "
Tingey said the person or persons who did this took the pants , the shirt and the hat .
It would have been hard to do since the clothes were super - glued on .
The mannequin is expected to be back this weekend , fully dressed .
The mannequin and his message are part of a new campaign to let everyone know troopers are on the lookout for drunk drivers , and if they catch you , they 'll arrest you .
The billboard will remain in place until July .

Researchers in Sweden have more than doubled the efficiency of a dye - based solar energy device .
The team say their system could be combined with more traditional Gr? tzel - type dye - sensitised cells to build doubly - active solar cells much more efficient than those currently available .
Dye - sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) were invented by Michael Gr?tzel and Brian O’Regan at the Federal Polytechnique at Lausanne , Switzerland , in 1991 , and are a potential alternative to traditional silicon cells .
Typically , DSSCs employ a photo - active anode , where light energy is harvested by a dye which passes electrons to an n - type semiconductor ( such as TiO2 ) coating the anode .
More recently , researchers have introduced the reverse type of solar cell , where dyes interact with p-type semiconductors ( such as NiO ) at a light - harvesting cathode .
1
Licheng Sun and Anders Hagfeldt at the Royal Institute of Technology at Stockholm , Sweden , have now significantly improved the performance of the p-type DSSC by introducing a series of modifications .
The team modified the structure of the polyaromatic dye to improve the charge separation , ensuring that the light - excited electron and the hole it leaves behind both travel around the electric circuit rather then directly recombining .
The thickness of the NiO layer and the electrolyte composition were also refined .
2
With these improvements , Sun says , the incident photon to current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) of these devices has reached above 44 per cent , more than double the efficiency of previous p-type photocathodes .
The next big step would be to combine the photoactive anode with the photoactive cathode to make a tandem solar cell , Sun adds .
DSSC inventor Gr? tzel praised the new work .
’ The results reported are certainly extraordinary in as much as the authors have for the first time achieved a very efficient sensitization of a p - type semiconductor oxide , ’ he told Chemistry World .
’ This paper sets the stage for realising tandem cells , which will be particularly easy to produce as they require only the replacement of the cathode in the normal DSSC by the new photo - cathode .
As a result of this new development we can expect a very significant increase in the conversion efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells . ’

The Goals of Scala 's Design
A Conversation with Martin Odersky , Part II
by Bill Venners and Frank Sommers
May 11 , 2009

Summary
Martin Odersky talks with Frank Sommers and Bill Venners about the compromises and most important goals in Scala 's design , its object - oriented innovations , and what 's in it for you .
Scala is an emerging general - purpose , type - safe language for the Java Platform that combines object - oriented and functional programming .
It is the brainchild of Martin Odersky , a professor at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) .
In this multi-part interview series , Artima 's Frank Sommers and Bill Venners discuss Scala with Martin Odersky .
In Part I , The Origins of Scala , Odersky gives a bit of the history that led to the creation of Scala .
In this installment , Odersky discusses the compromises , goals , innovations , and benefits of Scala 's design .
Design compromises in Scala
Frank Sommers :
You mentioned earlier that you wanted to create a language that would exist in the Java ecosystem and integrate with the Java infrastructure .
In order to do that what sort of compromises to Scala to make it compatible with the Java Platform ?
Martin Odersky :
There were fortunately not very many compromises we had to make .
Or let 's say , it 's debatable whether the compromises we made were altogether a bad thing , or whether they were actually good .
One compromise we had to make was to buy into the model of static overloading in Java .
We might have wanted to experiment with something more radical such as multi-methods , although at the time we did that , the multi-methods designs were not sufficiently explored .
Maybe they are not sufficiently explored even today , such that I 'm not completely sure this would have been a good thing .
It would have been an exciting possibility to explore , but we did n't do it because we wanted to stay compatible with Java .
Another thing , which people sometimes criticize , is that Scala has both traits and classes .
A cleaner design could make do with just traits .
There have been some clean designs that only have traits and give up the notion of classes .
But we did n't do that because we wanted to stay interoperable with Java in both directions .
We wanted to have a way where Java code could easily call Scala code , and traits do n't have a natural mapping back into Java , because they do n't exist in Java .
Thus we picked the class design as it was in Java because we wanted the backwards mapping , so we could easily have interoperability in both directions .
A third one , which is more a library problem than a language problem , really , is that we want to move away from null .
Null is a source of many , many errors .
We could have come out with a language that just disallows null as a possible value of any type , because Scala has a perfectly good replacement called an option type .
But of course a lot of Java libraries return nulls and we have to treat it in some way .
Picking battles in Scala 's design
Bill Venners :
What did you put in Scala for the purpose of making Scala more acceptable to Java programmers ?
For example , something like Java 's use of curly braces , which might make C and C++ programmers feel more at home than if Java had used some other block demarcation scheme .
Martin Odersky :
We did n't really design things in for marketing reasons , but we did want to avoid putting up hurdles — things programmers would find wierd — just because we wanted to be different .
For example , I think curly braces work perfectly well as delimiters , and that 's why I picked them .
We could have insisted on begin / end or something else , but I do n't think it actually works better .
There was one thing that we changed from a more pure initial design .
Initially we had colon- equals for assignment — just as in Pascal , Modula , and Ada — and a single equals sign for equality .
A lot of programming theorists would argue that that 's the right way to do it .
Assignment is not equality , and you should therefore use a different symbol for assignment .
But then I tried it out with some people coming from Java .
The reaction I got was , " Well , this looks like an interesting language .
But why do you write colon - equals ?
What is it ? "
And I explained that its like that in Pascal .
They said , " Now I understand , but I do n't understand why you insist on doing that . "
Then I realized this is not something we wanted to insist on .
We did n't want to say , " We have a better language because we write colon - equals instead of equals for assignment . "
It 's a totally minor point , and people can get used to either approach .
So we decided to not fight convention in these minor things , when there were other places where we did want to make a difference .
Bill Venners :
You did n't use the phrase , " pick your battles , " which I 've heard you say before .
Basically , you felt that the colon - equals was not that important , and there were other things that you did care about battling for .
What are those important things ?
What are the ways in which you really want to convince people to change how they think or program ?
Martin Odersky :
The first thing we cared about was to have as clean an integration of functional and object - oriented programming as possible .
We wanted to have first - class functions in there , function literals , closures .
We also wanted to have the other attributes of functional programming , such as types , generics , pattern matching .
And we wanted to integrate the functional and object - oriented parts in a cleaner way than what we were able to achieve before with the Pizza language .
That was something we deeply cared about from the start .
Later on , we discovered that this was actually very easy , because functional languages have a fixed set of features .
They had been well researched and well proven , so the question was only how to best integrate that in object - oriented programming .
In Pizza we did a clunkier attempt , and in Scala I think we achieved a much smoother integration between the two .
But then we found out that on the object - oriented side there remained lots of things to be developed .
Object - oriented programming , at least when you throw in a static type system , was very much terra incognita .
There was some work we could look at and use , but almost all languages that we found had made a lot of compromises .
So as we developed Scala , we started to discover how we could mix objects together with traits and mixin composition , how we could abstract the self types , how we could use abstract type members , and how we could let this all play together .
Up to then there had been a couple of research languages that addressed a few of these aspects in specialized ways , but there was n't much in terms of mainstream languages that covered the whole spectrum of making it all work .
In the end it turned out that the main innovations in Scala were on the object - oriented side , and that 's also something we really cared about .
Object - oriented innovations in Scala
Bill Venners : Just to clarify , could you give a specific list of what you consider to be the object - oriented innovations in Scala ?
Martin Odersky : First , we wanted to be a pure object - oriented language , where every value is an object , every operation is a method call , and every variable is a member of some object .
So we did n't want statics , but we needed something to replace them , so we created the construct of singleton objects .
But even singleton objects are still global structures .
So the challenge was to use them as little as possible , because when you have a global structure you can't change it anymore .
You ca n't instantiate it .
It 's very hard to test .
It 's very hard to modify it in any way .
The challenge was , therefore , how to enable complicated components to be built and composed without referring to statics or globals .
In particular , we had to deal with recursive dependencies between components .
I have two components , A and B . A uses B , and B uses A . How do I have them discover each other and let them work together ?
The first thing we did was this notion of mixin composition .
Whereas Java just has a single class and a bunch of interfaces that have abstract definitions but no code , Scala has classes and traits , where a trait can contain methods with definitions — i.e. , with bodies — as well as fields .
And then instead of just having the class implement interfaces , we have mixin composition , where we take the definitions of a class and all the traits .
The details of how this is done and exactly what definition actually ends up in the compiled class is tricky and is called linearization .
So we had to define a linearization ordering for Scala , which we did .
But then the problem became how can a mixin discover all the other mixins ?
Say they need some service from another mixin ; how can they specify that ?
The standard object - oriented way to do that is through abstract members , and that works well as long as you 're dealing with methods .
But we also had to deal with variables .
How can mixins find each others ' fields ?
And more importantly , we had to deal with types .
Because we had type nesting from the start , something like inner classes , which is another thing I believe is really important .
If you do mixin composition , how can a trait find out about the inner classes of all the other traits , so they can get at those classes ?
We discovered — it was more of a discovery than a design — that we could do that by having an abstraction over the self type .
So what does " abstraction over the self type " mean ?
Typically in a class , what 's the type of the this reference ?
You would say , " Well , it 's the type of the class . "
That 's what most people say .
There 's actually no compelling reason why it has to always be that .
The type of this could very well be something else .
There 's only one boundary condition , which is that by the time you actually create an instance of a class , then the object you create had better have the same as the idea of what this is that the class has of itself .
It 's exactly what happens when you deal with abstract methods .
You can very well have an abstract method in a class , and you do n't need an implementation .
It 's actually not dangerous , because by the time you create an instance of that class , you will have checked that all abstract methods have an implementation .
So , abstracting over the self type is just a generalization of that , which also lets you deal with fields and , more importantly , with types .
This technique of abstracting over the self - type was very rewarding to discover .
It happened when we built a calculus early on to study these things formally .
It was called the nu-object calculus — νObj , with the Greek letter ν — and we published it in the European Conference on Object - Oriented Programming in 2003 ( ECOOP 2003 ) .
We originally discovered this notion as just a technical trick to make some of the treatment simpler in the calculus .
Only later on did it occur to us that maybe this would be useful for something in the language .
We did n't really know too much yet about what it would be useful for , but we decided to try and put it in .
Since it was our calculus , we decided to do that .
Only later on did we discover that it achieves the fundamental principle of letting a trait declare what it requires of the other traits with which it will be mixed in .
That 's actually something that 's solved nowadays by tools such as Spring , and it 's called dependency injection .
Except that dependency injection typically only works for fields , and maybe for methods , but we have it working for types as well .
Also , in Scala it 's done statically rather than at runtime , and secondly , it gives us type safety for these inner types .
So in a sense we can push it much further than what the tools such as Spring can currently do .
What 's in it for me ?
Bill Venners :
We 're going to get back to dependency injection later in the interview , but other than dependency injection , the only other question we have for this installment of the interview is , why ?
You just talked " abstractly " about self types .
The two things you mentioned as battles you did want to pick were the blending of functional and object - orientation , and the object - oriented innovations .
If I 'm programming in Java for my job , how can these things help me in the real work I 'm doing ?
What kind of concrete benefits would I get ?
Martin Odersky :
One of the challenges we were facing is we wanted to be both functional and object - oriented .
We had very early on the notion that immutable objects would become very , very important .
Nowadays everybody talks about immutable objects , because people think they are a key part of the solution to the concurrency problems caused by multi-core computers .
Everybody says , no matter what you do , you need to try to have as much of your code using immutable objects as possible .
In Scala , we did that very early on .
Five or six years ago , we started to think very hard about immutable objects .
It actually turns out that a lot of the object - oriented field up to then identified objects with mutability .
For them , mutable state and objects were one and the same : mutable state was an essential ingredient of objects .
We had to , in essence , ween objects off of that notion , and there were some things we had to do to make that happen .
For instance , with a standard Java object , you would create a field , essentially a mutable field .
You would then have a constructor that takes parameters and assigns a value into the field .
That 's a notion of mutability that 's built right there into every Java class .
Now , Java has final fields , which are not treated as mutable because they are assigned only once in the constructor .
But you still see the assignment operator .
We wanted to have a much cleaner notion where you do n't have this constructor and assignment thing .
What we ended up doing in Scala is parameterizing classes directly .
You just write a parameter list after your class name , and those are the parameters of the class .
There 's no notion of having a separate mutable field and a constructor that assigns into it , and that actually turned out to cause a number of issues that we had to solve .
One was , what happens if you want to have several constructors ?
We had to define a syntax and rules for that .
You can have auxiliary constructors in addition to your primary constructor .
Another issue was , what if you want to have your parameter visible as a field later on ?
Do you need to create a separate field and assign to it ?
Or is it possible to pass a parameter into a class that immediately becomes available as a field for everyone to see ?
So we had to create syntax for that , which I believe is also new .
And once you do that you have to worry about rules for overriding these things , so we had to address that .
In the end it was quite a lot of novel ground on the object - oriented side to make it all work .
Bill Venners :
And the benefit for me , a Java programmer , is ?
Martin Odersky :
The benefit for you is you can write classes much more concisely in a syntax that does n't look like you were using state .
It is generally easier and more concise to write your classes in Scala , and it becomes far easier if what you want to do is immutable objects .
Because it 's really geared for that .
You can do mutable objects in Scala , as in Java .
They would even be still a little more concise in Scala than in Java , but Scala really shines for immutable objects .
It 's much more natural and concise than what you do in Java .

( CNN ) --
The United States stepped up preparations for a possible swine flu epidemic , and Canada confirmed its first cases on Sunday as researchers worked to determine how contagious the virus could be .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano briefs reporters at the White House Sunday .

Keiji Fukuda , the assistant director - general of the World Health Organization , called the outbreak " serious " on Sunday .
Researchers are still trying to determine how easily the virus is transmitted person to person and it's too early to predict whether there will be a mild or serious pandemic , said Fukuda .
Dr. Alejandro Macias , an epidemiologist and adviser to the federal Ministry of Health , told CNN en Español that the official death toll was at 86 .
Macias said five more deaths in Mexico City had been reported to federal authorities by local authorities in the city .
Earlier , Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 81 deaths were suspected to be from the outbreak and 374 people remained hospitalized .
Another 929 people have been examined and sent home , he said .
" These people have shown up at some medical institution in the country with respiratory symptoms that required to be studied and diagnosed , " he said .
Mexico City closed all of its schools and universities until further notice because of the virus , and troops passed out filter masks outside the National Cathedral on Sunday morning .
No masses were scheduled at the cathedral , but dozens of worshippers put on masks and went inside the church to pray on their own .
Public Health Emergency According to the
At a White House news conference Sunday , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the emergency declaration is standard procedure -- citing that one was declared for the inauguration and for recent flooding .
According to the World Health Organization , a public health emergency is an occurence or imminent threat of illness or health conditions caused by bioterrorism , epidemic or pandemic disease , or highly fatal infectious agents or toxins that pose serious risk to a significant number of people .
At a White House news conference Sunday , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the emergency declaration is standard procedure -- citing that one was declared for the inauguration and for recent flooding .
Mexican Finance Minister Augustin Carstens said Sunday that the World Bank was lending Mexico $ 205 million to deal with the outbreak .
" We are getting an immediate loan of $ 25 million for the requisition of medicines , medical equipment and epidemiological equipment and in addition , $ 180 million to build up strategic operational and institutional capacities to deal with this issue , " he said .
Russia announced it is banning meat imports from Mexico and the southern United States due to the outbreak of swine flu , the Interfax news agency reported .
Passengers arriving in Russia from Mexico and the United States also will be screened for swine flu , the news agency reported , by having their temperatures taken upon arrival .
Canada confirmed six cases of mild illnesses on Sunday , and the United States reported 20 .
Meanwhile , Spain , Israel and New Zealand were investigating possible but unconfirmed cases .
In Washington , the head of the Centers for Disease Control said 20 cases had been confirmed in five U.S. states by noon Sunday .
The largest number of cases was in New York , where the CDC confirmed cases in eight students at a preparatory school in that city , Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday .
Another seven cases have been confirmed in California , two each in Kansas and Texas and one in Ohio , said Dr. Richard Besser , the CDC 's acting director .
Only one person has had to be hospitalized , but Besser said authorities are likely to see " a broader spectrum of disease " in the days ahead .
" Given the reports out of Mexico , I would expect that over time we 're going to see more severe disease in this country , " he said .
Canada 's chief public health officer , Dr. David Butler - Jones said the symptoms seen there -- headaches , fevers , coughs and muscle aches -- were mild by the standards of serious flu cases .
But he added , " It 's still pretty miserable . "
The U.S. government declared a public health emergency -- a step Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said " sounds more severe than really it is . "
" This is standard operating procedure and allows us to free up federal state and local agencies and their resources for prevention and mitigation , " she said .
The outbreak " is of great concern to the White House , " said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , but , he added , " It 's certainly not a time to panic . "
" If you 're sick , stay home , get treatment , go see a doctor , " Gibbs told reporters .
" The government is taking all the steps it needs to and must do to take the precautions to deal with whatever size and scope we may be facing , " he said .
Watch how public health officials grade phases of pandemic alerts »
Meanwhile , the U.S. military issued a worldwide caution , telling its medical personnel to be on the lookout for troops with signs of swine flu and reiterated the need for public health precautions .
The WHO ordered countries worldwide to look out for " unusual " outbreaks of flu following an emergency meeting Saturday .
WHO official Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains .

Do you think we should be worried about swine flu ?
" Any time that there is a virus which changes ... it means perhaps the immunities the human body has built up to dealing with influenza might not be adjusted well enough to dealing with this new virus , " he said .
A spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association , which represents the U.S. airline industry , said the group is taking the matter seriously .
Airport employees and flight crews are on the lookout for any passengers who show signs of illness , and procedures are in place for determining whether ill passengers may fly , Andrus said .
At Los Angeles International Airport , custodians have been instructed to pay additional attention to sanitizing door knobs , handrails and faucets in airport restrooms , according to a statement from Los Angeles World Airports .
" In addition , public education signs with general tips on preventing the spread of illnesses -- that are posted throughout the airport during regular flu season -- are being re-posted , " the statement said .
The H1N1 strain of swine flu is usually associated with pigs .
When the flu spreads person to person , instead of from animals to humans , it can continue to mutate , making it a tougher strain that is harder to treat or fight off .
Symptoms of swine flu include fever , lethargy , lack of appetite , coughing , runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , the CDC said .

In New Zealand , officials said 22 students and three teachers , who returned from a three - week language trip to Mexico , may have been infected with the swine flu virus .
The group remains quarantined at home , and Health Minister Tony Ryall said 10 students tested positive for influenza A -- the general category of strains that includes the H1N1 swine flu .
In Spain , six people , all of whom had recently returned from Mexico , were being isolated in hospitals , the country 's health ministry reported .
And in Israel , doctors are running tests on a man who recently returned from Mexico with light flu symptoms .
In London , a hospital spokesman said a British Airways crew member developed flu - like symptoms during a flight from Mexico City and was tested for swine flu , but the results came back negative .
The flight attendant is back at work , British Airways told CNN .
Watch CBC report on Canadian microbiologists ' concerns »
Concerns over the virus have prompted Canada to issue a travel health notice , saying the public health agency was " tracking clusters of severe respiratory illness with deaths in Mexico . "
But Mexico's Tourist Board said Saturday there are no restrictions on travel to the country .
Watch efforts in Mexico to prevent spread of the virus »
Neither Britain nor the United States have issued any travel warnings or quarantines .
But South Korea said it will test airline passengers arriving from the United States , and Japan will convene a Cabinet meeting Monday to come up with measures to block the entry of the virus into the country .
Katherine Andrus , an attorney for the U.S. Air Transport Association , told CNN that the airline trade association was in regular contact with the CDC .
Andrus said airlines are following their own procedures to watch for ill passengers and crews have standard procedures for dealing with ill passengers .
Any onboard communicable disease incidents must be reported to the CDC , she said .
" This is a time for appropriate precautions but not panic , " Andrus said .

What if I have a property to sell ?
Of course you might also be looking to sell a home in Regina .
Knowing the MLS listings in Regina can make the process of getting your house noticed when it ’s on the market easier .
As much as buying a home can be stressful it can be a lot of work to sell a home as well .
You might be tempted to seek out a cash buyer for a home in the hopes of getting the sale done quickly , but you have to take into account the fact that they will not be paying you full value for the home .
Leaving your house on the market for a while longer while a licensed real estate professional works on selling your home is likely to end up getting you much more money in the long term .
It ’s up to you if you can wait for the sale and deal with the red tape of the selling process and dealing with open houses happening every so often to show the home off to prospective buyers .
Learning about home sales can help you get a grip on the process and allow you to make more informed decisions when it comes to how you sell your home and what price you look to get for it .
LensShopper - Contact lens price comparison
Lensshopper ⤏ Colored contacts
Prices are listed including Shipping and Handling .
Bulk prices may be available when promoted with a " Bulk Price " tag .
Remember that you need a Prescription ( RX ) for Colored Contact Lenses .
Colored contact lenses make it possible to change your eye color at any time you require .
You can start the day with one color and end it with another for a dinner or a party .
Colored contacts are perfect for use if you only want to strengthen the eye color you already have .
This has meant that the market for colored lenses has increased enormously in recent years .
More and more have discovered the possibilities offered by colored lenses and want to test how it feels to go around with new or sometimes different colored lenses .
One of the advantages with colored contact lenses is that even people without visual problems can use colored contacts .
Through the location of a little opening in the lenses the surroundings of the user are not influenced in any way .
Opaque and tinted are the most commonly used types of colored contact lenses .
The opaque lenses do not admit much light through to the original color of the eyes as the colored surface of the lenses cover the entire eye .
These lenses suit those who want to change eye color completely .
Tinted lenses on the other hand allow through a portion of the eyes natural color through the colored surface of the eyes lenses .
These lenses suit those customers who have eyes which are light in color and aspire to strengthening them .
Colored contacts have all of the advantages that ordinary lenses possess .
They are available both as Around the clock lenses and Monthly lenses .
Many of them have inbuilt UV - irradiation protection , which helps to protect against the suns injurious rays .
What are Special Effects Contacts ?
If you want something out of the ordinary when it comes to contact lenses then you might want to have a look at special effect lenses , also known as crazy contacts , novelty contacts or Halloween contact lenses .
Ever dreamed of having pool balls for eyes ?
Or charming those around you with a smiley on your iris ?
Special effects contacts allow you to change your eye color , add flair , cause a stir or just get a laugh .
When using these lenses you ’ll change the appearance of your eyes completely without really affecting the eyes themselves .
Crazy contacts have been commonly used in Hollywood movies but are now just as common and popular to wear during Halloween , at cosplay gatherings and parties , or at any other festivity where an outfit could need a little sprucing up .
One reason for the popularity of these lenses is that everyone can wear them – regardless if you have a vision disorder or not .
However , even if you order them with zero power , to prevent eye irritation and infections , these lenses must also be appropriately fitted by your eye care practitioner and well cared for during their lifetime .
And just as with ordinary contact lenses , novelty contacts require a prescription , according to US regulations .
The entertainment industry is one example where movie and TV cast members wear the most terrifying contacts to boost character credibility .
Another is Halloween that brings people to wear the strangest crazy contacts to create a scary effect .
In this top 10 list we have crawled the web and found the weirdest special effect contact lenses out there .

Lead in the atmosphere has a direct effect on how clouds form , according to research by an international team of scientists .
Led by Dan Cziczo at the US Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , the researchers were trying to determine which particles are most effective at triggering atmospheric ice formation , a question raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2001 report .
’ At first , we were just looking at the composition of the particles that form ice , which predominantly looked to be things like mineral dust , ’ Cziczo explains .
’ But we realised from our mass spec and electron microscopy studies that these included many man-made components , and the biggest single component that correlated with ice formation was lead . ’
Lead was used in experiments in cloud seeding back in the 1940s , but is also released into the atmosphere as a result of other human activities .
Much comes from coal - fired power stations , and while tetraethyl lead is no longer added to petrol for the automotive industry , it is still used in light aviation fuel .
Despite its removal from petrol , a considerable amount of the old lead is still on the earth ’s surface , and blown back into the atmosphere in dust particles .
To find out how these lead particles affect clouds , the researchers collected air from a mountain - top in Colorado , and used it to create synthetic clouds in the lab .
Half of the ice crystals that formed in the synthetic cloud contained lead , similar to the composition of a real cloud sampled above a Swiss mountain .
To discover whether the lead was responsible for the crystal formation , the US team worked with scientists in Germany and Switzerland to create dust particles that were lead - free or one per cent lead by weight - about the level found in the atmosphere .
They found that the air did n’t have to be as cold or heavy with water vapour to form ice crystals around the lead - containing dust particles , findings which suggest that lead reaching the atmosphere through human activities could alter the pattern of rain and snow in a warmer world .
Global climate modeller Ulrike Lohmann from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology put lead into her model at 0 per cent , 1 per cent , 10 per cent and 100 per cent of the dust particles that nucleated the synthetic clouds .
Lohmann ’s models suggested that with lead , clouds form at lower altitudes , and also allow more of the earth ’s heat to escape into space .
’ An increase in lead [ to 100 per cent ] could end up with a global average of 0.8W / m2 of energy going back into space , which would offset global warming to some extent , ’ Cziczo says .
’ But it highlights how complicated the atmospheric climate system is .
Trying to undo what we ’ve done to the climate by geoengineering is a very dangerous option as there are so many subtle feedbacks we do n’t understand .
Before we go tinkering we need to understand things a lot better than we do now . ’

Several views of the Computer Center during the installation of servers .
TechCrunch , and other tech blogs , are reporting that “ Apple is in late stage negotiations to buy Twitter and is hoping to announce it at WWDC in June . “
This has to be one the dumbest rumors we ’ve ever heard .
What in the world would ever prompt Apple to even consider purchasing Twitter ?
And was n’t TechCrunch the same site that reported a few weeks ago that Google was in “ late stage negotiations ” to purchase the Twitter ?
Ridiculous .
Kara Swisher over at AllThingsD has a brief rundown explaining why the above rumor should be ignored and holds no weight ( in case common sense is n’t enough ) .
But despite very serious interest in Twitter by every company that can afford considering such a thing , getting across that late - stage line would require major investors in the microblogging service to be involved and they are not as yet .
In fact , both Twitter Co-founders Evan Williams and Biz Stone are in New York today to attend the 2009 “ Time 100 ″ dinner , which fetes this year ’s influential people honorees selected by the magazine .
Which they are .
So , if they are in serious talks with Apple , they better grab that award and head on home tout de suite .
The idea that Apple would buy a company that has no idea how to make money , and has nothing to do with Apple ’s core business is absurd and downright laughable .
Apple makes surgical purchases , a’la PA Semi , that fit into its long term roadmap .
The odds of Apple purchasing Twitter are about as high as Apple purchasing EdibleApple .
When Apple bought P.A Semi for $ 278 million , it acquired engineers , patents , and a boatload of intellectual property and chip design know - how .
Does anyone honestly think Apple would pay nearly 3 x as much for a company like Twitter ?
And speaking of Twitter , and our lovely site , make sure to follow us over here .
Shameless , we know .

Greetings Readers !
Normally I am fast asleep at the time that I am writing this , but it is quite warm here and I can’t sleep when it is hot .
Not being able to sleep , I decided to browse the new posts on my Google Reader .
After sifting through all of the stuff I do n’t care about , I came across some news from TechCrunch that Twitter is removing a large part of the service ’s @ reply functionality because it seems to believe people are too stupid to figure it out .
Maybe I am just cranky because I can’t sleep , but this sounds like a great opportunity to go on a good rant .
Is there anything about Twitter that confuses you to the point of frustration or even wanting to quit the service ?
Do you find @ replies confusing ?
I did n’t think so .
@ Replies have been around for nearly as long as Twitter yet apparently all of the sudden they are too confusing for people .
What is most perplexing is that this functionality that is being removed , the ability to see everybody ’s @ replies even if you do n’t follow the people they are talking to , is that this functionality is n’t even enabled by default .
You have to go into the settings and enable this feature yourself .
If people are too stupid to figure out the basics of twitter , what are they doing mucking around in the settings area in the first place ?
If people ca n’t figure out what this functionality does and how it affects their experience withe the service , I think that is more twitter ’s fault for not explaining it well enough instead of just implying that their users are stupid .
The truly annoying thing about all of this is that they seem to be eliminating one feature after another without adding anything .
Just recently , they announced that they were killing the auto - follow feature that a user has to request to be an option in the first place .
Why are you killing a feature that is obviously valuable to some people while most users do n’t know it exists so that it ca n’t change how they use the service ?
I am not completely against killing features as I understand that sometimes they are n’t useful or cause more problems than good , but killing used features for no reason and not replacing them with new functionality is something that has always irritated me .
It is the purpose of a service to move forward , not back .
While many services are adding features , the fastest growing service on the internet seems to be taking them away with no legitimate reason for doing so .
Twitter seems to be becoming too reliant upon third party services to fill in the gap .
I will admit that while there are some really stupid services out there , there are a ton of great twitter apps and services that bring a huge value to the twitter experience .
While I think it is great to let the twitter community grow and do its own thing , it is not right to expect them to pick up the slack and make new services just because you kill off an existing feature .
You can help the community grow in many ways , but lowering the value of your service by disabling features is not a good move for anybody .
Twitter needs to wake up and realize that it has a ton of competition from services such as friendfeed and needs to spend more time improving and stabilizing the product instead of moving backward and disabling existing functionality .
Enough of my late night rant .

Venus Near Inferior Conjunction
Credit & Copyright : Eddie Guscott
Explanation :
This remarkable picture of a slender crescent Venus was made during daylight hours on March 26 .
Venus was then very near inferior conjunction , its closest approach to a point on a line directly between Earth and the Sun .
So , daylight was a good time to carefully record the telescopic view when both Venus and Sun were high in the daytime sky .
Near inferior conjunction , Venus is closest to us and at its largest apparent size , but Venus is also strongly backlit by sunlight , presenting its night side partially outlined by a narrow crescent .
What makes the image remarkable are the faint arcs extending beyond the sunlit crescent around to the night side of Venus , due to sunlight filtering through the planet 's dense atmosphere .
Astronomer Eddie Guscott reports from his site in Essex , England that the faint extensions came and went as the Earth 's atmospheric blurring changed .
His image was constructed from 85 of the sharpest frames chosen from thousands taken with a webcam and telescope .
• G20 pathologist reprimanded over conduct • MP asks why first post mortem was held so quickly , and calls for public inquiry
The initial post mortem examination of the man who died at the G20 protests after being attacked by a police officer , which found he had died of a heart attack , was conducted by a forensic pathologist once reprimanded about his professional conduct by the General Medical Council .
Ian Tomlinson , a 47 - year - old newspaper seller , died on April 1 after being assaulted at least once by officers policing the G20 demonstrations .
He had been trying to walk home from work when he was confronted by police , hit with a baton and thrown to the ground .
Two days later Home Office pathologist Dr Freddy Patel concluded Tomlinson had died of a heart attack .
He has previously been reprimanded by the GMC , after he released medical details about a man who died controversially in police custody .
In a second case , which raised questions about Dr Patel 's findings , police dropped a criminal investigation after the pathologist gave it as his opinion that the victim , a woman , had died of natural causes .
A man who lived in the flat where the body was found went on to murder two other women and mutilate their bodies .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) launched a criminal inquiry into Tomlinson 's death after footage obtained by the Guardian showed he had been attacked from behind .
Tomlinson had had his hands in his pockets and was walking away from police lines .
Last night a second post mortem examination , intitiated by Tomlinson 's family and the IPCC , was being carried out by Dr Nat Cary .
A source with detailed knowledge of the IPCC investigation expressed surprise that the initial post mortem was referred to Dr Patel rather than the Forensic Pathology Services , a body of nine independent forensic pathologists , including Dr Cary , which usually deals with suspicious deaths in London and the home counties .
The selection of Dr Patel could have been a jurisdictional issue relating to City of London authorities , the source said .
" Who chose the first pathologist and how ? " said David Howarth MP , the Liberal Democrats ' justice spokesman .
" When the first post mortem came out saying natural causes so soon after his death , I thought that was too quick . "
He added : " At the very least , there now needs to be a full and independent public inquiry into the Tomlinson case , and the actions of the public authorities in the days after his death .
Who knew what - and when ? "
The IPCC took over the criminal investigation into the death of Ian Tomlinson on Wednesday , after the Guardian published footage showing he had been hit with a baton and thrown to the ground by an officer in an apparently unprovoked assault .
The Guardian included the video in a dossier of evidence handed to the IPCC that also contained statements from witnesses who alleged Tomlinson was assaulted by police at least once before he died .
Dr Patel is on a Home Office register of accredited forensic pathologists , which is managed on behalf of all police forces by the National Policing Improvement Agency .
Questions have twice been asked about his handling of suspicious death cases .
In 1999 Dr Patel was disciplined by the GMC after he discussed the medical history of Roger Sylvester , a 30 - year - old black man who died in police custody , outside an inquest hearing .
He told reporters : " I am aware from the medical records held at Whittington hospital that Mr Sylvester was a user of crack cocaine . "
Sylvester 's family were devastated by the suggestion and contested that he been a user .
Asked about the GMC reprimand last night by telephone , Dr Patel said : " That is right .
It happened a long time ago . "
In a separate case in January 2002 , Dr Patel found that Sally White , 38 , died of a natural causes resulting from heart disease .
Her body was found locked in a bedroom in the Camden flat of Anthony Hardy , a 52 - year - old psychiatrically - disturbed alcoholic .
White 's death was treated as suspicious until Dr Patel detailed the cause of her death as a heart attack .
Hardy went on to kill two women , Elizabeth Valad , 29 , and Brigette MacClennan , 34 , and place their body parts in bin bags .
Last night , Dr Patel said : " As far as I know , my findings [ in the Sally White case ] stand as they were , and I was n't criticised . "
He declined to comment on whether he was the correct person to conduct the first post mortem examination into Tomlinson 's death , referring questions to the coroner .
The City of London coroner in the case , Paul Matthews , was yesterday not contactable .
Last night a spokesperson for the City of London said they did not have the necessary information to comment on Dr Patel 's involvement in Tomlinson 's post mortem .
An IPCC spokesperson said : " Again , we are not willing to give a running commentary of an ongoing criminal investigation as we wish to maintain the integrity of the investigation . "

Government is unrepentant about squalid conditions , saying Tamil Tigers must be weeded out from among civilians
Many of the quarter of a million people held in internment camps in Sri Lanka face up to two years behind razor wire , a government official said today .
Despite international concern over conditions inside the camps , the defence ministry spokesman , Lakshman Hulugalle , said Sri Lanka was not prepared to let the UN dictate terms over the length of time people could be held .
A UN spokesman , Gordon Weiss , said he was " shocked " at the revelation , which ran counter to previous government assurances .
" It was our understanding that the government was to return 80 % of the people to their homes by the end of the year , or at least try to , " said Weiss .
The UN , Britain and human rights groups have been pressing the government in Colombo to release people from the camps as soon as possible .
But Hulugalle said : " The UN can't dictate terms to us .
They can always make a request but the UN has n't asked us to release people .
The government has a plan to resettle them .
Let these agencies come and join us . "
Hulugalle said the government had already resettled almost 200,000 people after the east of the country was liberated from Tamil Tiger control .
" We were able to resettle them within nine months .
This operation will take a little longer – one and a half to two years , " he said .
Some elderly people with close relatives who could look after them had been released , but many others would have to stay behind for up to two years .
Responding to criticism of conditions inside the camps , where detainees have told the Guardian they are short of food , water and medicines , Hulugalle said : " You ca n't expect five - star hospitality in an area like that .
What we are providing are the basics – security , food , health and schools .
These are basic .
You ca n't expect an Oxford college . "
Hulugalle said the government had turned down an offer of 750 previously used blankets from the Hilton hotel group because people did not want to be treated as second - grade citizens .
" They are not beggars , " he said .
The government says it needs to hold the civilians until it can establish whether or not they are Tamil Tigers .
The news came as the Red Cross suspended delivery of supplies to displaced civilians after the Sri Lanka blocked access to camps it controls in the country 's north .
" There is no access to these camps at this particular moment , " said a Red Cross official in Geneva .
A second Sri Lankan official revealed that hardcore rebels were being held and interrogated in a secure unit in the south of the country .
The defence ministry has refused to discuss their fate .
Thousands of other former fighters are being held in what the government describes as " rehabilitation centres " .
Suhada Gamalath , the man in charge of the jails where the majority of Tamil Tigers who surrendered are being held , said about 100 fighters were being held in a prison in Boosse , in the south of the country .
He said they would eventually be brought to trial and could face up to 20 years ' jail if convicted of murder .
Gamalath said between 2,000 and 3,000 former Tamil Tigers were imprisoned , with up to 60 more arriving every day .
Most had given themselves up , he said .
The total included about 250 below the age of 18 , he said , with some as young as 14 .
Save the Children claims that at least a quarter of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the internment camps are acutely malnourished .
Another government minister disputed the military 's assessment of the timescale for rehabilitation , but admitted the task posed particular problems .
The disaster management and human rights minister , Mahinda Samarasinghe , claimed that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) had infiltrated the camps and there was a danger that some of those being held were potential suicide bombers .
Samarasinghe said the area where the civilians once lived had been heavily mined by the LTTE and would take time to clear .
He insisted the government was committed to getting the lives of its citizens back to normal at the earliest possible opportunity and that they would be consulted throughout the process .
But he said it was likely to take longer than the year it took to resettle civilians displaced by fighting in the east .
Samarasinghe also criticised some of the efforts of the UN agencies involved , claiming that tents supplied to house detainees were inadequate and unable to stand up to rain , and that toilets supplied by Unicef were not good enough .
" As much as they tell us to maintain international standards , it is incumbent on us as a government that if there are shortcomings on their part we tell them , " he said .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , is due to arrive in Sri Lanka on Friday to press the government to work towards reconciliation after 26 years of war and to allow humanitarian groups access to the camps .
The UN said Ban had met the Sri Lankan health minister in Geneva to press for access to the former battlefields .
He said in a statement that the situation in Sri Lanka was of " grave and growing concern " and said more care needed to be provided for

Humanity is facing " water bankruptcy " as a result of a crisis even greater than the financial meltdown now destabilising the global economy , two authoritative new reports show .
They add that it is already beginning to take effect , and there will be no way of bailing the earth out of water scarcity .
The two reports – one by the world 's foremost international economic forum and the other by 24 United Nations agencies – presage the opening tomorrow of the most important conference on the looming crisis for three years .
The World Water Forum , which will be attended by 20,000 people in Istanbul , will hear stark warnings of how half the world 's population will be affected by water shortages in just 20 years ' time , with millions dying and increasing conflicts over dwindling resources .
A report by the World Economic Forum , which runs the annual Davos meetings of the international business and financial elite , says that lack of water , will " soon tear into various parts of the global economic system " and " start to emerge as a headline geopolitical issue " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It adds : " The financial crisis gives us a stark warning of what can happen if known economic risks are left to fester .
We are living in a water ' bubble ' as unsustainable and fragile as that which precipitated the collapse in world financial markets .
We are now on the verge of bankruptcy in many places with no way of paying the debt back . "
The Earth – a blue - green oasis in the limitless black desert of space – has a finite stock of water .
There is precisely the same amount of it on the planet as there was in the age of the dinosaurs , and the world 's population of more than 6.7 billion people has to share the same quantity as the 300 million global inhabitants of Roman times .
Water use has been growing far faster than the number of people .
During the 20th century the world population increased fourfold , but the amount of freshwater that it used increased nine times over .
Already 2.8 billion people live in areas of high water stress , the report calculates , and this will rise to 3.9 billion – more than half the expected population of the world – by 2030 .
By that time , water scarcity could cut world harvests by 30 per cent – equivalent to all the grain grown in the US and India – even as human numbers and appetites increase .
Some 60 per cent of China 's 669 cities are already short of water .
The huge Yellow River is now left with only 10 per cent of its natural flow , sometimes failing to reach the sea altogether .
And the glaciers of the Himalayas , which act as gigantic water banks supplying two billion people in Asia , are melting ever faster as global warming accelerates .
Meanwhile devastating droughts are crippling Australia and Texas .
The World Water Development Report , compiled by 24 UN agencies under the auspices of Unesco , adds that shortages are already beginning to constrain economic growth in areas as diverse and California , China , Australia , India and Indonesia .
The report , which will be published tomorrow , also expects water conflicts to break out in the Middle East , Haiti , Sri Lanka , Colombia and other countries .
" Conflicts about water can occur at all scales , " it warns .
" Hydrological shocks " brought about by climate change are likely to " increase the risk of major national and international security threats " .
This looks like fun .
Born in Nagano , Japan in 1968 , Shinichi Maruyama hurls black India ink into water and photographs the millisecond that these two liquids collide .
Capable of capturing this phenomenon at a 7,500th of a second , Maruyama takes full advantage of a recent advancement in strobe light technology which can record physical events faster than the naked eye can perceive them .
In the series Kusho , which means “ writing in the sky , ” Maruyama 's goal is to arrest in space and time the sublime intersection of two different media before they merge into one .
In some respects , the project resembles a scientific experiment , but in Maruyama 's artistic hands , the total action becomes a form of Shodo ( Japanese calligraphy ) performance –with the gesture executed in the air rather than on the flat surface of the paper .
“ Once your brush touches paper , you must finish the character , you have one chance .
It can never be repeated or duplicated .
You must commit your full attention and being to each stroke .
Liquids , like ink , are elusive by nature .
As sumi ink finds its own path through the paper grain , liquid finds its unique path as it moves through air . ”

The most celebrated inscription at the Central Intelligence Agency 's headquarters in Langley , Virginia , used to be the biblical phrase chiseled into marble in the main lobby : " And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . "
But in recent years , another text has been the subject of intense scrutiny inside the Company and out : 865 characters of seeming gibberish , punched out of half - inch - thick copper in a courtyard .
It 's part of a sculpture called Kryptos , created by DC artist James Sanborn .
He got the commission in 1988 , when the CIA was constructing a new building behind its original headquarters .
The agency wanted an outdoor installation for the area between the two buildings , so a solicitation went out for a piece of public art that the general public would never see .
Sanborn named his proposal after the Greek word for hidden .
The work is a meditation on the nature of secrecy and the elusiveness of truth , its message written entirely in code .
Almost 20 years after its dedication , the text has yet to be fully deciphered .
A bleary - eyed global community of self - styled cryptanalysts — along with some of the agency 's own staffers — has seen three of its four sections solved , revealing evocative prose that only makes the puzzle more confusing .
Still uncracked are the 97 characters of the fourth part ( known as K4 in Kryptos - speak ) .
And the longer the deadlock continues , the crazier people get .
Whether or not our top spooks intended it , the persistent opaqueness of Kryptos subversively embodies the nature of the CIA itself — and serves as a reminder of why secrecy and subterfuge so fascinate us .
" The whole thing is about the power of secrecy , " Sanborn tells me when I visit his studio , a barnlike structure on Jimmy Island in Chesapeake Bay ( population : 2 ) .
He is 6 ' 7 " , bearded , and looks a bit younger than his 63 years .
Looming behind him is his latest work in progress , a 28 - foot - high re-creation of the world 's first particle accelerator , surrounded by some of the original hardware from the Manhattan Project .
The atomic gear fits nicely with the thrust of Sanborn 's oeuvre , which centers on what he calls invisible forces .
With Kryptos , Sanborn has made his strongest statement about what we do n't see and can't know .
" He designed a piece that would resonate with this workforce in particular , " says Toni Hiley , who curates the employees - only CIA museum .
Sanborn 's ambitious work includes the 9 - foot 11 - inch - high main sculpture — an S - shaped wave of copper with cut - out letters , anchored by an 11 - foot column of petrified wood — and huge pieces of granite abutting a low fountain .
And although most of the installation resides in a space near the CIA cafeteria , where analysts and spies can enjoy it when they eat outside , Kryptos extends beyond the courtyard to the other side of the new building .
There , copper plates near the entrance bear snippets of Morse code , and a naturally magnetized lodestone sits by a compass rose etched in granite .
" People call me an agent of Satan , " says artist Sanborn , " because I wo n't tell my secret . "

The heart of the piece , though , is the encrypted text , scrambled , Sanborn says , by " a coding system that would unravel itself slowly over a period of time . "
When he began the work , Sanborn knew very little about cryptography , so he reluctantly accepted the CIA 's offer to work with Ed Scheidt , who had just retired as head of Langley 's Cryptographic Center .
Scheidt himself was serving two masters .
" I was reminded of my need to preserve the agency 's secrets , " Scheidt says .
" You know , do n't tell him the current way of doing business .
And do n't create something that you cannot break — but at the same time , make it something that will last a while . "
Scheidt schooled Sanborn in cryptographic techniques employed from the late 19th century until World War II , when field agents had to use pencil and paper to encode and decode their messages .
( These days , of course , cryptography is all about rugged computer algorithms using long mathematical keys . )
After experimenting with a range of techniques , including poly - alphabetic substitution , shifting matrices , and transposition , the two arrived at a form of old - school , artisanal cryptography that they felt would hold off code breakers long enough to generate some suspense .
The solutions , however , were Sanborn 's alone , and he did not share them with Scheidt .
" I assumed the first three sections would be deciphered in a matter of weeks , perhaps months , " Sanborn says .
Scheidt figured the whole puzzle would be solved in less than seven years .
During the two years of construction , there were moments of intrigue and paranoia , in keeping with the subject matter and the client .
" We had to play a little on the clandestine side , " says Scheidt , who talks of unnamed observers outside armed with long - range cameras and high - intensity microphones .
" We had people with ladders climbing up the walls of my studio trying to photograph inside , " Sanborn says .
He came to believe that factions within the CIA wanted to kill the project .
There were unexplained obstacles .
For instance , he says , " one day a big truckload of stone for the courtyard disappeared .
Never found .
I saw it in the evening , went back in the morning , and it had vanished .
Nobody would tell me what happened to it . "
Sanborn finished the sculpture in time for a November 1990 dedication .
The agency released the enciphered text , and a frenzy erupted in the crypto world as some of the best — and wackiest — cryptanalytic talent set to work .
But it took them more than seven years , not the few months Sanborn had expected , to crack sections K1 , K2 , and K3 .
The first code breaker , a CIA employee named David Stein , spent 400 hours working by hand on his own time .
Stein , who described the emergence of the first passage as a religious experience , revealed his partial solution to a packed auditorium at Langley in February 1998 .
But not a word was leaked to the press .
Sixteen months later , Jim Gillogly , an LA - area cryptanalyst used a Pentium II computer and some custom software to crack the same three sections .
When news of Gillogly 's success broke , the CIA publicized Stein 's earlier crack .
James Sanborn buried his sculpture 's message so deeply that a CIA staffer took seven years to solve just the first three sections .
Here 's what we know .
The first section , K1 , uses a modified Vigenère cipher .
It 's encrypted through substitution — each letter corresponds to another — and can be solved only with the alphabetic rows of letters on the right .
The keywords , which help determine the substitutions , are KRYPTOS and PALIMPSEST .
A misspelling — in this case IQLUSION — may be a clue to cracking K4 .
K2 , like the first section , was also encrypted using the alphabets on the right .
One new trick Sanborn used , though , was to insert an X between some sentences , making it harder to crack the code by tabulating letter frequency .
The keywords here are KRYPTOS and ABSCISSA .
And there 's another intriguing misspelling : UNDERGRUUND .
A different cryptographic technique was used for K3 : transposition .
All the letters are jumbled and can be deciphered only by uncovering the complex matrices and mathematics that determined their misplacement .
Of course , there is a misspelling ( DESPARATLY ) , and the last sentence ( CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING ? ) is strangely bracketed by an X and a Q .
Sanborn intentionally made K4 much harder to crack , hinting that the plaintext itself is not standard English and would require a second level of cryptanalysis .
Misspellings and other anomalies in previous sections may help .
Some suspect that clues are present in other parts of the installation : the Morse code , the compass rose , or perhaps the adjacent fountain .
But if anyone expected that solving the first three sections would lead to a quick resolution of the whole puzzle , their hopes were soon dashed .
The partial solutions only deepened the confusion .
K1 is a passage written by Sanborn .
" I tried to make it sound good and be inscrutable enough to be interesting , " he says .
Judge for yourself how well he did : " Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the nuance of iqlusion . "
Yes , iqlusion — one of several misspellings that Sanborn says are intentional .
The second section reads like a telegraph transmission .
There 's a reference to a magnetic field and information transmitted to a specific latitude and longitude — geo- coordinates for a location a couple of hundred feet south of the sculpture itself ( a spot where nothing of apparent interest lies ) .
K3 paraphrases a diary entry of anthropologist Howard Carter from his 1922 discovery of King Tut 's tomb , ending with a question : " Can you see anything ? "
When Gillogly turned up that passage , he says , he had " the same excitement and exultation that Carter described .
In a way , it seems that the plaintext is a metaphor for the work of the code breaker , or perhaps of the CIA itself . "

What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide ?
Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical , selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen .
Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law , civilization and morality .
Society today accepts the idea of an evil human nature it is often used as the argument of why communism wont work .
That human beings are greedy sex hungry monstrosities .
That each individual is worse than a Stalin .
How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence ?
Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep ?
Is not man 's greatest sin to have been born ?
What duty is there to continue to live ?
We did not choose to be born .
Why pass on genes , and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire ?
Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds .
If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow .
Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance .
Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell .
Sociobiology like Eo Wilson , Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Riley 's
The Red Queen all agree that a brutal rapist sexuality is at the root of " human nature " .
So if there is no rational reason for living , and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times , then what is the philosophical argument against suicide ?
Free Will and the " Oh Well ! " Creed
What is free will ?
Free will is a doctrine that teaches that man can act independently of God .
This should already ring sour to the spiritually - attuned ear .
The doctrine of free will teaches that man has the freedom to choose or reject God , never mind the verse that says no man is seeking God ( Rom. 3:11 ) .
But I remind you that we ’re talking about free will ; Scripture has nothing to do with this .
In other words , in the doctrine of free will , man becomes the deciding factor in his own salvation .
Jesus Christ ’s work on the cross , according to this doctrine , was only a potential salvation , not an actual one .
According to this doctrine , the cross of Christ never saved anybody ; the cross only saves those who decide to be saved .
What about the verse that says no one can come to the Son unless the Father draws him ?
( Jn. 6:44 ) .
Never mind it .
What about the verses that say God is the Savior of all mankind ( 1 Tim. 4:10 ) , and that the blood of the cross will reconcile all to Him ( Col. 1:20 ) , whether those on the earth or those in the heavens ?
Never mind them .
Then what about the verse that says
God is operating all things in accord with the counsel of His will ?
( Eph. 1:11 ) Again , never mind .
I have already told you .
Scripture has nothing to do with this .
We ’re talking about free will .
Scripture is strong medicine
Reader , if you believe in the free will of man , please investigate the ninth chapter of Romans in any version you please , come back , then tell me if you still believe in it .
If you still do , then read Romans 11:32 .
If you still believe in free will after that , take a little tea , massage your temples , and read John 6:44 .
You say you ’ve read these verses and you still believe in free will ?
Very well ; perhaps your neck needs cracked .
If you do not know a good chiropractor , try it yourself .
Place one hand on your head , another on your chin and yank .
Ah!
Now read Ephesians 1:4 . Still ?
Perhaps bed is the answer .
Go to bed , rise tomorrow with a clear head , then read Proverbs 16:9 , 19:21 and 1 Kings 22:22 .
If , for whatever reason — medical or otherwise — you still believe in free will , take Daniel 4:35 , Jeremiah 10:23 , Proverbs 21:1 , Proverbs 20:24 and Isaiah 10:15 and call me in the morning .
As long as you are neither pregnant nor nursing a baby , take two readings of Ephesians 1:11 .
Caution : do not exceed this recommended dosage .
At higher doses , unbearable relief may occur .
Warning : these verses may cause excitability in theologians and seminary students .
Avoid operating a motor vehicle while reading these verses .
A persistent reliance on orthodox tradition may be a sign of a serious condition .
If your belief in free will persists for more than a week , tends to recur , or is accompanied by rash , pride ( or rash pride ) and a general looking down on others , accompanied by a false estimation of self , consult your Savior .
Who chose who ?
Do n’t take my jolly humor the wrong way .
I used to believe in free will myself .
But then a guy asked me to exercise it by deciding not to sin the following day .
I was determined to do it .
My alarm clock went off and I reached for it , but it was n’t there ; Melody had moved it to her side of the bed .
The day had hardly begun and already I had missed my alarm clock ; the word sin , in the original Greek language of Scripture , simply means " to miss . "
So much for my vaunted free will .
Deep down , many Christians believe that there is something about them that makes them smarter than ot hers , able to make a better decision concerning God than others .
Would n’t you agree that Christians who think this way would have something to boast in ?
They would if an account of their salvation began with the word " I . "
Yet Paul says that , in the true gospel of grace , boasting is debarred .
That ’s Romans 3:27 .
" Debarred " means : shut out , excluded .
Do you realize what this means ?
This means that a believer cannot even claim credit for his or her ability to believe !
( Quite true , I ’m afraid .
Read Philippians 1:29 and Romans 12:3 .
The first verse says that our belief in Christ is graciously granted us , the second that our very faith is a gift .
You ’re disappointed ; I can see it in your face .
But now you know the truth :
You are no different than anyone else .
If God had n’t chosen you , you ’d be an unbeliever , too , just like your stupid Uncle Harry .
Take heart .
Once your pride has recovered from this , you will exult in your Savior as never before ; you will need Him as you never have .
( If God has used me to save you from a fall and soften your opinion of Harry , I am happy . )
Think !
Now think about it .
If a person begins an account of his or her salvation with the word " I , " then he or she is boasting .
That person may say they ’re not boasting , but denial does n’t change facts .
Yet if they begin an account of their salvation with the word " God , " they are practically repudiating the doctrine of human free will .
What about you ?
Does an account of your salvation begin with the word " I " or with the word " God ? "
I hope that it begins with the word " God . "
If it does , then you have rejected the false doctrine of the free will of man and now believe in the free will of God .
This is a good thing .
For who makes you different from anybody else , and what have you got that was not given to you ?
And if anything has been given to you , why boast of it as if you had achieved it yourself ?
— 1 Cor. 4:7
But here we run into an apparently insurmountable problem , which also appears quite impossible to overcome .
We now understand that God has given us the belief and faith necessary for salvation .
But this leads us to a startling and seemingly troubling conclusion :
He has not given this belief and faith to others .
While this may be a hard pill to swallow at first ( I recommend a little orange juice ) , it is nonetheless true .
As I will show , this is not a problem .
No , truth is never a problem .
Discarding error is the problem .
Matthew 13:11 records these words Jesus spoke to His disciples : " To you has it been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of the heavens , yet to those ( the throng ) it has not been given . "
Hear Him in Matthew 11:25 - " Jesus said , ‘ I am acclaiming Thee , Father ... for
Thou hidest these things from the wise and intelligent . ’ "
What does the Master say of Jerusalem in Luke 19:42 ?
" If you knew ... what is for your peace !
Yet now it was hid from your eyes . "
Could it be that God purposely kept some from believing His Son ?
You may be tempted to think that the " wise and intelligent " nailed their own coffins , or that Jerusalem got stubborn apart from God ’s influence .
Resist this temptation .
I challenge you to read what these verses say , not what the " wise and intelligent " tell you they say .
God is a causer , not a reactor .
Consider the above in light of the following :
Romans 11:8 - " Even as it is written , God gives them ( Israel ) a spirit of stupor , eyes not to be observing , and ears not to be hearing , till this very day . "
Romans 11:32 - " For God locks up all together in stubbornness . "
Romans 9:18 - " Consequently , then , to whom
He will , He is merciful , yet whom He will , He is hardening . "
To the mind unprejudiced by traditional teaching , these verses say one thing :
God is responsible for unbelief .
Do n’t shoot the messenger !
This truth is probably causing yet another seemingly inescapable problem to trouble your mind .
That is why I am about to place that problem on a sturdy table in front of you and offer a solution to it in the plainest possible language .
I choose English .
Divine - inspired stubbornness
If you believe in either the annihilation or eternal torment of Uncle Harry , then you have encountered a serious problem .
I have just shown from the Scriptures that God is responsible , not only for withholding Himself from Uncle Harry , but also for locking up Harry in stubbornness .
Now look around you .
The world is an oblate spheroid from the weight of people like Uncle Harry ; the spiritually stubborn account for most of humanity .
My question to you is : what happens when these people die in this condition ?
You say everyone gets an opportunity to believe before they die ?
Let ’s test this theory .
Pause to consider Israel .
In Romans 11:8 , Paul writes that , " even as it is written , God gives Israel a spirit of stupor " that remains " till this very day . "
Paul was quoting Isaiah 29:10 .
Israel ’s divinely - inspired stubbornness , then , dates at least to Isaiah ’s time .
( See also Isaiah 63:17 and 64:7 - 8 . )
Paul wrote Romans around the summer of ‘ 58 A.D. Isaiah lived around 750 B.C.
Here alone are approximately 800 years of God-inspired stubbornness .
And what of the nearly 2000 years of stupor since ?
Folks , a lot of Jews have died unbelievers in 2800 years .
And God ,
Who has not only made them stubborn ( Rom. 11:8 , 11:32 ) but also holds the keys of death ( Rev. 1:18 ) , is responsible .
I wonder if your theology has an answer for this .
I ’ve been staring at that throw rug over there by your rocking chair .
All this time I thought that was your dog lying under it .
Now I see that Boscoe is chewing on the sofa .
That lump under your rug is all the verses I ’ve just quoted that you ’ve been sweeping under there for most of your Christian life .
I think it ’s time for a little spring cleaning .
The " Oh well ! " creed
Calvinists ( those folks belonging to a religion invented by John Calvin ) ran into the same problem ; they simply put their dogs outside .
But besides this , they also had trouble with the idea of a sovereign God bringing billions of people into the world , only to send most to an eternity of torment .
You see , the Calvinists at least saw the truth of the sovereignty of God ; give them credit for relatively flat rugs .
They acknowledged that members of Christ ’s body are predestined for it long before birth , apart from personal merit .
That ’s easy enough to see ; Ephesians 1:4 - 5 and Romans 8:29 say as much .
So hooray for the Calvinists again .
But what of the billions of people who are n’t predestined for heaven ?
What about the horrible problem of a God who purposely feeds hellfire with divinely - hardened flesh ?
Well , the Calvinists finally devised a " solution " to that : they no longer considered it a problem !
Today , one of their shortest creeds is : " Oh well ! "
This creed is repeated a great deal at funerals .
Calvinism so infuses the heart with Christian love that its founder , John Calvin , once had a disagreeable Spanish theologian , Michael Servetus , burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553 .
Does n’t that hurt ?
I guess only if you hold onto the match for too long .
Song and dance
At the other end of the problem stand the Arminians .
These folks followed Jacobus Arminius , who rejected Calvin ’s predestination teaching of pure grace .
Arminius believed salvation was available to everyone — if they exercised their free wills and took it ( i.e. " works " ) .
The Arminians ’ rug resembled a beret on the Matterhorn .
But at least they relieved God of responsibility for His creation .
God sent them a large " thank you " card , which can be seen at the National Free Will Museum in Meesavemyself , New Mexico .
This museum is open only if you believe that it ’s open .
" If you go to hell , it ’s your fault ! " is the Good News of the Arminians .
This bogus gospel , passed down to the present , is believed and preached by millions .
It even makes some people want to wear robes .
But the doctrine , " if you go to hell , it ’s your fault ! " does have an even more sinister side - effect than making people want to wear robes .
That side - effect is :
If you go to heaven , it ’s your credit .
This deduction is unavoidable .
If going to hell is one ’s fault , how can staying out of it be anything but one ’s credit ?
I give up .
If I can be stubborn enough to lose my salvation , it is self - evident that I can be savvy enough to gain it .
This little song and dance is also called " salvation by works . "
But I would n’t tell people that this is what they really believe .
Well — I guess I would .
But they wo n’t like to hear it .
And they sure wo n’t believe it .
So you say you want to get persecuted ?
That ’s awesome .
Then walk into your average evangelistic church today and suggest to them that the blood of Christ was shed for — and will ultimately save — everyone .
For some reason , this news will stab their hearts and they will hate your intestines .
Want to hear some sense ?
Now I ’m going to solve the problem and relieve your troubled mind .
Do n’t credit me — give
God the glory .
( But I do accept Red Lobster gift certificates . )
The problem , restated , is : 1 ) No one can believe in God unless God gives belief 2 ) He refuses to give belief to most of humanity , hardening hearts to boot , and — here comes the problem —
3 ) He allegedly sends those whom He has hardened ( without the proper clothing , one would assume ) to an eternity of hellfire .
You will notice that the Calvinist and the Arminian viewpoint have one common point : a belief in eternal torment .
The Arminians ducked this horror by making God not liable for sending folks to orthodox hell .
The ticket out ?
Free will .
Free will is one of the easiest heresies to disprove from Scripture — but it does n’t matter .
Arminian - types who believe in eternal torment are in the embarrassing position of having to stare sovereignty - of - God verses in the face and deny them ; I ’ve witnessed the phenomenon .
But at least , unlike Calvinists , they resist a God who damns people on purpose .
Calvinists , delicate souls , simply recite the " Oh well ! " creed and go home .
The common problem with these two errant beliefs is — eternal torment .
In my next book , I will put together the correct part of Arminianism with the correct part of Calvinism ( discarding the rest ) , to show you the truth .

On Monday , we hosted our final dinner in the summer series , Things We Love Summer of Beer at Toro restaurant in the South End of Boston .
Things We Love is a beer dinner concept that was designed to shed beer dinner images .
No longer do we work with one sole brewer and only their profile .
We work with what we love at that moment and what we love to eat , fresh and seasonal .
The idea is to gain a better inclusion of the restaurant staff , and a better idea of the restaurant itself .
So many times , people leave beer dinners talking only about the terrific beer they just had .
We want people walking out of our events thinking in new ways about beer and food together .
We wanted to shed themes and concepts to elevate the beer novices and foodies , and also bring down the beer nerd who demands the finest foods , rarest beers , but wo n't pay more than $ 45 .
The idea is to have fun and not work with impossible people or parameters .
These our dinners , our favorites and our idea of fun .
This can also include a wine pairing with the dinner , a battle of beer versus something , a beer cocktail ...
No limits anymore , but one rule , the main focus is the beer .
You are being welcomed to sit at OUR table .
To add any restrictions or rules about how it should be done changes the concept completely .
When I sat down with Jen Fields , the General Manager at Toro , we talked about our past histories in the restaurant world of Boston .
Jen and I both used to work a crummy , yet popular hipster dive bar in Cambridge .
We know our bartenders in this town .
Boston has become quite the town for craft cocktails and craft beer .
One thing that has never changed , is the need for cheap beer and shots of bourbon or fernet after a long day .
At Toro , head chef Jamie Bissonnette loves Bud Light Lime .
So does a lot of the kitchen staff .
If you are a beer nerd , this is probably cringe worthy to you .
But this is burden of true Beer Advocate .
It 's not our place to tell anyone who they are or what they can and can't drink .
It is a beer in their hands after all .
It 's obvious we advocate for better beer and will always do so , but the hardened beer geek must realize we are BeerAdvocate and not Craft Beer Advocate .
This does n't mean that we are in the pockets of Budweiser because we do n't shamelessly rip them apart every chance we get .
The arguments against them are stale , old and tired and no one is really saying anything new about the big bad beast that is Anheuser - Busch .
Having said that , we would still defend and support a craft brewer long before the corporate beasts if problems arise .
And at the end of a hard day in a hot kitchen , you want slamming back beers .
And if BLL is their choice , so be it .
They have earned the right to drink whatever they fancy .
When I sat down with Jen to discuss the menu for our beer dinner , I asked her what is everyone in here drinking right now , what do they love right now .
And she mentioned Jamie 's BLL affinity .
This made sense to me , because at his other restaurant Coppa , also in the South End , he features awesome Shandy 's on his cocktail list using stouts and 21st Amendment 's Hell or High Watermelon Wheat .
It 's called the Merman , with the wheat beer , and it 's delicious and hilarious with the name proving there is a time and a place for every beer .
Beer cocktails are fantastic .
We even featured a French Shandy at the Aquitaine TWL dinner .
We got a consensus of what everyone wanted to drink .
And Jen thought it would be funny and awesome to make Bud Light Lime Margarita as a welcoming drink since we told her that we LOVE beer cocktails and that they should feature one .
She thought this would be a good way to kill two birds with one stone .
Get Jamie 's choice in there , make a beer cocktail , and be completely cheeky about it without having any pretensions at this dinner .
One , Toro makes slamming cocktails with Andy McNees behind the bar .
It 's only right to have something fun .
Jen , was also a bartender in this town and knows how to make a good drink , this was all her idea .
Two , it 's in line with our idea of featuring what we love with beer cocktails .
Three , we made it into a cocktail and enhanced it .
Bud Light Lime Margarita ; tequila , elderflower liquor , grapefruit and lime , with lime salt .
We paired it with tempura rock shrimp that used BLL in the batter , lime salt again , shrimp mayo and charred jalapenos .
One person saw the dinner being advertised on their blackboard , and asked how much Bud was paying us and the restaurant to use their beer .
Another person , a member of our website , actually turned it away at the dinner .
Rude and silly if you ask me , but then again I tell no one who they are and what they can and can't like .
Not to mention random tweets from judmental dickheads who were n't even there to to try it , but saw Todd 's tweets about it .
I find it ridiculous , all the kerfuffle one beer cocktail has spurned .
Not to mention it tasted fantastic , made the beer quite enjoyable , and worked amazingly well with the pairing .
His loss , not mine .
We are not in Anheuser - Busch 's pockets , it 's ridiculous to even have to say that .
We have not , nor have we ever or will ever , sell out to AB .
It was Jen 's idea to highlight one of the most respected Chef's in Boston , Jamie Bissonnett 's favorite , as well the the staff favorite .
For the love of fuck it was n't a big deal , but it had enough people 's panties in a bunch that I felt like I had to say something about it .
The dinner was a huge success .
We had so much food and beers , it was well worth it .
And the next time we do a dinner like this or a tasting social , I will have no problem featuring a macro product if the timing and idea behind it , is right .
Once we , hosted an Aztec - themed beer dinner at Upstairs on the Square .
We featured and incredible ceviche on a bed of avocado with Negra Modelo .
There was an historic aspect to the beer , the style , and it worked out so well .
In a Russian - themed beer dinner , Budweiser , sent me Bud made in Russia for the dinner .
You see , beer is the number two drink in Russia behind tea .
And Budweiser did this for us with no questions asked , no favors exchanged .
It tasted very different from our Budweiser and it was really good and more malty .
It was paired with corn belini's , boiled eggs , caviar , and creme fraiche .
It was amazing to be honest .
And you 'd never know if you had such a deep snobbery , it prevented you from being adventurous .
I am not asking anyone to roll the way we do .
You can do whatever you like , pair how ever you see fit .
But we 're having mad fun and keeping it real with what our friends and restaurants we like .
When you see the pictures from the dinner , which I will blog about very soon , you will be jealous you missed an event like this .
Hang your heads in shame if one light hearted beer cocktail prevented you from coming to this dinner .
Edited : I forgot to mention how when we started Things We Love with Hungry Mother in Cambridge , we featured a battle of the cheap beers at that dinner .
10 courses and one was a fried chicken course served in a paper basket with watermelon and cole slaw .
We featured their shitty beer of choice which was Genny Cream Ale vs. our choice of Narragansett .
We served it in paper cups to be cheeky that an upscale southern restaurant could stay true to it 's down and dirty roots .
Everyone had so much fun popping open the cans and hearing the simultaneous cracking from the cans .
It was awesome , Narragansett won , and a whole room full of diners had fun .
All done with " shitty " beers .
We also did our second TWL with Hungry Mother for a Valentine 's day , and that time we featured a beer cocktail with Miller High Life .
We had 40's of HL on the bar and made and awesome cocktail with Vida Mezcal , grapefruit ' concentrate , ' beer syrup , Miller High Life , salt .
It was awesome .
No one complained once during those dinners that cheap macro beers were being used .
They served a purpose and ended being awesome and people loved it .
They were fun , they tasted good , and they fit with our theme of having fun the way we like it .
A top statistician has thrown a bucket of cold water on the stab murder media hysteria which has gripped the UK - and especially London - during the past year .
Professor David Spiegelhalter , Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge , has just published a study on the subject in Significance - the magazine of the Royal Statistical Society .
He has harsh words for comments like that of BBC correspondent Andy Tighe on July 10 last year , following four knife killings that day .
Tighe said : " To have four fatal stabbings in one day could be a statistical freak . "
Au contraire , says the prof .
It was a normal event , to be expected in London at regular intervals .
" Four murders on the same day in London would be expected to occur about once every three years , and it has done , " says Spiegelhalter .
" Seven days without a murder should occur about six times a year , and it does . "
The Significance study was written in conjunction with the Risk and Regulation Advisory Council ( RRAC ) , a government body set up to consider appropriate public response to risk .
According to the prof's research , covering crime since April 2004 , there has been little change in the capital 's murder rate over the past five years .
But you would n't know it from reading the news .
On 28 July 2008 thelondonpaper had the front - page headline " London 's murder count reaches 90 " .
But Spiegelhalter states that this number was normal for that time of year .
" We focused on London for this report as there is a general feeling , often driven by the media , that over the last 12 months murders have increased more than would be expected , " he said .
" Those in authority need to remain level headed and offer the general public a thoughtful , proportionate response , " said Rick Haythornthwaite of the RRAC .
" Sensible decisions can be made whilst never forgetting that each individual case is of course shocking and a tragedy for those affected . "
The research can be read in full here ( free pdf download available , as of going to press . )
Prof Spiegelhalter and his colleagues also have a dedicated site , here . ®
AT&T is not using behavioral advertising company Audience Science to track its customers ' activity on the Web , spokesmen from both companies said this week .
AT&T is not using behavioral advertising company Audience Science to track its customers ' activity on the Web , spokesmen from both companies said this week .
AT&T 's relationship with Audience Science made headlines last week after a congressional hearing on behavioral advertising and deep - packet inspection ( DPI ) .
At that hearing , Rep. Anna Eshoo , a California Democrat , asked an AT&T representative if the company worked with Audience Science to track customers ' online activity .
Representative from both companies denied having the kind of relationship Eshoo implied .
" They 're an advertising client for us , " Jeff Hirsch , chief executive of Audience Science , said in a phone interview .
" As an ISP , we do not track our customer 's data across unrelated websites to create a profile for behavioral advertising , or hire other firms to do so on our behalf , " said AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris .
" Our relationship with this firm is as an advertiser of AT&T products and services .
News reports suggesting that we are engaging in behavioral advertising by selling information [ about ] our customers [ are ] flat wrong . "
At last week 's hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Internet subcommittee , AT&T 's chief privacy officer , Dorothy Atwood , said she did not have immediate details about Audience Science , which Eshoo had incorrectly referred to as Audio Science .
MediaPost later reported that references to AT&T were stripped from the Audience Science Web site in the hours after the hearing , prompting Eshoo to pen a letter to AT&T asking for an explanation .
Why were the AT&T logo and an accompanying testimonial removed ?
" We saw the comments that were being said , and recognized there was a significant amount of confusion , and the statements were not really clear what was being discussed , " Hirsch said .
" We removed the logo for a short while in order to be able to understand exactly what was going on .
Now , we have replaced the logo and put it back up . "
AT&T did not ask Audience Science to remove its logo or testimonial from the Web site , Balmoris said .
AT&T has long insisted that it does not track its consumers ' activity online in order to serve up more targeted ads , but if it does , the process will be open and transparent .
" We will initiate such a program only after testing and validating the various technologies and only after establishing clear and consistent measures to engage customers , " Atwood told the subcommittee last week .
" If AT&T deploys these technologies and processes , we 'll do it the right ways . "
" We have called on everyone in the Internet ecosystem to step out of the cloud of invisibility to give consumers more transparency and control of their online information , and we welcome this discussion , " Balmoris said .
That hearing touched on DPI , a more invasive monitoring technique that allows for the detailed inspection of data as it travels across the Internet .
ISPs can use it to filter out the illegal transfer of copyrighted material or harmful viruses and spam .
No major ISP currently uses DPI in order to serve up more targeted ads , nor does Audience Science , Hirsch said .
" We do not do any deep packet inspection because we do n't believe that gives consumers the appropriate opportunity for disclosure or opt out , " he said .
" We do n't track all consumer behavior across the Web  just [ that collected from ] certain publishers that we work with . "
What does Audience Science do ?
Hirsch declined to provide specifics on exactly what services Audience Science provides to AT&T , but in general , a client like AT&T could use a service called re-targeting .
" A pixel is placed on the advertiser 's site , so when a consumer goes to that site , a cookie is placed on the consumer 's browser .
When that consumer leaves that site and goes elsewhere on the Web , they may receive an ad that is related to what they were looking at on that advertiser 's site , " Hirsch said .
A client like AT&T might also " come to us and say ' I 'd like to target consumers who have expressed interest in cellular phones or cellular services ' or any product line that the advertiser has based on information that we 've collected from this limited set of publishers , " he said .
All clients must provide details on this activity in their privacy policies and provide an option to opt - out , Hirsch said .
AT&T is in the process of submitting a response to Eshoo 's questions .
" We 've also consistently and repeatedly said that in our role as a publisher and advertiser we in fact do use ad networks , just like many other companies do and we 've always made that clear to Congress , policymakers and other stakeholders , " Balmoris said .
Eshoo 's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The Pirate Bay trial saw the defendants trot out " the Google defense " on multiple occasions : Google indexes . torrent files , so what 's wrong with our doing it ?
That point did n't sway the judge , who saw a world of difference between what the two sites did , but it did resonate with at least one Internet coder , who last week rolled out The Pirate Google .
The site serves as little more than a gateway to a Google custom search ( it simply limits all queries to . torrent files , something that any searcher can do on their own by adding " filetype:torrent " to searches ) .
It exists not so much to provide useful functionality , but to make the same point that The Pirate Bay admins made at their trial : Google indexes all of this stuff as well .
Ars spoke with the mysterious masked man ( or woman ) behind the site , who tells us that it was thrown together on Tuesday , April 21 and went live the following day .
In the week since launch , the site has garnered both publicity and traffic — nearly a million hits so far .
Why launch the site at all ?
" The purpose of the site was simply to provoke discussion on issues such as piracy , net neutrality , and the power of the Internet as a disruptor of more traditional forms of media , " we 're told , though it 's frankly refreshing to learn that the site 's backer recognizes the complexity of the arguments at play here .
" Although the site has received a great deal of support , it has also spawned many detractors .
I absolutely understand the argument that a comparison between The Pirate Bay and Google is much more nuanced then simply ' they both search copyrighted material , ' and think this criticism is quite valid . "
Indeed .
Still , our intrepid Pirate Googler is n't really out to offer an answer but to promote debate and discussion .
S/he also turns out to be something of an amateur philosopher , pointing out that " the Internet is a great equalizer , an individual such as myself is able to reach the world as effectively , and perhaps in an even more profound way than large corporations or politicians with deep pockets and connections in high places .
The threat to the established media industry and others like it wo n't simply be mitigated by winning a few lawsuits or shutting down a few popular websites .
These issues are fundamentally pervasive to our cultural development and as such their resolution can only be achieved by reconciling both the needs of industry and the public at large . "
We 're not sure that the public at large " needs " free access to prerelease Hollywood blockbusters , but the point about speech is well taken .
How else could someone 20 years ago have injected themselves into debates on networking , copyright , the public domain , and search engine law ... all within the space of a week , working from home , dropping only a ten - spot on a domain name ?
DRUG TESTS DRUG TESTS
In 10 cities surveyed by the Office of National Drug Control Policy , at least half of all men arrested tested positive for some sort of illegal drug .
2007 2008 Atlanta 67.8 % 60 % Charlotte 68.6 % 68.8 % Chicago 86.5 % 86.5 % Denver 71.1 % 67.6 % Indianapolis 65.5 % 64 % Minneapolis 63.5 % 65.1 % New York 69.2 % 69.2 % Portland , Ore. 72 % 64.1 % Sacramento 77.9 % 77.6 % Washington 68.3 % 48.6 % Source : Office of National Drug Control Policy
Half of the men arrested in 10 U.S. cities test positive for some type of illegal drug , a federal study found .
Not only do the findings show " a clear link between drugs and crime , " they also highlight the need to provide drug treatment , says Gil Kerlikowske , director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , which will make the data public Thursday .
Assessing offenders for drug and mental health problems and providing treatment is " important if you want to stop recidivism and recycling people through the system , " says Kerlikowske , who supports drug courts that offer court - ordered drug treatment .
" There 's an opportunity when someone is arrested to divert them to treatment if they need it , " says Bill Piper , director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance Network , a group that supports legalizing marijuana and treating drug use as a public health issue .
" But people should n't have to get arrested to get treatment . "
In 2008 researchers interviewed and obtained urine samples from 3,924 men arrested in 10 metropolitan areas : Atlanta , Charlotte , Chicago , Denver , Indianapolis , Minneapolis , New York , Portland , Ore . , Sacramento and Washington , D.C. In Chicago , 87 % tested positive for drug use and in Sacramento , 78 % tested positive .
Many of the men — 40 % in Chicago and 29 % in Sacramento — tested positive for more than one drug .
Marijuana is the most common drug in every city where testing was done except Atlanta , where cocaine is most prevalent , the study found .
Methamphetamine use is concentrated on the west coast where 35 % of the men arrested in Sacramento and 15 % of the men arrested in Portland tested positive for the drug .
Heroin use is highest , at 29 % , among men arrested in Chicago , an increase from 20 % in 2007 .
Heroin use among arrestees declined in Portland , from 12 % in 2007 to 8 % in 2008 .
Positive drug tests declined since 2007 among men arrested in Atlanta , Portland and Washington , the study found .
Some of that decline can be attributed to law changes , Kerlikowske says .
Portland passed laws restricting access to ingredients needed to make methamphetamine , Kerlikowske says .
Cities and states need more resources for drug treatment , says Marc Mauer , executive director of The Sentencing Project , which advocates for alternatives to incarceration .
" If you just want drug treatment , in some places you are better off getting arrested and going to drug court , " Mauer says .
" The federal resources that have gone into the drug war have been heavily oriented toward police and incarceration rather than treatment .
We need to shift that use of resources , " he says .

Their meat will not be reaching the Sunday lunch table any time soon and nobody would dare get close enough to try to milk them .
But a herd of " super cows " descended from animals bred in Nazi Germany is making an impressive sight on a farm in the south - west of England .
The " Heck " cattle were designed by brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck in an attempt to recreate the extinct European wild ox , the aurochs , an important beast in German mythology .
Only a few survived after the second world war , but farmer and conservationist Derek Gow has imported 13 of the animals from Belgium to Broadwoodwidger , on the Devon - Cornwall border , where they have joined a growing collection of beavers , polecats and water voles .
Rather than allowing his Heck cattle to be hunted , as some of the Nazi leaders wanted to do , Gow will be offering photographers the chance to take pictures of the animals .
He also hopes to begin his own breeding programme because he believes the Heck cattle may one day have an important conservation role to play , taking the place of the aurochs in the cycle of life .
Gow said his Heck cattle were much shorter than the aurochs but they did retain the muscular build , deep brown complexion and shaggy , coffee - coloured fringe .
Only one of his herd was dangerous .
" I 'm standing 2ft away from her at the moment .
If I was any closer she 'd try to kill me .
The others are just a bit nervous and jumpy . "
Gow is also a champion of the reintroduction of the beaver to the UK , believing its loss has changed the shape of the British countryside for the worse .
One of his beavers , which escaped from his farm at the end of last year , still remains on the loose .

--- No mirrors , please ---
Of the books published regarding hyperinflation , this may be the only one that provides effective strategies for operating a business under conditions of a rapidly depreciating currency .
" The Hyperinflation Survival Guide : Strategies for American Businesses " was written by Dr. Gerald Swanson ( an associate professor of economics at the University of Arizona ) .
Harry E. Figgie , Jr. sponsored the research and production of this book .
As it was originally printed in 1989 , it was way ahead of its time .
However , this does n't change the fact that this book will prove to be an excellent resource for businessmen and individuals once the Federal Reserve 's destruction of the U.S. dollar enters its terminal stage .

Last week I ended up building a distributed keystore for a client .
That was n’t my original intention , but after doing testing on just about every project out there , it turned out to be the best ( only ? ) solution for our needs .
Specifically , a production environment handling at least 100M items with an accelerating growth curve , very low latency retrievals , and the ability to handle 100s of inserts / s w/ variable - sized data ( avg 1 K , but up in many cases well beyond ) … on EC2 hardware .
The previous system had been using S3 ( since SDB is limited to 1 K values ) – err , the lesson there , BTW is do n’t do that .
So , these requirements are decent – something that actually requires a distributed system , but something that should n’t be beyond what can be handled by a few nodes .
My assumption was that I ’d actually just be doing some load testing and documenting installation on the keystore the client picked out , and that would be that .
This was not the case .
I ’m still catching up on a number of other projects , so I do n’t have a great deal of time to do a formal writeup , hoewver , the work I ’ve done may be useful for those who might actually need to implement a production keystore .
Some other recent useful starting points may be Richard Jones ’ Anti-RDBMS roundup and Bob Ippolito ’s Drop ACID and think about data Pycon talk .
MySQL – while the BDB backend is being phased out , MySQL is a good baseline .
With my testing , on a single m1.large , I was able to store 20 M items within one table at 400 inserts /s ( with key indexes ) .
Key retrievals were decently fast but sometimes variable .
There are very large production keystores are being run on MySQL setups .
Friendfeed has an interesting writeup of something they ’re doing , and I have it on good authority that there are others running very big key stores w/ very simple distribution schemes ( simple hashing into smaller table buckets ) .
If you ca n’t beat this , you should probably take your ball and go home .
Project Voldemort – Voldemort has a lot of velocity , and seems to be the de facto recommendation for distributed keystores .
A friend had used this recently on a similar - scale ( read - only ) project , and this was what I spent the majority of my time initially working with .
However , some issues …
Single node local testing was quite fast – 1000 + inserts /s , however , once run in a distributed setup , it was much slower .
After about 50 M insertions , a multinode cluster was running at < 150 inserts / s. This … was bad and led me to ultimately abandon Voldemort , although there were other issues …
There is currently only a partially complete Python client .
I added persistent connections in as well as client - side routing w/ the RouteToAll strategy , but well , see above Embedded in the previous statement is something worth mentioning – server - side routing currently does n’t exist .
While I ’m mentioning important things that do n’t exist , there is currently no way to rebalance or migrate partitions , either online , or , as far as I could tell , even offline .
This puts a damper on things , no ?
As a Dynamo implementation , a VectorClock ( automatic versioning ) is used – this is potentially a good thing for a large distributed infrastructure , but without the ability to add nodes or rebalance , it means that for a write - heavy load , it would lead to huge growth with no way for cleanup of old / unused items ( this of course , also is not implemented )
LightCloud – this is a simple layer on top of Tokyo Tyrant but the use of two hash rings was a bit confusing and the lack of production usage beyond by the author ( on a whopping 2 machines containing “ millions ” of items ) did n’t exactly inspire confidence .
Another problem was that it ’s setup was predicated on using master - master replication which requires update - logs to be turned on ( again , storing all updates == bad for my use case ) .
This was of course , discovered rooting through the source code , as the documentation ( including basic setup or recommendations for # of lookup & storage nodes , etc is nonexistent ) .
The actual manager itself was pretty weak , requiring setup and management on a per-machine basis .
I just could n’t really figure out how it was useful .
There were a number of projects that I tried , including Cassandra ( actually has some life to it now , lots of checkins recently ) , Dynomite and Hypertable that I tried and could not get compiled and or set up – my rule of thumb is that if I ’m not smart enough to get it up and running without a problem , the chances that I ’ll be able to keep it running w/o problems are pretty much nil .
There were a number of other projects that were unsuitable due to non-distributed nature or other issues like lack of durable storage or general skeeviness and so were dismissed out of hand , like Scalaris ( no storage ) , memcachedb ( not distributed , weird issues / skeeviness , issues compiling ) and redis ( quite interesting but way too alpha ) .
Oh , although not in consideration at all because of previous testing with a much smaller data set , on the skeeviness factor , I ’ll give CouchDB a special shout out for having a completely aspirational ( read : vaporware ) architectural post - it note on its homepage .
Not cool , guys .
Also , there were one or two projects I did n’t touch because I had settled on a working approach ( despite the sound of it , the timeline was super compressed – most of my testing was done in parallel with lots of EC2 test instances spun up ( loading millions of nodes and watching for performance degradation just takes a long time no matter how you slice it ) .
One was MongoDB , a promising document - based store , although I ’d wait until the auto - sharding bits get released to see how it really works .
The other was Flare , another Japanese project that sort of scares me .
My eyes sort of glazed over while looking at the setup tutorial ( although having a detailed doc was definitely a pleasant step up ) .
Again , I ’d finished working on my solution by then , but the release notes also gave me a chuckle :
released 1.0.8 ( very stable ) fixed random infinite loop and segfault under heavy load
OK , so enough with all that , What did I end up with you might ask ?
Well , while going through all this half - baked crap , what I did find that impressed me ( a lot ) , was Tokyo Cabinet and its network server , Tokyo Tyrant .
Here was something fast , mature , and very well documented with multiple mature language bindings .
Testing performance showed that storage - size / item was 1/4 of Voldemort ’s , and actually 1/ 2 of actual size ( Tokyo Cabinet comes with built - in ZLIB deflation ) .
Additionally , Tokyo Tyrant came with built - in threading , and I was able to push 1600 + inserts /s ( 5 threads ) over the network without breaking a sweat .
With a large enough bucket size , it promised to average O ( 1 ) lookups and the memory footprint was tiny .
So , it turns out the easiest thing to do was just throw up a thin layer to consistently hash the keys across a set of nodes ( starting out with 8 nodes w/ a bucket - size of 40 M – which means O ( 1 ) access on 80 % of keys at 160 M items ) .
There ’s a fair amount of headroom – I / O bottlenecks can be balanced out with more dedicated EC2 instances / EBS volumes , and the eventual need to add more nodes should n’t be too painful ( i.e. adding nodes and either backfilling the 1/n items or adding inline moves ) .
There are some issues ( an issue w/ hanging on idle sockets ) but current gets are at about 1.2 - 3 ms across the network ( ping is about 1 ms ) and it seems to otherwise be doing OK .
Anyway , if you made it this far , the takeaways :
The distributed stores out there is currently pretty half - baked at best right now .
Your comfort - level running in prod may vary , but for most sane people , I doubt you ’d want to .
If you ’re dealing w/ a reasonable number of items ( < 50 M ) , Tokyo Tyrant is crazy fast .
If you 're looking for a known , MySQL is probably an acceptable solution .
Do n’t believe the hype .
There ’s a lot of talk , but I did n’t find any public project that came close to the ( implied ? ) promise of tossing nodes in and having it figure things out .
Based on the maturity of projects out there , you could write your own in less than a day .
It ’ll perform as well and at least when it breaks , you ’ll be more fond of it .
Alternatively , you could go on the conference circuit and talk about how awesome your half - baked distributed keystore is .
UPDATE : I ’d be remiss if I did n’t stress that you should know your requirements and do your own testing .
Any numbers I toss around are very specific to the hardware and ( more importantly ) the data set .
Furthermore , most of these projects are moving at a fast clip so this may be out of date soon .
And , when you do your testing , publish the results – there ’s almost nothing out there currently so additional data points would be a big help for everyone .

Despite painful consecutive losses at the ballot box and in the courts , advocates for gay marriage are gearing up for a fight they say they can win : a statewide vote on same - sex marriage in 2010 .
But there are signs next year could be too soon for another fight on this volatile and exhausting issue .
For several reasons , the political climate in 2010 could be even less hospitable than in November , when 52 percent of the state ’s voters endorsed Proposition 8 , restricting marriage to a man and a woman .
Gay men and lesbians have since won the right to marry in several New England states and Iowa , but those victories came from legislative or judicial actions — not initiative elections .
“ The turn in 2010 is going to be markedly negative for them , ” said Frank Schubert , the Sacramento political consultant who ran the Yes on 8 campaign last year , and who would head a 2010 campaign to uphold Proposition 8 .
Schubert predicts at least a third of the 2008 electorate , particularly those young , first - time voters who turned out to vote for Barack Obama , wo n’t show up at the polls in 2010 .
“ They are not going to show up to vote for Gavin Newsom or Jerry Brown , ” he said of two potential Democratic gubernatorial nominees for 2010 .
Pointing to a new USA Today / Gallup poll that showed 57 percent of Americans oppose same - sex marriage , Schubert said California voters are fatigued with the issue .
“ We just had this debate , ” Schubert said .
“ There is a reaction by voters of , ‘ They do n’t even listen . ’ “
Ready for battle
Still , an overwhelming 69 percent of the members of Equality California — a leading statewide group backing same - sex marriage rights — said in a survey that they want to move forward on a 2010 initiative to overturn Proposition 8 , rather than wait until 2012 .
And advocates point to a new political asset they acquired in last year ’s strife over same - sex marriage — the estimated 18,000 gay and lesbian couples who legally wed in California last year before Election Day .
“ That there are 18,000 couples now , who are married and are raising families , makes a huge difference , ” said Marc Solomon , who led the successful four - year political battle to keep same - sex marriage legal in Massachusetts , and who recently became director of Equality California ’s efforts to legalize same - sex marriage here .
“ Our opponents try to scare people about what marriage equality means , ” he said , “ and what we have is the reality of marriage equality . ”
The 4 - point margin of victory for Proposition 8 was 18 points narrower than the last time voters considered the issue in 2000 , suggesting Californians are becoming less hostile to the idea over time .
But the political climate in 2010 is not likely to be substantially more favorable to gay marriage than it was in November , when a popular young Democratic presidential nominee pulled large numbers of younger voters — a group more likely to support same - sex marriage than older voters — to the polls .
And when same - sex marriage inevitably returns to the ballot , there will be new obstacles advocates did not face in 2008 .
Historically , it ’s much easier to get Californians to vote “ No ” on an initiative than to get them to vote affirmatively .
Same - sex marriage forces were seeking a “ No ” vote in 2008 , and lost .
Next time , California voters will have to vote affirmatively to create rights .
No state has yet voted in a general election to bestow same - sex marriage rights where they did not already exist .
Arizona had the first — and to date , only — statewide vote to defeat a proposed ban on same - sex marriage in 2006 , but Arizona voters reversed themselves in November and enacted a ban .
Key minority voters
Solomon ’s political victories in Massachusetts , where the state Supreme Judicial Court made the Bay State the first to legalize same - sex marriage in 2004 , were in the state Legislature .
New England states generally lack Western - style initiative government , although a new Maine law legalizing same - sex marriage could be repealed in a statewide referendum in November before it ever takes effect .
“ These kind of votes will always be close , ” said Betsy Smith , executive director of Equality Maine , which backs same - sex marriage rights .
“ That ’s just a given . ”
In California , there are political advantages to an initiative next year over 2012 , Equality California told its members in a memo this week .
All the major declared Democratic contenders for governor in 2010 back same - sex marriage , and a pro-marriage campaign will not have to compete for fundraising dollars or volunteers with a likely Obama re-election campaign in 2012 .
State politics also could be in disarray in 2012 , after the Legislature and Congress are redistricted following the 2010 census .
Demographics appear to favor the legalization of same - sex marriage , with by far the strongest opposition coming from voters over age 65 .
Solomon said minority voters will be a key target for Equality California in the coming months .
The group , which sent an appeal to members on Thursday to raise $ 500,000 in the next 88 days , plans to deploy field directors to 20 counties in Southern California and the Central Valley that produced the largest number of “ Yes ” votes for Proposition 8 .
The process of winning over the 200 Massachusetts legislators is not really different , Solomon said , from changing the minds of some of the 7 million Californians who voted Yes on Proposition 8 .
It amounts to gay men and lesbians — particularly those who married last year — telling their stories about the importance of marriage .
“ People only go one way on this issue — they go toward equality , ” Solomon said .
“ So there is no question in my mind we will prevail .
The question is when . ”

Afghanistan is President Obama 's war now , said Fred Kaplan in Slate .
Obama 's defense secretary , Robert Gates , is replacing Afghanistan commander Gen. David McKiernan , a specialist in old - school warfare , with Gen. Stanley McChrystal , a leader of an Army " new guard " that focuses on " asymmetric conflicts " and counterinsurgency .
This change is " a very big deal . "
The McChrystal decision is good if it means Obama is ready to take back control that the Bush administration handed to NATO , said Tom Donnelly in The Weekly Standard .
It 's bad if it 's the start of a " dumbing - down of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan to a narrower counterterrorism approach . "
The administration should feel a new sense of " urgency in improving the situation in Afghanistan , " but we 'll make wrong moves if the urgency becomes impatience .
It 's certainly possible that Obama picked McChrystal in haste , said Andrew Sullivan in The Atlantic .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal has a history — the man who 's now " running Obama 's war " was once " responsible for overseeing one of the worst torture and abuse centers in Iraq . "
The Pentagon certainly knew that — " I wonder if the president did . "
( CNN ) --
When George Pinon thinks of colors , he associates them with what other people have described .
George Pinon leads tour groups through Dialog in the Dark , an exhibit that simulates the blind experience .
" They say that red is supposed to be a warm color , a hot color .
I heard that apples are red and roses are red .
I heard that plants are green , the grass is green , " he said .
" That 's all you can do , you know ? "
Pinon , who lives in Atlanta , Georgia , has been blind since age 3 , when a high fever caused optic nerve damage .
He leads small tour groups through Dialog in the Dark , an exhibit traveling around the world that aims to foster understanding between people with and without vision .
For about an hour , visitors navigate different environments in complete darkness , relying on all senses except sight , and ask questions of their visually impaired guide , whose face they do n't see until leaving .
Stumbling in darkness makes the Dialog visitor appreciate how visually oriented the world is -- how would you go grocery shopping ?
How would you cross the street ? -- as well as the reliance on other senses such as sound and touch to navigate the world .
Investigating preventions , therapies
Researchers continue to search for methods of preventing and treating blindness .
A new study in the Journal of Archives of Ophthalmology shows that a single serving of fish per week is associated with a reduced risk of incident early age - related macular degeneration , a disease that is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people older than 60 .
The macula , a part of the retina that allows central vision , deteriorates in this condition .
Stem cells may also hold promise for AMD .
The London Project to Cure Blindness , with support from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer , is working on a therapy from human embryonic cells .
The project 's goal is to begin human clinical trials by 2011 .
The therapy aims to use embryonic stem cells to replace the cells that have been lost because of the disease .
Through surgery , the cells would be implanted to restore vision .

Interpreting the world
A variety of devices have been developed to help visually impaired individuals interact with the world around them .
Some of these technologies use Braille .
There are Braille codes for alphabets , mathematics , science , music and even computer programming , all based on the system of characters called cells , which consist of six dots in two parallel columns .
But fewer than 10 percent of the 1.3 million legally blind individuals in the United States read Braille , according to the National Federation of the Blind .
Only 10 percent of blind children are learning the system of raised dots that allows blind people to read and write through touch .
Reasons for this include a shortage of teachers qualified to teach Braille and misconceptions about the system , such as that it 's difficult to learn , the organization said in a recent report .
The National Federation of the Blind has worked with technology developers to enhance Braille to adapt to the needs to visually impaired people , said Mark Riccobono , executive director of the organization 's Jernigan Institute .
The organization 's International Braille and Technology Center for the Blind in Baltimore , Maryland , has nearly every tactile and speech output technology available for blind people to learn how to use .
A mechanical device called a refreshable Braille display raises and lowers a set of pins to form characters , translating words on a computer screen into Braille .
The pins refresh and translate subsequent text as the user scrolls down on a computer screen .
Riccobono , who has glaucoma and has been losing vision throughout his life , did not learn Braille as a child and believes that he missed out on literacy opportunities .
He discovered Braille in college , which cut his study time down by 50 percent , he said .
Braille is the only equivalent to print for visually impaired individuals , he said .
" Listening is not the same as actively reading something and seeing how words are spelled , " he said .
" Sometimes technology is used as an excuse to not provide Braille . "
Still , Pinon , who reads Braille , uses speech access software to browse the Internet .
He also noted that some movie theaters provide a special earpiece that has voice commentary describing what 's on screen , and some DVDs have commentary features also .
Some visually impaired individuals use a knfbReader , a device that takes a picture of text , such as a menu , and reads it back .
The Amazon Kindle , a digital reader for books and magazines , now has speech access , a feature for which the National Federation for the Blind advocated .
Read more about the voice capabilities of Kindle 2
Improving sight through technology
There are also technologies that allow visually impaired people to use other senses to orient themselves .
One new device is called BrainPort , which allows the user to " see " through the tongue .
BrainPort consists of an electrode array the size of a postage stamp on the surface of the tongue , which communicates with a digital camera , a base unit and a hand - held controller .
The device electrically stimulates the tactile receptors on the tongue .
The electrode array has a spatial map such that , as people move across a room , the vibration goes across the tongue .
" People are able to adapt and be trained to interpret this as spatial information , " said Dr. William Seiple , vice president for research at the nonprofit Lighthouse International in New York .
The device is being tested at Lighthouse , which has a mockup bedroom , bedroom and kitchen to help visually impaired individuals learn how to handle real - life situations .
Watch as one patient gets an artificial corneal transplant »
Another avenue of research is the retinal implant .
The user experiences something akin to what a person with sight sees when pressing on a closed eyelid : flashes of light , Seiple said .
The rays of the electrode in the eye produce these flashes , which the brain learns to interpret .
" We 've all done this throughout our lives , " he said .
" We have to interpret what 's out there in the world . "
Getting around without seeing
The U.S. Mint introduced the first coin with readable Braille in March , but not for general circulation .
Only 400,000 are minted , and they cost more than $ 30 each .
The National Federation of the Blind can receive surcharges from sales .
Since paper bills have no obvious tactile indicators , blind individuals can ask for their money bill by bill at the bank and fold it in different ways to know what they 're getting , Pinon said .
He tends to use debit cards when possible .
As sighted people feel around with canes in the dark at Dialog , Pinon helps them along with the sound of his voice and , for the lost ones , a gentle pat on the shoulder .
Pinon has a dog to help him navigate .
He has a wife and three children .
He even enjoys traveling , sampling the smells , tastes and sounds of foreign voices .
Moving to a new place -- from Florida to Georgia -- was somewhat challenging , but , as he told a group of Dialog visitors seated in total darkness , " You have to be adventurous and explorative and just get out and get to know the area a little bit .
" You pretty much have to be fearless , " he said .
All About Eyesight and Eye Health • Macular Degeneration
CANNES , France – Rock veterans Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno are launching a provocative new musicians ' alliance that would cut against the industry grain by letting artists sell their music online instead of only through record labels .
With the Internet transforming how people buy and listen to songs , musicians need to act now to claim digital music 's future , Gabriel and Eno argued Monday as they handed out a slim red manifesto at a huge deal - making music conference known as Midem .
They call the plan the " Magnificent Union of Digitally Downloading Artists " – or MUDDA , which has a less lofty ring to it .
" Unless artists quickly grasp the possibilities that are available to them , then the rules will get written , and they 'll get written without much input from artists , " said Eno , who has a long history of experimenting with technology .
By removing record labels from the equation , artists can set their own prices and set their own agendas , said the two independent musicians , who hope to launch the online alliance within a month .
Their pamphlet lists ideas for artists to explore once they 're freed from the confines of the CD format .
One might decide to release a minute of music every day for a month .
Another could post several recorded variations of the same song and ask fans what they like best .
Gabriel , who has his own label , Real World Records , said he is n't trying to shut down the record companies – he just wants to give artists more options .
" There are some artists who already tried to do everything on their own , " he said , adding that those musicians often found out they did n't like marketing or accounting .
" We believe there will be all sorts of models for this . "
A representative with the venture said other musicians had expressed interest in participating in the alliance , but did not provide names .
One band that has found its niche online is the jam band Phish , which sells downloads of its concerts on a popular website .
The band 's relationship with its devoted fans is often compared to that of the Grateful Dead , and the site is another chance for close contact .
But it also generates plenty of money : more than $ 2.25 million in sales since 2002 .
What 's driving the movement is the success of legitimate download sites such as Apple 's Internet music store , iTunes , which sells songs for $ 1 a pop in the United States .
Both Gabriel and Eno started their careers in the 1960s and remain immensely influential .
As a means to help unsigned artists , their effort " is certainly going to be a valuable and interesting thing to do , " said Josh Bernoff , principal analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
" But for anyone ( already ) signed it 's almost certainly a violation of their contract , " said Bernoff , who addressed the conference over the weekend .
" It 's not in a record company 's best interest to have large pieces of music out there that they do n't have control of . "
Gabriel co-founded a European company , On Demand Distribution , which runs legal download sites in 11 European countries .
The company would provide the technology for MUDDA , though Gabriel and Eno are looking for online partners .
Europe 's sites have n't yet caught up to the success of the U.S. portals .
Apple 's iTunes , for example , is planning a European launch this year , which is expected to build interest in legal downloading in a market where many people do n't realize there 's even such a thing .
Because both legal and illegal sites offer tunes a la carte , many in the industry believe they 'll make albums less important by putting the focus on catchy singles .
Eno and Gabriel both suggested they 'd welcome a chance to make songs that stand alone .
" I'm an artist who works incredibly slowly , " Gabriel said .
" If some of those ( songs ) could be made available , you do n't have to be so trapped into this old way of being confined only by the album cycle . "
The former Genesis singer and world music promoter is interested in putting multiple versions of the same song online .
He 's also looking forward to being able to hear unfinished music from other artists .
" We tend at the moment ... to try to find a moment when a song is right .
You stick the pin in the butterfly and put it in the box and you sell the box , " he said .
" Music is actually a living thing that evolves . "
I ’ve been re-evaluating my information security precautions lately , and while doing so , I discovered something interesting that I ’d like to share .
These days , most people have accounts at several different websites .
For convenience , most people use the same password for some or all of their accounts , which opens up a potential security vulnerability .
If a computer criminal manages to steal a list of usernames and passwords from a poorly - secured website , then they could try using each of these username / password pairs to log in to Paypal , for example .
As you can imagine , compromising a few thousand Paypal accounts could be quite profitable .
There are other , less - obvious ways that your passwords could be compromised as well .
As I learned from reading the EFF ’s Surveillance Self Defence guide , the New York Times website does n’t encrypt the username and password that you send them to access their articles .
If you log into the NYTimes.com website from the open WiFi provided at an airport , for example , then your username and password would be transmitted completely in the clear and could be stolen by anyone in range of the radio signal .
The recommended solution is to use a different password for each website that you use , so that the theft of one password will only give the computer criminal access to one online account and not all of them .
If you commit every one of your passwords to memory , then this strategy is very secure ; unfortunately , it also requires tremendous effort and discipline to memorize random strings of letters , numbers and punctuation .
One Option : Password Vaults
It is possible to store your passwords in an encrypted file on your hard drive , and then choose one “ master password ” that will allow you to fetch the password for a specific website out of the vault .
The master password is the only one that you need to remember .
Using this system , it will seem as though you ’re using the same password for each website .
Behind the scenes , however , each website will receive its own unique password .
This is a reasonable option , but it has some disadvantages .
First , you must have a good backup strategy in place , because losing your vault file would mean losing access to all of your accounts .
If you follow the advice of some security experts and set your password recovery questions to gibberish , the loss of your vault would be that much more difficult to recover from .
Second , this system is a bit inconvenient for accessing your accounts when you are away from your main computer .
If you go to an Internet cafe in some other country , perhaps you could bring your password vault on a USB thumb drive , but what if the cafe does n’t allow users to plug in their own USB drives ?
Or perhaps the cafe ’s computers run Mac OS X and you do n’t have compatible decryption software on the thumb drive .
I believe that it should be possible to develop a partially web - based password vault program that overcomes these problems , but no such program currently exists , as far as I know .
The Solution : Password Hashing
The basic idea behind password hashing is to take a master password of your choice and combine it with a value specific to the website that you wish to access .
This combined value is then run through a “ hash function ” that creates a random - looking string of letters , numbers and punctuation .
This random - looking string will be the password for that specific website .
It ’s pretty simple once you get the idea ; perhaps an example would help .
Suppose that you choose “ 123456 ” to be your master password , and you wish to access your Facebook account .
The password hashing software will combine “ 123456 ” with a value representing the website ; in this case , that would likely be “ facebook ” .
The resulting password is “ 9 bMxDooTmtwh7AX $ ” .
Nothing is stored on your hard - drive , so there ’s nothing to backup .
When you ’re away from your main computer , it is possible to browse to a web - based version of the password hashing software .
This online version should n’t need to transmit anything over the Internet in order to generate the password for any of your websites .
If an attacker manages to acquire one , or even all of your site - specific passwords , they will still be no closer to figuring out what your master password is , thanks to the special properties of the hash functions used for this purpose .
This system has one more great security benefit : protection against phishing attacks .
Suppose that an attacker tricks you into visiting a fraudulent copy of eBay with the address “ www.eboy.com”.
The website would look legitimate , but have a slightly different address than the real thing .
If you then try to log in to this fraudulent web - site , the password hashing software would combine “ 123456 ” with “ eboy ” to create the hashed password “ 2dsOpJdTv$ q9Aook ” .
This is completely different than your real eBay password , “ c+qw5XtUrJyLF2wM ” , created by combining “ 123456 ” with “ ebay ” .
The password stolen by the computer criminals is useless !
Password Hashing Software
One of the most popular password hashing programs is Stanford PwdHash , and with good reason .
It is simple , elegant and it just works .
When you visit a website that you wish to log in to , you simply type “ @@ ” followed by your master password into the website ’s password field .
PwdHash automatically substitutes the hashed password before transmitting the login information .
Anyone watching over your shoulder would n’t even know you were doing anything special .
It is definitely my favorite password hashing program , and it pains me that I ca n’t use it .
Sometimes a program can be too simple .
PwdHash has no options or customizability of any kind .
Any hashed password that is generated by PwdHash is always exactly two characters longer than the master password .
As I was half - way through converting all of my accounts to PwdHash , I discovered that some of the websites that I use had restrictions on the length and composition of the passwords that they would accept .
Specifically , it always seemed to be the websites for banks and financial institutions that would only accept weak passwords .
I know this is n’t really relevant here , but I have to ask : what is wrong with the banks ?
They make billions of dollars in profits but ca n’t spare enough hard drive space to store more than 8 characters for a password ?
Or maybe they just decided that 8 characters is good enough security for what they ’re protecting , because of course my life savings is so much less valuable than my list of favorite movies on Facebook .
Ahem .
Sorry about that .
Anyway , when it comes to password hashing in the real world , the best option that I ’ve found is the unimaginatively named “ Password Hasher “ .
It ’s basically the same as PwdHash , except that you can specify the length and characteristics of the passwords that are generated .
There are a few small usability problems that prevent me from endorsing it wholeheartedly .
Here ’s how the program works .
First , you visit the website , enter your username and tab down to the password field .
Then you activate the plugin through a keyboard shortcut , and a pop - up window appears into which you type your master password .
When you press “ Enter ” , the pop -up closes and the password field on the web page is populated with the generated password .
All well and good , but you must then press “ Enter ” again to actually submit the username and password and enter the website .
Pressing “ Enter ” twice to log in is a bit annoying , but you get used to it .
Another problem is the bizarre default keyboard shortcut for activating the pop-up : CTRL - F6 .
I recommend immediately changing it to something a little more convenient .
I use CTRL - semicolon ( see the FAQ for directions on changing the shortcut ) .
Overall , despite these niggling issues , the program performs admirably .
If you ’re seriously thinking about implementing this security strategy , I recommend making a list of all of your online accounts ( not an easy task , I assure you ) and then figuring out which websites , if any , have annoying password restrictions that rule out the use of PwdHash .
In all honesty , if you ’re a serious Internet user , Password Hasher is probably your best option .
Since you ’ve read this far , I can assume that you ’re pretty serious about securing your information , so why not give it a try ?
If you have any other questions , leave a comment and I ’ll do my best to help .
The reference to Mr Harris 's disability was accidentally included A Hull man says he was " shocked " by a letter from council contractors addressing him as Mr Blindman .
Paul Harris , of the Wincolmlee area , who was only registered blind late last year , received the letter from Kier Building Maintenance on Wednesday .
" I just could n't believe it , " said Mr Harris .
" Words just can't explain how I feel , I 'm really upset . "
The company apologised saying the error happened when Mr Harris 's disability was mistakenly entered on its database .
The letter was sent to Mr Harris to inform him that modifications were to be carried out on his home as part of the Hull City Council 's Decent Homes programme .
" I was literally horrified that they can send anything through the post saying ' Dear Mr Blindman ' about your disability , " said Mr Harris .
" I was just so shocked .
Mr Harris had only recently been registered as blind " You would n't send a letter to a person who 's got Down 's Syndrome saying Dear Mr Down 's Syndrome would you ? "
Ann Massam , from Hull and East Riding Institute for the Blind , said : " He has recently been registered as blind and that in itself is enough to come to terms with .
" Then to get something like this through the post , it just should n't happen . "
A Kier spokesperson said : " We sincerely apologise to Mr Harris for the distress caused by this error .
" The letter was part of a routine mail - out about Decent Homes work being carried out in his property .
" Any information relating to customers ' personal circumstances are entered into a remarks column on a database .
" Unfortunately , information about Mr Harris ' disability was accidentally entered into the name column , which was not noticed prior to the letter being sent . "
He said an internal investigation was under way to determine how the error occurred and ensure it did not happen again .
" We have visited Mr Harris to apologise and explained the error , and a letter of apology will be sent to him , " the spokesman added .

THE debate seems to resurface every few years .
Do some lipsticks contain lead ?
If so , is the amount so negligible that consumers have nothing to be concerned about ?
Or will all those years of applying lipstick several times a day add up to a worrisome accumulation of a dangerous substance ?
On one side are advocacy groups and doctors who insist that , over time , those who wear lipstick containing lead are at risk of absorbing high levels of a neurotoxin that may cause behavioral , learning and other problems .
On the other side are the Food and Drug Administration and outside experts who say that any traces of lead that do exist are too minute to cause harm .
In February , the debate reared its head again when the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics , a coalition of health and environmental groups , issued a plea to the F.D.A. to release information the agency had accumulated on the amount of lead in lipstick .
The study was conducted in response to an independent analysis in 2007 , paid for by the safe cosmetics group , which found that one - third of 33 lipsticks had lead in excess of 0.1 parts per million , the federal limit for candy .
Among the worst offenders were L’Oreal Colour Riche “ True Red ” lipstick ( with a lead content of 0.65 parts per million ) and Cover Girl ’s Incredifull Lipcolor “ Maximum Red ” ( 0.56 p.p.m. ) .
Price had nothing to do with lead levels : less expensive brands , like a $ 1.99 tube of Wet and Wild Mega Colors “ Cherry Blossom , ” contained no lead , whereas a $ 24 tube of Dior Addict “ Positive Red ” contained 0.21 p.p.m .

The service will be available later in the year and charge a monthly fee
The founder of online streaming games firm OnLive has defended the technology underpinning the service after accusations it was unworkable .
Steve Perlman said critics had not even used the system .
OnLive turns games into video data sent across the net to a hardware add - on , or software plug - in , which decompresses the data back into video .
The firm says a revolutionary video compression algorithm and custom silicon makes it possible .
OnLive has been in development for the last seven years and has signed up content partners , including EA , Ubisoft , Take2 , Eidos , Atari , Codemasters , Epic and THQ
The subscription service will feature games such as Burnout , Fear 2 , Tomb Raider : Underworld and Crysis : Warhead .
We are not doing video encoding in the conventional sense
Steve Perlman , OnLive Mr Perlman , who led the early developments into video streaming service QuickTime while at Apple , told BBC News : " We have nine of the largest game publishers in world signed up .
" They have spent several years in some cases actually going and reviewing our technology before allowing us to associate with their company names and allowing us to have access to their first - tier franchises . "
The service has raised eyebrows in some quarters given the difficulties of encoding High Definition video in near real time at servers in data centres , and streaming it over the open internet to a user .
Delivering real - time streaming game play is seen by some as an insurmountable problem , even before factoring in the necessity of sending back telemetry from a game controller across the net to the data centre .
" We are not doing video encoding in the conventional sense , " explained Mr Perlman , dismissing an article in gaming website Eurogamer that said the service was unworkable .
" It 's a very ignorant article , " said Mr Perlman , who said Eurogamer had conflated issues of frame rate and latency .
" They are independent factors , " he said .
OnLive has said it has created a video compression algorithm designed specifically for video games that can encode and compress video into data in about one millisecond .
So far nine big game publishers have signed up to the service A custom - built silicon chip designed by OnLive does the actual encoding calculations at the server end , as well as the decompression at the gamer end , inside a cheap hardware add - on .
Mr Perlman said it had taken " tens of thousand " of man hours to develop the algorithm .
He said : " First of all it was a postage stamp size screen with no latency over the internet .
It looked like the silliest kind of game because the screen size was smaller than a cell phone but nonetheless there was no lag .
" We were running Quake actually - or micro quake as we called it .
It was very unimpressive to anyone apart from an engineer . "
The algorithm is not perfect .
You will sometimes see little artefacts on the screen
Steve Perlman , OnLive
After years spent refining the technology OnLive has said it was able to make the video window bigger and bigger until achieving a resolution of 1280 by 720 at 60 frames per second .
Technologists contacted by BBC
News said that that level and speed of video encoding would not be " beyond the bounds of credibility " but would require custom hardware .
The algorithm was developed on dual quad core Xeon processors , which cost thousands of pounds , but OnLive have said they have distilled it down so it can run on a custom chip which costs " under 20 bucks to make " .
Mr Perlman said the chip was " high performance for video compression " , running at less than 100 Mhz clock speed and drawing about two watts of power .
" We can make millions of these things .
Because of the economy there is plenty of excess capacity in fabrication plants . "
Mr Perlman said OnLive had already ordered a " very large batch " .
He said the OnLive experience was almost as good as sitting in front of a console and playing a game .
" The algorithm is not perfect .
You will sometimes see little artefacts on the screen .
Video compression is part science and part art .
Net imperfections " Every time you present new material to it , you will see something it does not compress so well .
We note those and correct the algorithm . "
Mr Perlman said the algorithm had been designed with the imperfections of the internet in mind .
" Rather than fighting against the internet ... and dropped , delayed or out of order packets we designed an algorithm that deals with these characteristics .
" Every compression algorithm leaves something out .
It 's about figuring out what kind of stuff you drop out . "
OnLive said a broadband connection of 5 M bps will be fast enough for high definition gaming , while 1.5 M bps will be sufficient for standard definition .
At those speeds and with a data centre no further than 1,000 miles away for any gamer in the US the inevitable latency of the net as data has to physically travel across the network is within tolerable limits , said Mr Perlman .
The MicroConsole connects the TV to the internet OnLive currently has two data centres in the US running a beta version of the service .
In order to minimise lag across when the commercial service goes live at the end of 2009 the company has said it will need five data centres around the country .
" The round trip latency from pushing a button on a controller and it going up to the server and back down , and you seeing something change on screen should be less than 80 milliseconds .
" We usually see something between 35 and 40 milliseconds . "
The games themselves will be running on " off the shelf motherboards " at the data centres .
The company has calculated that each server will be dealing with about 10 different gamers , because of the varying demands games have on hardware .
" Most games run fine on dual core processors .
What you really want is a high performance graphics processor unit , " said Mr Perlman .
He said that while work continued on refining the algorithm the bulk of the technical work had been completed .
A wider beta test begins this summer and feedback from the testing will be used to refine the service .

DOG owners have been put on notice after a record fine was imposed on a Sydney man whose pit bull mauled and killed another dog .
Nick Raptis , 34 , of Beverly Park , was fined $ 20 , 223 and disqualified from owning a dog for three years after his American pit bull terrier Hannibal attacked a Maltese - silky cross terrier being walked by its owner at Carss Park , in Sydney 's south , in April last year .
Happier times ... Jennifer Aldridge and her pet dog Honey at Cronulla Beach six weeks before the dog was mauled and killed .
Jennifer Aldridge , 22 , had been walking her dog Honey when the pit bull charged , dragging it out of its collar and onto a road , where the pit bull began eating Honey .
The woman 's husband , Murray , tried to stop the attack by beating the dog with a shovel , but had to stop when it bared its teeth at him .

For a federal agency that has struggled for years to modernize its computer systems , this is pretty impressive , and just a tad worrisome :
Sometime yesterday afternoon , a woman named Liz Thompson posted this tweet : " Roh -oh , looking at an email in my spam folder from Federal Bureau of Investigations saying , " Message from FBI . "
Dare I delete ? "
Not longer after , @FBIPressOffice replied , " @thisfullhouse Yes , you dare .. and report it to our internet crime complaint center : » link to ic3.gov . "
Thompson seemed a bit surprised by the interaction , tweeting " They ARE watching , " and then , in reply to two friends , " I know , kinda scary ... and wild , right ?
Aaand , it came in right after my Tweet .
Covering up my webcam , just in case :( . "
Obviously , someone in the FBI Press Office is tracking references to the agency on Twitter and has the authority to respond , an echo of efforts in the private sector by companies like JetBlue to be more responsive to immediate complaints or issues raised by consumers .
The agency is also using the service to track more serious matters , like this case of an Oklahoma man who was allegedly issuing violent threats around the " tea - bagging " protests a few weeks ago .
[ A big tip of the hat to Chuck Thies , for bringing this to my attention .}
First , read David McLaughlin's Ugly Perl : A lesson in the importance of API design , and the comments .
The piece itself is n't short , but it 's worthwhile .
The most important high level concept is near the start :
What we took away from that evaluation process is that , more than choice of programming language , more than choice of development paradigm and more than choice of development methodology , good API design is the single most important factor in how developers perceive the quality of code .
Introducing the code review process to our team only confirmed this : almost every review I 've taken part in has revolved around naming conventions and style rather than performance or implementation .
David 's choice of jQuery as an example illustrates that point nicely .
Solving a problem in an elegant way is sometimes compelling enough that people will switch technologies , even if there are other drawbacks .
( I admire how little effort it takes to deploy a PHP application , and how little code you have to write to create a CRUD application in Ruby on Rails .
There may be big flaws in both approaches beyond that point , but each technology solves one problem in an elegant way . )
The opposite argument also applies .
A solution which looks clunky may turn off people :
package MyDatabase :: Main ; use base qw / DBIx :: Class :: Schema / ; __PACKAGE__->load_namespaces ; 1 ;
One of my favorite modules is CLASS .
It 's really simple and really stupid , but look how much prettier that code sample is :
package MyDatabase :: Main ; use CLASS ; use base ' DBIx :: Class :: Schema ' ; CLASS->load_namespaces ; 1 ;
Okay , I also replaced the bletcherous qw/ / syntax with something less syntactically noisy , but is n't CLASS easier to read than __PACKAGE__ ?
What if my class patch had been accepted ?
class MyDatabase :: Main is DBIx :: Class :: Schema { use CLASS ; CLASS->load_namespaces ; }
None of this is rocket science .
It 's barely any work modifying the Perl 5 parser ( at least once you accept that sometimes adding features is worth the pain of telling people with 15 year old code that they have to add a single line to make it forward compatible ) .
The changes themselves are very simple .
They 're surface changes .
They 're just syntax .
The guts of Perl do n't have to change at all .
Yet what a difference a little bit of syntax makes .
As the first commenter on Unshortening URLs with Modern Perl wrote , " Modern Perl looks sexy ! "
David 's absolutely right that beauty and elegance are important to APIs .
How much more important are they to languages .
In my mind , that 's what makes iterating languages so important : how else can you help people write beautiful code ?
Circumcision should be routinely considered as a way to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections , argue US experts .
They spoke out after research found circumcision significantly cut the risk of infection with herpes and the cancer - causing human papillomavirus .
Circumcision is known to sharply reduce the risk of HIV infection .
But the study , featured in the New England Journal of Medicine , failed to convince UK experts .
Yeah , no kidding .
People in Africa must think Americans are a strange people given their obsession with ( pardon the following ) surgically removing the foreskins of an entire continent of men .
I loved this quote from the BBC .
Dr Colm O’Mahony , a sexual health expert from the Countess of Chester Foundation Trust Hospital in Chester , said the US had an “ obsession ” with circumcision being the answer to controlling sexually transmitted infections .
Is there some sort of circumcision lobby of doctors who perform this procedure on ( gulp ) adult men ?
If so , can I buy stock in it ?
This is bordering on pathological .
Dr O’Mahony also said pushing circumcision as a solution sent the wrong message .
“ It suggests that it is women who infect innocent men – let ’s protect the innocent men .
“ And it allows men who do n’t want to change their irresponsible behaviour to continue to sleep around and not even use a condom . ”
Exactly .
And just a reminder that Africans are n’t falling for it .
Supporters of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) demand the sacking of army chief of staff Rookmangud Katawal on April 28 .
* * *
STOP PRESS -- Ben Peterson from Kathmandu reports on May 3 , 2009 , at 3 pm :
This morning the Maoists in government made the decision to remove General Katawal from his position of chief of army staff after his repeated political insubordination .
This follows 10 days of trying to reach consensus with the other political parties , up until a final cross-party meeting this morning .
Failing to achieve consenus , the goverment ordered Katawal 's retirement .
Reactionary and anti-democractic forces are trying to unseat the elected government .
The major coalition partners in government , the Madheshi Peoples Right Forum and the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninst ) have reportedly left the government , and the major opposition party , the Nepali Congress , has small groups of supporters in the streets , disrupting traffic and burning tyres .
Allarmingly , the chief of army staff has not accepted his removal , and is attempting to meet with other members of the millitary .
It is becoming clear that the political opposition , including parties previously within the government , are trying to find ways to destroy the Maoist government and to remove it from any form of power .
This situation is changing by the minute , but it is clear that very important and decisive struggles are playing out as we speak .
At the same time , there are rallies in various places in support of the government and the Maoist party 's decision .
The support for this decision and the government as a whole is widespread and while life is generally unaffected away from the major roads , there is an increasingly tense situation in Kathmandu .
May 3 , 2009 , 4 pm : I have just come from a press conference at the prime minister 's office .
The meeting was first addressed by minister of communications and information , and spokesperson of the government , Krishna Mahara .
He informed those present that the just completed cabinet meeting had declared that the actions of the president in reinstating the chief of army staff was illegal , and sent him a letter demanding he revoke his decision .
He also said that the cabinet meeting had also accepted the resignations that had been presented by the ministers from the CPN ( UML ) and the Sabdhavana party .
After this Prachanda addressed the nation .
He announced that he had resigned from his position as prime minister .

Kathmandu , April 29 , 2009 -- After the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) ( UCPN -M ) won three by - elections in April , it is facing fresh resistance by the old elite .
Nepal 's elite is seeking to stop the UCPN ( Maoist ) push for a “ New Nepal ” .
This has included front - page exposures of a coup plot to overthrow the elected Maoist - led government .
The centre of the storm is the move , begun on April 19 , by the UCPN ( Maoist ) - led coalition government to remove the chief of army staff Rookmangud Katawal .
This follows a long dispute between the military high command and the elected civilian government .
Katawal has refused to implement government instructions .
The April by - elections proved that the program of the UCPN ( Maoist ) for a new Nepal has popular support .
Occurring in six constituencies that had been left vacant in the past year , the by - elections took place in areas across the country , encompassing different ethnic groups and where the main political parties are powerful .
This meant the by - elections were a good reflection of the political mood .
Although only a fraction of people could vote , and the small number of seats at stake would not affect the balance of power within the parliament , the by - elections were seen as significant in the wider political struggle .
Despite what was widely predicted , UCPN ( Maoist ) support increased .
This is despite constant media attacks on the government and its difficulties in implementing most of its program .
The UCPN - M retained two previously held seats and won a third .
The other three seats went to the right - wing Nepalese Congress , the Communist Party of Nepal ( Unified Marxist - Leninist ) and the Madheshi People ’s Rights Forum .
The popular uprising and a Maoist - led “ people ’s war ” brought down Nepal ’s centuries - old monarchy , opening the way for constituent assembly elections one year ago .
Against expectations , the Maoists , whose support is based on the poor , won the largest number of seats .
Since then , right - wing forces , backed by foreign powers , have sought to weaken the UCPN ( Maoist ) - led government and drive back the momentum for genuine change .
The UCPN ( Maoist ) has deep roots within poor communities , through its work in local areas , among youth , women , peasants , and in the trade unions .
So far , the campaign by the right - wing forces that dominate much of the state and media have failed to sever these links .
` New ' Nepal
The perspectives of the UCPN ( Maoist ) for a new Nepal include creating secular , democratic republic ; a new democratised military based on merging the formerly royalist Nepal Army with the Maoist People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) ; and fighting discrimination against ethnic minorities , women and the lower castes .
A minimum wage has already been created and the UCPN ( Maoist ) program promises to guarantee employment .
National industry will be prioritised to promote development .
Workers will have the right to take part in management .
The UCPN ( Maoist ) also promotes land reform based on the principle of “ land to those who work it ” .
The public education system will be expanded and made free at lower levels .
Private education institutions charging high fees will be regulated and phased out .
Ethnic minorities will have the right to education in their own language .
A literacy campaign has been launched by volunteers , to combat an illiteracy rate around 50 % .
Recognising that health is a human right , the Maoists plan to significantly develop the healthcare system from its current decrepit state — especially in poor rural areas .
Suresh Kumar Ale Maga , a UCPN ( Maoist ) member of parliament , told Green Left Weekly that , for the UCPN ( Maoist ) , a new Nepal meant “ a Nepal on the way to socialism ” .
Army sabotage
Following its victory in the by - elections on this program , the UCPN -M has pressed ahead with plans to restructure the state .
The existing structures , inherited from the monarchy , have proved resistant to change .
This has sparked fierce resistance from the opposition , the foreign embassies and the army .
This has put the ongoing peace process , in which the PLA agreed to end its armed struggle , in jeopardy .
Facing attacks from various sides , the UCPN ( Maoist ) has responded with daily street demonstrations across the country .
The core issue is the need for control by the elected government over the state , with its entrenched bureaucracy .
There have been many controversies involving the army .
In February , the army recruited several thousand soldiers against the orders of the government , the supreme court and the interim constitution — and in direct violation of the peace process .
The army again challenged the government when it reinstated eight generals who had been retired by the defence ministry on March 16 .
Finally , the army staged a boycott of the recently held National Games when the PLA was allowed to compete .
The open disloyalty of the royalist military towards the elected civilian government represents an obvious threat to democracy .
For the security of Nepal , it is essential that the military be restructured and brought back under the control of the government .
The Nepal Army has changed only in name from the old Royal Nepal Army , which backed an anti-democratic coup to reinstate absolute royal rule in 2005 .
The retirement of the chief of army staff is an initial step in a process aimed at creating the new democratic armed forces as part of the struggle to create new , democratic state structures .
The basis of the opposition to such moves is the question of power .
People in positions of state power in Nepal , be it in the bureaucracy , judiciary or military , feel threatened by the process of change .
The political opposition unites those within the fabric of the old society seeking to prevent the creation of the new .
Resistance to change in the military is part of the struggle of the rich and powerful .
The elite views the military as its armed wing against radical change .
However , recent Nepalese history has shown that the real power in society is not to be found at the top .
Rather , it rests in the people .
There have been demonstrations every day by Maoist supporters calling for Katawal 's retirement .
Combined with the by - election results , it puts beyond doubt the fact that popular sentiment is behind the government and supports change .

Our rulers are destroying the economy .
Not little by little , as they usually do , but in huge swaths .
Each great assault on the free market , whether it be denominated a bailout , a stimulus , or some other species of purported salvation , brings us visibly closer to the complete ruin of an economic order that required centuries to build .
Awestruck , as if we were observing a tsunami sweep across an island , we can only watch the rulers ’ devastating actions , for which , strange to say , they expect the public to be grateful ―and , truth be told , most people are grateful , and clamor for more of the same .
We listen to the kingpins ’ lunatic ravings as they describe their perceptions of the current situation and solemnly declare their determination to “ do something ” to restore the prosperity that they themselves have demolished by previously “ doing something ” of the very same kind .
They gaze out at a financial debacle rooted in various government policies that induced lenders to do business with millions of borrowers who had no realistic prospect of repaying the loans .
And what do these berguardians propose ?
They aim to relieve the unfaithful borrowers of their contractual obligations , to purchase the disappointed lenders ’ “ toxic assets , ” and to “ get credit moving again , ” so that new loans will be made , again at artificially reduced interest rates to borrowers who have no realistic prospect of repaying them .
They are pouring credit madness on credit madness because they have no real understanding of how the economic world actually works and , even if they did understand , they are politically beholden to the owners and managers of failing economic behemoths who profited handsomely from the artificial prosperity of the boom and are now staring into the abyss .
Our forebears have stood in a similar position on previous harrowing occasions , and the sense of utter helplessness we feel now resembles the one they felt then .
When the world was rushing toward total war in the late 1930s , every intelligent person could imagine the abattoir toward which the great leaders were dragging their nations , yet no one could pull them back from the appalling destruction into which they seemed hell - bent to plunge .
In 1939 , in his poem “ In Memory of W. B. Yeats , ” W. H. Auden wrote :
In the nightmare of the dark All the dogs of Europe bark , And the living nations wait , Each sequestered in its hate ; Intellectual disgrace Stares from every human face
And the seas of pity lie Locked and frozen in each eye .
Though everyone foresaw the catastrophe , no one could pull the leaders back from its execution .
I experienced this sense of powerlessness in 2002 as I watched the Bush administration rushing headlong toward its murderous attack on the Iraqis .
On September 23 of that year , I gave vent to my feelings in an article called “ Helplessly , We Await the Catastrophe Our Rulers Are Creating . ”
“ Today , ” I wrote ,
the dogs of war are barking not in Europe , but in the District of Columbia , and again people are looking on helplessly as the tragedy unfolds .
We see the disaster being designed and touted , we observe the intellectual disgrace staring from the faces of George W. Bush and his advisers , and we note the seas of pity lying locked and frozen in their eyes .
Yet we can do nothing to prevent the makers of this coming calamity from carrying out the devastation .
The calamity that Bush and his government wrought in Iraq has now become a chronic , seemingly permanent condition , a pain that never eases , an emergency destined to continue as far as the eye can see , and nearly everybody has given up hope that anything good will ever come out of it , or even that its daily horrors will ever do anything but continue to erupt episodically in spasms of political madness and haphazard violence .
Iraq , however , is thousands of miles away , and few Americans could keep their attention focused on it for long , in any event .
Now that the financial mess and the deepening recession are affecting all Americans and raising fears about the whole country ’s future economic well - being , Iraq has been relegated to brief articles on page A - 23 of the newspaper .
The economic crisis had become overwhelmingly the foremost concern , and on this front , good news has been a very scarce commodity for the past year .
In the present situation , the formula our rulers employ to guide their actions is simple : borrow and spend ―the more , the better .
If reminded that the government cannot accumulate ever more debt without grave repercussions , they always answer that the present emergency is so pressing that concern about the future must be set aside until the present exigencies have been met .
It is not clear that they sincerely believe the economic drivel they dispense to the news media .
Perhaps they are merely cunning enough to appreciate Rahm Emanuel ’s admonition , “ You never want a serious crisis to go to waste . ”
My sense , however , especially when I ponder the way in which they describe the economic situation and justify their proposals for repairing it , is that they have virtually no sound understanding of basic economics , and no interest in acquiring such an understanding , either .
If the top dogs of the power elite are already living their lives in a reprehensible manner , it probably does not contribute to their happiness to dwell on the possibility that , in the process , they may also be contributing to public ruin .
Whether they are fools or charlatans , or both , as I suppose them to be , their actions amount to a genuine tragedy , because their leadership , so long as the people tolerate it , portends only devastation .
The people , in the main , are afraid , and they are immoral , so they are happy to seize any momentary advantage or enrichment the government will hand them , regardless of the moral breach this coercive transfer of wealth represents .
The rulers understand the people ’s moral weakness and exploit it at every turn .
Their own example of thoroughgoing corruption , of course , only coarsens the entire society ’s moral character ―after all , what sort of people tolerates , much less affirmatively supports , such creeps in high places ?
In the body politic , however , the masses are the tail , not the dog .
The rulers , like tigers who lie in wait near a spring , knowing that their prey will eventually come there to drink , tempt the people to indulge their appetites for ill - gotten gain , and , sure enough , the masses need not be invited twice .
It does not occur to the diners that this repast consists of tainted meat , and therefore that in due course they must suffer the consequences of having swallowed toxic fare .
Artificially easy credit , rapid monetary growth , subsidized homeownership for people who cannot make the mortgage payments , exclusive privileges granted to dishonest bond - rating agencies , explicit and implicit government guarantees of bank accounts , bonds , and other financial assets ―these policies and others that tend in the same direction have created our present economic difficulties .
To suppose , and to act on the supposition , that precisely these same kinds of policies will repair the day is supreme folly .
To augment these mistakes by expending a trillion borrowed dollars in new government outlays for whatever suits the grasping members of a totally corrupt Congress only compounds the folly on a cosmic scale .
Yet , no struggling firm or family wants to fail , and each prefers to survive the day without having to make painful adjustments , even if doing so requires supping disgracefully at the state ’s filthy trough .
The Best of Robert Higgs
It 's important to know that Sam Dodson is n't being charged with filming inside a courthouse in defiance of the law .
That 's important , because he was arrested for videorecording in the lobby of the Keene District Court , in Keene , New Hampshire , during the course of media coverage of a case there .
Dodson 's camera use defied the wishes of a judge who banned photography anywhere in the courthouse despite a state - wide policy permitting cameras in the courtrooms themselves .
To top it off , it 's likely that the judge 's policy is rooted in nothing more than embarrassment that one of his courtroom tantrums was filmed and uploaded to YouTube last year .
Dodson , a professional videographer , independent journalist , and member of the libertarian Free State Project , was at the Keene District Court on April 13 , 2009 , to cover the arraignment , ironically enough , of Dave Ridley , another Free Stater , for video recording at court .
In the lobby , camera in hand , he was ordered to turn off his equipment based on a flyer taped to the wall banning photography .
Seeing that the flyer cited no legal basis , he refused .
And so he was arrested -- as were several other people supportive of Dodson .
Only Dodson remains in jail , on a hunger strike , a month later .
Officials keep him confined on $ 10,000 cash bail because he refuses to formally give his legal name -- an exercise of his right to remain silent -- as a protest against his arrest .
Of course , his identity is known to the authorities .
The arrest seems to fly in the face of court policies clarified and formalized just last year .
As the Keene Sentinel reports :
The rules for recording public hearings in courtrooms are relatively clear :
The Supreme Court says it ’s allowed unless “ there is a substantial likelihood of harm to any person or other harmful consequence . ”
But those foggy gray areas beyond the courtrooms remain untouched by state law .
The specific district court rule states :
The presiding judge should permit the media to photograph , record and broadcast all courtroom proceedings that are open to the public .
The presiding judge may limit electronic media coverage if there is a substantial likelihood of harm to any person or other harmful consequence .
If recording is permitted inside the courtroom , why would it not be permitted in the lobby and hallways open to the public , where security concerns would seem to be minimal ?
According to the Sentinel , Judge Edward J. Burke banned photography in the courthouse " in an effort to protect juveniles and victims of crimes walking through the lobby from being caught on film without their consent . "
That seems like a tenuous excuse given that people run the risk of being photographed in any public place at any time .
A more likely reason for the ban is Burke 's mortification over a video of him throwing a courtroom tantrum in November of last year .
In that video , Burke repeatedly snapped " have a seat " at a defendant before ordering the man arrested just seconds later .
The seemingly confused defendant had begun to sit in compliance with an order to do so , then stopped and began to stand when his name was called .
Viewed over 58,000 times , the video portrays Burke as petulant and petty .
That video just slightly predates Burke 's February general ban on photography in the courthouse .
As of today , Dodson is charged with disorderly conduct , resisting arrest or detention and refusing to be processed .
All of these charges would seem to be related to the arrest itself and its aftermath , not to Dodson 's supposedly forbidden camera use .
Perhaps the authorities are n't as certain about the legal basis for Burke 's photography ban as they 'd like the public to believe .
And , as of today , photography remains forbidden in the lobby of the Keene District Court -- not as a matter of law that anybody can cite , but to spare a hot - tempered judge further shame .
Dodson 's docket number is 09 - CR - 01825-1828 .
An audio recording of Sam Dodson 's arrest can he heard below .

Trapped on a Pacific Island Scientists Research the Real Robinson Crusoe
Generations of children have been spellbound by Robinson Crusoe 's exploits , but few are aware of the real - life figure who inspired the classic .
Now , 300 years after he left his island prison , scientists have pieced together how the real Crusoe managed to survive .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Authorities moved to evacuate thousands of people from a second Australian town Friday as floodwaters from days of torrential rain inundated large parts of the country ’s east coast .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
About 5,000 residents in Lismore , in northern New South Wales ( NSW ) state , were evacuated from their homes as floodwaters , in some places more than 10 meters ( 32 feet ) deep , surged across riverlands stretching along 300 km ( 185 miles ) of coastline .
Authorities also urged 9,000 people to evacuate the nearby town of Grafton , with floodwaters up to 8 meters deep expected to hit the town late Friday .
State authorities declared disaster zones in six areas , unlocking government help .
“ The declaration will provide for a range of assistance to cover personal hardship and distress as well as funding for those who have suffered property damage , ” NSW Premier Nathan Rees said .
The flooding followed days of rain and cyclonic winds which battered southern Queensland state and northern NSW , killing one man and trapping hundreds of people as roads were cut , forcing authorities to use helicopters to rescue some .
The storms left 16,000 people without power as fallen trees brought down lines and blocked roads .
Floodwaters washed cars into the sea and huge waves pounded major ports , including the world ’s biggest coal export port at Newcastle , where ship movements were disrupted .
“ There have been some vessel disruptions , but effects on coal throughput are negligible , ” a spokesman for Port Waratah Coal Services Limited told Reuters .
Rivers burst banks at the towns of Murwillumbah , Tweed Heads and Grafton , although major coal - mining operations to the north and west in Queensland were unaffected .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered help to flood - hit areas .
“ It is critical residents follow the instructions of local authorities and as far as possible stay indoors and avoid the roads , ” Rudd said .
Further south near Coffs Harbour , the Bellinger River was expected to peak at more than 8 meters , with more than 3,000 people isolated in the towns of Thora , Darkwood and Bellingen .
In southeast Queensland , hundreds of roads remained cut on Friday , with homes flooded and industrial suburbs in popular tourist beach areas transformed into canals .
While the rain had mostly moved south Friday , a massive clean - up operation in the state continued as beaches were swamped with huge waves and high tides .

Appearing on the Alex Jones Show today , founder - pastor of Crossroad Baptist Church and presidential nominee of the Constitution Party for the 2008 U.S. Presidential election , Chuck Baldwin , talked about the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) report designating Baldwin , Ron Paul , Bob Barr supporters and Libertarians as terrorists .
Infowars broke the story on March 11 after Alex Jones received the MIAC document from an anonymous source in the Missouri police .
“ The MIAC report specifically describes supporters of presidential candidates Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , and Bob Barr as ‘ militia ’ influenced terrorists and instructs the Missouri police to be on the lookout for supporters displaying bumper stickers and other paraphernalia associated with the Constitutional , Campaign for Liberty , and Libertarian parties , ” Kurt Nimmo wrote for Infowars .
[ efoods ]
On March 13 , Paul Joseph Watson , Kurt Nimmo and Alex Jones expanded coverage of the MIAC report .
Mr. Baldwin asserted his strong opposition to the document and Missouri police efforts to characterize mainstream political parties and their supporters as domestic terrorists .
The MIAC report specifically links these supporters to “ militia ” influenced terrorists .
“ Police are educated in the document that people are are anti-abortion , own gold , display an assortment of U.S. flags , or even those that talk about the film Zeitgeist , view the police as their ‘ enemy ’ and conflates them with domestic terrorists like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph and other domestic militia groups who have been charged with plotting terrorist attacks , ” Infowars and Prison Planet reported .
In addition , Baldwin said he collaborated with Ron Paul and Bob Barr on a letter that will be sent to Missouri officials protesting the MIAC report .
Mr. Baldwin indicated that if the letter does not result in a repudiation of the MIAC report and its absurd allegations , he and fellow letter signatories will consider legal action .
Chuck Baldwin will send a copy of the letter to Alex Jones .
Infowars will post the letter .

Oct. 10 , 2008 -- Can taking an herbal supplement be as good as a prescription medication for people who are depressed ?
Researchers in Germany think so .
A team working for a firm that makes St. John 's wort extract has found that taking high - quality St. John 's wort can be as effective as standard prescribed antidepressants for some depressed people .
Extract of St. John 's wort is commonly used in Germany for people with depression , anxiety , and sleep disorders .
In the U.S. the jury is out , as study results have been mixed on whether the herb helps lift depression .
The study authors disclose that they were paid speaking and travel fees by the German company Schwabe , which produces St. John 's wort extract .

Some brilliant pranksters installed beautiful swings on BART last night .
What apparently happened , according to witnesses , was a team of six or so people hopped on to a north - bound train from 24th Street station in San Francisco around 8:30 p.m. last night , installed three matching red swings , and then exited at 16th Street leaving their swings behind for public consumption .
Luckily , photos were taken to record the event .
photo by Neiltron
I personally love this prank because of the joy that it inspires in the innocent by - standers .
Look at the photos .
Even the dudes that are not swinging are smiling ( except for one woman – that is just how some people roll , I guess ) .
I declare this to be an epic victory for joy and whimsy over the mundane !

For the past couple of years the British government has been extremely aggressive in installing surveillance cameras — CCTV on high streets , speeding cameras on highways , and so on .
If you are a typical British citizen , your actions are captured on camera hundreds of times a day , and you can be watched with suspicion even without the government having any probable cause reason to suspect you of anything .
Relatedly , they have also been challenging people taking pictures in public , and have recently essentially made it illegal to take pictures of police officers ( with the justification being the possibility of terrorist abduction of officers ) .
The erosion of civil liberties in Britain has been short and sharp .
Now some local authorities are witholding liquor licences from pub owners unless they agree to install CCTV inside the pub .
One striking recent example is The Draper ’s Arms in Islington , a borough of London .
As the Londonist notes :
Nick Gibson is attempting to re-open
The Draper ’s Arms on Barnsbury Street , a former Evening Standard pub of the year winner that shut its doors last August .
But to regain a licence , he ’s been told he must fit CCTV cameras that capture the head and shoulders of everyone entering the pub , and be willing to hand over footage whenever the police ask for it .
Gibson is furious at what he sees as erosion of civil liberties .
However , his local MP and the Metropolitan Police keep blithely citing ‘ public safety ’ .
We find that a bit rich , considering studies have shown CCTV is less effective than increased street lighting at cutting crime , and CCTV footage is used to help solve just 3 % of London robberies .
Henry Porter comments on this situation in The Guardian , and links to Gibson ’s original letter to The Guardian about this erosion of civil liberties .
I particularly like this idea :
Gibson has been put in a difficult position and I would expect the council to make the first move to resolve what is a minor but also crucial issue of privacy , which of course is guaranteed to each one of us by the Human Rights Act .
If it fails to do so , he might like to provide a mask at the entrances to his pub with a suggestion that if people want to drink in private they hold up the mask as they pass the cameras .
Or possibly drinkers may like to go equipped with their own mask .
A V for Vendetta mask seems appropriate ( £ 4.99 ) .
Perhaps there should be a V for Vendetta evening at the Drapers Arms .
If Gibson would like to suggest a date in the next two weeks , I will publicise it .
In the meantime , it is important that the police understand it is not their business to use their influence to make and implement policy affecting people ’s privacy .
Between the demise of civil liberties in the UK and the demise of economic liberties in the US , I ’m beginning to feel like the frog in the pot of water with the temperature increasing .
How soon will we be cooked ?

The Harrah 's chain of Las Vegas casinos and hotels has written a letter to Nevada 's legislature warning about a potential loss in gay tourism if Gov. Gibbons vetoes that state 's pending domestic partners bill .
In a letter to lawmakers , Harrah 's Senior Vice President Jan Jones said that Nevada must compete with other destinations for the growing gay and lesbian business and that there could be a " negative economic impact " if the bill does not become law .
" Our state can not afford to lose any more revenue to other destinations because of a reputation as a place which is not socially or politically the right place to do business or to vacation , " Jones stated in the letter , dated Tuesday .
Gays and lesbians have the highest disposable income of any segment of the population , according to Jones .
" Our company does aggressive marketing to this community , " Jones said Wednesday .
" How can we say to them 'we want your business , but we do n't care about your rights . "
Honesty is the best policy , and diversity is the right thing to do .
Harrah's has accomplished both with this letter of support for the Nevada domestic partnership bill , which the governor promises to veto .
Send Harrah's Hotel and Casinos a thank you letter for supporting LGBT customers in Nevada and for their overall ranking and awards by the Human Rights Campaign .

BBC Sport in Monaco
Formula 1 bosses are closing on an agreement that will end the crisis over the future of the sport .
The teams have agreed with Max Mosley , president of governing body the FIA , the framework for a compromise over his proposals for a budget cap .
It has been agreed in principle to delay introducing a 45 m Euro ( £ 39.6 m ) cap until 2011 , while Mosley has made other concessions to the teams on governance .
" Slowly we 're getting to a situation where everyone is going to agree , " Mosley said .
Everyone wants to reach agreement .
Even those teams who have still got a lot of money realise others have n't and , if we want to keep a full grid , the costs have to come down
FIA president Max Mosley
It is understood the teams may also receive more money from Bernie Ecclestone , who runs the companies which control the sport 's commercial rights .
The deal has been reached after a series of meetings over the weekend at the Monaco Grand Prix involving team principals , Mosley and Ecclestone .
Further talks are required to flesh out the detail of the agreement , but the basic principle has been agreed .
" We have asked to go into next year with the 2009 rules and then see what we can do to change for next year , " said Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali .
" Cost is something all the teams are fully committed to working on , but it is something [ on which ] the teams have to decide what they can afford .
" We do n't feel it is something someone can impose on us . "
The principle behind the agreement was to ensure everyone came out of the talks with a victory and therefore no - one lost face .
It is a remarkable turnaround after the weekend started against the background of threats by Ferrari and other leading teams to quit the sport rather than race under a budget cap .
Mosley , who was speaking in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport , said : " There may be an intermediate year in 2010 - that is still under discussion - and we 'll really come down to that figure ( £ 40 m ) in 2011 .
FIA president Max Mosley says an F1 breakaway was " never realistic " " Everyone understands that it simply cannot go on at the present level ; the money is n't there . "
Sources say the teams have won a number of compromises from Mosley , among them that the budget restriction will not be called a " cap " , which has become an emotive word .
In addition , the teams have forced Mosley to give ground on their long - running objections to the way he can impose rule changes since he allowed the Concorde Agreement , which governed the sport , to lapse in 2007 .
In those days the rules were agreed by a body called the F1 Commission , which comprised the FIA , Ecclestone and representatives of the teams , sponsors and circuits - after being agreed by the teams .
Mosley said : " They want to go back to the days of the F1 Commission and the system we had before the Concorde Agreement ran out so they can sit down and discuss all the rules .
" From our point of view , it 's a very tiresome process , but it does actually work . "
Mosley has set a deadline of 29 May for entries for the 2010 championship - six months earlier than normal .
He said he was hopeful the majority of teams would lodge entries by that date .
But he added that he thought the sport " may lose one or two manufacturers or teams " .
There is speculation that the future of BMW and Toyota is in doubt - although both teams publicly deny they are considering withdrawing .
BBC
Sport understands that a plan is being devised to keep grids at least at current levels if teams do pull out .
This would involve giving the commercial rights money of any team that pulled out to other teams who would run a third car for a rookie driver .
606 : DEBATE
I think the whole situation is very sad and very bad for F1 ; for too long now , the action on the track is being overwhelmed by politics off it
crozzers12
The restriction on manufacturers supplying no more than two teams with engines - which was waived this year to allow Brawn to survive - could also be abandoned .
" There 's genuinely a constructive atmosphere , " added Mosley .
" Everyone wants to reach agreement .
Even those teams who have still got a lot of money at the moment realise that others have n't and if we want to keep a full grid the costs have to come down . "
And he said the threat of a breakaway was never realistic .
" I think they all realise that is n't practical , " Mosley said .
" We [ he and Ecclestone ] tried all this in 1980 - 81 and we had a lot more going for us than they do .
You can't really do that - all you do is destroy what you 've got .
So that 's a bargaining position . "
It is also believed that next year 's rules will be fundamentally the same as this year 's , with the exception of a few small " tidy - ups " to remove areas of ambiguity .

One morning on the Underground , I began to reason that what I needed was a sort of " IRC Bot Apache " that would handle incoming IRC events of various sorts ( PRIVMSG , ACTION , etc. ) , and then pass them along with some connection information to my django code .
I 'd dispatch these messages through the regex - based patterns ( ) system , then call view code that uses ORM objects to perform queries .
The obvious choice for implementing something like this is Twisted Python , which shows its age but remains the de facto Python library for coding state machines .
I 'm only occasionally familiar with the system ( and the documentation is filled with distracting Java - esque Software Engineering babble for some bizarre reason ) , but I was able to localize the actual Twisted - using code to one function , which at the very least makes it simple to hand off to experts to tell me if I 'm doing anything stupid .
Yardbird
Digging through twisted documentation I found their example LogBot and based it loosely on that pattern , subclassing irc.IRCClient and replacing the privmsg method along the following lines :
from twisted .
words .
protocols import irc from twisted .
internet import defer , threads from django. core import urlresolvers from django.conf import settings class DjangoBot( irc.IRCClient ) : @defer.inlineCallbacks def privmsg ( self , user , channel , msg ) : resolver = urlresolvers.get_resolver ('.'. join ( ( settings.ROOT_MSGCONF , ' privmsg ' ) ) ) request = dict ( user=user , channel=channel , msg=msg , settings=settings ) callback , args , kwargs = resolver.resolve ('/' + request [ 'msg ' ] ) response = yield threads.deferToThread( callback , request , *args , ** kwargs ) defer.returnValue(self.notice(response.recipient , response.data.encode ( ' UTF - 8 ' ) ) )
Let me go through that line by line :
@defer.inlineCallbacks def privmsg ( self , user , channel , msg ) :
The inlineCallbacks decorator essentially catches any yield of a Twisted deferred object and schedules the next delve into the generator using standard Twisted deferred - execution mechanisms .
So now yield really behaves like a scheduler yield , and you can let some more critical IRC - parsing code run between your own calls .
Next we build a Django urlresolver object so we can dispatch regexes to handler functions , using some Django settings info to determine path info :
from django.core import urlresolvers from django.conf import settings resolver = urlresolvers.get_resolver ('.'. join ( ( settings.ROOT_MSGCONF , ' privmsg ' ) ) )
Then we build a request dictionary .
In normal Django this would be an HttpRequest object , containing all sorts of information about the web server and the remote client and the HTTP request itself .
Since this is a quick - and - dirty example , I 've reduced this to a dict for simplicity .
I also passed in the settings namespace just to be lazy ( so I can keep things like nickname in there ) :
request = dict ( user=user , channel=channel , msg=msg , settings=settings )
Now we actually use our resolver to test the incoming message against all our patterns in privmsg.py and return to us the appropriate function , along with all of the anonymous and named matches that were generated by the winning regular expression .
Note that we have to prepend a / to our message to appease the URL - centric resolver :
callback , args , kwargs = resolver.resolve ('/' + request [ ' msg ' ] )
Finally we get to the deferred execution magic !
We have a function , a request object , and some arguments made from textual analysis of the message .
We use the threads .
deferToThread method to generate a deferred object that runs in a completely separate thread , and yield it up to our inlineCallbacks decorator to be scheduled :
response = yield threads.deferToThread( callback , request , * args , ** kwargs )
Our view function then runs in the background , taking as long as it likes while our bot concerns itself with answering PING replies and dispatching further events to the resolver .
We 're confident that the Django code is reasonably thread - safe , as it has to handle concurrency under a variety of Web server models ( such as apache 's Worker MPM or a traditional Prefork model ) .
Once the function returns a value , the thread closes and execution comes back to this method again , chucking the returned value into our response object .
We 're almost done , but we still need to actually do something with this information !
In ordinary HTTP Django this would be an HttpResponse object , containing all sorts of information on what template to render and what dictionary to pass in as an extra context namespace .
This is a bit overkill for this example , so I 've simplified it to another dict :
defer.returnValue(self.notice( response [' recipient ' ] , response [ ' data '].encode ( ' UTF - 8 ' ) ) )
Technology.am ( Apr. 7 , 2009 ) — Cambridge University Eco Racing ’s ( CUER ) new solar racing car demonstrates cutting - edge environmentally - friendly technology , applicable to the next generation of electric vehicles .
The vehicle , currently codenamed ‘ Bethany ‘ , will compete in the World Solar Challenge in Australia in October 2009 .
This vehicle is capable of cruising at 60 mph using the same power as a hairdryer .
The car will weigh just 160kg and sports 6 m2 of the world ’s highest efficiency silicon solar cells .
In order to achieve the car ’s extraordinary performance , CUER ’s engineering team has systematically reduced energy usage for each part of the car .
Aerodynamics , rolling resistance , weight and electrical efficiency have all been optimised to create a vehicle that uses up to 50 times less power than a normal petrol car and has potentially infinite range .
Extensive computer modelling and simulation have been necessary to achieve this , using Dassault Systèmes ’ SolidWorks and Simulia packages for mechanical design , ANSYS ’s Fluent for aerodynamic simulation , as well as National Instrument ’s LabVIEW and The MathWorks ’ MatLab and Simulink for systems modelling .
Under its solar skin , the racing car is simply an ultra-efficient electric vehicle .
The technologies used are therefore applicable to the commercial electric cars that are beginning to appear on our roads .
Technologies used include a 98 % efficient electric hub motor , control systems providing battery management ( supplied by REAPsystems ) and regenerative braking , lightweight mechanical design , and carbon fibre composite bodywork .

Those who advocate for strict scientific standards in medicine are often asked , “ what ’s the harm ” of someone pursuing unconventional medicine ?
If people want to engage in a little hope , even if it ’s a false hope , it might make them feel better and it wo n’t cause any harm .
Often the questioner assumes that the unscientific remedies are themselves harmless .
This is not always a reasonable assumption .
Some unscientific treatments are directly harmful , or carry a non-trivial risk .
But that is not the limit to the harm that can be caused by pursuing such remedies .
For me the biggest harm of unscientific medicine is that it fosters a distruct of science - based medicine and practitioners and faith in bizarre notions of health and illness and in treatments that do not work .
Someone who feels that acupuncture helpe their back pain may then rely upon it when they get cancer .
Homeopathic treatments ( real ones , not products labeled homeopathic but containing real drugs ) are certainly harmless .
They have no side effects because they have not effects – they are just water and sugar pills .
Most homeopathic dilutions are such that chances are not a single molecule of the “ active ” ingredient remains behind .
Or , more acurately , the original assortment of molecules that can be found in all water are there , but that ’s it .
Homeopathy is literally nothing but pure magical thinking .
But homeopathy can still kill .
Thomas Sam , a homeopath , and his wife , Manju Sam , are standing trial in an Australian court for manslaughter by gross criminal negligence .
They allowed their 9 month old child to die from complications of severe eczema .
According to reports , their daughter , Gloria , was healthy at birth .
But at 4 months old she developed a skin rash , which became progressively worse .
Sam decided to treat the eczema with homeopathic treatments – which means not to treat it at all .
He sought advice from other homeopaths and naturopaths .
He also refused to follow the advice of the child ’s pediatrician to take her to skin specialist to get more aggressive treatment .
As a result Gloria ’s eczema worsened .
Her skin became thin and cracked , resulting in infections , and eventually septicemia and death .
Standard medical treatments could have saved her right up until days before her death .
This seems to be a case of ideology trumping common sense , evidence , and all reason .
This sad case is an extreme example , but it is not an isolated case .
Similar cases occur with adults , in which case there is no legal issue of neglect .
The website whatstheharm .net documents the stories of many similar cases .
Because of my blogs and podcast I also receive many e-mails from family members who are standing by helplessly while a loved - one slowly dies from a treatable disease because they are enthralled by an unscientific practitioner and their claims .
Some defend unscientific practices by saying that they should be used in addition to science - based medicine rather than instead of it .
I agree that this is a safer option – forgoing all science - based medicine is the most extreme and dangerous approach .
But that does not mean that the “ integrative ” approach is safe or reasonable .
In practice those who are ideologically dedicated to treatments that cannot be supported by evidence or basic science seek or prescribe such treatments first , delaying access to proven therapies .
There are also other sources of indirect harm .
Expending resources of time , money , effort , and emotion on treatments that do not work reduce the resources available for treatments that do work .
Also I find that unscientific therapies are often accompanied by gross misinformation about biology and medicine .
They also thrive , as I stated above , on mistrust of science - based medicine .
No matter how promoters try to sugar coat it , unscientific treatments are harmful to the system and to individuals .
Occasionally , as with the case of Gloria Sam , we hear of a dramatic example .
But the harm from unscientific health claims are not limited to these media - friendly cases .
Somehow the sports world long survived without lingerie football , but now that women are tackling dummies in their underwear , will sports ever be the same ?
Thankfully , some dignified citizens are playing backgammon in Damascus , and pehalwans keep their traditional wrestling alive in Lahore .
And this week 's Big Shots takes in many other sports that restore the world to balance like the women 's handball Champions League in Veszprem , Hungary , sprinting down the street with Usain Bolt in Manchester , England , and a good old - fashioned check into the boards at the NHL hockey playoffs .
The Volvo Ocean Race leaves Boston headed for Galway , and baseball begins what I hope is a new tradition : the post - homer pie in the face .

Takuo Toda , head of the Japan Origami Airplane Association ( classy ! ) set a new world record with his 27.9 second flight .
His greatest ambition , however , is to launch a paper plane ... from space .

Toda 's record - breaking paper plane was made from one uncut sheet of paper , because he 's a pro , and professional origami airplane modelers would never stoop so far as to use scissors .
The Telegraph reports that the plane was 10 cm long ( about four inches ) , which seems tiny to us , but then , we 're not paper aviation experts .
Oddly , Toda wants to launch his specially - designed paper planes from space .
Seriously .
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency announced that it would fund a three - year , 90 million yen ( £ 617,000 ) study into the feasibility of launching paper darts from the International Space Station .

In the nearly two years since it was first unveiled to the world , the Child - robot with Biomimetic Body , or CB2 , has been developing social skills by interacting with humans and watching their facial expressions , according to its creators at Osaka University .
Comprised of robotics engineers , brain specialists , psychologists and other experts , the research team has been teaching the android to think like a baby by having it evaluate facial expressions and classify them into basic categories , such as happiness and sadness .
+ Video of CB2 from June 2007
The 130 - centimter ( 4 ft 4 in ) tall , 33 - kilogram ( 73 lb ) robot is equipped with eye cameras that record emotional expressions .
Designed to learn like an infant , the robot can memorize facial expressions and match them with physical sensations , which it detects via 197 pressure sensors under a suit of soft , silicone skin .
In addition to watching faces , CB2 has been learning to walk .
With 51 pneumatic " muscles , " the little android can now amble through a room more smoothly than it could nearly two years ago , though it still requires the aid of a human .
Within two years , the researchers hope the robot will gain the intelligence of a two - year - old child and the ability to speak in basic sentences .
In the coming decades , the researchers expect to develop a " robo species " that has learning abilities somewhere between those of humans and chimps .

FORT MYERS , Fla. , April 11 ( UPI ) -- A Florida developer says he wants to build a 19,500 - home city powered entirely by solar energy .
Babcock Ranch will be developed by Kitson & Partners on 17,000 acres northeast of Fort Myers , Fla .
The developer said it will be the " first city on Earth powered by zero-emission solar energy , " The Miami Herald reported Saturday .

The city will include the world 's largest photovoltaic power plant , to be operated by Florida Power & Light .
The facility will cost about $ 300 million .
" We 're out to prove that it works economically , " developer Syd Kitson was quoted as saying .
" And it 's the right thing to do for the long - term solutions in this country . "
The newspaper said researchers are working to develop storage capability for sunlight - generated power since solar electricity is available only during daytime hours .
Solar panels to power the city will sit on 350 acres within the development .
The newspaper said more than half of the city 's 17,000 acres will be permanently protected as greenways and open space , and will adjoin the 73,000 - acre Babcock Ranch Preserve , which has been purchased by the state .
In a recent interview Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner admitted that Federal Reserve monetary policy was too loose for too long . 
Geithner s remark has been met with much enthusiasm .
Is this not a major concession on his part ?
Has Geithner not laid the blame for the 2008 crisis squarely at the Feds doorstep ?
Some of us claim that Geithner has admitted to an Austrian explanation for the 2008 crisis .
If true , this would be a major concession on Geithners part .
Such a concession would run contrary to the policies that Mr. Geithner is supposed to implement as Treasury Secretary to President Obama .
Geithner sees three causes behind the crisis .
The first cause was , as previously noted , loose Fed policy .
Oddly Geithner commented favorably on what the Fed has done over the past six months .
Low interest rates are supposedly helping to turn this crisis around .
So Geithner sees loose policy during the Subprime Boom as too low for too long , yet lauds an even looser policy .
He explains that The Fed was too loose then when investors were too optimistic , but now that financial markets are frozen and investors are pessimistic , monetary laxity is fine .
More specifically , Geithner blames irresponsible judgments by individuals in the financial system for an unsustainable rise in debt . 
Could it be that people assumed excessive debt because Fed policy was too loose for too long ?
Mr. Geithner is , for some reason , unable to see the connection between the low interest rates that result from loose Fed policy , and excessive borrowing .
Geithners second reason for the boom and bust is that the governmental supervisory system was way behind the curve , risk built up outside of the regulatory framework ,  and banks were overleveraged .
According to Geithner , over the past ten years executive compensation became detached from reality , and this compensation created incentives that overwhelmed  all the checks and balances against excessive risk taking .
Geithners answer to this alleged problem is new government regulation to restrain risk taking , regulation of leverage , and regulation of incentive compensation .
These measures are about preventing the next boom .
Once again , Geithner has ignored the likelihood that loose Fed policy was the main driver of the Subprime Boom .
Geithner is overlooking all that the Federal Government did to promote subprime lending by banks ( see Anatomy of a Train Wreck : Causes of the Mortgage Meltdown by Stan J. Liebowitz . )
The third and final reason Geithner listed is that governments were late to move .
They were late to put in place the kind of forceful fiscal stimulus we now have in place . . . it took a while for people to recognize the urgency of the situation and be willing to legislate the kind of broader authority that any government needs to get through a financial crisis . 
This is not surprising .
Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman explained how long and variable lags prevent timely implementation of changes in government policies .
There is a recognition lag to all policies , and the legislative process causes a lengthy administrative lag in fiscal and regulatory policies .
Strangely , Geithner recognizes that the private sector has already moved to solve its own problems .
In an earlier interview Geithner said :
 [ T ] he financial system will be dramatically different .
It s already dramatically different .
Again , if you look at the scale of adjustment and restructuring in the financial system , its already happened .
It s profound in scope already .
So if you just look at the system today relative to what it was through [ sic ] three years ago in terms of the institutions that existed then , and their basic shape has changed dramatically .
. . .
This will clean out a lot of the excesses and bad practices , and those that dont get cleaned out just by experience and knowledge now , better regulation oversight , better rules to the game , enforced more cleanly , well fix . 
Geithners desire for greater regulation is particularly hard to understand given his views on existing changes in the financial system .
The financial system is already dramatically different because experience has cleaned out excesses and bad practices , but we need new regulations ?
Even if we accept the idea that the crisis derived partially from lack of regulation , Geithners own words indicate that that the private banks have moved faster than the Federal Government to correct faulty practices .
Why then should we trust them to prevent further crises ?
Geithner claims that this is the best managed crisis because they acted earlier and stronger to deal with these problems , yet he also describes delays in government action as tragic . 
Of course , Geithner sees his own management as the best , and earlier efforts as weak and delayed .
But he has no better ability to foresee future events , and no special powers to effect changes in policy more rapidly .
If anything , recent experience indicates that the private sector moves faster in dealing with serious problems than can federal officials .
Geithner claims that he is designing into these programs a credible capacity to dial back and exit . 
For example , Obama and Geithner have an ambitious and tough with plan with clear choices for bringing deficits down to a sustainable level .
At this point Obamas proposed spending cuts are miniscule as compared to his planned spending increases .
Given the track record of Federal Government , the likelihood of Obamas new Federal Spending being dialed back seems quite small .
In fact , the expansion of government during crises typically exceeds post crisis retrenchment [ 1 ] .
The case that Geithner makes for his policies is both self - contradictory and contrary to fact .
Geithner wants to build a stronger and more sustainable recovery ,  but at the same time he is promoting a more extreme version of the monetary policy that he thinks contributed to the last unsustainable boom .
He is also pushing for new regulation of risk , leverage , and compensation in response to a crisis that was driven by government policies that encouraged risky Subprime lending .
There is a great need for reform .
What we actually need is to prevent inflationary monetary policies as well as Federal efforts to direct the economy through regulation , as these are the types of action that caused the subprime housing boom and subsequent crisis .
Ironically , Geithners goal of preventing yet another unsustainable boom and crash can be achieved only by ignoring his advice , because his policies are based on faulty logic and a misinterpretation of available facts .

German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the Hohenschoenhausen Memorial on Tuesday , getting a tour from one of the thousands of political prisoners who were held in the former Stasi detention center .
The memorial shows " the brutal ways in which people 's dignity was abused , " said Merkel , who grew up under the communist East German regime .
Merkel is the first German leader to tour the Berlin prison .
The tour was part of this year 's anniversary commemorations , which mark the 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
" It is crucial that this chapter of the history of the East German dictatorship is not covered up or forgotten , " Merkel said .
Yet there 's a growing worry among some historians and activists that many of those who grew up in the former German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) would rather forget the atrocities committed by the regime .
Few visitors from the East
The memorial is popular with visitors
Only 20 percent of visitors to the Hohenschoenhausen Memorial come from the eastern German states that made up the GDR .
" I myself had also expected that more easterners , people from the former GDR , would come and see our memorial site ... all the more so since they do n't have to travel far , " Siegfried Reiprich , a historian from the site 's political education department , told Deutsche Welle .
" But the figures are disappointing . "
Hohenschoenhausen is a unique " living memorial " which includes many of the original prison furnishings , providing a sort of time capsule to show what prison life was like for many of the GDR 's best - known dissidents .
The memorial has been hugely successful in the 15 years since it opened , attracting a record 250,000 visitors last year .
Fear remains of facing the past
Carola Schulze said she was surprised that so few former East Germans visited the museum , but thinks it has to do with their apprehension to examine the past .
Chancellor Merkel , who grew up in the GDR , toured the Stasi facility
" Of course it hurts when you look back to the past , " said Schulze , from the UOKG , a Berlin - based umbrella group for victims of the communist dictatorship .
" After all , we 're human beings .
But on the other hand , it 's so necessary to look back . ”
Not only are former East Germans uninterested in examining the past , but they are also prone to distorting their own history , says Reiprich .
They are much more likely today to portray the GDR in a much more positive light than they would have in the years directly after the communist regime was toppled in 1989 , he says .
" To look at a memorial site as we have it here in Hohenschoenhausen would mean to face your own history , to face your own collaboration with the system , ” Reiprich said .
What to tell the children ?
The generation , which lived under Communism also does not seem to be discussing Stasi brutality with their children .
Several school - aged visitors at the recent exhibit said the subject was brushed over , both at school and at home .
Reiprich said one of the problems is that many of the teachers do n't convey to their students a realistic picture of life in the GDR .
They certainly are n't interested in visiting Hohenschoenhausen with their students , he said .
" They just do n't want to hear unpleasant questions such as ' what did you do 20 years ago ? ' "

Ghibli's Scenery documentary , Ghibli Asemamire radio show
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment ( WDSHE ) has announced that two new limited edition DVDs about the Studio Ghibli anime company will ship in Japan on June 10 .
Ghibli no Fūkei : Miyazaki Sakuhin ga Kaita Nihon / Miyazaki Sakuhin to Deau Europa no Tabi ( Ghibli's Scenery : The Japan Depicted by Miyazaki's Works / A Trip of the Europe Encountered in Miyazaki's Works ) compiles two television documentaries about the real - life locales that inspired the movies of studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki ( Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind , My Neighbor Totoro , Spirited Away ) .
In the 2008 Miyazaki Sakuhin ga Kaita Nihon documentary which ran on the BS NTV satellite channel , actress Mayu Tsuruta visited the Japanese sites of yesteryear that informed the artwork in My Neighbor Totoro , Spirited Away , and Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea .
In 2006 's Miyazaki Sakuhin to Deau Europa no Tabi documentary from the same channel and upcoming home video release , actress Yui Natsukawa ( Gedo Senki , Onmyoji ) visited Stockholm and Gotland , two locales in Sweden which served as the model for the fictional town of Koriko in Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service film .
In addition , actor Tetta Sugimoto ( Higurashi no Naku Koro ni , Mei-chan no Shitsuji ) travels to the French region of Alsace to " find " the hometown of the heroine Sophie from Howl 's Moving Castle .
WDSHE is hosting a trailer for both documentaries in large or small file sizes .
The Suzuki Toshio no Ghibli Asemamire : Kyūjūkyū no Kotoba ( Toshio Suzuki 's Ghibli Asemamire : 99 Words ) DVD compiles selections from the Ghibli Asemamire radio program that Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki hosts every week .
Suzuki launched the program in October 2007 , and WDSHE plans to include over 40 hours of audio recordings with 49 guests .
Still photos and backgrounds will accompany the audio recordings .
In related news , Studio Ghibli revealed on Monday that the previously announced West Ghibli spinoff studio will be established next month in the western Japanese city of Toyota .
Not coincidentally , the new studio will be in a building owned by Toyota , the automobile manufacturer .
Less than 30 young animators will train at West Ghibli for two years by creating an animated short for screenings at the Ghibli Museum .

STOCK
For home cooks , the biggest problem with stock is having it around when you need it .
So make as much as you can manage  three gallons , say .
To save space , you can reduce the stock so that it ’s extra concentrated , and reconstitute it with water to taste when you ’re ready .
Refrigerate and skim the fat , if you like , then freeze in containers of varying sizes , or in ice cube trays .
Image Credit ...
Tony Cenicola / The New York Times
STOCK -MAKING MATERIAL
Scraps of poultry ( most of the chicken parts we do n’t eat are good for stock ) , meat ( again , especially the less - used , bonier parts ) or fish ( heads and skeletons in particular ) , vegetable trimmings , bones and more .
Keep separate bags for each , adding to them when you can .
Remember , though , that stock is not garbage soup : Carrot and potato peels , cabbage cores , and the like can be used , but in moderation .
Animal organs are best avoided ( fish gills and guts must be removed , and offal in general makes bitter stock ) .
BREAD , BREAD DOUGH , BREAD CRUMBS
Freeze dough in well - wrapped balls ; defrost until it regains springiness .
( It will never rise quite as high as unfrozen dough , but it works nearly perfectly for pizza or focaccia , and well enough for other uses . )
Good crusty bread , wrapped in aluminum foil , can turn lighter dishes into meals  just defrost in the foil at 350 degrees or so for 10 minutes , then crisp up , unwrapped , at slightly higher temperatures .
( I ’m talking about crusty bread ; sliced bread can be defrosted on the counter or in a toaster . )
And stale bread can be made into crumbs in a blender or food processor , stored in a container , and added to at will .
PASTRY AND PASTRY DOUGH
Most cake and cookies freeze pretty well , carefully wrapped .
Or make a frozen log of “ refrigerator ” cookies to slice and bake later .
Same with biscuits : make a whole batch or double batch of biscuit batter , bake just enough for dinner , and freeze the rest .
TOMATOES AND TOMATO SAUCE
Tomato sauce is best frozen in zippered bags with the air squeezed out .
If you have ripe tomatoes , core , quarter , and throw them in a bag ; as they thaw the skins will slip off , a bonus .
( The frozen chunks separate easily so you can just break off a couple for soups , stews , salsas , sauces and so on . )
You can also freeze unused portions of canned tomatoes , preferably in their juice .
BACON
Or pancetta , prosciutto , smoked ham hocks , prosciutto bones , etc .
Wrap tightly in plastic and cut off pieces as you need them .
( Or cut before freezing  you might need a butcher to do this in the case of big bones . )
FRESH HERBS
If you have extra herbs , your four best options are :
Make pesto by puréeing the herb with oil and whatever other seasonings you like ; make “ pesto , ” a purée of herb and water , with or without other seasonings ; make compound butter ; chop herbs , and freeze in ice cube trays covered with water .

A trail of evidence led investigators into Tuesday 's terrorist attacks from one abandoned rental car in Portland , Maine , to two houses in Vero Beach , Florida .
One of the Vero Beach houses had been rented by two brothers from Saudi Arabia .
Inside it were two pilot 's certificates in the names of Adnan Bukhari and his brother , Ameer Abbas Bukhari .

Early accounts stated it was Adnan and Ameer Bukhari who rented the car from Logan Airport Alamo and abandoned it at Portland , not Mohamed Atta .
The Bukharis " did get on a plane and fly to Boston " , Adnan Bukhari 's name reportedly appeared on Flight 11's manifest , and a trail of evidence led investigators to Adnan Bukhari 's house .
Within hours of the attacks it was nearly " case closed " that the Bukharis were hijackers of Flight 11 , but a couple of simple facts proved their innocence - Ameer Bukhari died in a plane crash in 2000 and Adnan Bukhari is alive .

How did so much evidence initially point to the Bukharis , and how did Adnan Bukhari 's name reportedly appear on Flight 11 's manifest ?
The words " fabricated evidence " spring to mind .
The Bukharis innocence caused a major rethink of Flight 11's hijackers , and this rethink resulted in the implausible scenario of Atta abandoning two rental cars in two airports .

What You Can Do
( OrganicJar ) California farmers expect to harvest the smallest avocado crop since 1990 and possibly even as far back as 1980 .
The price of avocados is expected to rise later this year in response to a predicted avocado shortage .
Prices should n't explode , but they 'll creep into the higher range , especially for organically grown avocados .
According to the California Avocado Commission , the main culprit is a rash of hot and dry weather last June which will cause a smaller crop this spring .
This will cause us to rely more on imported avocados from Mexico and Chile .
This is unfortunate news if you 're a huge fan of avocados like me !
You can , of course , stock up on avocados in advance to get you through the lean months ahead ( though fresh is certainly best when it comes to avocados ! ) .
Avocados will keep in the freezer for up to six months , though you do want to mash them with a bit of lemon juice first .
To freeze avocado : puree flesh with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice per 2 avocados , and place in a tightly - closed container with the air removed .
A zip - lock plastic bag will work well for this .

CANNABIS CULTURE – American Congressmen Ron Paul and Barney Frank , who have co-sponsored several recent pro-marijuana and hemp bills , appeared on Active Voice Radio to discuss medical marijuana , hemp , decriminalization , and President Obama ’s recent comments on legalization .
Paul and Frank introduced “ The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2009 ” on April 2 , which would eliminate federal laws prohibiting farmers from growing non-psychoactive industrial hemp .
The two congressman have also co-signed the “ Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act of 2008 “ , which would enact legal protections for medical marijuana users , and the “ Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008 “ , which would have removed federal criminal penalties for possession of up to 100 grams of marijuana .
The congressmen were interviewed separately by independent public radio producer Chris Goldstein , who asked them about the proposed bills , action by Attorney General Eric Holder to stop medical marijuana raids , and President Obama ’s recent mockery of online marijuana supporters .
“ I would think a lot of people ought to be disappointed ” , Congressman Paul said about Obama ’s town - hall comments on legalization , “ because he ’s indicated that maybe he ’d bring about some changes , and most people thought he’d be a little bit more tolerant .
But it does n’t look like he ’s going to be , so it was a disappointment to a lot of people , including myself . ”
Despite his disappointment in the president , Paul was positive about the future , and said that he thinks public and political attitudes are changing .
“ Overall , I ’ve generally been optimistic that the country will eventually wake up and see the futility of the drug laws .
I think sentiment is changing in the Congress . [… ]
Politicians will shift when they ’re sure about the sentiments – when they ’re sure it ’s not going to hurt them politically .
I think that ’s where we ’re winning – and maybe all of a sudden they will decide it ’s not a big deal . ”
Paul also discussed the many uses of hemp and said that one of his kids bought him a hemp t- shirt .
“ Hemp is pretty easy to grow , ” he said , “ it uses very few chemicals and could compete with cotton . ”
Then he said with a laugh , “ maybe the cotton industry is keeping hemp from coming . ”
Congressman Frank congratulated his home state of Massachusetts for voting to decriminalize marijuana possession in a fall ballot referendum and said the drug war is a waste of resources .
“ There is this recognition that an effort to prohibit absolutely something that ’s widely desired and seen by many people as not harmful if done moderately – it corrodes law enforcement . [… ]
To have our law enforcement and judicial and police resources tied up by prosecuting people for smoking marijuana at the expense of more serious crimes is a great mistake . ”
Frank said that activities like smoking marijuana and gambling should be personal choices made without government interference .
“ The notion that if the government does n’t make something a crime , it ’s encouraging it is a very authoritarian notion .
They ’re ought to be a wide range of human activity that ’s none of the government ’s business – that the government neither prohibits nor encourages – and I would put marijuana in that category . ”

• Hammersmith team stuck in Egypt at Rafa crossing since 4 May • Group on humanitarian mission to set up cardiac hospital unit
Three British medics began a hunger strike in Egypt today to protest against being refused entry into Gaza for a humanitarian mission .
Their aim is to establish a cardiac surgery unit at al - Shifa hospital in Gaza City , which currently has no such facility , and to help train medical students and junior doctors there .
But the British medics have been denied access to the Palestinian territory at the Rafah crossing since the beginning of May .
Omar Mangoush , a cardiac surgeon at Hammersmith hospital , in London , told theguardian.com he had been to the crossing with his colleagues every day since arriving in Egypt on 4 May , only to be told they did not have permission to enter .
" We are on hunger strike until they let us through , " he said .
" We 'll stay [ at the crossing ] until they let us in .
We want to put pressure on the British embassy .
We believe if the British embassy wanted us to do this they could exert pressure [ on the Egyptian authorities ] . "
Mangoush said he had been told by the British embassy that it had received a letter from the Egyptian foreign ministry saying the medics ' request for access to Gaza had been " postponed " .
But he claimed American aid workers had gained entry to Gaza at their first attempt with the support of the US embassy .
Mangoush named the other British medics on hunger strike as Christopher Burns - Cox , a retired consultant , and Kirsty Wong , a nurse at Hammersmith hospital .
Another six people are on hunger strike , including three Belgians , he said .
The cardiac surgeon took a month 's holiday from work to take part in the mission for the Manchester - based charity Palestine International Medical Aid ( PIMA )
" This is very important for us , " he said .
" There are loads of people with heart disease [ in Gaza ] .
They can't get here [ to Egypt ] , they can't get to Israel .
If it 's this hard for us to get to , how difficult is it for the Palestinians to get out ? "
PIMA 's director , Dr Ahmed Almari , said : " It 's unbelievable .
They 're a group of doctors , they went for education and teaching , to set up a cardiac unit .
It 's unfair and sad that it is only as a result of a hunger strike that anybody pays attention .
There 's no reason to stop them from crossing . "
Egypt has kept the Rafah crossing largely closed since Hamas won the Gaza elections three years ago .
One of the main demands of Hamas has been that all crossings into Gaza should be allowed to reopen permanently .
A number of aid groups have said the closure of the crossings is contributing to a humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Palestinian medical sources reported today that a one - year - old infant died yesterday at a local hospital in Rafah owing to several complications , including pneumonia , as his transfer to a hospital outside of the Gaza Strip was not possible due to the ongoing Israeli siege .
Rock Snobbery Explained
The Rock Snob is a confounding person in your life .
On one hand , he brooks no ignorance of pop-music history , and will take violent umbrage at the fact that you ’ve never heard of the noted rock arranger and soundtrack composer Jack Nitzsche , much less heard Nitzsche ’s ambitious pop-classical album , St. Giles Cripplegate .
On the other hand , he will not countenance the notion that you know more than he about a certain area of music .
If , for example , you mention that Fun House is your favorite Stooges album , he will respond that it “ lacks the visceral punch of ‘ I Wanna Be Your Dog ’ from a year earlier , but it ’s got some superb howling from Iggy and coruscating riffage from Ron Asheton , though not on the level of James Williamson ’s on Raw Power ” — this indigestible clump of words acting as a cudgel with which the Rock Snob is trumping you and marking the turf as his .
The Rock Snob*s Dictionary ( Broadway Books , 2005 ) was conceived , in part , to enable non-Snobs to hold their own in such distressing situations , with the added benefit of sparing them the trouble of actually listening to the music in question .
However , the dictionary is equally useful as a primer for curious music fans who sincerely want to learn more about rock but are intimidated by unexplained , ultra - knowing references in the music press to “ Stax -y horns , ” “ chiming , plangent Rickenbackers , ” and “ Eno . ”
The editors have painstakingly catalogued the fundaments of Rock Snobbery — e.g. , Who is Nick Drake ?
Why should I care about the deceased rock critic Lester Bangs ?
What is this “ Hammond B3 ” thing that they keep talking about ?— and distilled years of arduous research into concise , alphabetized knowledge pellets .
And though most of the Snob canon consists of music that ’s actually quite listenable , the editors have not shied away from sounding a word of warning about the follies of certain revisionist Snobs , who , in their eagerness to claim a “ discovery , ” recklessly elevate the reputation of such flagrantly second - rate acts as Badfinger and Delaney & Bonnie
The editors caution that neither The Rock Snob*s Dictionary nor Snobsite.com is meant to serve as a comprehensive rock - music reference in the vein of The Rolling Stone Encylopedia of Rock & Roll .
Just because a musician has enjoyed lasting success and critical acclaim does n’t mean he warrants inclusion here .
Only the persons and entities that are the psychic property of Rock Snobs make the cut .
For example , there is no entry for David Crosby , because practically every person over 30 knows who he is and can hum a few bars of “ Teach Your Children . ”
However , the late Gene Clark , Crosby ’s colleague in the original lineup of the Byrds , warrants an entry because , while the average Joe has n’t the faintest idea who he is , the Rock Snob has fetishized him for his poor - selling post - Byrds output of country rock and orchestral pop .
Occasionally , there will be an entry that seems to buck this policy , that will seem familiar to lay readers — such as Dion , ubiquitous on oldies radio via “ The Wanderer ” and “ A Teenager in Love , ” or Dexys Midnight Runners , the ’ 80s British pop group of “ Come On Eileen ” repute — but appearances are deceptive .
These artists warrant inclusion in The Rock Snob*s Dictionary and Snobsite.com because Snobs value them for utterly different reasons than non-Snobs do — in Dion ’s case , for his post - drug - rehab forays into folk music and MOR pop in the late ’60s and early ’ 70s ; in Dexys Midnight Runners ’ case , for the alienating , absurdist post - “ Eileen ” work of the group ’s key member , Kevin Rowland .
For all intents and purposes , there are two Dions and two Dexyses , the Snob and non-Snob versions .
The latter versions , being accessible and commercially successful and all , do n’t warrant our consideration here .
A Brief History of Rock Snobbery
Since the dawn of rock , there have been individuals , usually young men of argumentative tendencies , who have lorded their encyclopedic musical knowledge over others .
In the movie Diner , the filmmaker Barry Levinson adroitly depicts an early specimen of this type with the character Shrevie , played by Daniel Stern , who dresses down his wife for misfiling one of his 45s , and , in the same fit of pique , boasts of knowing the producer , year , label , and B - side title of every single he owns .
By the 1970s , the legions of such pedants had grown considerably thanks to the emergence of a credible rock press .
Via Rolling Stone and Creem in America and Melody Maker and the New Musical Express in Britain , one could easily track the latest developments in Captain Beefheart ’s career and vicariously experience David Bowie ’s gigs with the Spiders from Mars , even if one was underage or wary of actually commingling with sweaty , hirsute rock people in the flesh .
But it was n’t until the 1980s that Rock Snobbery truly gained traction as a phenomenon and pathology .
This was attributable chiefly to two developments : the advent of the “ classic rock ” radio format , which saw rock aficionados retreat from their monomaniacal obsession with the new , and the rise of the CD format , which A ) compelled fans to repurchase their entire music collections ; and B ) compelled the record labels to reissue their back catalogues with “ bonus tracks ” and booklets featuring never - before - seen photographs and exhaustive liner notes .
Rock knowledge , even of the most arcane sort , was suddenly common currency and a saleable commodity , valuable and significant beyond one ’s immediate circle of loser friends .
Independent labels such as Rhino and Sundazed astutely took advantage of this situation , broadening the Snob mandate beyond the mere revisiting of one ’s old favorites and trawling the archives for out - of - print records that could be digitalized , remastered , and packaged as “ lost masterpieces ” and “ forgotten gems . ”
The attendant press coverage created a new roster of Snob heroes whose underappreciatedness was , in the Snob purview , a societal crime : Gram Parsons , Curt Boettcher , Fred Neil , Alex Chilton , Shuggie Otis .
Which is not to say that the Rock Snob was some hidebound , patchouli - drenched anachronism who lived strictly in the past — he was , by definition , in touch , and thus , his fear of calcification ensured that he kept up with developments in hip - hop and electronica as surely as he collected Syd Barrett bootlegs .
By the dawn of the twenty - first century , Rock Snobbery had become so widespread that some old - line Snobs felt under siege , their carefully hoarded knowledge of Harry Smith ’s Anthology of American Folk Music no longer special in the wake of the O Brother , Where Art Thou ?
roots - music explosion , their rare mint vinyl copies of Shuggie Otis ’s Inspiration Information rendered worthless by the album ’s loving reissue on CD — an indignity exacerbated by the title track ’s inclusion on a Starbucks compilation .
But the fact is , Rock Snobbery , far from having been undermined , had reached epidemic proportions .
While the fogy stereotype still occasionally rang true — the Snob as embodied by Nick Hornby ’s aging hipster protagonist in High Fidelity , or by the indignant boomer who writes to Mojo magazine complaining that Radiohead is too young to appear on the cover — the Rock Snob phenomenon had grown to encompass both sexes and all ages :
The twentysomething Jack White covered Dusty Springfield tunes and took it upon himself to produce Loretta Lynn ’s comeback album ; the Lindsay Lohan - portrayed teen heroine of Disney ’s 2003 remake of Freaky Friday affectionately cradled “ my dad ’s Strat ” ; and such Snob lodestars as the Pixies , the Stooges , and the New York Dolls exhumed themselves for sold - out reunion shows that were attended not only by nostalgic graybeards but by kids who missed out on these bands the first time around .
The Snob fraternity has also benefitted from the very public advocacy of its celebrity membership , a roster whose number includes such musicians as Morrissey , Beck , Elvis Costello , and the Beastie Boys and such music - savvy film directors as Wes Anderson , Martin Scorsese , and Cameron Crowe .
These individuals , all of unimpeachably exquisite musical taste , play a sort of curatorial role for the masses , using their platforms to familiarize civilians with such Snobworthies as Jobriath , Serge Gainsbourg , David Ackles , Lee “ Scratch ” Perry , Nico , and Harry Nilsson .
In some cases this role has been formalized , with the Luminary Snob actually mandated by an institution to propagate his Snobbery .
Both Costello and the producer Hal Willner have served stints in UCLA ’s Artist - in - Residence program , where they have been charged by the university with organizing conceptual concert series ;
Willner really pulled out all the stops with his two - day Harry Smith tribute in 2001 , which featured Costello , Beck , Bill Frisell , Todd Rundgren , Marianne Faithfull , and Richard Thompson , among others .
And , since 1993 , London ’s Royal Festival Hall has hosted a summertime concert series called Meltdown in which a guest Snob curator — past overseers include Morrissey , Laurie Anderson , Nick Cave , Scott Walker , and , inevitably , Costello — rounds up his favorite “ seminal ” acts for a de facto Snob Woodstock .
Though non-Snobs still far outnumber Snobs in the general population , the demographics of Snobbery are skewing ever younger .
Taken in tandem with the aforementioned advances in Snob education , this trend augurs further gains in the Snob population and a future in which even preschoolers will be able to differentiate between the Louvin Brothers and the Stanley Brothers .
Finally , let us express our sincere hope that this reference performs a valuable public service , serving not only to edify musically inquisitive readers , but to bridge cultural gaps between Snobs and non-Snobs , many of whom sleep under the same roof but live lives fraught with unnecessary , vintage - vinyl - related tension .
Oh , and by the way , the cool Beatles song for Snobs to like is “ Cry Baby Cry , ” off Side 4 of the White Album .
PATRIOTS WIN PROFILING FIGHT Missouri Report Smearing Patriots Withdrawn Due to Citizen Pressure By Mark Anderson MISSOURI PUBLIC SAFETY DIRECTOR
John Britt on March 23 issued an apology letter to Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) , former Rep. Bob Barr ( R - Ga. ) , and Florida minister and former Constitution Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin .
Why ?
For having included their names in the Missouri Information Analysis Center ’s report that linked Americans concerned about NAFTA , the Federal Reserve , the IRS , the proposed North American Union , firearms confiscation and other real issues with “ the militia movement . ”
Indeed , the embattled MIAC report , first reported in AFP a week ago , implies that any significant distrust of government schemes could be linked with militia activities or untrustworthy “ right - wing ” belief systems .
The MIAC report available online essentially says that while “ the militia movement ” peaked in 1996 , it ’s making a return due to the moribund economy .
But the report apparently has been totally withdrawn , not just altered to address the concerns of Paul , Barr and Baldwin , said the head of the Missouri Highway Patrol .
“ For instance , the militia report was created by a MIAC employee , reviewed by the MIAC director , and sent immediately to law enforcement agencies across Missouri .
The militia report was never reviewed by me or by the Director of Public Safety [ DPS ] , John Britt , at any point prior to its issuance .
Had that report been reviewed by either my office or by leaders of the Department of Public Safety , it would never have been released to law enforcement agencies , ” wrote Col.
James Keathley in an official letter that AFP obtained from Missouri officials on March 31 .
He added : “ The Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety believe that law enforcement officers require intelligence of the highest quality and that the report in question does not meet that standard .
For that reason , I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report .
Further , I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement .
My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC . ”
The evidently defunct report , for example , had noted that the peaceful “ End the Fed ” rallies held nationwide at 39 Federal Reserve Banks ( 12 main branches , plus smaller outlets ) last November are part of a movement that ultimately could be “ dangerous ” to law enforcement .
In fact , many at these rallies came from both liberal and conservative backgrounds .
Their concern is simply that the Fed , as the nation ’s central bank , is too secretive and is doing a poor job , and thus should be dissolved via legislation .
Britt ’s letter of apology to Paul , Barr and Baldwin— all
Britt wrote to them : “ Unfortunately , in the course of preparing this report , some regrettable information was included in the report on militia groups in Missouri .
While the intent of the report was only to identify certain traits that are sometimes shared by members of militia organizations , the report is too easily misinterpreted as suggesting that militia members may be identified by no other indicator than support for a particular candidate or political organization .
That is an undesired and unwarranted outcome . ”
Britt added : “ Upon review and reflection , it is the judgment of the Department of Public Safety [ DPS ] that the report should have made no reference to supporters of Ron Paul , Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin or any other third - party political organization or candidate .
In recognition of the mistaken inclusion of this information by the MIAC in its Feb. 20 , 2009 report on the militia movement , I have ordered that the offending report be edited so as to excise all reference to Ron Paul , Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin and to any third - party political organizations .
Additionally you may rest assured that the report is not posted on any website maintained by the state of Missouri . ”
Paul , Barr and Baldwin did not merely ask that their names be deleted and that state online postings of the report be dropped , They also challenged the report itself , adding in their letter :
“ The ‘ report ’ draws links between white supremacists , anti-immigration persons , people opposed to gun control and those who do not favor the Federal Reserve banks and much more .
Were the ‘ report ’ nothing more than a nonsensical diatribe penned by some uninformed person , we would certainly not take our time writing this letter . ”
Missouri citizens had been preparing to meet with area law enforcement to give them commonsense input on this matter , to try and prevent police from abridging freedom of speech and other constitutional protections afforded all Americans , regardless of their beliefs .
More over , Missouri State Rep. Shane Schoeller , District 139 , has sponsored a bill to forbid political profiling .
The MIAC report came from an actual place that is part of Missouri ’s “ fusion center ” where information is pooled to tackle crime and terrorist threats .
New Department of Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano visited the center on March 11 .
“ Napolitano and Gov. Nixon then traveled to Kansas City to address the National Fusion Center Conference .
Fusion centers are collaborative efforts by law enforcement and other agencies to pool information , resources and analysis to better address and detect crime and potential terrorist threats .
Napolitano called fusion centers , which often receive federal funding and work with federal agencies , ‘ the future of law enforcement , ’’ stated a DPS news release online .
MIAC went into operation in December 2005 and started 24 - hour operations on Oct. 1 , 2006 , the DPS noted in a brochure .

( Issue # 15 , April 13 , 2009 )
( CNET ) --
Once again , Microsoft is finding itself beaten to the punch in the search game .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer may be ready to unveil search engine Kumo as early as next week .
While it has been readying Kumo for its first public airing -- probably at next week 's D : All Things Digital event -- Yahoo and Google have already shown off their latest search enhancements .
Worse still , their demos show that Redmond 's rivals are heading in some of the same directions as Microsoft itself .
According to screenshots that leaked out in March , Kumo 's look focuses on a new left - hand navigation menu that breaks searches down into a number of related queries .
The results themselves also feature information organized into categories .
For example , a search on " Audi " breaks things down into an initial result with facts such as price and fuel economy pulled out in bold , followed by general Web results , then results by category , such as Audi parts , used Audis , and Audi accessories .
But in the time since those screenshots leaked and Microsoft began internal testing of Kumo , Yahoo and Google have also continued to advance their efforts .
Last week , Google showed off new ways of filtering results at its Searchology event .
On Tuesday , Yahoo talked about trying to return more instant results , as opposed to just linking to sites that might have what a user is looking for .
Yahoo even used Microsoft 's favorite catch phrase .
" It 's time to kill the 10 blue links , " said Prabhakar Raghavan , head of Yahoo 's search strategy , referring to the top 10 search results listed when you enter most queries into a search engine .
" We want to move away from document retrieval as center of search to divining the user 's intent . "
The Kumo revamp includes more than just a new user interface and is also expected to include enhancements in video and image search as well as technology from Powerset , a natural - language search company Microsoft bought last year .
The need for Microsoft to make headway is critical .
After four years in the business , Microsoft continues to tread water as a distant third in the search market .
Even within its own walls it has n't been able to command a majority of searches .
In the broader market , the company has struggled to achieve a double - digit market share .
In April , the company had 9.9 percent of the U.S. search market , according to Nielsen Online .
That compares to 16.3 percent for Yahoo and 64 percent for Google .
The effort has also been a drag on the company 's overall earnings as it has continued to pour billions of dollars in profits from its Windows and Office businesses into the money - losing online push .
Last quarter alone , Microsoft 's online services business had a $ 575 million operating loss on revenue of $ 721 million .
Search is key for Microsoft -- and everyone else in the business -- because it is where much of the online money is made today , as opposed to services such as e-mail or instant messaging , which generate relatively paltry amounts of revenue .
Microsoft is counting on Kumo to help the company improve its fortunes and prove that the years - long investment in search will finally bear fruit .
However , some are less than optimistic that Microsoft can make headway .
" The battle for general Web search is all but over -- or at least the formation of the landscape for that , " said Ned May , the lead analyst for Outsell , an analysis firm that focuses on the information and publishing industries .
" It 's Google , Yahoo , Microsoft - - in that order . "
The launch of Wolfram Alpha shows that the public is still hungry for additional alternatives , May said , but added that at this point new advances are quickly copied , limiting broad - scale changes in the market .
May noted that Microsoft is rumored to be planning a $ 100 million ad campaign to promote its search improvements .
" That speaks to what it 's about today , " May said .
" They need to spend $ 100 million to move the needle in their direction .
That speaks volumes . "
Microsoft wo n't say when Kumo will be available publicly , or in fact whether it will keep the Kumo name or go with one of the reported alternatives , such as Bing .
Although Microsoft may well show Kumo at D , the public launch is still a bit further off .
A clock at Microsoft , said to be counting down the days until Kumo 's launch , wo n't be done ticking in time for the News Corp . - owned conference .
By my rough calculations , that should have the clock standing at somewhere around a dozen days from today .
As others have also noted , that coincides with June 3 , the start of SMX Advanced , where Microsoft 's Qi Lu is speaking .
Meanwhile , Microsoft has been testing some Kumo - like navigation features in recent days .
May said that the changes being talked about make sense , but may not be enough to help Microsoft stand out .
" That 's good stuff , " he said , but added that Yahoo already does a good job of things like suggesting additional searches .
" It 's already being done pretty well by the others . "

I do n't know if there are any terrorists in the US trying to help terrorists outside of the US .
But I do know that the conservative talk radio and MSM are giving aid to any would - be homegrown terrorists by turning the airwaves over to the likes of Limbaugh , Cheney , Newt Gingrich and others .
They simply broadcast their statements , giving them legitimacy .
Where is the reporting ?
This is cut and paste journalism .
For the first four months of this year , Dick and his daughter tried to scare us about abandoning torture .
They both appeared on every possible network program to rewrite history and justify torture .
It was a first strike , a shock and awe .
They told us that Obama was making us less safe .
Now we have respected generals , CIA documents , photos and interrogators telling the real story about what really went on .
Dick and Liz cannot deny what we all know now .
Cheney lied and thousands died .
Now that President Obama has nominated a Latina for the SCOTUS , Rush and Newt and others have been given a platform on the airways to spew hatred , lies and fear .
Not only are we to fear the African American president , but we are also to fear the first Latina justice nominee to the Supreme Court .
Not only did they strike the same tones in the first 24 hours of her nomination that they took throughout the presidential campaign , but their words also ring a familiar tone from those in our history who advocated genocide and terrorized a race of people with violence and death .
But I do n't blame them .
They do n't control the airways .
I thought it would be interested to research some of Adolph Hitler 's quotes and place them along side some of Limbaugh's .
Can help but wonder what Limbaugh 's ultimate goal might be .
Below are 7 quotes from Hitler and 9 quotes from Limbaugh .
Could it be that Limbaugh and other GOP crazies are using plays out of Hitler 's play book ?
The similarity in tone and strategic suggestions is scary .
Adolf Hitler 's Greatest
If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough , it will be believed .
2 . Make the lie big , make it simple , keep saying it , and eventually they will believe it .
All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach .
Hate is more lasting than dislike .
5.I use emotion for the many and reserve reason for the few .
6 . The art of leadership ... consists in consolidating the attention of the people against a single adversary and taking care that nothing will split up that attention .
The great masses of the people will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one .
Rush Limbaugh 's Greatest I mean , let ’s face it , we did n’t have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing .
Quite the opposite : slavery built the South .
I ’m not saying we should bring it back ; I ’m just saying it had its merits .
For one thing , the streets were safer after dark .
You know who deserves a posthumous Medal of Honor ?
James Earl Ray [ the confessed assassin of Martin Luther King ] .
We miss you , James .
Godspeed .
Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson ?
Look , let me put it to you this way : the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons .
There , I said it .
The NAACP should have riot rehearsal .
They should get a liquor store and practice robberies .
They ’re 12 percent of the population .
Who the hell cares ?
Take that bone out of your nose and call me back ( to an African American female caller ) .
I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well .
They ’re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well .
I think there ’s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really did n’t deserve .
Limbaugh attacks on Obama .
Limbaugh has called Obama a ‘ halfrican American ’ has said that Obama was not black but Arab because Kenya is an Arab region , even though Arabs are less than one percent of Kenya .
Since mainstream America has become more accepting of African - Americans , Limbaugh has decided to play against its new racial fears , Arabs and Muslims .
Despite the fact Obama graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law school , Limbaugh has called him an ‘ affirmative action candidate . ’
Limbaugh even has repeatedly played a song on his radio show ‘ Barack the Magic Negro ’ using an antiquated Jim Crow era term for black a man who many Americans are supporting for president .
Don Imus got fired for less .
We know Rush is after listeners to support his $ 400 million contract .
There does n't seem to be a bottom for his employer .
Every day , the MSM more and more look like the political version of Jerry Springer .
Their programming meetings must start with the question
Who can we have on TV to say the most outrageous things ?
Now , here is a revised version of the speech from the movie , The American President .
Compared to fresh fruits and dried fruits , freeze dried fruits are not really all that flavorful .
But they do have some advantages over their juicier counterparts .
For instance , they can be stored pretty much indefinitely without spoiling .
They can also be worked into recipes where other types of fruit just wo n’t work out .
This property turns out to be a great advantage when you like to play with flavors .
You certainly could chop up a strawberry and put it into some chocolate chip cookie dough , you ’ll end up with a cookie that might be a little too soft and strawberries that might be a little too watery / mushy after baking .
Freeze dried strawberries , by contrast , can be stirred into just about any dough , adding color and flavor without altering the consistency of the original recipe .
I used this method – and a bag a freeze dried strawberries – to make these Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookies .
Their flavor was more muted than that of a regular strawberry , but it was still distinct and made a nice change from the standard chocolate chip cookie .
I was also able to use a lot of berries because the dried berries mixed into the cookie dough very easily , rather like adding a handful of oats .
I used my hand mixer to stir them in .
Do n’t be worried if the mixer breaks up the berries !
This just distributes the flavor more evenly throughout the dough .
I loved the fact that you could taste the strawberries while the cookies retained their chewy , chocolate chip cookie consistency .
The baking time given below should give you a soft / chewy cookie after they cool down to room temperature , but you could bake them for another minute or two if you prefer a crisper cookie .
The chocolate does have a stronger flavor than the berries , so do n’t go overboard with the quantity of chocolate chips in this cookie or you ’ll end up with only a hint of strawberry flavor in the end result .
Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookies
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter , room temperature
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp honey
2 cups freeze dried strawberries
1 cup chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 350 F .
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper
In a large bowl , whisk together flour , baking soda and salt .
In a large bowl , cream together butter and sugars .
Add eggs in one at a time and beat until fully incorporated .
Stir in vanilla and honey .
Gradually blend in dry ingredients , followed by freeze dried strawberries and chocolate chips ( do n’t worry about breaking up the strawberries ; stir them vigorously ! ) .
Drop tablespoonfuls ( 1 - inch balls ) of dough onto prepared baking sheet .
Bake for about 10 - 11 minutes , or until cookies begin to brown and are set .
Bake an extra minute or two for a crisper cookie .
Cool for 2 minutes on baking sheet , then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely .
Makes 3 - 4 dozen
Here ’s an interesting concept from blog reader Todd Palmer , who wants reader opinions as to whether his concept can work in the marketplace ; and he also needs a good domain name .
Todd ’s idea :
The site would function as a recruiting network , giving students and corporations an entirely new dimension of access to one another .
Corporations would post tasks , real or simulated , for students to work on .
These tasks would be organized by subject area or industry , such as computer science , mechanical engineering , journalism , marketing , web design , etc .
Students would create individual or team profiles and work on selected tasks , submitting their completed work in the form of text , images , videos , power point , audio , or any other format that can be uploaded .
Companies will have the ability to rate submitted work , allowing students to accumulate a “ work score . ”
The benefit for the corporation would be their new outlet to recruit students who have a proven ability to excel at the type of assignment they will be faced with on the job .
They will also find that they have a large audience of well - educated students who are quite motivated to impress them with their submissions .
This will give them the power to bleg .
They will be able to post tasks that they are unable or unwilling to pay a single individual to do , and they will get at least a few surprisingly high - quality submissions due to the nature and size of their audience .
They will be able to tap into the creative minds of the masses at their will .
The students will be able to showcase their skills while still in school full time , and they will also be able to build a work portfolio that can be integrated into their resume .
Each top - notch project that they complete for a corporation will get them noticed , and make them more likely to be hired upon graduation .
This format could even allow for students to go pro early , meaning they could get recruited while still in school and get a jump on their careers while their new employers pay for the remainder of their education .
This new site could be to summer internships what online education has become to on - campus education .
It would give students exposure to real - world scenarios and assignments without the face - to - face interaction of an internship .
There are times , as a skeptic , when I know that the answer I get to a question may not be the one I want .
That 's part of being a skeptic .
We know Oprah Winfrey 's not a skeptic .
So I imagine that when she asks the public for their opinions on what Jenny McCarthy should talk about on her new talk show , well , she may get answers she really wo n't want to hear .
What would you like to see featured on Jenny 's show ?
What would you like for her to talk about ?
What are you and your friends buzzing about ?
Any topics you 'd like for her to tackle ?
Are there any questions that you have -- that you would love for her to answer ?
I have one : why does n't Jenny ever mention that she 's an " Indigo mom " anymore ?
Is it because it would reduce her credibility with everyday folks ?
Oh !
Here 's another one : why does she claim not to be antivax , when she distorts information about the toxicity of vaccinations ?
Golly , the more questions I ask , the more I think of !
How does she feel about a four week old infant dying in Australia because of the antivaccination movement down there ?
How does Jenny feel about all the outbreaks of preventable diseases occurring ?
( Oh , right , we already know the answer to that one : it 's OK and even necessary for kids to get sick and die to further her cause ) .
Why should we trust her " mommy instinct " over conclusive evidence that vaccines are totally unrelated to autism ?
What solid evidence does she have that changing her son's diet relieved his autism ?
Will she ever have real doctors on her show to discuss vaccines ?
Somehow , though , I suspect none of these questions will get answered by Jenny or Oprah ... because the answers are really something neither wants to hear .
For much of 2005 , I walked the same five - block stretch of Rivington Street , on New York City ’s Lower East Side .
A direct route to my favorite bars and restaurants , the street was lined with tenements and storefront bodegas that I usually strode right past .
Then one day something stopped me in my tracks .
It was a painting .
Rising up against the dirty white brick of a derelict building , this was no hurriedly sprayed graffiti .
It was a beautiful , arrestingly detailed black - and - white image of a young boy in a baggy T - shirt , one arm raised proudly above his head as if to show off his biceps .
The portrait was a complete mystery .
Who was the boy ?
Who had painted him , and why here , where he seemed to be growing right out of the sidewalk ?
Intrigued , I started looking for other great street art on the walls and alleyways of my city — and I found them everywhere .
“ Street art can change your relationship to a place , ” says Marc Schiller , cofounder with his wife , Sara , of WoosterCollective.com , a website devoted to street art around the world .
( The duo , well - known street - art aficionados , have lectured on the subject at the Tate Modern in London . )
“ It opens up your peripheral vision , so you start to notice things you did n’t before .
You start to tap into a city ’s underbelly , its soul .
” If the proliferation of street - art galleries , exhibits , online photo albums , and websites like Streetsy.com and Unurth.com are any indication , people are increasingly enthusiastic about finding that “ soul . ”
These days , says Sara Schiller , people “ do n’t just make a beeline for the big museums .
They walk around and explore … and see what people are putting up without permission . ”
That could mean poking into mural - covered alleyways in Melbourne and São Paulo , venturing into far - flung , nontouristy neighborhoods around London and Paris , or visiting iconic sites of political unrest , like the West Bank and remnants of the Berlin Wall .
Of course , what some call soul , others call vandalism .
Even exquisitely crafted street paintings like the one that first grabbed me ( which turned out to be the work of Swoon , now an internationally famous street artist ) , or the stencil paintings of Banksy , which have fetched six - figure prices at Sotheby ’s auctions , are illegal in most places around the world .
Consequently , the preferred media for many street artists — stickers , posters , stencils , and wheatpastes ( drawings that are cut out and slapped up with adhesive , like sheets of wallpaper ) — are ones that allow for quick - and - dirty installation .
But according to Marc Schiller , street art ’s fly - by - night quality — the fact that it can be torn down or obscured just hours after it appears — is part of what makes it magical .
“ There ’s an energy about street art that you know is ephemeral , ” he says .
“ Your relationship with it becomes really immediate and personal , almost visceral .
It may not have staying power — but it has power . ”

President Obama is expected to announce late this week that he will create a “ cyber czar , ” a senior White House official who will have broad authority to develop strategy to protect the nation ’s government - run and private computer networks , according to people who have been briefed on the plan .
The adviser will have the most comprehensive mandate granted to such an official to date and will probably be a member of the National Security Council but will report to the national security adviser as well as the senior White House economic adviser , said the sources , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are not final .
The announcement will coincide with the long - anticipated release of a 40 - page report that evaluates the government ’s cybersecurity initiatives and policies .
The report is intended to outline a “ strategic vision ” and the range of issues the new adviser must handle , but it will not delve into details , administration officials told reporters last month .
Cybersecurity “ is vitally important , and the government needs to be coordinated on this , ” a White House official said Friday , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
“ The report give conclusions and next steps .
It ’s trying to steer us in the right direction . ”

I love a good high - def movie , and Blu-ray players are sweet .
Only they 're so feature rich , the discs themselves are an afterthought — DOA or relegated to a niche format reserved for the finest films .
Advertisement
Oh , come on — you can't tell me you do n't see where this is going .
Even though the format has grown 72 % in the last quarter , every Blu-ray player we choose to review has an abundance of features that have nothing to do with Blu-ray .
In fact , they all have to do with delivering movies in a different way , with more instant gratification .
Advertisement
The joke is , when we were pushing for Blu-ray 2.0 with BD - Live a year ago , we did n't realize that the ethernet port was really not about enhanced Blu-ray at all , but about video on demand .
I own a few Blu-rays , like Wall - E , that have BD - Live components .
Never even bothered with them .
No point .
But you'd be a ' tard to buy a Blu-ray player without an ethernet port , and you'd be a ' tard to buy a Blu-ray player without Netflix on demand , and at this point , another service for new - release movies , like Amazon VOD or CinemaNow .
Netflix gives me back seasons of 30 Rock and The Office in high - def .
Pop quiz : Will I ever buy them on Blu-ray , or even DVD ?
No .
I can even get stuff I 'd have previously hunted down on disc , like The IT Crowd .
I can get lots of the movies I previously owned on DVD instantly on demand for no cost other than the $ 10 monthly subscription .
People do n't even bitch about DRM with Netflix , because it 's instant and always there , so even the copyright owners should be happy .
Time Warner 's boss even said he 's thinking about offering a Netflix - like VOD distribution channel for HBO — nothing like all - you - can - eat Rome , Wire and Band of Brothers to kill DVD sales , and HBO still gets their mad money .

You want to talk video quality ?
Fine .
I own The Dark Knight on Blu-ray .
That movie is freakin ' awesome , and I am happy to watch it on a Blu-ray player , while I sit exactly 47 inches from a 50 - inch 1080 p plasma television .
But what about Billy Madison ?
I love that movie too , but I first owned it on a VHS playing in 4:3 at what you might call 240i , and I can verify that the high - def version is no funnier .
In fact , instead of fishing out the HD DVD of it I have , and hooking up the HD DVD drive to my Xbox , I 'd probably sooner try to find it on Netflix , in whatever video quality they 're offering .
Besides , most people — most Giz readers , I 'd wager — are watching " high def " movies on LCD TVs they bought at Costco for $ 899 , so you can't tell me that they can see a difference between so - called VOD high - def and real bonafide Blu-ray high - def , even though there definitely is one .

The Criterion Collection belongs on Blu-ray .
But six films by Wes Anderson , Terry Gilliam and Akira Kurosawa do not an industry make .
Like our discussion of audiophiles , there 's a need to preserve ( and even appreciate ) video at very high quality , but that need does n't trickle down to the masses , and especially does n't matter for every single film , or even the vast majority of middle - of - the - road movies and TV .
DVDs were a hit because they were the smartest way to deliver most video in the years 1999 to 2007 .
Now , the smartest way to deliver most video is over broadband , not on high - density shiny discs .

Do n't get me wrong .
You 'll buy a " Blu- ray player . "
Stats show many of you already are .
You may even buy some Blu-ray discs , or pay the extra $ 2 or $ 3 for Netflix Blu-ray rental .
But the amount of time you 'll spend watching Blu-ray on it will continue to dwindle , until , maybe one day , the disc tray just refuses to open from lack of use .
A Bloomberg story gives the not - heartening news that the government - prodded mortgage modifications are producing higher failure rates as the economy decays :
Mortgages modified in the third quarter failed at a faster pace than those revised in the first , and the delinquency rate on the least risky loans doubled , signs of deteriorating credit quality , U.S. regulators said .
Loans modified in the first quarter to help borrowers keep their homes fell delinquent 41 percent of the time after eight months , and second - quarter loans had a 46 percent default rate , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision said in a report today .
Third - quarter trends “ are worsening , ” the agencies said .
“ For the year and this quarter , we saw the same trend that we saw last time : quite high re-default rates , no matter how we measured them , ” John Dugan , the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency , said in a conference call with reporters .
Lenders including Citigroup Inc. and loan - servicing companies are adjusting mortgages by lowering interest rates or crafting longer - term payment plans .
The Obama administration is acting to help as many as 9 million struggling homeowners by using taxpayer funds to pay lenders such as bond investors , mortgage servicers for reworking the mortgages .
Dugan said higher re-default rates are likely related to stressful economic conditions and new loan plans are not producing significant reductions to make mortgages sustainable .
It ’s important to notice what kinds of mods were offered : interest rate reductions and lengthening maturities .
These are not very deep mods , in other words .
Mods that offer principal reduction have higher success rates .
And Wilbur Ross , a well known investor in distressed companies , is not exactly the charitable sort .
As reported in HousingWire :
[ Wilbur ]
Ross has plenty of skin in the mortgage servicing game , as he owns Irving , Tex. - based American Home Mortgage Servicing , Inc. , which recently became the nation ’s largest third - party servicer with the acquisition of a large portfolio from Citigroup Inc … .
Last week , Ross told HousingWire in an interview that he thinks the best way to motivate lenders , servicers , and homeowners work together on modifications requires far more than what ’s been proposed so far .
In particular , he believes that what ’s needed is aggressive principal modifications for borrowers most in need .
He has said that his American Home servicing shop has seen six - month recidivism rates below 20 percent — compared to the 50 or 60 percent standard in the industry — because the servicer has been aggressively looking to cut principal balances .
“ The price of housing needs to be cleaned out .
The Obama administration could right - size every underwater home and reduce principal to fit the current market value of the home .
If they are going to deal with it they have to deal with it in a severe way , ” Ross told HousingWire .
“ They also really need to consider all borrowers who are underwater , and not just the ones that have gone into default . ”
The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan does some of that , but does n’t go far enough , Ross suggested .
“ The have to reduce the principal amount of loan , not just nonperforming loans , but also performing ones , ” he told CNBC .
“ Why should a guy who ’s not paying benefit , while some poor citizen who ’s struggling to make the payments gets stuck with the mortgage ? ”
His own plan looks something like this : 1 . The lender takes a write - down in principal , and the servicer takes a similar hit on any servicing strip on the newly - reduced UPB .
2 . After principal reduction , the government guarantees half of the remaining principal the lender now holds .
3 . This guarantee of half the principal can now be sold into the securitization market , which will give the lender an income stream on the home again and offset some of the losses the owner of the loan has to take when they write down the principal .
4 . When the house is sold , if the value of the home has gone up at the point of sale , the homeowner and the lender share in the profits earned on the gain .
Ross is n’t the first to suggest an home equity sharing plan , and there are clearly strong complexities in how any such plan would be put together , particularly as it relates to second lien holders and / or investors in junior bond classes .
But the fact that a large investor with such a strong hand in the servicing business is suggesting it ’s possible at all to accomplish is something that perhaps bears more attention than the idea has been getting as of late .
We ’ve been arguing for some time that with housing in many market trading at well below peak levels , the bank can offer a principal reduction and still come out ahead .
In normal times , the cost of foreclosure means recovery rates of 70 % at best .
So assuming 50 - 60 % ( and that is probably still high ) , the bank can reduce principal 25 % and still come out ahead .
It is n’t simply that a principal reduction lowers monthly payments more ( but let us not kid ourselves , that ’s a biggie ) but it also changes the owner ’s perspective .
Why should he struggle to make payments on a house that is unlikely to be worth more than the mortgage ?
Odds are that he is still looking at a foreclosure or short sale as his endgame .
That also means he has zero reason to make repairs or routine investments .
Conversely , if the mortgage is written down to something much closer to the current value of the house , he has much greater reason to persevere .
Why is n’t that happening ?
Ah , those pesky securitizations .
Although investors litigating to block mods is the oft - given reason for not taking this course of action ( a presumed to be high number of securitizations either bar or restrict mods ) , my impression is servicers simply have not wanted to fight this fight ( they have clearly defined compensation in the case of foreclosure versus no rewards for mods , save the fees under new government programs ) .
Paying legal fees to fight investors is an even more dubious business proposition ( it ’s a near certainty they ca n’t charge those expenses to the securitization trust , and it would thus come out of their bottom line ) .
That is a long winded way of saying I doubt that there has been much study by legal talent as to how to overcome mod restrictions in servicing agreements .
Given the high level of fraud ( in a small sample , Fitch found evidence of fraud in every loan file it examined ) , there might be ways to persuade investors they have more to lose than gain by pursuing this line of legal action .
About 10,000 fans are expected to travel to the city without tickets Manchester United fans are being urged to avoid Rome 's tourist areas when they visit for the Champions League final .

Samantha Orobator fell pregnant four months after being taken into prison A pregnant British woman faces death by firing squad if she is convicted of smuggling drugs at a trial in Laos , campaigners have said .
Prosecutors claim Samantha Orobator , 20 , was in possession of 1.5 lb ( 680g ) of heroin when she was arrested at Wattay airport in Laos in August .
Legal charity Reprieve has called on the UK government to intervene with the Laotian authorities on her behalf .
The Foreign Office says it is " paying close attention to her welfare " .
Miss Orobator , from London , has been held since her arrest at Phonthong prison in the south east Asian country .
She became pregnant in the prison in December and is due to give birth in September .
In Laos , anyone caught with more than 1lb ( 500g ) of heroin faces a mandatory death sentence .
Reprieve legal director Clive Stafford Smith said that on Thursday the authorities in Laos announced that they were bringing forward her trial by around a year to next week .
Nothing that happens in that prison is voluntary
Clive Stafford Smith , Reprieve
He believes the decision to move the trial was only taken after arrangements were made for her to see a lawyer for the first time .
He said : " It 's pretty shocking that they would do that apparently to avoid her seeing a British lawyer before she has to go to trial .
" The notion that no lawyer should be appointed to defend her is outrageous . "
He said she was " certainly not guilty " and had originally told police the drugs were not hers .
Mr Stafford Smith added : " We 're dealing with a woman who has clearly become pregnant in prison .
Nothing that happens in that prison is voluntary " .
Labour MP Stephen Pound , vice chair of the all party group on the death penalty , said Miss Orobator was being kept " in the most inhumane circumstances " .
He criticised conditions in the prison saying there was evidence of " no space , no light , no exercise , no diet , no food , no consideration of the needs of a woman carrying a baby " .
There is no British Embassy in Laos and the nearest is in the Thai capital , Bangkok .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : " We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in discussion with the Laotian authorities about her case .
" We have visited Samantha every month and we have kept in close contact with the family . "
She said Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Minister Bill Rammell will raise the issue with the Laotian foreign minister when he visits the UK on 7 May .
But Mr Stafford Smith fears that could be too late .
He said : " The trial will be over by then .
We 're calling on the government to do everything in its power " .
He wants the trial to be put back and for Reprieve lawyers and mental health professionals to be allowed into the prison .
He is also seeking assurances that Miss Orobator will be provided with a proper defence .
Miss Orobator was born in Nigeria but lived in south London from the age of eight .
Her father lives in Nigeria and her mother and three sisters live in Ireland .
She had been on holiday in Thailand and the Netherlands before travelling to Laos .
At least 39 people have been sentenced to death in Laos since 2003 .

I THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH . .
Hi Newbies !!!!!
WELCOME TO DTM !!
Today I 'm going to take an hour or so out of my day to create this thread .
Read it thoroughly please , I now wish I would had a thread like this when I was starting out .
It would have saved me a lot of time and money .
Let 's start off with a little history about myself in part one of this five part series .
PART ONE
My name is Edward Brown , and if you have been browsing this forum for as little as one day , you probably have heard of me .
I started out with the internet in 2003 .
Until 2005 , I did not make any money .
From there my career took off .
I was a true internet marketer
But , as the economy failed in 2008 , so did my profits .
So I decided to take up article writing .
I did n't make that much .
I thought the internet as I knew it was over for me until I found out about something called a ' hyip ' .
It stands for High Yield Investment Program .
It is just like my site , except usually the administrators do not pay you , and instead run away with your money .
That is not who I am .
As a newbie , I invested $ 300 in one without even making a test spend .
Guess what ?
It was a scam .
I lost it all .
( Which one was it ?
www.marketforexltd.com.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT INVESTING THERE .
It 's a scam now .
I really am pissed . )
So , I took a break from the internet , feeling down and depressed .
Until September 22 , 2008 , when I signed up for Dream Team Money .
And , let me tell you , it was a GREAT decision that I made .
THIS IS THE BEST FORUM ON THE WEB .

Picasso’s at - hand art supplies during those early days of postwar reconstruction included panels of fiber cement and Ripolin — basically Sheetrock and house paint — as well as plywood , and Picasso used them all to create pastoral scenes like “ La Joie de Vivre ” in which a curvy female nude clearly modeled on Gilot dances joyously in an idyllic Mediterranean landscape amid flute - playing fauns and dancing goats .
The painting , the unofficial icon of the Antibes period , is among the most beloved treasures of the museum ’s collection , which also includes portraits of striped - shirted fishermen and dreamily reclining nudes .
Both the artist and the museum curator acknowledged that had they set out to create a Picasso museum , it may never have happened .
In the end , the sheer quantity and scale of the works determined that some sort of legacy would remain at the chateau .
The current exhibit reunites those large works , which Picasso could not take with him when the cold drove him from the drafty chateau in November , with smaller ones that he did carry away ( and that are now returning for the first time ) .
Included among them are many drawings never before exhibited that provide a window into Picasso ’s artistic process , which Bernardo Laniado - Romero , former director of the Picasso museum in Malaga , Spain , describes as “ the laboratory ” of his ideas .
“ If you want to understand the meanings of his paintings , you need to look at the drawings he was creating at the same time , ” Laniado - Romero said in an interview .
Several drawings on view trace Picasso ’s evolution of the theme of the “ femme - fleur ” — images of a woman ( again , Françoise Gilot ) transformed into a flower — that seem almost childlike representations of fertility .
Indeed , in the fall of 1946 , she was already pregnant with the first of their two children , but as she recounted in her 1964 memoir “ Life with Picasso , ” their day - to - day existence was not all flowers and joie de vivre .
She eventually left him in 1953 — the only one of his lovers to do so .
Not far from the museum , Picasso often sketched at the beach at La Garoupe , a cove on the Cap d’Antibes .
Today , beyond the usual swimming and sunbathing , the beach offers travelers a lovely promenade winding along the sea .
In the old town of Antibes , there are lots of charming cafes , restaurants and crêperies to try out , and a bustling morning produce and flower market changes in the afternoon to a place where artisans sell handicrafts .
A few miles northwest of Antibes is Vallauris , where Picasso and Gilot moved in 1948 and raised their two young children , Claude and Paloma , until 1953 , and where Picasso explored the medium of ceramics .
Georges and Suzanne Ramié , owners of the Madoura factory , a producer of the region ’s traditional platters , pitchers and other pottery , were as clever as Dor de la Souchère had been at the Château Grimaldi .
By offering Picasso a place to work , they in turn created a good business for themselves .
Update : A rep for A&E Television , which owns HIstory Channel , says these are not authorized History Channel ads .
This rep did not know if they were created by Ogilvy and Fran Luckin , as they were attributed on Adsoftheworld.com .
We 've updated the images with watermarks reflecting their inauthenticity .

Certainly thought - provoking , possibly anti-American , the poster - sized print ads are engaging in just the way online advertising struggles to be .

Enlarge First Family Church
" We had 2,000 people , the largest worship service turnout of the year , " for a Sunday service in February for people who had lost their jobs , says the Rev. Jeremy Johnston , executive pastor of First Family Church in Overland Park , Kan .
The church has added ministries to support the unemployed .

Among 1,000 pastors who were asked about the impact of " recent problems in the economy " : • 62 % have had more requests for financial assistance from outside the congregation .
• 40 % have members of their congregations who have lost their jobs .
• 37 % have increased spending from the church budget to help those who are in need .
• 31 % have explored starting new ministries to aid the disadvantaged .
• 31 % have had more requests for financial assistance from members of their congregation .
• 27 % have paid for more ministry items out of their own pocket than normal .

Cathy Lynn Grossman .
Pleas for help — spiritual and financial — are flooding U.S. churches , from tiny congregations to megachurches , as recession woes seep into the pews , a new survey finds .
Pastors say they 're giving out benevolent funds in record numbers , increasing ministries to the unemployed and the financially fearful , even reaching into their own pockets more to help .
FAITH & REASON : ' People want to hear from God ' now , in hard times Nearly two in three pastors ( 62 % ) report more people from outside their church asking for help , and nearly a third ( 31 % ) see more such requests from church members , according to a survey of 1,000 Protestant pastors .
The survey , by LifeWay Research , a Christian polling firm based in Nashville , finds that 40 % of pastors say they have church members out of work , and 37 % say their church has increased spending to help the needy .
( The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points . )
The Rev. Bill Ankerberg has seen it all at his Whittier Area Community Church , east of Los Angeles .
The church gave more financial aid to folks in one month , $ 26,000 from the benevolent fund , than it was asked to give in all of 1996 , the year he came to Whittier , he says .
Like 27 % of pastors in the survey , Ankerberg has given personally , too .
Last weekend , 1,100 of the Whittier Area church 's 1,800 adult members were signed up to help with more than 112 service projects in area schools , hospitals , homeless shelters and other public sites .
First Family Church in Overland Park , Kan. , called all 5,000 members to tell them about a special February Sunday worship service where people who had lost their jobs could come to be anointed with oil by senior pastor Jerry Johnston and his son , Jeremy , the executive pastor .
" We had 2,000 people , the largest worship service turnout of the year , " says the Rev. Jeremy Johnston .
" The worship team led the prayers while my dad and I stood in the aisles , and one after another people came forward to be anointed and for prayer .
It brought me to tears . "
First Family also has added ministries to support the unemployed , and next month will hold a baby shower for new mothers from 17 shelters in Kansas City .
" We 're going through money a lot faster in terms of helping people with utility bills and shut - offs , and we 're seeing people we have never seen before seek help , " says the Rev. Larry Klinker of historic Zion Lutheran Church in New Middletown , Ohio , where nearly 140 worship on Sundays .
Zion is a distribution site for the Salvation Army , which once gave Zion $ 5,000 to distribute each year but now has cut back to $ 3,500 .
" I spend more time on counseling now .
The difference I see between now and other hard times , " says Klinker , who has spent 27 years at Zion , " is that it 's more pervasive , and there 's a sense of no end in sight . "

Dymaxion car chronology
< back up to dymaxion car notes
1927 late in 1927 , Bucky turns his attention to the transport phase of his comprehensive plan he invents , at least on paper , his " 4D twin , angularly - orientable , individually throtleable , jet - stilt , controlled - plummeting transport "
1933 given as main date for the car January 1933 , a friend gives " a few thousand dollars " for Bucky to test some of his Dymaxion ideas due to the Depression at the time , this money has very large buying power Bucky knows the Dymaxion house was not yet affordable to develop , and that jets were n't yet feasible , so he decides to focus on a ground vehicle March 1933 , rents a disused factory in Bridgeport , Conn .
screens 1,000 job applicants , hires crew of 27 to work under the engineering direction of Starling Burgess July 12 , 1933 , demonstrated to the public front - wheel drive , rear engine and rear - wheel steering aluminum body , chrome - molybdenum aircraft steel chassis 1/8th inch shatterproof glass 19.5 feet long about a half - ton a great deal of suspension :
The first frame , hinge - supported by the front wheels , carried the engine and drive shaft .
Frame No. 2 was hinge - and - spring connected to Frame No. 1 , but was supported by the steerable tail wheel .
The body , in turn , had its own independent frame which was sprung directly from the front axle , with a balancing spring connected back , abreast the engine , to Frame No. 1 .
The consequence [...] was that the car could zoom across open fields with the agility of a light plane , yet provide a ride as smooth as any cruise on a highway .
Car # 1 color : white , with dark belly sold to Captain " Al " ( Alford F. )
Williams , then holder of the world 's speed record for seaplanes Col.
William Francis Forbes - Sempill , an English aviation expert , commissioned to come to the US and test the performance of car No. 1 car is involved in fatal accident ( what date ? ) both Williams and Fuller , after carefully inspecting the car 's functioning parts and reconstructing the sequence of events , were convinced that the Dymaxion car itself had no design or structural fault which had a bearing on the accident car is repaired Williams sells it to the director of the automotive division of the U.S. Bureau of Standards another source [ 3 ] says it was sold to Gulf Oil was very lightwight , weighing about as much as a VW beetle [ 3 ]
October 18 , 1933 : US Patent application is submitted
1934 Car # 2 second car built on order from a group of English automobile enthusiasts completed in January 1934 flat window panels on the front , instead of the rounded glass on Car # 1 improved , lighter frame structure color : entirely dark , and shiny they no longer wanted it due to the bad publicity of Car # 1's crash some time later , Fuller sells it to a group of his Bridgeport mechanics years later , it ended up USED AS A CHICKEN COOP [ 3 ] also fairly light , but a little heavier than the first one [ 3 ]
Car # 3
Fuller spends his " entire family inheritance " to built car # 3 color : emerald green , with white top and a blue Formica interior . [ 3 ] according to J. Baldwin , it was really heavy , " built like a tank " completed in 1934 , makes it to the Chicago World 's Fair sold to Leopold Stokowski and his wife , who sold it a few months later during the next nine years the car is resold many times , and for a long span disappears from sight Peter Viemeister relates a story of going for a ride in the car in 1934 , when he was not yet 6 years old .
1937 December 7 1937 : US Patent Office grants the car patent # 2,101,057
1943 Car # 1 is destroyed in a fire in the U.S. Bureau of Standards '
Washington garage at the request of Henry Kaiser , Bucky redesigns the car , making use of newer automotive technology the new design which was never built :
Powered by three separate air - cooled " outboard " type ( opposed cylinder ) engines , each coupled to its own wheel by a variable fluid drive .
Each of the engine - drivewheel assemblies was detachable .
The engines themselves were run always at the same speed ; the speed of the car was controlled by varying the quantity of fluid in the coupling .
Low - horsepower engines - 15 to 25 hp , cut down to one engine at cruising speed , for 40 - 50 mpg Steered at cruising speeds by the front wheels , rear - wheel steering was used only as an auxiliary for tight turns , or to move sideways Tail mounted on extensible boom summarized by J. Baldwin : " Ten years later , Bucky put what he'd learned to work in a much handier five - seater with a tiny engine at each wheel .
This time , the front wheels steered , but all three could be steered for tight city turns and crabbing sideways into parking spaces .
High speed stability was enhanced by extending the rear wheel on a boom to lengthen the wheelbase . "
1944 Car#3 is discovered in Brooklyn , and repurchased for Fuller by his friend , J. Arch Butts , Jr. of Wichita , Kansas
1945 Car #3 shown at Wichita airport estimated to have been driven 300,000 miles Fuller restores it to prime condition
1950s Car #3 disappears .
J. Baldwin says he finally tracked down a junkyard owner in Wichita who says he cut it up for scrap during the Korean war . [ 3 ]
1960s Reportedly , the magazine " Car and Driver " did some articles on the Dymaxion car in the late 60s .
Reportedly : " I remember the car being on display in the basement of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago in the mid 60's .
I was frustrated because the windows had been painted and I could n't see inside . "

No other significant troop movements within the country have been reported , but analysts have warned of a further increase in military tension , including the possibility of a naval clash along the sea border between the two Koreas .
The UN Security Council 's five permanent members - plus Japan and South Korea - are working on a strong resolution condemning North Korea 's actions , including possible punitive measures .
Washington has reaffirmed US commitments to its allies Japan and South Korea while accusing Pyongyang of " sabre - rattling and bluster and threats " .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the North 's violation of Security Council resolutions , but also held out hope that North Korea would return to six -nation disarmament talks .
Moscow said that while world powers should be firm , they should not inflame tensions , adding that the stand - off could only be solved through talks .
Heightened tensions Last month North Korea launched a long - range rocket over Japanese airspace , angering the international community .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .

More from BBC World Service Pyongyang said the rocket had carried a peaceful communications satellite , but several nations viewed it as cover for a missile test .
The UN Security Council condemned the launch and , in retaliation , North Korea announced it was quitting long - running six-nation negotiations on its nuclear disarmament .
It ejected all international monitors and said it would reopen its main nuclear plant at Yongbyon , which was closed in July 2007 as part of a disarmament deal .
When North Korea agreed in February 2007 to abandon its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions , there was real hope of reaching a settlement .
But the negotiations stalled as it accused its negotiating partners - the US , South Korea , Japan , China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations .

Original Story
Share this article
( Natural News ) The Mothers Act is due to be voted on soon by the U.S. Senate .
This is the Big Pharma - advocated law that would require the mandatory screening of all expectant mothers for depression -- with the intent of drugging them if symptoms are present .
Investigative journalist Kelly Patricia O'Meara has authored an important op - ed piece on the dangers of the Mothers Act , and I 'm publishing it here , with her permission , to share this with Natural News readers .
Those wanting to stay up to date on the battle against psych drugs may also be interested in following CCHR on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/CCHRINT
What follows here is authored by Kelly Patricia O'Meara :
It seems these days that everything is a test .
Yes , the powers that be have decided that taxpayer benevolence now is contingent upon passing a stress test .
But much to the dismay of those being tested , the results may reveal , for example , that the nation 's financial wizards and auto giants are actually bankrupt midgets and unworthy of America 's support .
Given that officialdom has embraced the stress test as a barometer of future viability and success and a determinant for public financing , it seems reasonable to request that other important issues that very personally impact the health and welfare of the American people be subjected to similar stress tests .
There is none more deserving of stress testing than the proposed MOTHERS Act .
On the surface , the MOTHERS
Act reflects its sponsors overwhelming compassion and empathy for women suffering from alleged mental health disorders resulting from childbirth  often referred to as Postpartum Depression .
But when one conducts a brief stress test on important sections of the legislation , taxpayers may find that this costly and sweeping mental health legislation actually fails women of America , but goes a long way in inflating the balance sheets of one of the most lucrative industries in the nation  big Pharma .
For instance , the MOTHERS Act legislation that currently is pending in the U.S. Senate states that the Secretary of Health and Human Services may " make grants to eligible entities " to deliver essential services to individuals with a postpartum condition .
What the legislation does n't delineate is who and what entities may receive these grants .
Are these " entities " funded by pharmaceutical companies ?
Lawmakers have not specified what constitutes an " entity " so it will be impossible to know if there are conflicts of interest between those who develop the screening tools and conduct research and the pharmaceutical companies who most certainly will benefit financially from the increased diagnosing .
Furthermore , no research guidelines have been provided for public disclosure .
This is no small issue , given that the Senate Finance Committee recently exposed the conflicts of interest of the top ten psychiatric researchers in the U.S. who had received millions of dollars in pharmaceutical funding .
Where is the guarantee that the " entities " are not pharmaceutical front - men ?
The legislation also allows for the " expansion and intensification of activities " into the research of Postpartum conditions and " evaluation of new treatments . "
This is a humdinger .
Despite ever - increasing published data and clinical studies challenging the safety of antidepressants and other antipsychotic drugs , there is no guidance provided by lawmakers to mandate that the public be made aware of the avalanche of scientific data that not only questions the efficacy of the drugs available to mothers suffering from these conditions , but also warning of the dangers associated with currently available " treatments .
"
The section of the legislation dealing with expanding the research into the causes of Postpartum conditions is wholly void of any guidelines that insure the validity of the research conducted , and provides nothing in the way of public disclosure or peer - review of research before it is launched in education campaigns .
In the real world , research is conducted and submitted for peer review .
In this instance , it appears that Congress has learned nothing from the ongoing banking debacle and naively believes that the researchers will be on their best behavior  self - policing themselves .
This is a dangerous omission in the legislation , especially since the Senate Finance Committee has exposed the serious conflicts of interest that exist between researchers and pharmaceutical companies .
Making matters worse , much of the legislation revolves around funding national education campaigns about Postpartum Depression , including Public Service Announcements and television and radio advertisements .
Based on the current language of the legislation , research will be conducted without peer review  no checks and balances ; no one to validate the integrity of the research which then will be used to determine a woman 's mental health status .
Given that this research will be used to develop questions or tests for screening new mothers for possible mental disorders , one might find it important to know that the research has integrity and has been validated by the scientific community , free of pharmaceutical largesse .
Congress apparently did n't think integrity of the research is important and there are no provisions to protect women from pharmaceutical driven research .
Taxpayers may also expect that such important legislation would make provisions for some kind of oversight ; some government entity that could provide feedback on the success or failure of this mental health campaign .
One avenue that may help lawmakers ' determine if these new programs are working is the Food and Drug Administration 's MedWatch Adverse Event Reports .
MedWatch collects information about people who have experienced adverse reactions to drugs overseen by the FDA .
With the increased drugging that most certainly will occur with the increase in diagnosing , it seems logical that lawmakers would insert provisions in the legislation to annually review Adverse Event Reports collected by MedWatch , especially those relating to drugs prescribed in the treatment of Postpartum Depression .
Unfortunately , because the nation 's lawmakers have provided no provisions for oversight , countless numbers of women may be harmed by the " treatments " but will be none the wiser because no protections were provided in the legislation .
There also is the very basic question of why the government is endorsing this sweeping mental health legislation and sanctioning a national advertising campaign about Postpartum Depression when there is no definitive data about the cause of the condition or that it is an objective confirmable abnormality  the scientific standard for disease .
Given that there are so many unknowns in this legislation , it seems irresponsible to go forward without reasonable protections in place .
Congress must insure that all research and screening tests proposed and endorsed by this legislation be disclosed for peer - review and consumer input before implementing any screening tests and approving any research to be used in the national education campaign , including Public Service Announcements and radio and television advertising .
Given the documented risks related to the current modes of treatments , including antidepressant and antipsychotics , which are commonly prescribed for Postpartum Depression and documented to cause birth defects and host of other issues in pregnant and nursing mothers , Congress must include mandatory reviews of published research and clinical data on the drugs prescribed for the treatment of Postpartum Depression .
Finally , Congress must protect the integrity of the research by providing strict guidelines to insure that there are no conflicts of interest between the researcher and the pharmaceutical industry .
Without these safeguards , the MOTHERS
Act cannot today , or ever , pass a stress test of viability and mothers and their children certainly will be on the losing end of this mental health campaign .
Sometimes it's in the best interest of the people for Congress NOT to act , and until our lawmakers are confident that all legislative precautions have been taken to insure optimum results , this is one of those times .
I 'm a graduate student at MIT and I 've been doing some research on beverage consumption and carbonation ( CO2 ) density .
I noticed the same thing by accident when I was on my break and I immediately went to the professor I 'm doing the work with and we experimented with different sodas and can / bottle sizes .
After about a month and a half 's work , we 've just found out what causes this change in taste ( the paper is going to be published in MITs magazine " Technology Review " ) .
Quite frankly the results are astounding , and really , quite disturbing .
The short answer is because of these partciles in the soda called " neutrinos . "
The consistency of syrup has nothing to do with it ( as my colleague so naively hypothesized ) .
In soda there are many molecules and elements that are unstable ( hence the bubbles ) , and when a certain type of element because unstable , it will undergo nuclear decay .
Before this was n't an issue , but with the some new ingredient they started buying from China , the amount of decay is phenomenal .
Neutrinos are released along with Beta - positive particles in this nuclear decay .
Since the decay begins when the soda is put into the bottle , there is a higher concentration of neutrinos in the smaller bottles .
Neutrinos are anti-matter , and if you 've ever seen Star Trek , you know that whenever anti-matter comes into contact with matter , it explodes .
The reason your mouth is n't torn to bits right now is that neutrinos are so tiny that they only destroy your tongue and slowly eat away at your stomach and intestines .
The reason it tastes better in small bottles is because the higher neutrino concentration eats away at your taste buds faster , which makes it taste better .
We 're taking this up with the FDA and congress as we speak , and my NDA just expired so I 'll be spreading this around as much as I can .
My advice ?
DON'T DRINK SODA !
Money makes the world go ‘ round , and we now realize that when the force is n’t with us , things can come to a screeching halt .
Artist Robert Dowd was well aware of the power and glory of money , and during the 1960s he was “ making ” it after his own fashion -- creating drawings and paintings that satirically reinterpreted the face of American currency .
In one series he substituted a homage to his own heroes -- making an image in the style of such artists as Vincent van Gogh , Pablo Picasso , Jasper Johns -- in place of the presidents usually slotted in the oval ( when once there was an oval ) .
In another series he depicted the back of a $ 10 bill with the stately U.S. Treasury building standing like a Greek temple -- except this one is on fire or hit by a cyclone .
The career of this now - obscure artist is revisited in “ Robert Dowd : Pop Art Money ” at the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University , through April 5 .
Michael Zakian , director of the museum and curator of the show , has been researching Dowd for the last year and a half , finding most of the material in the artist ’s private papers , since little has been written about him .
“ He was like a storyteller , ” Zakian says , “ and he used money as a way of telling stories about people ’s priorities , wants and desires . ”
In 1962 , Dowd was recognized as a pioneer of Pop art .
He was included in the landmark “ New Painting of Common Objects ” at the Pasadena Art Museum alongside the likes of Andy Warhol , Jim Dine , Wayne Thiebaud .
It was among the first Pop art exhibitions in the country .
For the next six years , Dowd made gargantuan - size drawings and paintings of money , some nearly 10 feet wide , onto which he projected his counterculture humor as well as his own valuations of importance .
Even a visit from the Secret Service did n’t stop him .
He turned to painting postage stamps , but continued his money series in private .
His career never really took off , despite an effort to reinvent himself by moving to New York in the early 1970s .
“ The Pop art that achieved international recognition and lasting fame was reductive , detached , and impersonal , ” Zakian suggests in his catalog essay .
“ The most celebrated Pop artists such as Andy Warhol , Roy Lichtenstein and Ed Ruscha created a cool , aloof art that mimicked the emotional indifference of mechanical reproduction . ”
Dowd , in contrast , was always engaged with his heart and his hand , and given to a prankster ’s sensibility .
He also , as the show reveals , went on to other concerns -- going through a Magritte - like Surrealist period in the 1970s , an exploration of abstraction inspired by his interest in quantum theory and Asian philosophy in the 1980s .
He returned to Los Angeles in 1985 , and 10 years later he died , destitute , at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Westwood .
Today Dowd is mainly known for his money series , which has been featured in two traveling exhibitions -- the Smithsonian ’s “ Realm of the Coin : Money in American Art ” and the Federal Reserve ’s “ Show Me the Money : The Dollar as Art . ”
For artists , playing around with money ’s design was fun and challenging .
Mary Anne Goley , director of the fine arts program for the Federal Reserve , even held that , “ Working with currency can engender patriotic feelings . ”
But there was also sometimes a subversive or at least critical undercurrent in the work .
“ Money is a powerful blend of American literature , document and symbol , ” Dowd once wrote in his personal notes .
“ Forget that it illustrates a complete monetary system of unimaginable proportions or that it represents destinies of nations and men .
What we are dealing with here is a marvelous form of American literature of epic proportions in the proud tradition of P.T. Barnum and tabloid journalism . ”

Remember that Air Force
One flyover in Manhattan that scared New Yorkers into thinking another 9/11 was underway ?
Well , the White House has decided to release the reason for the flight : Publicity photos to show off the presidential plane , with the Statue of Liberty in the background .
The New York Daily News called it a photo oops .
A White House report on the incident " will be concluded at some point this week , " said press secretary Robert Gibbs .
" We 'll release its findings and release a photo . "
Reporters have been demanding the photo for days , citing the administration 's commitment to transparency .
White House wavering had earned the president some of his toughest criticism to date .
Talk show host David Letterman had joked , " is it just me or is Obama ' Bushing ' it up a little bit on this one ? "
The issue may also surface today when New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg visits with Obama to discuss education .
Above is a cellphone photo of the April 27 incident .
We 'll post the White House version when we see it .

The blogosphere has been all a buzz this week after an article in the Financial Times suggested that AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s prized Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ AAAÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â credit rating could be in jeopardy .
I first mused about this last fall even before the extent of the financial crisis was fully known and long before the government - sponsored stimulus packages added trillions to the US national debt .
In the ensuing eight months since then , conditions have only worsened and , if anything , the case to downgrade the US credit rating is even greater .
Most of the pundits addressing this topic all agree that losing triple A status would be catastrophic to the US and would torpedo efforts to emerge from the recession .
However , most writers seem to believe that the US economy is too big , and the US dollar too widely - held , to entertain the possibility that the US could be anything but the safest of bets .
Too big ?
Too important ?
IsnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t that what they said about General Motors ?
AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s annual deficit is now approaching $ 2 trillion a year with an accumulated debt of $ 11 trillion which is set to double in less than six years if the US remains on its present course .
This alone must give ratings agents reason for concern but more telling perhaps is the recent actions of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s number one lender . *
In September 2008 , China surpassed Japan as the largest holder of US debt which as of March 2009 , was nearly $ 768 billion dollars .
In fact , in just over a year China has nearly doubled its US holdings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including more than $ 50 billion in the last four months alone .
Meanwhile , many of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s other traditional investors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ countries including the United Kingdom , Brazil , Switzerland , and Germany Ã¢â‚¬â€œ actually reduced their US dollar exposures .
But if China is increasing its investment in the US , is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t this a vote of confidence in the long - term prospects for America ?
Actually , no Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lending the US more money in this manner has more to do with China protecting its own investments as any drop in the US dollar also hits ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bottom line .
Further to this point and as noted in yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s New York Times , China may be buying US debt , but it is being much more selective , eschewing long - term Treasuries and government - sponsored enterprises ( such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) in favor of short - term notes .
In other words , China is increasingly less willing to accept the greater risk of long - dated bonds and is actually exchanging long - term bonds for short - term notes , which even though they have lower yields , provide greater flexibility should China wish to divest itself of some of its US holdings .
The implications of this should not be ignored as it represents a major shift in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s policy from even as little as a year ago .
Not only is China reducing its exposure to long - term US securities , China is also Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as we learned recently Ã¢â‚¬â€œ increasing its supply of gold in a bid to alter the composition of its $ 2 trillion foreign currency portfolio .
This is a strategy clearly aimed at minimizing the risk of future inflation eroding the value of long - term US - denominated holdings , while at the same time reducing exposure to what it feels are riskier investments .

Solidarity message to the revolutionary masses of Nepal
Statement by the Socialist Party of Malaysia
May 12 , 2009 .
1. The Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) would like to express our greatest concern over the current political developments and intensifying social struggles in the newly born Republic of Nepal .
2 . The political and military elites have once again revealed their true nature when the president , who is from the conservative Nepali Congress party , overrode the decision of Prime Minister Prachanda from the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) ( UCPN -M ) to sack Chief of Army Staff Katawal .
Some opportunist sections of the coalition government , like the Communist Party of Nepal ( Unified Marxist - Leninist ) ( CPN - UML ) also turned to the right by opposing the UCPN ( M ) move .
3 . The army high command has refused to obey instructions from the elected civilian government as well as refused to implement key parts of 2006 peace accords which included the integration of UCPN ( M ) - led People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) into the current army forces .
Sections of the high command in the current Nepalese army committed serious human rights violations during the armed conflict with PLA and continue to enjoy impunity , and even planned to stage a military coup against the elected government .
4 . It is clear that the Nepalese elites want to keep the Nepalese army from being integrated with the revolutionary fighters from the PLA in order to continue to use the army as a violent tool to repress the struggle of the poor in Nepal .
5 . The Nepalese elites have received support from imperialist and regional powers , especially the United States and India , which both fear the establishment of a radical and pro-poor regime in South Asia .
6 . The UCPN ( M ) has a little choice but to withdraw from the coalition government and call for street protests to defend democracy .
This can be turned into a new wave of people 's uprising for democracy and social justice in the country .
7 . The decade - long Maoist - led “ People ’s War ” and the 2006 mass democratic uprising have successfully overthrown the 240 - year - old monarchy and brought new hope for the ordinary people of Nepal .
8 . The Maoists have played a crucial role in overthrowing the monarchy and mobilising the people in the democratic movement , and have gained massive support from the grassroots .
Maoists won over 3.14 million votes in the 2008 election of the Constituent Assembly , and captured 229 seats out of 601 seats in the Constituent Assembly , making it the largest party in the parliament .
For the poor majority , UCPN ( M ) represent a radical change that would increase workers ' rights , land reform for the peasants , access to education and health care , equal rights for ethnic minorities and extensive pro-people economic development .
9 . The current crisis demonstrates that the bureaucrats and political elites , who are fearful of = radical change , have tried to prevent such change and to seize power through undemocratic means .
10 . The PSM calls for :
the UCPN ( M ) and revolutionary left in Nepal to continue and intensify their mobilisation of the masses in defence of the revolutionary process and democracy in Nepal
stop all imperialist intervention in the political affairs of Nepal , especially the US and India have to stay away from Nepal .
stop state violent attacks against the protesting masses .
11 . The PSM also expresses its disappointment and disgrace at the CPN ( UML ) for betraying the people of Nepal .
12 . The PSM extends its solidarity to the revolutionary people of Nepal for their courageous struggle for social justice and freedom from oppression .
Long live revolution !
Long live democracy !

" About 3,000 , " said the matriarch of a large family .
" I hope you like mutton , " said my language teacher , ominously , the day before we departed .
Our first stop was a ger ( traditional nomad dwelling ) in the town of Moren .
Inside the round felt structure a half - dozen children , parents , and friends looked on as a woman ladled suutei tsai ( salted milk tea ) out of a pot set atop the wood - burning stove .
Just behind the stove , the Tsaagan Tsar food was laid out : boov ( cookies fried in beef tallow ) , candy , aaruul ( dried curds ) , homemade butter , the back and tail of a sheep , and the better part of a boiled goat -- head included -- cut up in a bowl .
After tea was served , a man cut me a chunk of fat from the sheep rump .
To my surprise , it was good , like a piece of grainy , smoked butter .
I realized then that the taste of Mongolian food is proportional to how cold you were before eating it .
Outside , it was fifteen below .
Sheep fat and salty tea hit a spot I did n't know I had .
Still , the buuz were lurking .
When they came out , my initial reaction was that they , too , were tasty .
But we made a tactical error .
We ate quickly .
In Mongolia , where hospitality for wayfarers can be a matter of life and death , a guests ' bowl never stays empty long .
Soon we were on our tenth buuz , with no end in sight .
The night ended with vodka .
One person served , passing and refilling a glass .
Before taking a drink , each person dipped their right ring finger into the glass three times , flicking vodka into the air after each dip .
According to legend , the practice originated in the days when people killed their enemies ( Genghis Khaan 's father , for example ) by poisoning their beverages .
After each flick , vodka trickles down onto the ring on your finger .
If , by the third flick , the ring has changed colors , it 's probably not a good idea to drink .
Bachelors all , we set to .
Technically , Tsaagan Tsar lasts three days .
But the feast lasts much longer .
Over the next two weeks of our trip we ate so many buuz we began to smell like sheep , and were just as round .
Eventually , we developed a conversation to break the ice with locals :

" Do you like Tsaagan Tsar ? " one of us would ask .
" Yes . "
" How many buuz have you eaten ? "
" [ Some large number . ]
And you ? "
" At least a thousand . "
The truth is that , buuz by buuz , we were beginning to enjoy the countryside cuisine .
Perhaps it was the experience of eating it : the boundless hospitality , the slow ritual progression from tea to meat to vodka , the feeling of huddling around a stove with strangers , in outposts surrounded by cold .
Either way , we began to say , when hungry , " Man , I could really use some buuz . "
We spent our last day driving on frozen rivers in the Siberian taiga , headed , with several Mongolians , for a cabin where an old woman was hosting a Tsaagan Tsar celebration .

Pierre Lemieux , a French Canadian , economist , professor , author , libertarian thorn in the flesh of the Canadian Leviathan , and a friend , has become a felon .
Pierre refused to answer one of the questions on his application to renew his firearms license , and the licensing center refused to renew his license .
He now faces the prospect of 10 years in prison for keeping firearms without a license .
I will tell you some of his story .
At this stage you may be thinking that it ’s going to be about gun control but , rest assured , it ’s not .
Too many see trees , only trees , everywhere they look , and never a forest .
Every abuse , every injustice is singular , isolate , one more thing to be addressed , corrected or reformed — unfortunate , deplorable really , but circumscribed , in an arena separate from the rest of life , someone else ’s problem , and someone else ’s cause .
No , Pierre ’s story is about what it means to be ruled , what it means to need permission from the state .
And if you stop looking at trees and see the forest , then Pierre ’s refusal to follow orders may pose a question for you :
How far will you accommodate the state before you resist ?
Is there some limit to your ability to mold yourself to the state ’s designs ?
At what point will the state cross a line within you , when what you are ordered to do is more than you will accept or bear , when you will say , " Here I stand , I cannot do otherwise " ?
Or does no such line exist ?
Are you that final object of all the state ’s labors , that Quintessential Being that the state expects , demands and needs you to be : a plastic person ?
In 1995 Canada passed an " Act Respecting Firearms and Other Weapons , " generally referred to simply as the " Firearms Act " or by its original bill number , C - 68 .
At the time , Canada already had handgun registration .
The Firearms
Act created a long gun registry and a new firearm licensing authority , and required citizens to possess licenses to own firearms .
The licenses are good for five years .
Pierre registered his firearms , and submitted his first application for a firearms license in 1996 , which was granted , his first application for renewal in 2001 , which was granted , and his second request for renewal in 2007 , which was denied .
Pierre believes that Canadians have the right to own firearms without government approval .
In fact , he has written extensively on the subject to educate his fellow Canadians and to peaceably restore respect for this right .
Nevertheless , like most people , Pierre complied with the registration and licensing scheme in order to keep what he loves and to live a " quiet life . "
Unfortunately , despite his best efforts to comply , Pierre ran into his own personal limit with an impertinence in the license application that he simply could not abide , viz. , question 6 ( d ) of the license application , which asks :
" During the past two ( 2 ) years , have you experienced a divorce , a separation , a breakdown of a significant relationship , job loss or bankruptcy ? "
The instructions to the application state that all personal history questions must be answered , and that " [ I ] f you answer YES to any of the questions . . . you MUST provide details on a second page .
. . .
If details are not provided , your application cannot be processed .
A YES answer does not mean your application will be refused but it may lead to further examination . "
In each of 1996 , 2001 and 2007 , Pierre , waging what he describes as " a dignity battle " against the law , refused to answer this question , instead responding that " My love affairs are none of your business / Ça ne vous regarde pas . "
In 2007 , Pierre took the additional step of sending , by registered mail , a copy of his application , a cover letter and three pages of his book , Confessions d’un coureur des bois hors - la - loi , which chronicles his resistance against Canadian gun control laws , to the Prime Minister of Canada .
Two months after his license expired , having heard nothing from the licensing center , Pierre made a freedom of information request to find out the status of his application .
Eventually , he received word that his license renewal was denied by reason of his failure to answer question 6 ( d ) .
Pierre now owns firearms — registered firearms — in violation of the law , a crime punishable by 10 years in prison .
On the webpage where he chronicles his resistance to the Canadian license law , Pierre wonders : " Will I be the first Canadian to be jailed for refusing to tell the state about his love life ?
Not the last one , I fear . "
If an activity is licensed by the state , then it is a privilege conferred and controlled by the state , and not a right .
The conditions on which the privilege is conferred are matters of legislative or administrative grace ; the person may not lawfully engage in the activity and is not affirmatively protected from state incursion simply by reason of being a person , as would be the case with an " individual right . "
The Firearms
Act empowered an agency with a mandate to create and administer a licensing program and vested very broad powers in the agency to establish the particulars of the program .
The Act clearly establishes that ownership of firearms in Canada is a privilege conferred only upon those deemed worthy by satisfaction of conditions determined by the licensing authority .
Stop and consider for a moment this by method of " legislation . "
The founding " law " simply directs a combined legislative / judicial / executive agency to create and enforce a program without bothering to prescribe the contents of the program or even any significant limits on the exercise of that " authority . "
Instead , it vests the agency with very broad discretion to define and administer the program .
This form of legislation is , historically , a favorite with advocates of gun control , but it is by no means atypical of modern law - making , and is often used to control all sorts of activities .
For example , the act establishing the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is in large part of this nature , being essentially a mandate to the agency to go forth and create clean air and water .
Consider what this type of " legislation " says about how truly , deeply , worried your " representatives " are about your lives .
They can not be troubled to precisely define the contents of the " laws " to which you will be subject , to define or circumscribe the conditions that may ultimately be imposed upon you or resultant burdens upon you and , therefore , do not limit how impertinent , overreaching or arbitrary they may become .
Instead , the laws to which you will be subject largely or in significant part are devised by men and women who are not subject even to the minimum accountability of having to be re-elected to maintain office , who are protected from removal from office by civil service laws and who will never , ever be accountable to the innumerable citizens they harm for the harebrained regulations they impose .
The legislators do n’t have to make any of the difficult decisions , wo n’t be blamed for agency regulations that outrage the electorate , and it ’s just fine with them if you have to incur significant costs in time , money and energy to bring actions in the courts to overturn the agency ’s edicts , or to lobby the legislators to bring their administrative dogs to heel .
There ’s certainly no problem with more lobbying , it means more political contributions !
The legislators dodge responsibility and accountability to the electorate , and position themselves as saviors who can remedy the abuses of the administrative agencies .
An ideal system , really !
For reasons known only to it , the Canadian licensing bureau decided that it needs to know details about each applicant ’s love life , job losses , and bankruptcies in order to determine whether to issue a firearms license .
Doubtless many of us are dulled , if not numb , to the presumptions of wisdom and competence , and intrusiveness , of government agencies , but consider the god - like heights that the Canadian firearms licensing bureau claims as its own .
The air is indeed rare there !
It is going to make decisions whether to grant or deny a firearms license based on its evaluation of your love woes , job loss or bankruptcy !
" Provide details , " it commands .
Assuming you can get past the monumental presumptuousness that demands that you submit , as a matter of official record , intimate details about your life to be mulled over by some police official , really , how does one respond to that ?
What level of detail , exactly , are they demanding ?
Would " My wife and I were divorced six months ago " be sufficient ?
Or is one required to add some salient , hopefully spicy details ?
" My God !
For a while there , it was almost like " War of the Roses ! " I refused to leave the house !
She smashed some of my things and in retaliation I uprooted her beloved rose bushes !
The tears !
The screaming fits of rage !
It was a complete nightmare !
Now it ’s over and , fortunately for all concerned , we live in completely different provinces ! "
Or does one add page after page of Henry James - like psychological detail of every gesture , facial expression and step of the breakup , the job loss , the bankruptcy ?
Assuming one provides sufficient details , the agents who process the applications will then decide what significance these personal facts have for firearms ownership .
This is pretty impressive !
Consider that state - licensed psychiatrists , actual medical doctors who have specialized in the scientific study of mental health , cannot reliably predict , do not even claim to be able to predict , who is and is not going to commit an act of violence .
Yet fear not and be ye amazed !
The intrepid agents of the licensing bureau can and will determine who among those recently wounded in love , employment or credit relationships may safely own a firearm , doubtless relying upon gut instincts finely - honed through years of processing applications !
Maybe the licensing bureau is n’t going to use psychological profiling .
Maybe , instead , the details it needs are the names and phone numbers of your ex-lover , your ex-boss and the creditors who lost a bundle when you filed for bankruptcy .
And maybe the bureau will then contact them and make inquiries .
" Hello .
This is Officer Smith from the Firearms Licensing Bureau .
Your [ choose one ] [ ex - lover ] , [ former employee ] [ former debtor ] is asking us to renew his firearms license so that he can continue to own firearms for the next five years .
Are you okay with that ?
Does that give you any cause for concern ? "
And then the bureau can decide whether to issue a license based on what these people say about you .
Not quite a judicial determination of the existence of a crime , you understand , with an actual crime charged , penalties for perjury , the opportunity to confront and cross -examine your accusers and rules about what is and is n’t admissible evidence , but hey !
Good enough for administrative agencies , which make their own rules and act as legislature , judge and enforcer .
Who knows how the licensing bureau will evaluate this information ?
They want it , and they will act upon it , and that is all the applicant needs to know .
The activity for which the supplicant need a license is a privilege conferred by the state and , therefore , at bottom rests on nothing more than meeting their conditions , i.e. , on pleasing the authorities , who most assuredly will do as they please .
This is what it is to be ruled , for your activities to be privileges conferred by the state , for the conditions of your life to be determined based on some legislator ’s or administrator ’s " good ideas " for governance .
This is what it is to have your life controlled by another who has the power to fine you and throw you in jail for failing to comply with his conditions .
This is why American gun owners vehemently oppose registration of guns and licensure of firearms ownership .
It does n’t matter what the law says or whether it ’s a " good idea " or what its supposed socially - worthwhile , beneficially - motivated " intent " is .
It ’s how the law ’s power is wielded that determines the conditions of your life .
This is why , when the NRA and gun owners supported " shall issue " concealed carry licensing laws , currently in place in 37 states , the laws were carefully crafted to specify precisely the procedures to be followed , to enumerate the only conditions that could be imposed , all of which were objectively determinable and none of which depended upon the exercise of agency discretion , and to impose time and cost limits for processing , so that , upon satisfaction of strictly objectively verifiable criteria , the licensing authority was required to issue the permit .
This is why American gun owners demanded that state legislatures pass these new laws and repeal the old licensing laws that were enacted in the early 20th Century , laws like the Sullivan Act , which still governs the residents of New York City .
While appearing on the surface to be even - handed , those older statutes simply conferred broad , nebulous discretion on a licensing authority , with the result that they have been and , where still in effect , are , administered in a way to insure that only the " right " sort of people obtain permits .
In New York City , this means that men like Donald Trump and Howard Stern get carry permits , but not the multitudes whose lives just are n’t important enough to warrant the privilege of self - protection .
( For a more extensive discussion of the arbitrary nature of discretionary licensing statutes , see this policy analysis of " shall issue " concealed carry laws . )
While Pierre is now a felon because of his nation ’s gun control laws , never forget that this is how he got in trouble with the state :
He acted on the basis that there are some details about his life , important to him , that are his affair and his alone .
No one who believes he has the right to control you , who believes , further , that he has the right to engineer a society according to his ideas and plans , will ever accept this .
It is an affront to his arrogance , to his arrogation of power to control you as he deems fit .
To have " lawful authority " — really , political power — is precisely to have a free hand to use coercion to suit your purpose , without necessity of justification .
If you are simply carrying out a prescribed course , if there is no discretionary element to your " authority " that permits you to shape it and use it to your purpose , it is not power but mere processing and ministration : you are a mere servant , a functionary , a minion .
In brief , you are you : a servant and whatever government requires you to be , and manifestly not a king , a sovereign , a president , a semi- divine one , a colossus bestriding the earth .
Anyone who believes they have the right to control you ultimately must act ruthlessly , because a person does not control another unless , in the absence of willing consent or consent obtained through misrepresentation or fraud , he will compel the other to act as he commands .
Ask yourself why a refusal to answer a single question about your love life is accompanied by a threat of , and merits , 10 years in prison .
The failure to answer this question inflicts no actual harm on any citizen .
The punishment cannot , therefore , be for harm the refusal has caused any specific victim or " society " at large .
No , the injured party here is the state itself .
The refusal to answer the state ’s question is an affront to the state ’s " authority , " and its claims to operate , and manage society , as it sees fit .
The real " crime " is that the subject has failed to follow the state ’s orders .
He has failed to submit to and participate in the state ’s project to control or engineer society in accordance with the state ’s plans .
Possibly , for example , the licensing bureau ’s motivation for asking about love woes , job losses and bankruptcies is that it hopes to be able to prevent some future crimes ( with guns , at least ) based on certain facts that the licensing bureau believes have some degree of predictive value for determining who will and wo n’t commit crimes .
That is , it may be implementing a general policy directive to shape an aggregate outcome ( a reduction in crime ) based on the fact that a certain small percentage of ex-lovers , ex-employees and bankrupts will commit armed violence against their former lovers , former employers or creditors .
In refusing to answer the question , then , the applicant thwarts the state ’s plans and rebukes the state ’s claim to an authority to control or engineer society in accordance with its purpose .
The " crime " is not a personal crime , like murder , robbery or pollution of the air or water , but a political crime .
The essence of the crime is lèse majesté .
The " criminal " has refused to obey the state ’s fiat , and in so doing has committed an intolerable affront to the state ’s claim to an absolute " authority . "
He has shown his willingness to keep and act upon his own counsel and not follow orders .
The state cannot let that stand and continue to be a state .
It is the ultimate crime , and that it is why it is dealt with ruthlessly , meriting the same punishment that Solzhenitsyn informed us that Stalin ’s political prisoners in the Gulag received for rebukes to authority : a tenner .
Evidently , like minds , each claiming a right to control and engineer both man and society , perceive like threats , and respond with a like " solution . "
In his letter to the Prime Minister , Pierre notes that he is ashamed that he has not joined the Canadian heroes who are resisting the Firearms
Act by refusing to register their guns or apply for licenses .
These peaceful , otherwise law - abiding men and women occasionally hold open protests in front of government buildings daring the authorities to arrest them and throw them all in jail for ten years .
According to information obtained by Pierre under a freedom of information request , as of February 2009 , the Royal Mounted Canadian Police estimate that there were 185,925 owners of long guns alone who are not in compliance with the firearms registration and license laws .
We know now that Pierre need not have been ashamed , for it is clear that he is no less heroic .
The state pushes and pushes ; too much is never enough .
It demands nothing less than absolute , complete control over an avidly obedient populace .
To the state , there is no difference between 99 % compliance and zero compliance .
If there is one thing , one thing alone that it commands that you are unwilling to do for it , you have rebuked its authority and you are a threat , and the state will take you down .
Pierre tried to comply for the sake of an undisturbed , peaceful life , but there was one thing the state demanded that he was not willing to do .
There is something within him , some inherent dignity , he is not willing to relinquish or alter to suit the bastards .
And so he refused to act as he was commanded to act , he refused to be a plastic person , forever conforming himself to the shapes devised for him by men and women with delusions of grandeur and whose tools for creating utopia are tasers , guns , fines and prison .
And for that he may get ten years in jail .
So this is how it is .
If you can labor " within the system " forever to obtain the reform that will correct this abuse , and that one , and each and every other abuse that arises , now and forever ; if you can labor forever to exchange your current masters for better ones , a better Congressperson , a better Senator , a better President ; if , in short , your idea of " citizenship " or " activism " is playing whack - a- mole with those lording it over you ; if you can wait forever for the permission that you need to live life peaceably as you envision it ; if you can march forward uplifted on Hope and Change ; if you can find reasons and make excuses forever why Change cannot be achieved fully , just yet ; if , in short , nothing can cause you to call into question the fundamental belief that it is good and proper for some people to have a " right " to control your life and the rest of society , using , as their tools , lying , fraud , manipulation , threats , grants of legal monopolies , protection and immunities , payoffs ( " subsidies " ) , confiscation , fines , tasers , guns and jail ; and if , when their commands are finally issued directly to you and you are confronted with tasers , guns , fines and jail , everything about you is conformable , malleable ; if at no point will you ever openly refuse to comply with their plans when you are ordered to do so ; then relax , the state is not coming for you .
You are a plastic person , deforming yourself to fit into the shape that the state designs for you .
You are no threat and you can be controlled because there is no one there to offer any resistance .
But if there is some peaceful activity you care about deeply , if you invest your life in it and the state should seek to control this in a way that that truly hurts you , then you will collide with the state , and what you love will be used against you .
That is how the state operates .
That is how it implements its self - described mission of " protecting " and " caring " for you .
And if , because of this thing you love , you have some limit , some thing or aspect of yourself you will not give up or alter , then you are a threat , then you are an affront and rebuke to your government ’s assumption of complete control .
You have demonstrated that you will not dance to the state ’s tune , that you are an individual and not a cog in the state ’s machine , and Pierre ’s story may someday also be your story .
Pierre has filed a motion of appeal before the Québec provincial court , asking that the license refusal be quashed and apologies issued .
He also argues that the Firearms Act and related criminal code provisions are unconstitutional , and that he does not need any license to exercise his traditional liberty to possess firearms .
The court date has been set for May 26 and 27 , 2009 , in room 207 of the Mont - Laurier Courthouse , Québec , starting at 9:30 a.m. each morning .
Richard A. Fritze , an Alberta lawyer and well - known defender of Canadian firearms owners and their rights , is representing Pierre pro bono .
In addition , several expert witnesses will testify on behalf of Pierre ’s position , including Joyce Malcolm , author of To Keep and Bear Arms : The Origin of an Anglo - American Right , Colin Greenwood , a now retired senior English police officer who authored a landmark work on the history of England ’s gun control laws and their failure to reduce violent crime , and Professor Gary Mauser , who co-authored an article in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy with Don Kates titled , " Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide ?
These experts have generously agreed to assist Pierre for only the cost of their travel and accommodations , but Pierre needs funds to pay for what will most likely be a long and difficult battle .
Please consider supporting him .
If you wish to assist Pierre ’s fight by donating , please contact Paul Rogan , publisher of Canadian Access to Firearms , who is acting as a pro bono fund - raiser .
Alternatively , The Canadian Constitution Foundation has established a " Pierre Lemieux Legal Fund . " to provide funds to support Pierre ’s case and you may instead donate earmarked funds to the CCF .
Mr. Rogan can provide details on how to make your contribution through CCF .

Cobble Tech : VeloNews ’ Ben Delaney checks out what the teams are using on the cobbles this year
Although not as harsh as Paris - Roubaix , the cobbles of the Tour of Flanders do warrant a few concessions from racers ’ typical bikes .
For wheels , standard steel spokes and box rims are the rule ( although of course there are exceptions ) .
Beyond that , each team 's mechanics have their own take on the ideal set - up for the Ronde van Vlaanderen .
Here are a few of the details we found at a few teams ’ hotels and inside the start village in Brugge .
“ If you ’re being deluged by constant communication , the pressure to answer immediately is quite high , ” she added .
“ So if you ’re in the middle of a thought , forget it . ”
Michael Hausauer , a psychotherapist in Oakland , Calif. , said teenagers had a “ terrific interest in knowing what ’s going on in the lives of their peers , coupled with a terrific anxiety about being out of the loop . ”
For that reason , he said , the rapid rise in texting has potential for great benefit and great harm .
“ Texting can be an enormous tool , ” he said .
“ It offers companionship and the promise of connectedness .
At the same time , texting can make a youngster feel frightened and overly exposed . ”
Texting may also be taking a toll on teenagers ’ thumbs .
Annie Wagner , 15 , a ninth - grade honor student in Bethesda , Md. , used to text on her tiny LG phone as fast as she typed on a regular keyboard .
A few months ago , she noticed a painful cramping in her thumbs .
( Lately , she has been using the iPhone she got for her 15th birthday , and she says texting is slower and less painful . )
Peter W. Johnson , an associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington , said it was too early to tell whether this kind of stress is damaging .
But he added ,
“ Based on our experiences with computer users , we know intensive repetitive use of the upper extremities can lead to musculoskeletal disorders , so we have some reason to be concerned that too much texting could lead to temporary or permanent damage to the thumbs . ”
Annie said that although her school , like most , forbids cellphone use in class , with the LG phone she could text by putting it under her coat or desk .
Zardari 's claim cuts against that line of questioning .
Americans are concerned with solutions to the Taliban problem ; Zardari made a point about its cause .
Americans have looked for Pakistan to take more responsibility ( there 's some frustration being expressed in the U.S. public debate that Pakistan wo n't take its eyes off India , for instance ) , and Zardari , to a degree , rebuffed that , saying it 's not entirely Pakistan 's fault , and that it 's the U.S. 's too .
That 's not to say that Americans do n't care about what Zardari is saying -- it 's just not a big part of the discussion right now .
His point may be a good one to make to U.S. diplomats , and maybe the U.S. public , but I suspect it might not be too effective on Congress : members of Congress seem more concerned with the lives of U.S. soldiers and the money question .
David Obey , the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , has given the administration a one - year deadline on Afghanistan ; this tells me that House Democrats could turn on that war -- and U.S. involvement in the region , generally - - if public support for it slips , and if significant gains are n't made .
Causation and responsibility , in Zardari 's terms , had little to do with the domestic U.S. political fight over Iraq and the surge : no opponents of the invasion -- congressional Democrats or otherwise -- argued that the U.S. bore some responsibility for the destabilization of Iraq after Saddam Hussein 's regime was toppled ; the debate over whether to stay was about U.S. lives , the cost of the war , whether gains could be made , and whether it was worth it .
That might be what the growing debate over Afghanistan and Pakistan is becoming , as well .
If Democrats and public opinion turn against U.S. efforts in that region , I 'm not sure Zardari 's point -- whether or not it 's true , and whether or not it should - - will factor into the stances taken by those in the U.S. who advocate staying in Afghanistan and giving more aid to Pakistan .
The threats of a nuclear Taliban and a terrorist - haven Afghanistan will probably have more to do with it .

Nearly 80 years old , Lego construction toys were invented by carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen , who coined the name by combining the Danish words " Leg " and " Godt , " meaning " play well . "
( In Latin , the words coincidentally translate as " I put together . " )
He started the Lego Group in 1932 , which became Lego in 1934 .
The small toy company 's first Lego blocks were constructed of wood , which evolved into plastic , interlocking bricks in 1940 .
Today , Lego is the world 's fifth - largest toy manufacturer , according to the company .

Think is an electric car maker that has a product called the Think City that is pretty close to perfect for an electric vehicle at current technology that the average person can afford .
It looks nice enough , costs under $ 20,000 , goes 210 km on a single charge , has a maximum speed of 105 kph ( the only highway certified electric car besides the ones Tesla makes ) .
If you 've never seen this car before first take a look at these two videos .
The first one is in English and gives a good introduction to the car and the company 's aspirations in the United States , and the second is in Dutch and simply shows what it 's like to drive it .
As the first video shows , the car maker is looking to start a plant in the United States as well , and Oregon in particular is very interested in this , along with seven other states .
The plant would be able to provide 300 high - paying jobs in the beginning , then up to 900 .
Unfortunately , even though they 've already manufactured 1000 vehicles , they 've been under the equivalent of chapter 11 for a few months now and so they need every piece of good news they can get to continue to operate and hopefully expand .
This article in Norwegian from two days ago details some of the new orders they 've received , and the huge problem it still faces re : capital .
Some parts from the article :
There is " hope in the hanging rope " for the crisis - affected electric car producer
Think : in the spring it signed two major supply contracts .
The latest is a delivery agreement to the Spanish distributor Going Green in Madrid .
( note : Think 's press release in English is here
The Spanish government has offered a large financial package of ten million euro to speed the introduction of electric cars in the country .
The package provides for purchase of electric cars and the commencement of electric car pilot programs .
These cars can go to cities , states , individuals or companies , said spokesperson Katinka von der Lippe in Think .
In March the Netherlands made an order for 500 Think cars , and the first eight are already making their way around Amsterdam .
" We have agreements in more or less all European countries .
If this trend continues we can foresee more orders " , said von der Lippe .
But the orders have zero tangible value .
Think has neither money to buy the parts needed to put cars together , nor the workforce .
The number of employees is down to 57 .
" We are not producing at the moment because we have no working capital .
We have orders for over 2,000 cars and the capacity to produce 5,000 a year .
As soon as we get new capital we can start to produce " , said von der Lippe .
...
" How realistic is it that production of the cars can begin with new capital ? "
" We have dialogues outside Norway , but hope for a split Norwegian solution for financing ... " as for exactly how much capital is needed she wo n't say .
And on the American connection :
Think also has a loan application for money from Obama 's crisis package in the US .
This application has no value as long as the company has no money .
During the spring there were also rumours of Saab and Think joining together .
Great !
But the problem is that Think has no capital .
The question : how does
Think get out of its current rut ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Obama administration officials have determined they can avoid asking Congress for more bank bailout funds by converting existing loans to the largest U.S. banks into common stock , The New York Times reported on Sunday .

President Barack Obama ’s top economic advisers now say such a conversion would let them stretch what is left of the $ 700 billion financial bailout fund further than they had expected a few months ago , the paper said , citing administration officials it did not identify .
Converting the loans to the 19 biggest U.S. banks into common shares would turn the government aid into available capital and give the government a large equity stake in return , the newspaper said .
Some critics would consider the option a back door to nationalization since the government could become the largest shareholder in several banks , the report said .
The U.S. Treasury Department estimates it has about $ 134.5 billion remaining in the $ 700 billion financial rescue fund approved by Congress in October .
The change to common stock would not require the government to contribute any additional cash , but it could increase the capital of big banks by more than $ 100 billion , the newspaper said .
Asked about the report , a Treasury Department official pointed to an agency paper on the aid program without elaboration .
A section of the so - called White Paper reads :
“ The capital provided to eligible banking organizations under this program will be in the form of a preferred security that is convertible into common equity . ”
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said on ABC ’s “ This Week with George Stephanopoulos ” on Sunday that the administration thinks it can avoid nationalizing U.S. banks .
A major challenge for the U.S. economy is to restore confidence that its banks are now sufficiently capitalized after huge losses from the collapse of the housing market .
Obama ’s economic team is conducting stress tests of the top 19 U.S. firms and will issue guidelines on the process on Friday , with results due on May 4 .
“ We believe we have those resources available in the government as the final backstop to make sure that the 19 are financially viable and effective , ” Emanuel said .
“ If they need capital , we have that capacity . ”
Via LWN , we found a blog post of a Debian maintainer which announces a new package : EGLIBC , a compatible reimplementation of the GNU glibc which “ which will soon replace the GNU C Library ” .
Apparently the primary reason is the sadly famous bad maintainership aptitude of Ulrich Drepper , the main libc maintainer .
The blog post explains that even though EGLIBC is primarily aimed at embedded architectures it still has some very favourable features :
EGLIBC is source and binary compatible with the original GLIBC , and the package names will remain the same ( except the source packages ) .
Not all of the above features are yet taken advantage of , but the upload of the package is a first step .
GLIBC is a core package of the GNU project , so in all honesty , I never paid much attention to it .
It ’s just there , silently doing its job .
However , reading through some of the bug reports , it does seem that its maintainer , Ulrich Drepper , is a bit of an ass .
Since Free software / open source is not just about the code , but also the people around it , I say that any move away from certain types of people is a good one .
Still , this is all only one side of the story , so I reserve judgment on Drepper for now .
The National Endowment for the Arts would get a 4 % raise under President Obama 's federal budget proposal for the coming 2010 fiscal year .
This increase would continue the modest growth implemented under George W. Bush after the 1990s " Culture Wars " brought drastic reductions from which the agency still has not nearly recovered .
The NEA budget , most of which is funneled to state and regional arts agencies and to nonprofit arts organizations , would total $ 161.3 million under Obama 's plan , up from the current year 's $ 155 million .
" We are honored that the president recognizes that access to the arts strengthens both the cultural and civic life of our nation , " Patrice Walker Powell , the NEA 's acting chairman , said in a statement .
Americans for the Arts , a leading arts - lobbying organization , praised Obama for taking " actions firmly in line with the arts platform " he rolled out during his election campaign .
Other initiatives getting a thumbs up from the group are the separate $ 50 - million injection the NEA received as part of the recent economic stimulus package , $ 38 million for arts - education written into the current year 's Department of Education Budget , and last month 's announcement that Kal Penn , a cast member on the TV show " House , " would join Obama 's staff as associate director of the White House Office of Public Liaison , with a portfolio including outreach to the arts community .
Sharking is a real term we coined at Emerald City a while back .
It is basically an excuse to poke people at critically inappropriate times .

I discovered JSONP just recently , following Chris ‘ comment .
Though I initially did n’t intend to support JSON , JSONP made enough difference that I rewrote most of the TheRealURL code ( all 20 lines of it ) to support it .
Since it took me some time to figure out JSONP initially , perhaps a quick guide might help those who follow .
JSONP allows you to make an HTTP request outside your own domain , which enables consuming Web Services from JavaScript code .
It relies on a JS quirk : while XMLHttpRequest is blocked from making external requests , there ’s no such limit on < script > elements .
What JSONP does is add a < script src= > element to the DOM , with the external URL as the SRC target .
To serve JSONP simply return the JSON data inside a function .
e.g. , this JSON :
{ " hello " : " Hi , I 'm JSON .
Who are you ? " }
Becomes :
some_function ({ " hello " : " Hi , I 'm JSON .
Who are you ? " } )
( The reason is that the latter is actually code that will run inside the created by the JSONP client , so it needs to be executable code rather than plain JSON data )
some_function is provided by the calling client , usually in the ‘ callback ’ parameter .
So , a query like this :
get_jsonp?callback=getthedata
Should return :
getthedata({ " hello " : " Hi , I 'm JSON .
Who are you ? " } )
On the server side , this means adding some code similar to this :
// assume $ json holds the JSON response if ( $ GET [ ' callback ' ] != '') $ json = $ GET [ ' callback ' ] . " ( $ json ) " ; return $ json ; // my PHP is rusty but you know what I mean
On the client side , modern JS frameworks include JSONP support ( or you can DIY ) .
For example , in jQuery <= 1.2 adding &callback= ?
to the query string in getJSON method ’s URL sends a JSONP request . ( jQuery transparently replaces the ‘?’ with a unique string ) .
Here ’s how you get the unshortened URL for ‘ bit.ly / a ’ using therealurl :
$.getJSON ( " http://therealurl.appspot.com?format=json&url=bit.ly/q&callback=? " , function ( data ) { alert ( data.url ) } ) ;
That ’s about it .
JSONP probably wo n’t feature in the next Beautiful Code edition and obviously you need to watch the URLs you ’re accessing so you do n’t get malicious JS code executed , but , until cross site XHR is resolved , JSONP can get the job done .
GRAND RAPIDS --
Business is booming in at least one sector of the local and national economy : bankruptcy .
The
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Grand Rapids
saw its caseload jump nearly 58 percent in March as more individuals and businesses are bitten by the recession .
Bankruptcy filings are up nearly 40 percent through the first quarter of 2009 , with 3,916 individual and business cases in the Lower Peninsula 's western half .
" Obviously , it 's a difficult economic situation right now , " said Dan LaVille , clerk of the court .
" With each year , our numbers of cases continue to grow .
The numbers we had in March were quite large . "
Kim Rockinger , a recently divorced Cedar Springs mother of two , is about to add to the statistics .
Saddled with $ 50,000 in debt spread among 12 credit card issuers , plus medical bills and mortgage payments , she expects to file for bankruptcy soon .
Rockinger , who also filed for bankruptcy in 1996 , said she thought she had the debt under control .
But the breakup of her marriage left too much debt for her to handle with her income from child support and her part - time job as an office assistant .
She takes some personal responsibility for the problem , saying she needs to control impulse buying and resist the onslaught of credit - card offers .
" I do like to shop , " she said during a recent visit to Grand Rapids bankruptcy attorney David Andersen 's office .
" It 's difficult .
I have two girls , too , so we like to go shopping . "
She said she rarely answers the phone these days , afraid it will be another bill collector .
Andersen said he encounters cases like Rockinger 's all the time .
" I see this a lot where people make really good money and they can probably make their payments , but what they 're not thinking about is what happens if they 're laid off , or there 's a divorce . "
While Rockinger has n't lost her job , the number of individual filings in recent months has been directly correlated with businesses closing or cutting back operations , Judge Jeffrey Hughes said .
Banks are taking over assets or selling businesses before they hit bankrutpcy court , which is why Hughes said there has n't been a surge in business filings .
" What we see is , all of a sudden , you have a lot of unemployed workers , and it 's those individuals who have to seek relief in bankruptcy , " Hughes said .
The judge expects the impending closure of the General Motors plant in Wyoming to boost filings the same way closure of the Electrolux plant in Greenville drove many of its employees to his courtroom .
" The bankruptcy court addresses the flotsam and the jetsam of a business closing , " Hughes said .
More and more companies are on the edge , giving Tom Sarb , a corporate - bankruptcy attorney for Miller Johnson in Grand Rapids , plenty to do even if his clients do n't end up filing .
" It 's about as active and maybe a little bit more so than a couple of earlier downturns , " Sarb said .
" The 1980 - 81 downturn was fairly active , and then there has been a lot of activity in Michigan since the year 2000 related to tool and dies . "
Predictably , auto companies are among the hardest hit .
Sarb 's current clients include the creditors committee for Checker Motors , the Kalamazoo stamping operations known for the taxicabs it once made .
" I think everybody is just struggling with the drastically reduced volumes of parts that GM , Ford and Chrysler and everyone else are ordering these days , " he said .
" I tell people that , unfortunately , I am very busy these days . "
Local trends are in line with national statistics showing bankruptcies surging despite a 3 - year - old federal law that made it much tougher for Americans to escape their debts , an Associated Press analysis found .
Christian Krupp II , a Grand Rapids attorney , said his business is up among insurance workers , mortgage brokers and sales people .
" I had one client that commented this is the year of the white - collar bankruptcy , " Krupp said .
" These are people making good money , $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 , but their lifestyle is at $ 85,000 because of bonuses that they 're no longer getting . "

Where does one begin in Jeff Stein 's scoop in CQ ?
Is it more of a scandal that the Bushies were wire - tapping Harman and then were in a position to blackmail her if she did n't provide public support for ... their warrantless wire - tapping ?
Or is it just another day at the office for AIPAC :
Rep. Jane Harman ... was overheard on an NSA wiretap telling a suspected Israeli agent that she would lobby the Justice Department to reduce espionage - related charges against two officials of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee , the most powerful pro-Israel organization in Washington .
Harman was recorded saying she would “ waddle into ” the AIPAC case “ if you think it ’ll make a difference , ” according to two former senior national security officials familiar with the NSA transcript .
In exchange for Harman ’s help , the sources said , the suspected Israeli agent pledged to help lobby Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , then - House minority leader , to appoint Harman chair of the Intelligence Committee after the 2006 elections , which the Democrats were heavily favored to win .
Seemingly wary of what she had just agreed to , according to an official who read the NSA transcript , Harman hung up after saying , “ This conversation does n’t exist . ”
A suspected Israeli agent able to deliver AIPAC and AIPAC able to deliver Pelosi ?
Take it away , professor Walt !

Fox guest gets death threat after calling GOP ' one trick dog ' David Edwards and John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This A liberal Fox News regular received a death threat and a slew of hate mail after calling Republicans a " one trick dog " on Fox Business Channel Tuesday .
Mike Papantonio , an Air America talk show host and defense attorney , lambasted Republicans who 've come out in opposition to President Barack Obama 's economic stimulus plan .
" You know what the problem is ? " Papantonio declared .
" The American people know that the Republicans have no ideas .
They 're like dinosaurs .
They have one talking point .
You know what it is , Stuart ?
It 's the same thing I hear you say on this show .
Cut taxes and deregulate .
You 're a one -- Republicans are a one - trick dog . "
At another point , he called Republicans " boneheads . "
This did n't sit well with listeners to the upstart business channel .
Ironically , those who appeared to be most upset with Papantonio's name - calling , resorted to attacks themselves -- only far more extreme .
One even wished Papantonio dead .
Emails provided to Raw Story display a torrent of ire from those who felt personally insulted by the Air America host 's choice of words .
Out of privacy , Raw Story has withheld the emailers ' names .
" Mike Papantonio , " wrote one listener .
" May you die a horrible death from brain cancer you frigging scumbag [ sic ] . "
" Better hope you 're on a bail - out list when you start feeling the pain that the great - half - african icon , y'all put up there in Our face , falters again , and again , there wo n't be enough stimulus to keep your sad voices on the air , " wrote another .
" Hey Mike , too funny ! " typed a third .
" Saw you on Neil Cavuto today .
What a frigging communist you are and now we all know it .
The more of you who speak out , the easier it is for we Americans to stop you from finishing the job of communizing America .
Keep up the good work .
Ha !!! "
A fourth was terse : " You frigging treasonous pig . "
Others reflected a more general dissatisfaction .
" Your encounter with the guest commentator was bizarre , " one emailer wrote .
" Do you have any idea of how absurd and actually a bit nutty you looked .
Your rants were outrageous but I guess that was your ploy so you would not have to answer his question which was quite simple .
You should set yourself up to be the poster child for the ultra liberal side of the Dems with all of that anger and ranting and name calling . "
Mike Papantonio " is extremely rude and so abrasive .
I was shocked at his appearance on a certain news show .
I am a Democrat , however , I am an American first and strongly oppose his going on national television and calling fellow Americans ( Republicans ) ' dogs ' among other names . "
Papantonio hosts the Air America talk show , Ring of Fire .

BASRA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Iraq considers a U.S. military raid that killed two people a crime and wants U.S. forces to hand over those responsible to the courts , an Iraqi official said on Sunday .

Hundreds of Iraqis protested in the southern city of Kut against U.S. forces and the provincial governor also condemned the military operation .
The U.S. military had any immediate comment on the Iraqi stance but said the raid was carried out with the full approval of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government .
It said it had targeted “ special group ” fighters , its term for Shi’ite militiamen the United States says are funded and armed by Iran , in the operation early on Sunday in Kut , 150 km ( 95 miles ) southeast of Baghdad .
“ The general commander is affirming that the killing of two citizens and detaining of others in Kut is considered a violation of the security pact , ” said an official in the office of Major General Qassim Moussawi , Baghdad ’s security spokesman .
“ He asks the commander of the multinational forces to release the detainees and hand over those responsible for this crime to the courts . ”
‘ General commander ’ refers to Maliki .
Under the U.S. - Iraqi security pact that came into force this year , the 137,000 U.S. troops in Iraq can no longer conduct military operations without Iraqi approval .
The pact says U.S. soldiers are immune from prosecution in Iraqi courts unless they are suspected of grave crimes committed while off duty outside their bases .
Two Iraqi military commanders who authorized the raid were detained on the orders of the defense minister , spokesman Major General Mohammed al - Askari said .
A committee had been sent to Kut to investigate .
“ This committee has managed to get the six people detained by the Americans released , ” he said .
Witness Nidhal Abdul Munem , the sister of the man killed in the raid , choked back tears as she recounted her story .
“ They invaded our house , shot my brother and my sister - in - law and herded us into one area .
All the while , we tried to ask , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ ” she said .
ANGRY CROWDS
In a statement issued before the Iraqi government ’s condemnation , the U.S. military said its troops had shot and killed a man suspected of being behind supplying weapons to the Shi’ite fighters .
A woman was killed in the crossfire , it said .
As a funeral procession made its way through Kut , carrying the cloth - draped coffins of the two people killed in the raid , protesters shouted angry slogans and demanded the release of the seized men , calling Americans “ criminal occupiers . ”
“ We condemn this horrific incident .
Innocent people were killed and the city is now very tense , ” said Latif al - Tarfa , governor of Wasit province .
U.S. First Lieutenant John Brimley said the women killed was in the area with a suspect and moved into the line of fire .
She died of her wounds before she could be evacuated .
But Iraqi police Major Aziz al - Amara , who commands a rapid reaction force in Kut , said all of those targeted in the raid were innocent .
One of those arrested was a police captain .
Wasit deputy governing council head Mehdi al - Makosi said the families of the victims were pursuing a legal case against the soldiers who carried out the raid .
The raid was mounted just months before U.S. combat troops are due to withdraw from Iraqi cities .
U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered all U.S. combat operations in Iraq to cease in August 2010 before the full withdrawal by the end of 2011 .
Kut and surrounding Wasit province were the last area south of Baghdad to be handed over to Iraqi forces last October .
Wasit province was the scene of fighting during an uprising by followers of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr in March and April last year but like other parts of the south has since become largely quiet as Sadr ’s followers observe a ceasefire .

Schools in Waltham Forest have introduced knife checks
Almost half of secondary schools in England have a dedicated police officer , suggests a survey .
Children 's Secretary Ed Balls and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith have repeated calls for all schools to join such partnerships with the police .
There are over 5,000 schools in Safer School Partnerships with the police , including 20 % of primary schools .
These schemes can " prevent problems with youth crime before they escalate " , says Mr Balls .
The idea of putting police into schools - either as a full - time presence or as regulator visitors - is intended to tackle bad behaviour , cut truancy and build a relationship between youngsters and the police .
Anti-social behaviour
It was launched in 2002 , originally with plans to base 100 extra police officers in schools in 10 specific areas .
According to the Department for Children , Schools and Families and Home Office , this has now grown to include 45 % of secondary schools across England - with some cities having police in every school .
Earlier this year , it was announced that every secondary school in Leeds would have a police officer , provided by a team of 24 officers .
Police involvement has become an increasingly visible part of school discipline .
Figures published last year showed that police were called to violent incidents in schools more than 7,000 times .
Waltham Forest in east London is believed to be the first local authority in England to introduce weapon checks at all its secondary schools .
Mr Balls , launching new guidance for Safer School Partnerships with Ms Smith , says there have also been benefits from police officers providing a positive role model for young people .
" This will help them develop into young adults who care about the communities they live in , " said Mr Balls .
The home secretary said that " prevention is vital in stopping young people from getting involved in bad behaviour in the first place " .
" Safer School Partnerships reduce the risks of young people turning to crime and anti-social behaviour . "
There has also been support for these partnerships from the police .
" Through these partnerships we are also better able tackle the causes of violent extremism and to deal with specific issues that are of concern to young people such as bullying , weapons , drugs , alcohol and gang culture , " says Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Rod Jarman .
April 19 , 2009  -- STEPHANOPOULOS : Good morning and welcome to " This Week . "
More change from Obama .
On Cuba .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : The United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Terrorist interrogations .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
( UNKNOWN ) : The president moved swiftly to end that practice .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And the economy .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
OBAMA : We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand .
We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
As the president rounds out his first 100 days and the new Congress returns from its first recess , what 's next on the agenda ?
We 'll ask our exclusive headliners , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and House Republican Leader John Boehner , only on " This Week . "
Then , ...
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
( UNKNOWN ) : No more bailouts !
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Tax day tea parties .
Boom or bust ?
That and the rest of the week 's politics on our roundtable , with George Will , Cokie Roberts , Sam Donaldson and Peggy Noonan .
And as always , the Sunday funnies .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
( UNKNOWN ) : Nothing shakes a politician up like a complimentary bag of tea .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Hello again .
Ninety days into his term , President Obama 's wrapping up his second overseas mission today and coming home to his next set of challenges in Congress .
That sets the table for our exclusive headliners this morning , beginning with the president 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel .
Welcome back .
EMANUEL : Good morning .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you could not have been happy when you got up and saw the New York Times this morning .
Headline talks about the president 's softer stance .
The first paragraph says he 's shown a willingness to capitulate on some early initiatives .
Then it goes on to quote Leonard Burman of the Urban Institute , and he says that -- he says , " the thing we still do n't know about President Obama is what he 's willing to fight for .
He likes giving good speeches , he likes the adulation , he likes to make people happy , but it 's hard to think of a place where he 's taken a really hard position . "
Your response ?
EMANUEL : Well , George , let me approach this from two sides , if I can .
As you noted , we 're into only 90 days .
What have we gotten done in those 90 days ?
First , we passed the largest recovery act to put Americans back to work .
We 've gotten in place the financing to help stabilize the credit system throughout the financial system .
A housing plan so people can keep their homes , and millions of Americans can refinance .
We started the ending -- we started the process to end the war in Iraq , put in place a policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan area that will change that area and take the fight to the terrorists that exist there .
We also started the credit flowing to small businesses .
So in the first 90 days , a lot has been done both to get the economy moving again and change America 's foreign policy and its objectives ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Is that the easy part , though ?
EMANUEL : Well , if you think that 's easy , George , and you 've been in the White House , I would suggest in the fist 90 days , it 's quite a lot to take on , but the American people asked for us to roll up our sleeves every day and get to work on behalf of them .
Second , let me squeeze it from this side , or address the question from this side .
You could not report on the challenges of the fights with the special interests if it was n't for what we 've initiated under President Obama .
A , taking on the banking industry as it relates to the student loan .
We basically said we 're going to cut you out , put $ 94 billion that we subsidize you with , and we 're going to give it directly to the students who are trying to go to college .
In the area of healthcare reform and getting costs under control , we said to the insurance industry , we 're eliminating your subsidies and only going to pay you what basically 100 percent on the dollar , but not 115 cents on the dollar , and you 're going to compete for that money .
And that saves the taxpayers about $ 170 billion ...
( CROSSTALK )
EMANUEL : George , George , finally , on the oil and industry , we eliminated their taxpayer subsidies and put that money into alternative energy .
So every one of the fights that you 're engaged over the next six to nine months were ones that we initiated in taking on those special interests .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , you had two important ones , healthcare and energy .
And when you look at those issues , what the president has done in his first 90 days , achieved a lot of his major initiatives , as you pointed out , but with very little Republican support .
Only three Republicans on the stimulus package ; none for the president 's budget .
To get healthcare , energy , regulatory reform , the president is going to need Republican votes .
What adjustments is he willing to make to get them ?
EMANUEL : Well , you just said adjustments .
The first question was we 're compromising too much and now are you saying how are you going to compromise to get those done ?
We set the goals .
The goals are getting healthcare costs under control .
The goals are having an energy policy in which America is independent of its tie to foreign oil and having a policy in which America basically has an energy policy that frees itself from exporting $ 700 billion of wealth to the Mideast .
Those are the objectives .
Now , he 's open to different roads to get there , but what he 's not open to is compromising on the ...
( CROSSTALK )
EMANUEL : ... healthcare costs under control and ridding us of our dependence .
Now , as President Obama said when asked by a congressman at one of the task force on healthcare -- not on healthcare , on fiscal discipline .
You know , the Republican congressman said we 're being cut out .
EMANUEL : He says , well , you should be included ; that 's fair , but you have to come constructive .
And when you 're the party of no ; when you 're the party of never ; when you 're the party of no new ideas , that 's not constructive .
So my recommendation is , we 'll work with people of all sides ' ideology to get things done .
And I think you 'll see this on Tuesday .
The president will sign a landmark legislation for national service .
And the sponsors are President -- Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch , a Republican .
( CROSSTALK )
EMANUEL : And if you go through the process on kids ' health care , national service , as well as getting resources necessary for stabilizing the banks , every one of those votes has been bipartisan .
The challenge will be , will the Republicans come to the table with constructive ideas ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let 's talk about the big issues .
On health care , on Republican idea on health care is to tax employer benefits .
The president blasted Senator McCain for that idea during the campaign , yet it 's now being joined by some Democrats as well .
Is the president willing to consider that as a way to pay for his plans to expand coverage ?
EMANUEL : George , the goal -- well , remember , first of all , what 's the objective ?
The objective is getting ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... I want to know if he 's willing to consider that as a way to pay for it .
EMANUEL : Well , first of all , what we have to do is squeeze out all the basic costs in the system , before we talk about any other type of revenue .
There 's a lot that has to be changed .
Unfortunately , I know a little about health care reform from my family .
The fact is , we had all the wrong incentives in the health care system .
And if you change the incentives toward medical I.T. , which we put in place the resources to start basically having a way to control costs there ; if we change the way the doctors are paid -- so , rather than fee for service , for outcomes ; change the way -- in fact , rewarding people who take care of themselves and get their health together .
All those are what you have to consider ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But all of that is only going to get you a fraction of the place where you need to be in order to cover everyone as the president has said is the goal as well .
And he laid out a plan , a reserve package of about $ 600 billion ; the plan he laid out to pay for it , shaving deductions for wealthy Americans .
Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill say , no way , we 're not going to do it .
So how is the president going to fill the gap ?
How is he going to pay for the programs ?
EMANUEL : Well , ( inaudible ) George , it 's not just the president .
It 's what we work with Congress .
That process is beginning .
I think , in this next five weeks , you 'll see tremendous progress at the -- at the committee level , to getting that done .
And he does not believe that 's the first step .
And what you have to do , as he believes , is make the cuts in the system that we have today because we 're overpaying for a lot of things ; and second , is change the incentives before you get to immediately going to a default position that you have to raise taxes .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But is he open to taxing employer benefits ?
EMANUEL : He -- he has said he opposed that , as he said in the campaign .
And that 's what he believes , and believes is , before you get there , you have got to address the priorities .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So he wo n't sign a bill that includes that ?
EMANUEL : George , I 'm not going to do any absolutes on your show .
That 's not my right to do that .
If there 's ( inaudible ) then we 'll try to arrange that ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let 's move over to energy .
The president made a major announcement -- the EPA made a major announcement on Friday , giving the EPA the ability to regulate greenhouse gases .
It drew some sharp opposition from our next guest , Congressman Boehner .
Here 's what he had to say .
He said , " This decision is nothing more than a back - door attempt to enact a national energy tax that will have a crushing impact on consumers , jobs and our economy .
The administration is abusing the regulatory process to establish this tax because it knows there are not enough votes in Congress to force Americans to pay it . "
EMANUEL : Well , first of all , let 's take a step back .
That decision was an outgrowth by the EPA -- went through scientific review , but it was an outgrowth of a Supreme Court decision in 2007 .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So it does n't have much choice ?
EMANUEL : Well , the -- what EPA just announced , the EPA had to go where it was .
Let me also note -- and I think it 's important -- both on that decision , George , as well as on the stem cell rules and regs that were just put out , once again , science is where it should be , giving us all the data we need .
Now we have to decide how we 're going to handle that information .
And I think , on this case , this EPA has said , here 's what we have -- here 's what the data says ; here 's what we think about it .
Now , we have to make the decision , which is what the president 's always said , it is better , on an issue of this size and magnitude , and in an effect on the economy , that Congress and the White House come up with a set of policies that deal with greenhouse gas emissions and our energy policy .
We have a bill that 's working , right now , dealing with our energy independence .
What would be helpful is if your next speaker , John Boehner , who 's a friend , has his ideas put forth on how he wants to deal with greenhouse gases -- emissions , and how he wants to deal with our energy independence ...
( CROSSTALK )
EMANUEL : And we 're going to have -- the Congress is beginning to work ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : I will ask him about that , but meanwhile , the president 's plans to cap - and - trade carbon emissions is getting a lot of resistance , not only from Republicans but Democrats as well , who do believe -- who are fearful that this will be a broad - based tax increase .
EMANUEL : I would -- well , I -- of course , when you have something of this magnitude , there 's going to be people that raise objections , because it 's a big change .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you believe it 's a broad - based tax increase ?
EMANUEL : No , what I believe is we 're going to -- we 're going to alter how we deal with our energy policy .
And what I think is going to happen is that Congress will deal with this part of the energy policy ; they 'll deal with the resource investments into alternative energy .
They 'll also deal with the way we bring more efficiency into the system .
And they 're going to look at that .
I do know this .
At the end of this first year of Congress , there will be an energy bill on the president 's desk .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That includes cap - and - trade ?
EMANUEL : Our goal is to get that done .
We will see .
You 're asking me right before the legislative process starts to make that prediction .
I do think this , that even those who object to particulars know that we have to deal with this part of our energy policy and that -- the challenge now is , rather than to criticize and rather than say no , rather than to say never , is to provide ideas .
And that has yet to happen from the other side .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You believe that both health care , then , and energy will get through the Congress this year ?
At the same time , are you confident that you can get those through before you have to come back to the Congress and ask for more money for the banks ?
We all know these stress tests are coming up at the end of the month .
We 've seen some positive reports from the banks in recent weeks .
How confident are you that the banks are going to be able to get through this period without having the government come in and temporarily take over ?
And will you be able to get through this next period without coming back to Congress for more money ?
EMANUEL : George , let me take a step back .
I want to address the particular , at the end , on the resources .
Remember what the stress test is about .
It 's very important .
You needed a clear demarcation .
For the last year and a half , the credit markets have seized up .
It was filled , in the financial system , with fear and confusion .
Nobody was lending to each other and , therefore businesses , families that were trying to buy a home , kids who wanted to go to college , people that want to buy a car could not access the resources they need to do that because the banks were filled with fear and confusion between each other and were n't lending .
And then , at the end of the day , the economy and the consumer got effected .
The purpose of the stress test was to have a clear demarcation between that confusion and fear with ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And also figure out how much more money they 're going to need from the federal government .
Are you confident you will not have to come back to Congress ...
EMANUEL : Well , first of all , I have n't seen -- as you know , I have n't seen the stress test yet .
What we do know is , in the first quarter , banks and the financial institutions , the major 19 , are doing better .
And I think we 're all pleased that they 're reporting profits .
But that does n't take away that some are going to need resources .
We believe we have those resources available in the government as the final backstop to make sure that the 19 are financially viable and effective .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Without coming back to Congress ?
EMANUEL : Right .
The resources that we have on hand , we believe -- and it's not just that , George , is that we have those resources ; we have a facility to buy these troubled assets off their banks .
If they need capital , we have that capacity .
We have what we 're doing on the home front .
I 'm basically helping homeowners basically access and buy a home and stay in a home and refinance their home .
And we also believe , as you see in April , consumer confidence is up .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you do n't believe you 're going to have to come back ?
Do you believe now ...
EMANUEL : I 'd say that -- you know , I want to be careful here , George , because you 're dealing with stuff -- and a lot of people are waiting in the next three weeks .
It 's a big issue .
I believe we wo n't , but I have n't seen the stress tests , so it 's -- I want to put a cautionary note there .
I do think , based on everything , you know , in our discussions ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You are well - informed .
EMANUEL : I understand I 'm well - informed .
But that does n't mean I 've seen the stress tests .
I do believe we have the resources to handle what the results will be .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you will avoid any kind of temporary nationalization ?
EMANUEL : I think we will be able to avoid that .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you a final question on ...
EMANUEL : And again , obviously -- I want to be careful , George , because this is very important , and rightfully so .
I believe we have the resources .
I believe , -- not only -- I believe we will not have to deal with nationalization , and that 's not the goal , nor do we think that 's the right policy objectives here .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Fair enough .
Final question on the president 's decision , this week , to disclose the documents dealing with terrorist interrogations .
A series of officials who served with President Bush have come out and blasted it , including the former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff , the former CIA director Michael Hayden .
Here 's what they had to say .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
FORMER SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY MICHAEL CHERTOFF :
One is that you 're giving terrorists insights into the things they need to prepare for , and they do prepare .
And the second thing is you 're sending a message to our allies that we are not reliable in terms of safeguarding confidential information .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Mr. Hayden added that fully half of the information the government has gotten about Al Qaida came from these interrogations .
They say that the president 's decision has put the United States at risk .
EMANUEL : A couple things , George .
First of all , we 've banned these techniques and practices -- banned them .
Because we did n't think they were consistent with America 's security ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you do n't believe we got this information that Michael Hayden believes we got ?
EMANUEL : First let me address the question , OK ?
Second is , we 've enhanced America 's image abroad .
These were tools used by terrorists , propaganda tools , to recruit new terrorists .
And the fact is , having changed America 's image does have an impact on our security and safety and makes us stronger .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
How do you answer the argument , though , that ( inaudible ) that this gives them a roadmap to how to resist ?
EMANUEL : It 's kind of a -- let me say this .
One of the reasons the president was willing to let this information out was that already the information was out .
So if they 're saying that you basically have exposed something , it 's been written .
Go get the New York Review of Books .
It 's there .
So the notion that somehow , we 're exposing something -- it 's already been out .
In fact , President Bush let -- allowed -- let it -- allowed a lot of this information out .
So the notion that somehow this all of a sudden is a game changer does n't take cognizance of the fact that it 's already in the system and in the public domain .
Therefore , it 's not new .
So the notion that that is something we 've built in -- it 's already been there .
Number two , it 's one of the key tools Al Qaida has used for recruitment .
There has been a net cost to America .
By changing the way America is seen in the world , which means banning this technique and practice , we have actually stopped them and prevented them from using it as a rallying cry .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Final quick question .
The president has ruled out prosecutions for CIA officials who believed they were following the law .
Does he believe that the officials who devised the policies should be immune from prosecution ?
EMANUEL : What he believes is , look , as you saw in that statement he wrote , and I would just take a step back .
He came up with this and he worked on this for about four weeks , wrote that statement Wednesday night , after he made his decision , and dictated what he wanted to see .
And Thursday morning , I saw him in the office , he was still editing it .
He believes that people in good faith were operating with the guidance they were provided .
They should n't be prosecuted .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What about those who devised policy ?
EMANUEL : Yes , but those who devised policy , he believes that they were -- should not be prosecuted either , and that 's not the place that we go -- as he said in that letter , and I would really recommend people look at the full statement -- not the letter , the statement -- in that second paragraph , " this is not a time for retribution . "
It 's time for reflection .
It 's not a time to use our energy and our time in looking back and any sense of anger and retribution .
We have a lot to do to protect America .
What people need to know , this practice and technique , we do n't use anymore .
He banned it .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Rahm Emanuel , thank you very much for joining me .
EMANUEL : Thank you , George .
STEPHANOPOULOS : We turn now to Congressman Boehner .
And let me get you right on there , Congressman Boehner .
What is your response to the president 's decision this week ?
And also , we just heard from Mr. Emanuel that the president wants to move forward , no prosecution for officials who devised the policy .
BOEHNER : Well , I think that 's one area -- area that I can agree with the president on .
But I think the release of these memos is dangerous , and I agree with what Leon Panetta had to say , when he made it clear that he thought that this would hamper our ability to get information from terrorists and get other countries to work with us .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And let 's look at this more broadly , then , Congressman Boehner .
You heard what Mr. Emanuel had to say about the president 's approach towards this next set of challenges facing the Congress , especially healthcare and education .
And he says the president 's willing to work with Republicans , but Republicans have to come to the table with ideas .
Let 's take each issue in turn .
Are you prepared to come forward with a plan to cover all Americans and control healthcare costs ?
BOEHNER : I think we believe , along what Democrats believe , that all Americans should have access to high - quality , affordable health insurance .
We 're working on a plan that preserves the doctor / patient relationship , rewards quality and rewards innovation .
We 're not for a plan that puts the government in charge of our healthcare , decides what doctors ought to be paid , or what treatments ought to be prescribed .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So that means -- so that 's a no to the president 's plan ?
BOEHNER : We have n't seen the president 's plan as yet .
I can tell you what our plan is beginning to look like and the types of things that we will oppose .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you then about energy .
We showed your statement on the president 's decision through the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases .
Also , you 've come out against the president 's proposal to cap - and - trade carbon emissions .
So what is the Republican answer to climate change ?
Is it a problem ?
Do you have a plan to address it ?
BOEHNER : George , we believe that our -- all of the above energy strategy from last year continues to be the right approach on energy .
That we ought to make sure that we have new sources of energy , green energy , but we need nuclear energy , we need other types of alternatives , and , yes , we need American - made oil and gas .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But that does n't do anything when it comes to emissions , sir .
BOEHNER : When it comes to the issue of climate change , George , it 's pretty clear that if we do n't work with other industrialized nations around the world , what 's going to happen is that we 're going to ship millions of American jobs overseas .
We have to deal with this in a responsible way .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So what is the responsible way ?
That 's my question .
What is the Republican plan to deal with carbon emissions , which every major scientific organization has said is contributing to climate change ?
BOEHNER : George , the idea that carbon dioxide is a carcinogen that is harmful to our environment is almost comical .
Every time we exhale , we exhale carbon dioxide .
Every cow in the world , you know , when they do what they do , you 've got more carbon dioxide .
And so I think it 's clear ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you do n't believe that greenhouse gases are a problem in creating climate change ?
BOEHNER : ... we 've had climate change over the last 100 years -- listen , it 's clear we 've had change in our climate .
The question is how much does man have to do with it , and what is the proper way to deal with this ?
We can't do it alone as one nation .
If we got India , China and other industrialized countries not working with us , all we 're going to do is ship millions of American jobs overseas .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But it sounds like from what you 're saying that you do n't believe that Republicans need to come up with a plan to control carbon emissions ?
You 're suggesting it's not that big of a problem , even though the scientific consensus is that it has contributed to the climate change .
BOEHNER : I think it is -- I think it is an issue .
The question is , what is the proper answer and the responsible answer ?
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And what is the answer ?
That 's what I 'm trying to get at .
BOEHNER : George , I think everyone in America is looking for the proper answer .
We do n't want to raise taxes , $ 1.5 to $ 2 trillion like the administration is proposing , and we do n't want to ship millions of American jobs overseas .
And so we 've got to find ways to work toward this solution to this problem without risking the future for our kids and grandkids .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you are committed to coming up with a plan ?
BOEHNER : I think you 'll see a plan from us .
Just like you 've seen a plan from us on the stimulus bill and a better plan on the budget .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Finally , also this week , we saw these TEA party tax day protests coming out across the country .
Yet , one of the organizers of the protests , one of your predecessors , Dick Armey , former Republican leader in the House , said even as he was going forward with the protests , that the taxes of the United States are now at a good level .
Do you agree ?
BOEHNER : I think the taxes in America continue to be too high , and if you talk to the people I talk to at the taxpayer protests out in Bakersfield , California , they did n't believe their taxes were too low or about right .
They thought they were too high .
George , when I talk to people at these rallies , it was pretty clear people are scared to death .
And they 're scared to death about the future for their kids and their grandkids , and the facts that the American dream may not be alive for their kids and grandkids .
That 's what really scares them .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But on the issue ...
BOEHNER : They understand that you can't borrow and spend your way to prosperity .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But on the issue of taxes , I think it 's 43 percent of people who file taxes pay no income tax at all .
For the middle fifth of taxpayers , they 're paying just about 3 percent in federal income tax this year .
BOEHNER : Well , you want to go out and explain that to the hundreds of thousands of people around America that showed up for these rallies .
They understand that they 're paying too much in taxes .
But they 're really concerned about the amount of spending that 's going on in Washington and the amount of debt that 's being piled up .
They know that you can't have trillion - dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see without imprisoning the future for our kids and theirs .
STEPHANOPOULOS : OK , Congressman Boehner , thank you very much for your time this morning .

How Did We All Come From Adam and Eve ?
By Babu G. Ranganathan
How Did We All Come From Adam and Eve ?
Young people , and even adults , often wonder how all the varieties or " races " of people could come from the same original human ancestors .
Well , in principle , that 's no different than asking how children with different color hair ( i.e. , blond , brunette , brown , red ) can come from the same parents who both have black hair .
Just as some individuals today carry genes to produce descendants with different color hair and eyes , humanity 's first parents , Adam and Eve , possessed genes to produce all the variety and races of men .
You and I today may not carry the genes to produce every variety or race of humans , but humanity 's first parents did possess such genes .
All varieties of humans carry genes for the same basic traits , but not all humans carry every possible variation of those genes .
For example , one person may be carrying several variations of the gene for eye color ( i.e. , brown , green , blue ) , but someone else may be carrying only one variation of the gene for eye color ( i.e. , brown ) .
Thus , both will have different abilities to affect the eye color of their offspring .
Some parents with black hair , for example , are capable of producing children with blond hair , but their blond children ( because they inherit only recessive genes ) will not have the ability to produce children with black hair unless they mate with someone else who has black hair .
If the blond descendants only mate with other blondes then the entire line and population will only be blond even though the original ancestor was black - haired .
In reality there is only one race - the human race - within which exists myriad variations and permutations .
The evidence from science shows that only microevolution ( variations within a biological " kind " such as the varieties of dogs , cats , horses , cows , etc. ) is possible but not macroevolution ( variations across biological " kinds " , especially from simpler kinds to more complex ones ) .
The only evolution that occurs in Nature is microevolution ( or horizontal evolution ) but not macroevolution ( vertical evolution ) .
The genetic ability for microevolution exists in Nature but not the genetic ability for macroevolution .
The genes ( chemical and genetic instructions or programs ) for microevolution exist in every species but not the genes for macroevolution .
Unless Nature has the intelligence and ability to perform genetic engineering ( to construct entirely new genes and not just to produce variations and new combinations of already existing genes ) then macroevolution will never be possible in Nature .
We have varieties of dogs today that we did n't have a couple of hundred years ago .
All of this is just another example of microevolution ( horizontal evolution ) in Nature .
No matter how many varieties of dogs come into being they will always remain dogs and not change or evolve into some other kind of animal .
Even the formation of an entirely new species of plant or animal from hybridization will not support Darwinian evolution since such hybridization does not involve any production of new genetic information but merely the recombination of already existing genes .
Modifications and new combinations of already existing genes for already existing traits have been shown to occur in nature but never the production of entirely new genes or new traits .
This is true even with genetic mutations .
For example , mutations in the genes for human hair may change the genes so that another type of human hair develops , but the mutations wo n't change the genes for human hair so that feathers , wings , or entirely new traits develop .
Mutations may even cause duplication of already existing traits ( i.e. an extra finger , toe , etc. even in another part of the body ! ) , but none of these things qualify as new traits .
Evolutionists believe that , if given enough time , random or chance mutations in the genetic code caused by random environmental forces such as radiation will produce entirely new genes for entirely new traits which natural selection can act upon or preserve .
However , there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that random mutations have the ability to generate entirely new genes which would program for the development of entirely new traits in species .
It would require genetic engineering to accomplish such a feat .
Random genetic mutations caused by the environment will never qualify as genetic engineering !
Mutations are accidents in the sequential molecular structure of the genetic code and they are almost always harmful , as would be expected from accidents .
Of course , just like some earthquakes that do n't do any damage to buildings , there are also mutations that do n't do any biological harm .
But , even if a good mutation does occur for every good mutation there will be hundreds of harmful ones with the net result over time being disastrous for the species .
Furthermore , only those mutations produced in the genes of reproductive cells , such as sperm in the male and ovum ( or egg cell ) in the female , are passed on to offspring .
Mutations and any changes produced in other body cells are not transmitted .
For example , if a woman were to lose a finger it would not result in her baby being born with a missing finger .
Similarly , even if an ape ever learned to walk upright , it could not pass this characteristic on to its descendants .
Thus , modern biology has disproved the once - held theory that acquired characteristics from the environment can be transmitted into the genetic code of offspring .
Most biological variations within a biological kind ( i.e. varieties of humans , dogs , cats , horses , mice , etc. ) are the result of new combinations of already existing genes and not because of mutations .
For those who are not read - up on their biology , a little information on genes would be helpful here .
What we call " genes " are actually segments of the DNA molecule .
DNA , or the genetic code , is composed of a molecular string of various nucleic acids ( chemical letters ) which are arranged in a sequence just like the letters found in the words and sentences of a book .
It is this sequence of nucleic acids in DNA that tells the cells of our body how to construct ( or build ) various proteins , tissues , and organs such as nose , eyes , brain , etc .
If the nucleic acids in the genetic code are not in the correct sequence then malfunctioning , or even worse , harmful proteins may form causing serious health problems and even death .
There is no law in science that nucleic acids have to come together in a particular sequence .
Any nucleic acid can just as easily bond with any other .
The only reason for why nucleic acids are found in a particular sequence in the DNA of the cells of our bodies is because they are directed to do so by previously existing DNA .
When new cells form in our bodies the DNA of the old cells direct the formation of the DNA in the new cells .
The common belief among evolutionists is that , if given millions of years , radiation and other environmental forces will cause enough random changes ( mutations ) to occur in the sequential structure of the genetic code of a species so that entirely new sequences for entirely new genes will develop which in turn will program for the formation of entirely new biological traits , organs , and structures that natural selection can then act upon .
Would it be rational to believe that by randomly changing the sequence of letters in a cookbook that you will eventually get a book on astronomy ?
Of course not !
And if the book were a living being it would have died in the process of such random changes .
Such changes , as transforming one book into another or the DNA of one species into the DNA of another , especially one more complex , simply cannot occur by random or chance alterations .
It would require intelligent planning and design to change one book into another or to change the DNA of a simpler species into the DNA of a more complex one .
Yes , it is true that the raw biological materials and chemicals to make entirely new genes exist in every species , but the problem is that the random forces of nature ( i.e. radiation , etc. ) simply have no ability to rearrange those chemicals and biological materials into entirely new genes programming for entirely new traits .
Again , mutations only have the ability to produce variations of already existing traits .
It would require intelligent manipulation of genetic material ( genetic engineering ) to turn a fish into a human being .
The random forces of the environment cannot perform such genetic engineering !
If the environment does n't possess the ability to perform genetic engineering and if macro- evolutionreally did not occur then how else can one explain the genetic and biological similarities which exist between various species and , indeed , all of life .
Although it cannot be scientifically proven , creationists believe that the only rational explanation for the genetic and biological similarities between all forms of life is due to a common Designer who designed and created similar functions for similar purposes and different functions for different purposes in all of the various forms of life from the simplest to the most complex .
Even humans employ this principle of common design in planning the varied architecture of buildings !
If humans must use intelligence to perform genetic engineering , to meaningfully manipulate the genetic code , then what does that say about the origin of the genetic code itself !
Many have confused natural selection with evolution itself .
Yes , Charles Darwin did show that natural selection occurs in nature , but what many do n't understand is that natural selection itself does not produce biological traits or variations .
Natural selection can only " select " from biological variations that are produced and which have survival value .
The real issue is what biological variations can be naturally produced .
What biological variations are naturally possible ?
When a biological change or variation occurs within a species and this new variation ( such as a change in skin color , etc. ) helps that species to survive in its environment then that variation will be preserved ( " selected " ) and be passed on to offspring .
That is called " natural selection " or " survival of the fittest " .
But , neither " natural selection " nor " survival of the fittest " has anything to do with producing biological traits and variations .
The term " natural selection " is simply a figure of speech .
Nature , of course , does not do any active or conscious selecting .
It is an entirely passive process .
Darwin did not realize what produced biological variations .
Darwin simply assumed that any kind of biological change or variation was possible in life .
However , we now know that biological traits and variations are determined by the genetic code .
Natural selection works with evolution but it is not evolution itself .
Again , since natural selection can only " select " from biological variations that are possible , the real question to be asking is what kind of biological variations are naturally possible .
How much biological variation ( or how much evolution ) is naturally possible in Nature ?
As we have seen all biological variation or evolution is limited to within plant and animal kinds .
Another reason for why macroevolution is not possible in Nature is because a half - evolved and useless organ waiting millions of years to be completed by random mutations would be a liability and hindrance to a species - not exactly a prime candidate for natural selection .
In fact , how could species have survived over , supposedly , millions of years while their vital ( or necessary ) organs were still in the process of evolving !
How , for example , were animals breathing , eating , and reproducing if their respiratory , digestive , and reproductive organs were still incomplete and evolving ?
How were species fighting off possibly life - threatening germs if their immune system had n't fully evolved yet ?
Scientist and creationist Dr. Walt Brown , in his fantastic book " In The Beginning " , makes this point by saying , " All species appear fully developed , not partially developed .
They show design .
There are no examples of half - developed feathers , eyes , skin , tubes ( arteries , veins , intestines , etc. ) , or any of thousands of other vital organs .
Tubes that are not 100 % complete are a liability ; so are partially developed organs and some body parts .
For example , if a leg of a reptile were to evolve into a wing of a bird , it would become a bad leg long before it became a good wing . "
Usually what is meant by the term " biological kind " is a natural species but this may not always be the case .
The key to keep in mind here is that in order for evolution in nature to occur from one biological " kind " to another biological " kind " entirely new genes would have to be generated and not just merely modifications and / or recombinationof already existing genes .
If , for example , offspring are produced which cannot be crossed back with the original stock then there is , indeed , a new species but if no new genes or traits developed then there is no macro-evolution ( variation across biological kinds ) and the two distinct species would continue to belong to the same " kind " .
Science cannot prove we 're here by creation , but neither can science prove we 're here by chance or macro-evolution .
No one has observed either .
They are both accepted on faith .
The issue is which faith , Darwinian macro-evolutionary theory or creation , has better scientific support .
If some astronauts from Earth discovered figures of persons similar to Mt. Rushmore on an uninhabited planet there would be no way to scientifically prove the carved figures originated by design or by chance processes of erosion .
Neither position is science , but scientific arguments may be made to support one or the other .
What we believe about life 's origins does influence our philosophy and value of life as well as our view of ourselves and others .
This is no small issue !
Just because the laws of science can explain how life and the universe operate and work does n't mean there is no Maker .
Would it be rational to believe that there 's no designer behind airplanes because the laws of science can explain how airplanes operate and work ?
Natural laws are adequate to explain how the order in life , the universe , and even a microwave oven operates , but mere undirected natural laws can never fully explain the origin of such order .
Of course , once there is a complete and living cell then the genetic program and biological mechanisms exist to direct and organize molecules to form into more cells .
The question is how did life come into being when there was no directing mechanism in Nature .
An excellent article to read by scientist and biochemist Dr. Duane T. Gish is " A Few Reasons An Evolutionary Origin of Life Is Impossible " .
There is , of course , much more to be said on this subject .
Scientist , creationist , debater , writer , and lecturer , Dr. Walt Brown covers various scientific issues ( i.e. fossils , so - called transitional links , biological variation and diversity , the origin of life , comparative anatomy and embryology , the issue of vestigial organs , the age of the Earth , etc. ) at greater depth on his website at http://www.creationscience.com .
On his website , Dr. Brown even discusses the possibility of any remains of life on Mars as having originated from the Earth due to great geological disturbances in the Earth 's past which easily could have spewed thousands of tons of rock and dirt containing microbes into space .
In fact , A Newsweek article of September 21 , 1998 , p.12 mentions exactly this possibility .
An excellent source of information from highly qualified scientists who are creationists is the Institute for Creation Research ( http://www.icr.org) in San Diego , California .
Also , the reader may find answers to many difficult questions concerning the Bible ( including questions on creation and evolution , Noah 's Ark , how dinosaurs fit into the Bible , etc. ) at http://www.ChristianAnswers.net.
It is only fair that evidence supporting intelligent design or creation be presented to students alongside of evolutionary theory , especially in public schools which receive funding from taxpayers who are on both sides of the issue .
Also , no one is being forced to believe in God or adopt a particular religion so there is no true violation of separation of church and state .

Starting today ( or at least very soon ) , Windows Media Center users on Vista systems can stream Netflix Watch Now videos , and manage their DVD and streaming queues , straight from the TV +
Movies section .

Microsoft 's announcement came late yesterday , and some in - house blogs are reporting the feature as " starting today , " but we lack a Vista system and Netflix Unlimited subscription to test it out at the moment .
When it does arrive , however , users running Windows Vista Home Premium or Ultimate can fire up Media Center , head to the TV +
Movies section , and should see a new Netflix option there .

Here 's how the selection and queue management should look .
Search , recommendations and ratings are available from the Media Center view , and any remote that works with Media Center should be able to operate the Netflix streaming controls while it 's playing .
The plug - in is Silverlight based , and requires a Netflix subscription , of course .
Running Media Center on a lower - tier Vista system , or want that same kind of Netflix streaming on your TV - connected PC ?
Try the myNetflix plug - in , or make the leap to Boxee or XBMC .
Mac users should also check out Plex 's latest upgrade .
Here 's Microsoft 's video preview of Netflix streaming :
Thanks ,
Ognjen !
Netflix in Windows Media Center [ Microsoft Windows site via Windows Experience Blog ]
The article was all over the web within minutes .
It was first published on Bloomberg ’s site on the morning of March 30 .
“ We can not see large upside for the S&P 500 above the 825 — 850 level , ” Morgan Stanley U.S. equity strategist Jason Todd wrote in a report yesterday .
“ In the rush to buy a cyclical recovery , it seems earnings or valuation no longer matters .
We would be comfortable with this view if the earnings trough was closer , but it is not . ”
The Dow fell like a stone from the opening bell .
It closed down 254 : 3.5 % .
The S&P 500 fell by the same percentage , confirming Morgan Stanley ’s recommendation .
“ Sell the S&P 500 ! ” I recommended this on November 5 , 2007 .
I actually recommended selling it short .
Morgan Stanley did not know what hit it in 2008 .
The firm is no longer an investment bank .
Its business model collapsed last October .
Over one weekend , its lawyers converted the once independent firm into a bank holding company .
Then it accepted $ 10 billion in bailout money .
The story of Morgan Stanley ’s taxpayer - funded restructuring is here .
I wonder what it must be like for a Morgan Stanley portfolio manager to call his clients , who have lost half the value of their recommended stock market portfolios since October 2007 , and who followed his advice to buy more stocks all the way down — dollar - cost averaging — to tell them that the company now recommends that they sell the S&P 500 .
The clients have already read the headlines .
Maybe they will call their managers .
They surely should call them .
“ Get me out . ”
To read that they should get out in a story on the Web is not the way to find out that the stock market is not the place for your money today .
“ But that ’s not what you told me ! ”
That is correct .
It ’s not .
The faith in the loss - producing strategy of “ buy a no - load index stock fund and hold ” is waning .
It has lost money ever since March 2000 .
Now the stock specialist at a former investment bank says to bail out .
This is a man bites dog story .
There are flickers of awareness in the financial media .
They do not last for long .
They flash like shooting stars and then crash — rather like the stock market .
NEW WORLD DISORDER
The G - 20 meeting begins this week in England .
Here , political leaders from 20 major nations meet to share ideas on how to solve an international financial crisis that their central banks created , following the lead of Alan Greenspan ’s FED .
They never saw it coming .
Not any of them — not the central bankers , not the politicians , not the regulators .
They were all caught flat - footed .
Then they assemble at a meeting and send out press releases .
These press releases are designed to assure the investing public that they , the creators of this crisis , know what went wrong — they do n’t — and that by discussing the causes of the crisis , which they do n’t understand , they will be able to come up with a joint solution that does not involve either ( 1 ) mass inflation or ( 2 ) a worldwide depression that lasts for years .
It is a song and dance .
It is shuck and jive .
It is bait and switch .
It is Custer ’s last stand .
These people do n’t know what to do .
If they did , there would be two or three well - defined , fully documented proposals out there , each with national co-sponsors .
All of them would have major flaws .
They would be mutually exclusive .
Economists of various schools of opinion would be mobilizing behind one or another program .
Instead , there are no published plans .
There are no working papers .
There are only vague promises of joint action .
Like what ?
There are no detailed plans out of which this team of egomaniac politicians might conceivably hammer into an acceptable plan .
There is no centralized international planning agency .
There is no international enforcement agency .
There is no agreement among central bankers .
There is no unanimity to do anything .
There is not going to be , either .
The G - 20 meeting will issue some sort of bland statement of hope , and everyone will go home .
They refuse to adopt the only system that every brought unity to governments and central banks : an international gold coin standard .
The politicians and central bankers could not control the movements of gold out of inflating nations and into non-inflating nations , 1815 — 1914 .
They resented the ability of common people to exercise control over domestic monetary policy simply by going down to a bank and demanding payment in gold coins .
They all took away this authority in the summer of 1914 , when World War I broke out .
These deal - doers , these politicians , these seekers of power do n’t trust each other .
That is the famous bottom line .
They do not trust the common people , which means that they do not trust a gold coin standard .
But they do not trust each other .
They are trapped by the dollar standard .
They have told their voters that their nations can get rich by exporting to the United States .
They have not explained that in order to export lots of goods to the United States , their central banks must create fiat money to buy depreciating dollars at a favorable rate of exchange .
They have not told the voters that modern mercantilism depends on lending tax money and central bank fiat money to the U.S. government , which will not pay back the loans .
Ever .
So , the G - 20 nations ’ politicians will not come to any agreement that can be enforced institutionally .
They do not trust the United Nations Organization .
They will have to stick with Treasury bills , just as they have ever since 1946 .
They will conduct business as usual , namely , export - driven mercantilism .
In every nation , the national state will command its central bank to debase the national currency in order to buy more Treasury debt .
But they will not buy as much as before .
Two weeks ago , the G - 20 finance ministers adjourned their fruitless meeting in Horsham , England .
They came to no conclusion .
The Telegraph reported .
For all this rather predictable grand verbiage , however , there was a profound sense as the G20 finance ministers departed for their respective corners of the globe that the thing was , at heart , a disappointment .
That assessment was accurate .
Nothing in the past two weeks has indicated that anything substantive has been accomplished .
The event concluded with a sense of ambition half - thwarted .
On the one hand there was no great blow - up between the Europeans , who wanted the focus to be further regulation of financial markets , and the Americans , who wanted more specific targets for government bail - outs of both banks and broader economies .
There you have it .
The Europeans , being Europeans , want more government regulation .
The Americans , being Americans , want more bailouts .
Nobody wants a free market .
Now all hope rests on the prima donnas : the politicians .
As indeed was the hope that the G20 summit would produce a conclusive answer for the final crisis .
The lie is that there could be one moment — or indeed one menu of options — that will be either a silver bullet or supreme catalyst for solving this mess .
The sooner people realise that this is too much to expect of the G20 , and at the London Summit on April 2 , the better .
This is rather a depressing thought .
However , the solace is that , at least , no - one now doubts the scale of the problems before them and , most importantly that the world ’s biggest economies are still talking to each other .
The scale of the problems is indeed gigantic .
The solutions are more of the same .
The likelihood of agreement is minimal .
The politicians will huff and puff , but none of them will sacrifice his career or his nation ’s autonomous policies of inflation in order to surrender sovereignty to a new international central bank controlled by no nation .
That is what the gold coin standard did , but at the same intolerable price : surrendering national political autonomy .
Nobody in power trusts his peers .
He knows how they rose to power .
They all did the same untrustworthy things .
THE SYSTEM WILL UNRAVEL MORE
The international banking system is shaky .
We are in the early stages of huge corporate losses , huge national deficits , falling trade , and monetary inflation .
The finance ministers suggested no program of reform .
The politicians will not come up with any clear - cut coordinated program to increase profits , increase trade , increase output , and stabilize the money supplies of each nation .
Investors are looking for hope .
It need not be plausible hope — just hope .
Morgan Stanley ’s spokesman sees that there is no hope over the next two quarters for corporate profits .
This barely describes the nature of the threat to prosperity .
The American banking system is still undercapitalized and suffering from massive losses due to bad real estate loans and defaulting credit card debtors .
There are no proposed solutions to any of this , other than more bailouts .
There are lots of reassurances that there is a solution that will not involve mass inflation or mass depression .
None of them explains how .
The investors are easy marks for hype .
They do n’t know why they invested in stocks instead of gold , 2000 to 2008 .
They do n’t understand why nobody in authority saw this crisis coming .
They do n’t understand monetary theory .
They only understand that corporate profits are falling , but somehow the government has a solution .
Over time , this hope will fade , and with it the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 .
CONCLUSION
Monitor the G - 20 meeting .
See if there is any program announced by all 20 members .
See if it anything more than pious assurances that Something Will Be Done , Real Soon Now .
How much faith should you place in such pronouncements ?
None .

No one 's happy about The Pirate Bay verdict .
The site admins , who are now on the hook for a collective 30 million kronor in damages plus one year each in jail , have charged that the judge was biased .
But the movie and music businesses have filed an appeal of their own , saying that the 30 million kronor in damages was n't nearly enough ; the amount should be closer to Skr100 million ( about US $ 13 million ) .
It 's a small world after all
The " spectrial " became even more of a spectacle this week as the Swedish judiciary announced that it would consider The Pirate Bay 's claims against the trial judge .
That judge , Tomas Norstr�m , belongs to the Swedish Copyright Association along with Henrik Pont�n , Peter Danowsky , and Monique Wadsted — all lawyers who represented the recording industry in The Pirate Bay trial .
Additionally , Norstr�m also sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property , an advocacy group that pushes stricter copyright laws .
The Pirate Bay has charged that this was a total conflict of interest and that the verdict must be thrown out .
According to the court of appeals ( English translation ) , a decision on the matter will be made not by " section 1 " of the court , which deals with copyright claims , but " section 2 . "
The court decided that it would be " appropriate " to have a judge totally uninvolved in the case and in copyright law weigh the merits of The Pirate Bay 's objection .
So the court chose judge Anders Eka to lead the inquiry .
The court went out of its way to note that Eka and his two fellow judges have not " been members of any groups involved in the case . "
Sound fair ?
Not to The Pirate Bay .
Defendant Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi noted on his blog today that a little googling actually turned up links between Eka and industry lawyers Wadsted and Danowsky .
All oversee the " research center for media rights " at The Stockholm Center for Commercial Law .
The Center , based at the University of Stockholm , does n't appear to be an advocacy group and would seem to have nothing in particular to do with copyrights .
Over the last few years , it has hosted seminars on such scintillating topics as " International liability of arrangers for securities - offering circulars " and " EC Directives :
What is left of the prohibition on horizontal enforcement ? "
Still , the links indicate that Eka knows and has worked with some of the key lawyers in the case , though in a country the size of Sweden , this sort of mixing within a profession is hard to completely avoid .
That does n't make it less of an issue , though ; similar concerns were raised here in the US about Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson , who decades ago served as the lawyer for the judge in the Joel Tenenbaum file - swapping trial .
More cash ( and more charges ) , please
But even as the legal maneuvering takes place over the impartiality of Norstr�m and Eka , the rightsholders have filed an appeal of their own .
In addition to seeking more cash , lawyers for the content owners want the charge of " infringing copyright " restored against the defendants .
That charge was dropped on the trial 's second day ( rightsholders settled for a lesser charge of helping others infringe copyright ) , but it could reappear if the appeal succeeds .

When I started this blog , I was naive .
I thought I knew .
I believed in technology .
I thought the way I saw my blog was how everyone saw it .
A bit like when I was a kid .
Then I thought when I would keep my hands over my eyes , nobody else in the world could see , because I could not see .
Same with my blog .
I thought what I published , all of you would see the posts I would see it .
Now I know better .
Now I know one thing : " I know nothing " .
And maybe that I will never know .
And the fact that for the user , IT technology sucks .
What am I talking about ?
Two years ago , I only used Internet Explorer .
Until a friend told me that some of my posts looked weird on his computer .
Text formatting around pictures was screwed up .
Some widgets did not show correctly .
Some stuff clearly ran outside of the main column .
He showed it to me and " Yak ! " , he was not kidding .
He used Firefox .
I had never heard of Firefox before ( I told you I knew nothing ! ) .
I looked at my web statistics and found out quite a lot of visitors used Firefox .
So a lot of people saw my blog differently than how I saw it .
So I downloaded Firefox , and from then on , I checked my blog both on Firefox and Internet Explorer .
Until another friend told me some of the stuff on my blog looked weird .
I checked , and it did look weird .
He used Safari on a Mac .
I downloaded Safari .
Just in the last couple of months , I changed the layout of this blog significantly .
Added drop - down menus , collapse / expand features , changed fonts , colours , template layouts , ...
And I tell you , it would take me typically a couple of hours to make the change , but two days to ensure it looks right on different browsers .
I can now understand the agony professional web developers have to go through during the final browser - compatibility testing .
At work , we are developing a big portal website .
And the developers are running past their delivery deadline .
Why ?
Browser compatibility problems .
Drives them nuts .
And me too .
So nowadays , I check everything I publish on my blog in Internet Explorer 7 , Internet Explorer 8 , Firefox Opera and Safari .
Why ?
Because The Road 's web statistics from the past few months show me this is what you use :
The worst is Internet Explorer .
The worst of worst is Internet Explorer 6 .
I do n't even check it anymore .
It is hopeless .
The only hope I have is that my visitors as sensible enough to either upgrade to Explorer 7 , or to use a decent browser .
Besides formatting problems , Internet Explorer is slow ( as I showed in the past ) and often seems to get stuck while waiting for a page to load .
Bleh !
So my tip for the serious blogger : Download the most popular browsers and test your site .
The more features you add , and the more advanced those features are , the more thorough you have to test in different browsers .
Oh , and tip of the week : Try BrowserShots , a website that generates a screenshots of how your site looks like on dozens of different browsers , and on the different operating platforms ( Windows , Linus , Mac ) .
Have fun , and I hope you do n't get too many nasty surprises .

Kerstin Sjoden reports .
One of the four men convicted in The Pirate Bay trial is seeking to have his guilty verdict thrown out after learning that the judge in the trial is a member of two pro-copyright groups , including one whose membership includes entertainment industry representatives who argued in the case .
Stockholm district court judge , Tomas Norström told a Swedish newspaper that his previously - undisclosed entanglements with the copyright groups did not constitute a conflict of interest .
The groups include the Swedish Association of Copyright , a discussion forum .
Henrik Pontén of the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau , Monique Wadsted , a motion picture industry lawyer , and Peter Danowsky from the recording industry 's IFPI are members of the organizations , and were largely responsible for pressing the case against The Pirate Bay before the judge .
Norström also sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property , and the Internet Infrastructure Foundation , which oversees the dot - se country code and advises on domain name disputes .
Monique Wadsted is one of his colleagues at the foundation .
The judge 's links to the groups were reported by Swedish National Radio .
Peter Althin , the lawyer who represents Pirate Bay spokesperson Peter Sunde , announced Thursday that he plans to demand a retrial .
" The Court of Appeal will decide if the district court decision should be set aside and the case revisited , " Althin said on Thursday to the site The Local .
Last Friday Norström and three lay judges found Sunde and three other men guilty of contributory copyright infringement , sentenced them to a year in prison , and ordered them to pay damages of 30 million kronor ( $ 3.6 million ) to entertainment companies .
" It was n't appropriate for him to take on this case , " says Eric Bylander , senior lecturer in procedure law at Gothenburg University .
" There are several circumstances which individually do n't constitute partiality , but that put together can form a quite different picture .
It 's also a matter of what signal this sends to the citizens .
Anyone who , on reasonable grounds , can be appear biased in a case should not judge that case . "
But Bylander says it 's a toss - up as to whether the appeals court will find the conflict serious enough to throw out the verdict .
" I do n't think the trial will be declared a mistrial , but it 's definitely a close call , " he says .

A nonprofit backed by $ 34.1 million aims to reverse weight gain and increase fitness among Colorado residents over the next five years .
Funded by $ 17.1 million from the Colorado Health Foundation , $ 16 million from Kaiser Permanente and $ 1 million from the Kresge Foundation , LiveWell Colorado is the only standalone nonprofit in the state dedicated to fighting obesity , LiveWell chief executive Maren Stewart said Thursday .
“ We have a laser focus , ” Stewart said .
“ We ’re ready to put words into action and measure what we accomplish . ”
With a well - connected board of directors from academia , business , politics and health care , the nonprofit will coordinate , streamline and promote obesity - prevention programs statewide .
While Colorado still ranks as the fittest state , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the obesity rate has doubled since 1995 and 19 percent of adults here are obese , Stewart said .
LiveWell began in January 2007 as a joint effort of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , the Colorado Health Foundation and Kaiser Permanente .
Kristen Browning - Blas : 303-954-1440 or kbrowning@denverpost.com
Focus on healthy food and active living
LiveWell ’s “ laser focus ” aims at the following areas :
Promoting awareness of healthy eating and active living among families , schools and communities .
Addressing the lack of fresh and healthy foods in poor neighborhoods .
Coloradans earning above $ 75,000 a year had a 16 percent obesity rate , while nearly a quarter of those making below $ 25,000 are obese .
Analyzing healthy eating and active - living policies , or lack thereof , across the state .
Lobbying for walkable streets , school fitness programs and safe , accessible parks .
" The special forces guys - they hunt men , basically .
We do the same things as Christians , we hunt people for Jesus .
We do , we hunt them down .
Get the hound of heaven after them , so we get them into the kingdom . "
Unbridled religious arrogance is forging a link with high - tech weaponry and an unlimited defense budget .
COLONIALIST CONVERSIONS :
our government will only acknowledge that it is
" investigating the reports of civilian deaths , "
which is the standard , meaningless comment that reporters work into such stories , seemingly with no obligation to follow up .
Forget about it and move on .
We should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity , "
" hounds of heaven "
" Dehumanization . "
" we sang cadences about killing people . "
Occupation means implicit disrespect .
The testimony went on and on , describing detainee abuse , humiliation and starvation ; the terrorizing of families during house raids ; the casual brutalities and killings at checkpoints ; vandalism and joy - riding around the ruins of Babylon ; the shooting of pets to relieve boredom .
And this is the context in which we now hear about earnest American Christians harvesting the souls of Muslims .
Let us bow our heads in prayer , America .
The worst of who we are is STALKING THE WORLD with religious fervor .
It 's worse than you think .
Torture , religion , democracy , God .
They 're all part of the mixed - up , horrific business that George W. Bush unleashed in the Middle East and Central Asia , and that Barack Obama is struggling to control and rationalize .
As the words above demonstrate , the 12th century is striving mightily to join hands with the 20th in the U.S. military :
The speaker , Lt. Col.
Gary Hensley , the chief of U.S. military chaplains in Afghanistan was videotaped last year delivering a sermon at Bagram Air Base .
Since Al Jazeera first broadcast the footage at the beginning of the week , it has spread widely on the Internet .
( Video )
Like so much else that the Bush administration has bequeathed us , and the world - pre-emptive war and torture , for instance - this is nothing new , but suddenly it 's overt .
A U.S. military spokesman has denied that American soldiers are allowed to try to convert Afghans to Christianity - it violates Central Command 's General Order No. 1 - and said that Hensley was quoted out of context .
U.S. military spokesmen , of course , also routinely deny that U.S. bombing raids kill civilians .
And indeed , U.S. air strikes this week in a densely populated area in western Afghanistan 's Farah Province , during a battle between Afghan soldiers and the Taliban , may have killed as many as 100 civilians , according to the New York Times .
The Red Cross , the United Nations and the Afghan government are all expressing shock at the death toll , but The possibility that we are - not officially but in the minds of many American soldiers and officers - waging a religious war that parallels the secular one , an Ann Coulter war ( " Coulter wrote on Sept. 12 , 2001 ) , is both deeply disturbing and utterly appropriate .
The arrogance required for both efforts is so similar .
The line blurs for many of the participants .
What is the difference between believing one can bomb a country into democracy and any sort of armed , uniformed proselytizing ?
Putting a religious spin on the war on terror may be an official no - no , but when I read about Bargram ' sand other recent reports of the growing evangelical Christian influence in the U.S. military ( such as Jeff Sharlet 's stunning investigative piece in the May issue of Harper 's , titled " Jesus Killed Mohammed " ) , I think first of the extraordinary Winter Soldier testimony I attended a year ago in Washington , D.C.vvThis testimony , sponsored by Iraq Veterans Against the War , and vastly underreported in the media , featured vet after vet giving agonized , conscience - wracked testimony on his or her training and service in Iraq and / or Afghanistan .
If one word could describe the overarching theme of the four - day event , it might be " In our boot camp , " said former Marine Matthew Childers , - Robert C. Koehler ( " The Hounds of Heaven " , CommonDreams.org , 5.7.2009 .

Hulu - that online video extravaganza juiced by three of the four American TV / movie giants - has suddenly recognized the existence of Blighty .
Today , the old / new media hybrid told the world it has partnered with UK content distributor Digital Rights Group to offer up several Brit television titles , including Green Wing , Peep Show , Kingdom , and Doc Martin .
And it has inked a similar pact with Indian distributor Saavn , embracing several classic Bollywood films , including Sarkar , Deewana , Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke , Hera Pheri , and Huluchul ( no relation ) .
But Hulu is not offering any of these British or Indian titles to Britons or Indians .
The site remains closed to everyone but America .
Of course , the idea is to change this .
Speaking with The Financial Times , Andy Forssell - Hulu senior vice president of content acquisition and distribution - said that the company is in the midst of discussions to launch the site in " six to eight " of the leading broadcast markets .
We 're not sure why he 's confused about numbers seven and eight .
But there you have it .
And the company 's new British and Indian deals are at least a small step towards the site 's internationalization .
Hulu also argues that these deals deliver content that most Americans have n't seen .
But knowing Americans - a race of people who are interested in themselves - they are n't likely to see it now either .
Ex-pats ?
Sure .
Forssell also told
The FT that the company has been in talks with The Beeb and ITV about pacts involving their shows as well .
Originally a joint venture between NBC Universal and News Corp. ( owners of Fox TV ) , Hulu has since roped in Disney ( owners of ABC TV ) .
The full - length TV and movie vids are free - except that they come with advertising .
And the site does n't like ad blockers .
If you do n't live in the US , you cannot access Hulu here . ®
After more than a decade of fighting in Afghanistan , the Pentagon is worried that American commandos might not be able to spot and avoid ...
After more than a decade of fighting in Afghanistan , the Pentagon is worried that American commandos might not be able to spot and avoid roadside bombs .
The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization — or JIEDDO — outlined these concerns in contract documents released on June 24 .
JIEDDO is looking to pay private contractor Orbis Operations more than $ 600,000 to teach special operators how to spot and identify IEDs .
Orbis will be on the hook for nine of these “ situation awareness training ” sessions between July and August .
The reasons for the training program were detailed in a so - called “ Justification and Approval ” document .
The Pentagon needs a J&A any time it wants to give a contract to one company without a having to take any other offers .
This training will fill a “ critical and life - threatening … gap , ” according to JIEDDO .
Until earlier this year , elite forces could largely rely on regular Army engineers and bomb squads to clear the homemade munitions .
The ground combat branch ’s specialized equipment and highly trained bomb technicians have been in great demand over the last decade .
But Washington is drawing down in Afghanistan and pulling out many of those vital troops .
Conversely , commandos working to train local forces will probably be among the last to leave .
The Pentagon says these Special Operations Forces lack the training and gear to best protect themselves against IEDs — “ the number one killer on the battlefield . ”
Elite troops “ received minimal route clearance , detection and removal … specialized [ counter - IED training ] , if any , ” the Pentagon ’s improvised munitions experts say .
The situational awareness training was apparently “ not considered critical for SOF units and [ was ] not part of their predeployment training ” before they headed out to Central Asia .
If true , one could only wonder why the Pentagon did not fix this glaring omission years ago .
However , these dire claims could be more for the benefit of Pentagon budgeteers than anyone else .
For one , JIEDDO admits that commandos have already cleared hundreds of IEDs across Afghanistan in recent weeks as the spring fighting season heats up .
These forces are managing without the additional courses .
In addition , special operators might not have all the unique Army engineering tools , but they ’re hardly unprepared .
U.S. Special Operations Command has bought the blast - deflecting trucks seen in the picture above , radio jammers and other life - saving equipment for its forces in Afghanistan .
Many of the Pentagon ’s elite troops also receive specialized training in the art of blowing things up .
The commandos would no doubt have a leg up from regular soldiers in identifying bombs and disabling them to begin with .
Of course , JIEDDO has been criticized in the past over how it spends its money .
The Pentagon wants to overhaul the office and give it a new name .
Still , roadside bombs remain a serious threat to American troops regardless of whether JIEDDO ’s arguments are legitimate .
Washington is unlikely to let commandos take on an “ unacceptable risk to sustain loss of life and serious injuries ” from IEDs .

This is the slogan that was put on 25 buses in Chicago this week , as a part of the Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign .
The bus ads will be seen cruising all over Chicago through the month of June .
Charlie Sitzes , a spokesman for the group from Indiana says that " The intent of the campaign is to stimulate discussion of religion and its place in our society . "
They took the campaign from Indiana to Chicago after a similar campaign with a different slogan " you can be good without God " was reject by the public transportation authorities in Bloomington and stalled by officials in South Bend because they did n't want the ads to be posted during the speech of President Obama at Notre Dame University .
In reaction to the Bloomington refusal , the Indiana chapter of the " It would appear that where there is more opposition to the message that maybe that would be the place where we needed dialogue more , " Sitzes said , maintaining that the slogan is a simple fact .
" All non -believers believe God is a creation of man , " he said .
" We used to have thousands of gods .
Now we ’re down to one .
We ’re getting closer to the true number . "
The guidelines ruling advertising on the Chicago Transit Authority ( While at this moment , Trinity Christian College is the only religious organisation advertising on the CTA , eight religious organisations have done so last year , including Muslims , Roman Catholics , Christian Scientists and Seventh Day Adventists .
Charlie Sitzes thinks it is sad that the European - inspired advertisement campaign has been opposed in his home state .
In Great - Britain , ads were used that said " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
The AHA used pictures with a man in a Santa suit , saying " Why believe in a God ?
Just be good for goodness sake . " in Washington DC .
Sitzes said that the Chicago slogan " makes the point that religion is a social , man - made creation – like literature , art , politics , and science – and as such , it should be subject to debate like everything else , " He add that the view of atheists , agnostics and secular humanists are often ignored in public life .
" Atheists , agnostics and secular humanists have a unique perspective on the topic that usually gets ignored in public discussion , and we ’d like to make ourselves heard , " he said .
" The ads are n’t an attack on religious people but an affirmation of a different point of view . "
The Chicago Tribune reports that the Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign ( IABC ) has collected more than $ 10,000 USD in private donations to buy ads in Indiana and Illinois , with help from the AHA Charlie Sitzes , a spokesman for the group from Indiana says that " The intent of the campaign is to stimulate discussion of religion and its place in our society .

In reaction to the Bloomington refusal , the Indiana chapter of the ACLU has sued the Bloomington Public Transportation Corporation on behalf of the IABC .
The mayor of Bloomington , Mark Kruzan has denounced his own public transportation corporation , saying that he does not agree with government censorship .

When I was a youngster I had a lively and active imagination and loved to read .
Thus , when I was a young teenager , my mother took me and my three sisters on weekly visits to our Ohio town 's library to " re-load " our supply of reading materials .
It was in the quiet , dusty library stacks , smelling of old leather and new ink , that I discovered a wondrous , magical , and mysterious world of the paranormal .
The books I found covered topics from UFOs , ghosts , ESP , to the Loch Ness monster ( I now realize that I had read some of the " classics " - including information on the Project Blue Book ( UFOs ) and Edgar Cayce 's work on his supposed psychic readings ) .
The subjects fit perfectly into my young interest in mysteries and science fiction ( I believe that I actually read nearly every science fiction book the library had ) .
My favorite writings were those of Von Daniken 's " Ancient Astronauts . "
I had always loved stories about archaeology above all else , and when I " grew up " I wanted to be an archaeologist .
Von Daniken 's stories about space aliens visiting the past and the tales he wove of deciphering their presence in obscure archaeological traces tugged at my very heartstrings .
I discovered a marvelous world in all those books and later on , films , describing the supernatural - grand and glorious stories revealing the special nature of humans and the world about us .
I eventually went on to become an undergraduate student at the Ohio State University specializing in my first true love - archaeology .
It was in the first set of classes that I discovered that Von Daniken 's books had very little basis in reality .
The more I learned the more I discovered how Von Daniken had twisted facts to suit his proposed theories , did n't even get basic information down correctly , and , in fact , often created " facts " ( later skeptically - oriented books pointed out the whoppers invented by Von Daniken ) .
It was at this stage that I asked the fundamental question - " If the ' Ancient Astronauts ' idea is so terribly incorrect , what about all those other fantastical ideas ? "
Additionally , I learned a more important elemental " truth " - that the universe about us , revealed through the process of science , is much more fascinating and intriguing than all of the paranormal claims I had once found so exciting .
As I completed my undergraduate education and made my way through the perils of graduate school my interest in pseudoscience was put on low priority .
As I look back upon this time I can see , however , that not only was I learning the " tools of my trade " but that my ability to think critically was being further enhanced and developed .
Mastering the discipline of archaeology , one of the subfields of anthropology , requires an individual who is able to pull together information from diverse fields , sift through data for relevant patterns , and devise creative ways to scientifically test ideas and theories .
Furthermore , the larger topic of anthropology focuses upon how humans have evolved as thinking individuals and the role that belief systems play within societies .
Consequently , I became interested in exactly how people think ( cognition studies ) and how myths are generated and maintained within communities ( a background that has worked to my advantage in the study of phenomena such as Satanic cult rumor panics ) .
As a senior graduate student in the early and mid-1980s I was assigned my own courses to teach at Ohio State University in introductory archaeology and physical anthropology ( specializing in evolutionary theory and human origins ) .
As many of you may recall , it was in the early 1980s that the " Moral Majority " and certain Christian fundamentalist groups began to push the teaching of creation science in classrooms .
I was astonished , as a young naive instructor , to be literally confronted in several of my classes by younger students telling me in no uncertain terms that I was an instrument of Satan teaching such unholy ideas about human evolution .
I became painfully aware that I could n't adequately respond to their emotional distress nor to really answer their questions about the nature of science ( like many scientists I had never truly confronted what exactly science is for myself ) .
I thus began my self - taught education into the philosophy of science , the bizarre arguments of the creation scientists , and how to adapt adequate responses about the topic to the general public .
In addition , to help in my understanding of the issues , a dear friend of mine , Dr. Brad Lepper ( Archaeology Curator at the Ohio Historical Society ) introduced me to the world of CSICOP and the Skeptical Inquirer .
From there I discovered other skeptical organizations and journals , books and conferences .
The material and information from the skeptically - inclined authors also helped prepare me when as a professional archaeologist I encountered many individuals who had rather unique ideas about my specialization .
I conduct research on Hopewell archaeology --- the grand Moundbuilders of the mid-Ohio valley who created earthworks some 2,000 years ago .
This type of impressive archaeology acts as a magnet for a number of outrageous claims ; ranging from Mormons who believe they were not built by Native Americans to individuals who staunchly hold forth that the Lost Tribe of Israel created the earthworks .
I eventually received my doctorate and became a professor at a lovely Pennsylvanian university .
Over the past several years I have designed and taught a course specifically about pseudoscience ( " Pseudoscience : Science and Nonsense " ) .
The course focuses on teaching students about science , including the philosophy of science and how " everyday " scientists go about their work .
It contrasts science as a method and knowledge base against various pseudoscientific claims .
It is a fun way to get students to learn critical thinking skills and an appreciation of how easy it is to be fooled by others and by oneself .
Above all else I have discovered that I am having just as much fun today , with the same sense of mystery and excitement , as I did as a young teenager reading paranormal books .
In this case , I am channeling my need for mystery by trying to figure out how various pseudoscientific scams are conducted and how to go about exposing those who feed upon the needs of so many .
Along the way I am creating a rather interesting reputation on campus ...
What have the Arizona State cheerleaders been up to this offseason , you ask ?
BC Special Assignment Editor Art McGregor ( more of his work at Blog on the Run ) has the latest news out of Tempe and as you expected , it includes bikinis and famous men .
Busy past couple weeks for the Arizona State cheerleaders .
First they had tryouts , then the premiere with Wolverine where they posed with Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman .
Capped it with a bikini birthday bash for a teammate ’s 19th birthday .
There seems to be some perks ( and perky ones ) that come along with being a cheerleader at ASU .
Huge Jackman was interviewed at the Wolverine premiere and said he loved Tempe and was moving there .
We ’re trying to figure out if Hugh said that before or after the Sun Devil cheerleaders got close to him for a team photo .
We ’ll cut to the chase .
The Arizona State ladies know how to keep the offseason interesting .
Bikinis .
Fruit .
Pools .
Cameras .
….still trying to figure out why we subject ourselves and staff to Midwestern winters and lack of sunshine .
Re-Default in Obama�s $ 75 Billion Program for Foreclosures
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : John Cutts
President Barack Obama�s $ 75 billion program to stop further foreclosures will again just waste government money and bank money because it will just extend the number of months underwater borrowers occupy bank properties for free .
Just like any other program launched under the previous administration to prevent foreclosures , Obama�s program did not spend more effort in distinguishing between borrowers who have great chances of sustaining their mortgage payments after loan modifications and those who will just go through the restructurings just to extend their free stay in the properties .
Under Obama�s program to mitigate foreclosures , the chances of re-default are great because of two issues .
The first issue is that the program did not consider the possible thinking processes of underwater borrowers .
With their mortgages deeply underwater , borrowers have little motivation to spend some more effort to save their homes .
They know that even if the monthly payments are reduced to levels that they can afford , their mortgages would still be underwater .
They would just go through the motions of modifications but would not sustain their payments to avoid foreclosures .
The second issue is that Obama�s program does not have the provisions to screen out applicants who have major financial problems other than their mortgage loans .
Surely many applicants would be accepted into the program even with big credit card debts , reduced incomes because of the downturn and doubtful capability to pay even if the monthly payments are reduced because of possible job losses .
The second issue is that Obama�s program does not have the provisions to screen out applicants who have major financial problems other than their mortgage loans .
Surely many applicants would be accepted into the program even with big credit card debts , reduced incomes because of the downturn and doubtful capability to pay even if the monthly payments are reduced because of possible job losses .
One option is for Obama�s administration to add more stringent screening processes to weed out the really irresponsible borrowers .
But then again , this needs additional funds and will again provoke an outcry from homeowners troubled by foreclosures and groups advocating for the rescue of foreclosure - burdened Americans .
Are there other options to mitigate foreclosures ?
Perhaps these options might work : giving tax breaks to anyone across the country who buys a foreclosed property , erasing current default records to give a clear break to everyone and allowing banks to proceed with foreclosures to reduce losses .
Here is the update for 04/30/09 .
Enjoy !

After all the hype , I got around to taking Wolfram Alpha for a spin last night due to being unable to sleep after a weird Doctor Manhattan themed nightmare .
The experience of using the site is very impressive and there is a great walkthrough of the power of the site in the Wolfram Alpha screencast which I encourage people to watch if you are interested in learning about a new breed of search engine .
There have been a ton of articles calling Wolfram Alpha a " Google Killer " but after using the site for a few hours although I find it fascinating , I question how much of a threat the site is to Google either as a way to satisfy the typical questions people ask Web search engines or a threat to Google ’s search advertising cash cow .
You can get a sense for the kinds of queries that Wolfram Alpha handles amazingly well from the list below
As you can tell from the above list , Wolfram Alpha is like having a search engine over the kind of data you ’d see in the CIA 's World Factbook or Time Almanac .
There really is n’t anything like it on the Web today .
However it is n’t really a competitor to traditional web search engines who for the most part are still focused on finding web pages despite the various advancements in answering a subset of queries with direct answers instead of links to web pages such as Google 's OneBox results and Live Search ’s instant answers feature .
From my perspective , the threat to search engines like Google is n’t Wolfram Alpha but the trend it represents .
That trend is the renaissance of the vertical search engine .
Earlier this year , I was putting together a panel at the MIX ‘09 conference and needed to invite the panelists from a pool of people who I ’d either heard about or knew of professionally but had never contacted directly .
How did I find out how to contact these people ?
Even though all of them had blogs , there was n’t a consistent way to track down contact information .
So I looked them up on Facebook and sent each of them a private message .
Mission accomplished .
Unbeknownst to me , Facebook had become my “ people ” search engine ” .
Here ’s another story .
Last year I worked on the most satisfying software release of my career , Windows Live ( wave 3 ) .
After the launch I wanted to find out what people were saying about the product so I did a Twitter search for Windows Live and posted the results .
While I was n’t paying attention , Twitter had become my “ what are people saying about < insert brand here > ” search engine .
This trend of search engines dedicated to specific scenarios and contexts that ca n’t be answered well by Web search is the trend that traditional search engines should watch carefully .
I can imagine Wolfram Alpha eventually growing to satisfy a lot of the sorts of queries I go to Wikipedia today to get answers to and doing so in a more authoritative manner .
In that case , it would become my “ facts and trivia ” search engine .
However there are currently too many gaps in its knowledge of commercial products ( e.g. search for “ ipod ” results in a coming soon notice ) and people ( e.g. the Jim Carrey entry is amazingly brief yet still manages to have a factually inaccuracy ) to make it a true replacement for wikipedia .
That said , the service shows great promise and it will be interesting watching as it evolves .
The Lancet has accused Pope Benedict XVI of distorting scientific evidence to promote Catholic doctrine following his remarks about condom use and HIV .
During a visit to Africa last week , the pope said the use of condoms increased HIV infection rates .
This was later amended by the Vatican , which said that condom use merely increased the risk of transmission .
The remarks were condemned by aid agencies , the UN and the German , French and Belgian governments .
Today 's Lancet editorial said the statement was " outrageous and wildly inaccurate " , adding : " By saying that condoms exacerbate the problem ... the pope has publicly distorted scientific evidence to promote Catholic doctrine .
Whether the pope 's error was due to ignorance or a deliberate attempt to manipulate science to support Catholic ideology is unclear .
" When any influential person ... makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record . "
The House Energy and Commerce Committee begins the long slog today through hundreds of Republican amendments to change a 946 - page energy and global warming bill ( pdf ) even as Democrats appear to be lining up behind the measure .
Republicans have written about 450 possible amendments , though Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , the panel 's ranking member , said he only expects the GOP to focus on about 150 amendments as the markup stretches into the late night hours today , Wednesday and Thursday .
" Bring a sleeping bag , " Barton said yesterday after a relatively brief , three - hour session for opening statements .
Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) said he would prefer to take up amendments title by title , though he is open to departing from that practice if lawmakers request it .
If Waxman 's plan holds firm , debate today will focus first on a section of the legislation establishing a nationwide renewable electricity standard ( RES ) requiring utilities to supply escalating amounts of power from sources such as wind , solar and biomass .
Rep. Ed Whitfield ( R - Ky . ) said he planned to offer an amendment that would open the RES to nuclear power and carbon capture and storage at coal - fired power plants .
" We think it 's unfair that basically they 're subsidizing wind and solar , and the government is deciding which sources of energy would be used to produce electricity , " he said .
Rep. Greg Walden ( R - Ore. ) also has his sights on the RES with an amendment that would allow hydropower as a renewable energy source for periods when wind power output slows .
" It makes no sense to me " that Democrats disqualified hydropower , Walden said in a statement .
Looking at the bigger picture , Barton said he plans to offer a complete alternative to the Democrats ' climate and energy bill that focuses on expanding domestic energy production , though he was still working on his strategy for when to seek a vote on the proposal .
" I 'm trying to figure it out , " Barton told reporters .
" I 'm not dodging you .
I do n't know .
I kind of want to see how the debate goes . "
Rep. Fred Upton ( R - Mich . ) , the ranking member of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee , detailed the first four amendments that he would offer this week , including a proposal to terminate the climate law if U.S. unemployment reaches 10 percent .
" You heard a lot of talk from the other side of the aisle how this would n't distress the economy , well , we 're going to make sure it doesn't , " Upton said .
Other Upton amendments would sunset the climate law if 8 million households lose their electricity or natural gas services ; kill the climate law if China and India have not implemented climate regulations " at least equivalent " to the U.S. law ; and force climate compliance costs on every utility bill , gas pump , manufactured product and food label .
" I think you 're going to look at amendments to try and fix the bill in constructive ways , " Upton said .
Republicans have tailored a series of amendments at specific states , including language that would suspend the act should it cause anywhere from 1,000 to 500,000 job losses .
The GOP also may try to eliminate tax benefits for companies that belong to the U.S. Climate Action Partnership , including Alcoa , BP , Duke Energy Corp. , Rio Tinto and Shell Oil Co. , and tinker with the nonprofit tax status for the Environmental Defense Fund , Natural Resources Defense Council , Nature Conservancy , World Resources Institute and Pew Center on Global Climate Change .
Asked to elaborate on the tax - focused amendments , Rep. John Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) said , " You 'll have to wait and see .
You have three days of markup opportunity .
When you do something this big this quick , I think there are going to be provisions in this bill that members are going to regret .
And we 'll give them an opportunity to know about it before they vote for the entire bill . "
Barton said there was no shortage of amendment ideas .
" We 're preparing them as we speak , " he said .
" In fact , I came up with several just listening to their opening statements . "
It is unclear if the Republicans will have any success in peeling off Democrats to vote for their amendments .
Several influential panel members said yesterday they would remain united with their committee leaders in opposing the GOP alternatives .
" I 'm going to vote for the bill , " Rep. Gene Green ( D - Texas ) told reporters .
" And I 'm going to defend it against amendments that I 'd love to have , from the Republican side , that I 'd like to vote for . "
Democratic amendments
Waxman and Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) released yet another new version of their climate bill that adds about 14 pages to the measure compared with a version released Friday .
Key changes in the committee print ( pdf ) include relaxed restrictions on sources of biomass that can be used to make cellulosic ethanol and other fuels under the national renewable fuels standard ; the removal of language that calls for a nationwide automobile standard for greenhouse gases ; and a clarification that greenhouse gas requirements wo n't apply to the Clean Air Act 's New Source Review provisions dealing with new or modified power plants and other major stationary industrial sources .
Headed into the markup , Democrats do have their own amendments planned , albeit in far fewer numbers compared to the GOP .
Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) said yesterday that he intended to vote for the overall bill .
But first , the former panel chairman said he would offer language that establishes a Clean Energy Investment Bank to promote clean energy technology through loans , loan guarantees and other credit options .
The amendment also would back secondary market support for new energy bonds that could lower lending prices in the private sector .
" As we transition to clean energy , we must fund the research and development as well as deployment of these energy sources to meet the mounting demand for zero - carbon technology to dramatically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions , " Dingell said during yesterday 's opening statements .
Supporters of the energy bank idea say the federal government 's financing can help bring promising technologies from the lab into commercial deployment , backing innovative projects that Wall Street may not on its own .
Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - Wash . ) and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) have offered similar legislation .
Inslee yesterday said he hopes to amend the legislation to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission new powers to site interstate transmission lines when local governments cannot reach agreement .
Inslee and other advocates say a major build - out of new lines will be needed to carry increased renewable generation to populated areas .
But Inslee acknowledged that adding the plan is no sure thing .
" This is a contentious issue , " he told reporters .
" It takes a lot of people getting comfortable with what we are proposing and we are not there yet . "
Rep. Charles Melancon ( D - La. ) outlined a series of concerns with the House bill , though he stopped short of floating any amendments .
Among his concerns : no domestic energy production provisions ; too tight restrictions on the use of only government - established registries for domestic offsets , as opposed to private outlets such as the Chicago Climate Exchange ; stringent rules that would not allow Southeast states to use biomass material for compliance with the RES ; shortcomings in the amount of money for wetlands restoration ; and not enough consumer protection from high gas prices .
" As a representative of a region whose people are both highly dependent on jobs in the oil and gas industry , yet also more vulnerable to rising sea levels and climate change ( which has been linked to more frequent , more intense hurricanes ) , Representative Melancon is carefully weighing his decision , " said Robin Winchell , the congressman 's spokeswoman .
" He will continue to be an active player in the negotiations . "
Another vocal Democratic complaint comes from Rep. Eliot Engel of New York , who said Waxman had not heeded his call for language that promotes production of flex - fuel automobiles in the United States .
" I understand that sometimes compromises have to be made in order to pass a bill , but I find it incomprehensible that compromises were made watering down the bill with others who do n't share our view , but when you came to a real compromise on flex - fuel cars , none could be made , " Engel said yesterday .
" I know this bill generally takes us in a direction that you and I would like to go , " Engel added .
" I 'd like to vote for this bill , but I 'm not sure I can vote for this bill in its current form without strong flex - fuel language . "
Waxman said he is working with Engel and U.S. EPA to find a solution to the flex - fuel issue .
And he also defended his moves to win over moderate and conservative Democrats despite complaints from some environmental groups that he is watering down the overall measure .
" We 're only making consensus and reaching compromises where we think it makes sense , " Waxman said .
" And we 'll continue to be open to other ways to bridge differences with members and outside groups . "
Democrats are expected to pass the House climate bill later this week thanks to months of intense negotiations .
But Republicans have their own take on how the Democrats have managed to get the legislation so close to passage .
" I 'll give Waxman some credit , " Barton said .
" He and Markey have been very pragmatic in buying votes .
Give them credit .
Free allowance here .
Free allowance there .
Everywhere a free allowance . "
Science markup postponed
The House Science and Technology Committee yesterday postponed its plans to mark up legislation that would establish a National Climate Service to help communities and industries adapt to climate change .
Science Chairman Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn. ) , sponsor of H.R. 2407 ( pdf ) , has said his panel is working under a tight deadline to keep pace with the Energy and Commerce Committee 's plans for the Waxman - Markey bill , which would also establish a climate service at NOAA .
Gordon is also a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee .
Though the bill won unanimous approval during a subcommittee markup last week , a spokeswoman for Science and Technology Committee Democrats said the full committee action was postponed to give " a little more time for collaboration on the bill . "
The Science markup was rescheduled for June 3 .
Schedule : The Energy and Commerce Committee markup resumes at 10 a.m. today in 2123 Rayburn .
It is also expected to go tomorrow , Wednesday and conclude late Thursday or early Friday .

A US judge says a commercial helicopter pilot videotaped in a sex act while flying over San Diego committed gross negligence and cannot have his licence back .
National Transportation Safety Board administrative law Judge William Mullins upheld a Federal Aviation Administration order revoking the licence of David Martz after a hearing on Tuesday .
Martz had no comment after the ruling .
A passenger was videotaping when Martz let an adult film actress perform a sex act on him during the 2005 flight , and an edited version eventually became public .
The judge watched the unedited tape in chambers and took testimony before his decision .
Martz testified that his actions were unwise and he was much more responsible now .

Resolver One 1.5 beta : The Python Console
We 've just announced an invitation to try the beta of Resolver One 1.5 .
The major new feature in version 1.5 is an interactive Python console that lets you explore and interact with your spreadsheet objects .
You have full access to the spreadsheet scope - including any functions and classes you have defined in user code - and any changes you make in the console are immediately reflected in the spreadsheet display , so it is a really useful way of experimenting .
The console itself has syntax highlighting , auto - indent and history .
Much kudos to Kamil Dworakowski , my colleague who created the console .
As Resolver One is a Python powered spreadsheet system ( IronPython specifically of course ) , an interactive console has been an ' obvious idea ' ever since we first released .
We thought it would be a lot of work which is why we 've not done it before ; but when Kamil produced a prototype in a few days hacking we knew we had to do it .
The console is n't the only new feature in 1.5 .
Another feature that Resolver One has needed for a long time is the ability to import and export CSV files , and at last it can !
( It 's nice to gradually cross items off my Resolver One wish - list . )
You can also now drag and drop ' .rsl ' files onto Resolver One to open them .
A more important feature for working with user code is the new ' jump - to - line ' dialog .
When you have an error in your user - code the traceback in the output view pane ( at the bottom of the Resolver One UI ) will helpfully tell you which code section the error occurred in and which line number .
Unfortunately there was no easy way to quickly jump to that line in the code editor ( although the red error markers to the right of the code pane would show you all the error locations ) .
This feature was made more complex by the fact that the code box includes all the generated code from your data and formulae ( and the generated code can change if there are errors etc ) , so there was really no concept of a canonical ' line number ' for any individual line of code .
The new goto - line dialog ( activated by ctrl - g or from the menu ) lets you choose which code section and specify the line number , which is really handy and much requested :
Along with these features there are the usual host of minor features and bugfixes which will be announced when 1.5 final is out .
To go alongside the 1.5 release will be a demo of distributing Resolver One calculation tasks on the Digipede grid computing platform .
We 're already working on features for 1.6 , with more ' much - requested ' functionality .
Something else to look forward to .
Other news : we 've just announced the winner of the April round of the Resolver Systems Spreadsheet Challenge .
The winner is is Greg Bray 's Texas Holdem Poker Monte Carlo Simulator , a clever blend of compiled .NET code , IronPython , and Resolver One .
Several of the entries for this round are up and available for download on the Resolver Exchange .
Quite a few new spreadsheets have been added there recently , so if you are looking for examples of what Resolver One can do this is the place to look .
We 're also now seeing people buy and use Resolver One because of the Numpy integration .
Great !
Python Magic Methods Reference
Appendix B of IronPython in Action is a reference on all of the common magic methods in Python .
The magic methods are those that start and end with double underscores , and are called ' magic ' because instead of calling them directly they are usually called for you by the interpreter when objects that implement them are involved in certain operations .
They are used to implement the Python protocols ; for example the mapping and sequence protocols when an object is indexed , the context management protocol when an object is used with the with statement and the numeric protocols when an object is used in numeric operations .
Python protocols are duck typed versions of interfaces in other languages ( if the protocol methods are available then they will be called - not dependent on the type of the object ) .
There is a mechanism introduced in Python 2.6 and 3.0 , Abstract Base Classes , which is a bit more like interfaces in statically typed languages and makes it easier to know which protocols an object supports .
In most cases just implementing the magic methods you need is sufficient without needing to use the ABC machinery .
Appendix B is a useful reference for Python and IronPython programmers alike and I 've been given permission by Manning to put it online .
As it was quite long I 've gradually been putting up new sections over the last couple of weeks , and now it is complete !
As well as the magic methods ( including magic functions , modules and attributes ) it includes descriptions of the with statement , generator expressions and conditional expressions and the descriptor protocol .
The full table of contents for the online guide is :
Object creation Table B.1 Object creation
Comparison Table B.2 Comparison methods
Miscellaneous Table B.3 Miscellaneous methods
Containers and Iteration Table B.4 Mapping and sequence protocol methods Generator expressions and conditional expressions
Conversion to string Table B.5 String conversion methods
Attribute access Table B.6 Attribute access methods
Numeric types Arithmetic operations Table B.7 Binary arithmetic operations Table B.8 Unary arithmetic operations Conversion between numeric types Table B.9 Type conversion
Context managers and the with statement Table B.10
The context management protocol
The descriptor protocol Table B.11 Descriptor protocol methods
Magic attributes Table B.12
Python magic attributes
Functions and modules Table B.13 Magic functions and modules
If I find the time I might put the other appendices online .
If you like the reference you 'll find it so much more useful in handy book format ...

Anne Budden , 83 , is leaving the land of her birth because she can no longer bear to be “ a burden on my daughters in Zimbabwe ” .
She added : “ Their husbands are nearing retirement age .
They keep on saying I should change my mind , but I must go .
My hip operation took my last money .
Our three pensions , on which we lived well , disappeared about five years ago . ”
With my recent release of a new version of this site , I finally made the jump from using mod_python to using mod_wsgi .
This change had been a long time coming , but was made slightly less than straight forward by my desire to deploy to virtualenv environments .
This desire is borne of convenience and necessity .
One of the major problems with any web deployment that is on some kind of shared environment is managing the versions of dependent software .
If you want the underlying system to provide a rich set of languages and libraries , eventually the needs of a particular application will no longer match the state of the system : a new app will need a newer version of something , or an old app depend on an older version of something .
The other option is to sandbox every app entirely , which means lots of duplication and configuration management .
With my blog , not only had the Django version changed , but I also developed for newer versions of many utilities like python - markdown , pygments , and lxml .
Creating a virtualenv to throw these dependencies in made debugging that environment a snap , and allowed me to set up a staging and deployment environment for those new packages without having to manually create an entire shadow python installation .
Virtualenv and mod_wsgi's documentation on how to deploy using virtual environments are at odds , but at the time of this writing mod_wsgi's is essentially correct .
My " django.wsgi " application looks something like this :
import sys import site import os STAGE = False if STAGE : vepath = '/ path/to/virtualenvs/jmoiron.net-stage/lib/python2.5/site-packages ' else : vepath = '/ path/to/virtualenvs/jmoiron.net/lib/python2.5/site-packages ' prev_sys_path = list ( sys.path ) # add the site - packages of our virtualenv as a site dir site.addsitedir( vepath ) # add the app's directory to the PYTHONPATH sys.path.append('/ path/to/app/%s/' % ( ' stage ' if STAGE else ' live ' ) # reorder sys.path so new directories from the addsitedir show up first new_sys_path = [ p for p in sys. path if p not in prev_sys_path ] for item in new_sys_path : sys.path.remove(item ) sys.path [ :0 ] = new_sys_path # import from down here to pull in possible virtualenv django install from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler os.environ [ ' DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE '] = ' web.settings ' application = WSGIHandler ( )
The mod_wsgi documentation on deploying via virtualenv was heavily pylons biased , but the beauty of wsgi is that it generally works with any wsgi application .
The second part to migrating to use mod_wsgi instead of mod_python was a bit trickier since it lies outside my area of expertise : the apache configuration .
Unfortunately , I run a lot of things off of my www domain other than this django app , but the django application owns '/ '.
In the past , this meant a lot of < Location > blocks with SetHandler None in them , but since mod_wsgi handles alias stacking properly and the SetHandler hack does n't work with it , I had to translate that over .
The important points are :
' SetHandler None ' has to be converted to an Alias , which has to map to a location in the filesystem and thus can't always do the same things in the same way the SetHandler hack does .
, which has to map to a location in the filesystem and thus can't always do the same things in the same way the SetHandler hack does .
Your WSGIScriptAlias should come after your other aliases so that they have a chance to match before your application eats '/'
Here 's roughly the config I 've ended up with :
< VirtualHost *> ServerName jmoiron.net # ServerAlias and what - not WSGIDaemonProcess live user=wsgiuser group=users threads=25 WSGIProcessGroup live Alias / media / / path/to/app/media/ # allow jmoiron.net / ~user / to still map to user 's public_html AliasMatch /~([ ^/ ]+ )/?(.*) /home/$1/public_html /$ 2 < Directory /home/jmoiron/public_html > # custom stuff i should put in an .htaccess </ Directory > # more Alias config for cgi-bin , et al WSGIScriptAlias / / path/to/app/apache/django.wsgi
< Directory / path/to/app/apache/>
Order deny , allow Allow from all </ Directory > # boring logging stuff </ VirtualHost >
Development and staging is now a snap , as switching my staging setup from " testing new software dependencies " to " testing new code " is as easy as switching the virtualenv I 'm using in the wsgi file and letting mod_wsgi reload the application !
Today , President Obama released the evidence needed to convict Justice Department lawyers John Yoo , Jay Bybee and Stephen Bradbury of conspiracy to torture , in the form of previously classified memos authorising torture and providing guidelines for its use .
But in the same breath , Obama also ruled out any action being taken against the torturers who implemented those techniques .
They had acted " in good faith " and on legal advice , and therefore should not be held accountable .
In other words , Befehl ist Befehl - " they were only following orders " .
The US rightly rejected this attempt at blame - shifting at Nuremberg , and the hypocrisy of them accepting it now to protect their own who have been involved in crimes under US and international law is astounding .
but its worse than that - because Obama did n't just promise to protect the US 's torturers - he praised them .
From his statement :
In releasing these memos , it is our intention to assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution .
The men and women of our intelligence community serve courageously on the front lines of a dangerous world .
Their accomplishments are unsung and their names unknown , but because of their sacrifices , every single American is safer .
We must protect their identities as vigilantly as they protect our security , and we must provide them with the confidence that they can do their jobs .
The United States is a nation of laws .
My Administration will always act in accordance with those laws , and with an unshakeable commitment to our ideals .
Oh yes - unknown heroes who have Sacrificed To Save America - by torturing people , waterboarding them , threatening to rape and murder their children , and in some cases even killing their victims in the process .
So , I guess Obama approves of torture after all .
And then , to cap it all off , he says this : ... by excusing those who violate those laws and ideals from any threat of justice .
That noise was my hypocrisy meter overloading .
This just makes it clearer : the US will not act to uphold its obligations under the Convention Against Torture , so the international community will have to do it for them .
There is universal jurisdiction for torture , and any CIA torturer who sets foot outside the US should expect to be arrested and tried .
And the same should apply to President Obama - because by taking a stand to protect his torturers , he 's just made himself a co-conspirator .
Dr Andy Jones , head of information security research at BT , who led the survey , said : " This is the fourth time we have carried out this research and it is clear that a majority of organisations and private individuals still have no idea about the potential volume and type of information that is stored on computer hard disks .
1. Requiem For A Dream ( 2000 )
Darren Aronofsky 's brutal adaptation of Hubert Selby 's novel depicts the horrors of substance abuse in many forms — heroin , pot , caffeine , prescription pills , hope — with such visceral , breathtaking force that shell - shocked audiences were forced to think long and hard about pouring that first cup of coffee the next day .
The result is one of the only genuinely effective , non-hysterical anti-drug movies ever made .
Dream flirts extensively with delirious camp during its fever dream of a climax , but retains a pummeling power thanks to Aronofsky 's unblinking willingness to trawl deep into the bowels of hell alongside his heartbreakingly fragile characters .
2. Dancer In The Dark ( 2000 )
Starting with 1996's Breaking The Waves , writer - director Lars von Trier all but commandeered the genre of fascinating , beautifully wrought movies that are too agonizing to sit through twice .
Waves , Dogville , Dancer In The Dark , and even the less successful Manderlay all center on women making well - meaning but disastrous choices , attempting to help other people but winding up meekly agreeing to their own financial , sexual , and emotional exploitation .
And when presented with such humble , cooperative victims , the people around them tend to abandon any semblance of morality and decency in order to take full advantage of the sacrifices they 've been offered .
Dancer
In The Dark follows the same pattern as the others , but it 's particularly painful thanks to Björk 's sweet , nakedly vulnerable performance as a cringing immigrant factory worker who 's gradually going blind while trying to save up money so her son can have the operation that will save him from the same fate .
Von Trier calculates his plotlines with exacting , inspired sadism , ensuring that her attempts to reach out to others backfire , her kindness is repaid with betrayal , and every seeming spark of hope exists only to better illuminate the miserable darkness .
And yet Dancer is a beautiful film , filled with terrific performances and heartbreaking music , performed by Björk in character .
3. The Passion Of Joan Of Arc ( 1928 )
Von Trier owes his entire painful career to his Danish countryman Carl Dreyer , particularly his silent classic The Passion Of Joan Of Arc , which deals with the ultimate case of a woman suffering for her faith .
What makes the film difficult to watch is n't so much Joan 's persecution at the hands of her ecclesiastical tormentors , or even Maria Falconetti's famously expressive performance , which registers her anguish in every crevice of her face .
Its disturbing intensity comes mainly from Dreyer 's refusal to play by the rules :
Defying the most basic tenets of cinematic grammar , which require filmmakers to establish spatial relationship on a 180 - degree plane , Dreyer instead constructs the film as a series of extreme close - ups , with little sense of where the characters are in relation to one another .
That disorientation , combined with the feverish emotions whipped up by the trial , places viewers in a grim psychic space .
4. The Seventh Continent ( 1989 )
Just about every film by Michael Haneke — the fiendishly precise Austrian director of Funny Games , The Piano Teacher , and Caché — could have made this list .
An unsparing moralist with a peerless talent for getting under viewers ' skins , Haneke backs up his schoolmarm - ish theses on violence with a punishing aesthetic that could n't be further from the escapist frivolity of Hollywood fare .
The first entry in a so - called " glaciation trilogy " that continued with Benny 's Video and 71 Fragments Of A Chronology Of Chance , Haneke 's brilliant debut feature The Seventh Continent watches with chilling dispassion as an average middle - class family sets about destroying itself .
Haneke starts by focusing on the mundane , joylessly repetitive details of their life , then follows the drastic measures they take in carefully dismantling it .
In the pantheon of Haneke shocks — the " remote control " in Funny Games , the broken glass in The Piano Teacher , Maurice Bénichou 's fate in Caché — Continent 's fish - tank scene may be the most emotionally wrenching .
5. Winter Light ( 1962 )
Perhaps the grimmest entry in Ingmar Bergman 's " Trilogy Of Faith " ( also known as the " God 's Silence " trilogy , which should be a good indicator of the bleakness standards at play ) , Winter Light follows a small group of parishioners who have no celestial answers for their anguish .
The opening scenes alone constitute one of the sparest expressions of Bergman 's dour spirituality :
As a rural pastor performs his noon service , a handful of the faithless faithful go through the requisite motions , but with a palpable disconnection from their meaning .
Though he offers himself as counselor , the pastor can't comfort them , because he too is in spiritual crisis ; after serving in Spain during the civil war , he witnessed so many bloody atrocities that he struggled to reconcile the idea of just loving God with the reality of human cruelty and violence .
In the end , apostasy is the only answer .
6. Bad Lieutenant ( 1992 )
The blunt title turns out to be an understatement :
The hard - living detective in Abel Ferrara 's Bad Lieutenant , played with fearless brio by Harvey Keitel , surely counts as one of film history 's most corrupt cops .
He 's a gambler and an addict , given to pocketing drug seizures for recreational use and planting them when necessary , participating in sleazy sex - and - drug - fueled bacchanals , and flagrantly abusing the public trust .
For his part , Ferrara coughs up some suitably repulsive images : a nun getting gang - raped on the altar ; a virtual how - to clinic on preparing and shooting up a ball of heroin ; a profanity - laced confrontation with Jesus ; and most memorably , a scene in which Keitel pulls over two underage girls and agrees to let them go in exchange for sexual favors .
As hard as these scenes are to watch , the clincher may be Keitel 's performance itself — a display of raw , unvarnished emotion from a character whose slumbering conscience and faith are suddenly reawakened .
Witnessing his transformation is like watching a dried - out junkie .
7. Straw Dogs ( 1971 )
A forceful , unrelenting statement on masculinity and violence , Sam Peckinpah 's Straw Dogs sounds like a perfectly watchable home - invasion thriller , concluding as it does with the hero standing his ground and beating back his formidable attackers .
But like many of the films on this list , it 's a case where the moviemaking is skillful enough to make even its simple revenge scenario seem dangerously potent .
Critic Pauline Kael described it as a " fascist classic " for casting Dustin Hoffman as a wimpy , bespectacled academic and pacifist whose manhood remains questionable until he 's put through a bloody rite of passage .
Hoffman 's gruesome showdown with a group of crude locals would be shocking enough on its own , but the infamous scene that prefaces it counts as even more disturbing .
Left alone in their home in a seemingly quaint Cornish village , Hoffman 's wife ( Susan George ) is raped by her former lover and his crony .
Initially horrified , she eventually responds with something close to ecstasy , underlining her husband 's weakness in the context of an indefensible rape fantasy .
8. Audition ( 1999 )
" Kiri - kiri - kiri - kiri - kiri ! " ( " Deeper , deeper , deeper … " ) J- horror maestro Takashi Miike has plenty of disturbing images to his credit — a man suspended horizontally by hooks and doused with hot oil in Ichi The Killer , the infamous lactation sex scene in Visitor Q— but Audition , his best film in a walk , unsettles because its shocks are character - oriented , in addition to merely being gross .
The first half of the film could be mistaken for austere melodrama , as Miike follows a widowed producer who " auditions " a new wife under false pretenses , and finds a quiet , petite young woman who fits the bill .
But the woman turns out to have a dark agenda , and she answers his deceptions in a horrifically extended torture sequence involving a very long needle .
Her retribution is Miike 's sick idea of social critique , addressing the problem of female objectification with unspeakable ( and yet weirdly erotic ) acts of cruelty .

9. Sick : The Life And Death Of Bob Flanagan , Supermasochist ( 1997 )
Simply describing the sadomasochistic stunts pulled by Bob Flanagan , a performance artist who died from cystic fibrosis at age 43 , is enough to get half the population wincing as if they were sucking on a lemon wedge .
But seeing Flanagan 's work in Kirby Dick 's surprisingly moving and inspiring documentary Sick is another matter .
As a way of combating a body that was constantly betraying him , Flanagan tested his astounding pain threshold in shocking ways , most notoriously including a nail pounded into his penis .
( In close - up . )
It may sound like something no one would want to watch the first time , let alone twice , but Sick is redeemed by Flanagan 's wicked sense of humor and courageous defiance in fighting a disease that normally strikes down the afflicted during childhood .

10 . Come And See ( 1985 )
Many films use a child 's perspective to tell a war story — it 's a easy way to chronicle loss of innocence and portray the consequences of violence .
Nothing on film drives this point home quite as effectively as Elem Klimov 's Come And See , the chronicle of one boy 's struggle to defend his Belarusian village from the Nazis in 1943 .
Aleksei Kravchenko spends the early part of the film eager to join his comrades , finding a damaged rifle of his own and dressing in oversized military clothing , camouflaging his youth before the war actually takes it from him .
Kravchenko's face tells the story , as repeated close - ups document his transformation .
By the film 's end , it 's hard to tell whether dried dirt or actual wrinkles are violating his once - youthful visage .
The scene where a Nazi officer gleefully pushes Kravchenko to his knees and points a pistol at his temple to pose for a photograph may once have brought to mind Saigon and that notorious execution of a Viet Cong officer .
Now , it 's hard not to think of Abu Ghraib .
11 . In A Year Of 13 Moons ( 1978 )
There 's torment enough in Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's deeply personal In A Year Of 13 Moons long before it reaches the sequence that made it semi-notorious .
Fassbinder 's hero , a transvestite martyr played by Volker Spengler , is a pitiable Frankfurt drifter who had a sex - change operation years earlier , prompted by an offhand comment ( " too bad you 're not a girl " ) from an unattainable object of desire .
Spengler convinces neither as a man or as a woman , and he winds up subjecting himself to his old crush , now a cruel businessman whose towering office space is accessed by the password " Bergen - Belsen . "
And on top of it all , the film was shot mere weeks after Fassbinder 's lover committed suicide .
But 13
Moons saves its most disturbing setpiece for its final act , which contains a monologue on self - mutilation set against footage of the killing floor in a slaughterhouse .
Fassbinder super - fan Richard Linklater lifted the idea for Fast Food Nation as a tactic for letting audiences know where their steaks and burgers come from , but the combination of those images and the dissociated voiceover makes 13 Moons considerably more disturbing .

12 . Safe ( 1995 )
A sort - of horror movie in which the monster is the entire world , Todd Haynes '
Safe follows a rich , empty housewife ( played masterfully by Julianne Moore ) into the depths of " environmental illness " — a malady that real - world doctors still can't agree on .
Is it all in her head , which is half - vacant and in need of something to worry about when all basic needs are met ?
Or is she just sensitive to low levels of toxic chemicals that most people simply do n't notice ?
The film does n't offer an clear answer — instead , it follows Moore through incredibly uncomfortable anxieties and unpeggable illnesses .
She ends up at a wellness retreat , which at first seems to offer some hope , but she 's soon sucked even deeper into the discomfort of her own mind .
It 's pure bleakness .
13 . Irreversible ( 2002 )
Gaspar Noé's Irreversible picked up some well - deserved notoriety for its centerpiece , a gasp - inducing nine - minute single - take sequence in which Jo Prestia anally violates Monica Bellucci at knifepoint in a grimy ( and highly symbolic ) red underground tunnel , then beats her to an unrecognizable pulp .
There 's nothing cinematic or subversively sexy about the rape scene ; it 's a ghastly , raw experience that seems to go on for hours , with Bellucci 's muffled cries and wide , blank eyes becoming increasingly inhuman as the process drags on .
But Noé does n't make the rest of the film any easier to take .
Laying out the story in reverse chronological order , he begins with a stomach - churning act of revenge for the rape , then sets his camera spinning slowly end - over - end , preventing viewers from gathering their bearings and turning the film into a ghastly carnival ride .
Throughout the film , his shocking content and his startling intimacy with his characters make for a strikingly vivid , immersive , intense experience , but it 's a singularly exhausting one as well .
14 . Boys Do n't Cry ( 1999 )
Graphic rape scenes are tough enough to sit through without squirming , but the brutal assaults in Boys Don't Cry make repeat viewings of the film an act of psychic self - abuse .
Based on the real - life tragedy of transgender 21 - year - old Brandon Teena — played with haunting depth by Hilary Swank — Boys is relentless in its portrayal of barbaric bigotry in small - town Nebraska .
After Swank starts a romantic relationship with Chloë Sevigny 's Lana Tisdel , Lana 's redneck friends forcibly expose Teena as a biological female , then savagely rape her before the hatred escalates to an inevitably horrific end .
Just as sickening as the violence , though , is the complicity of Lana 's mother — who calls Teena " it " and ultimately gives the boys sanction to " clean up " the situation — and the outright antagonism ( bordering on titillation ) of the hick sheriff who grills Teena after the rape .
The fact that the film 's events are based on truth — and the lingering attachment Boys Do n't Cry has to the hate - fueled murder of Matthew Shepherd around the time of its release — only magnifies its gut - crawling impact .
15 . Grave Of The Fireflies ( 1988 )
From the opening scene showing 14 - year - old protagonist Seita dying on a train - station floor as harried travelers look on bemusedly , it 's clear that Grave Of The Fireflies is n't going to be easy to watch .
An animated Japanese film as visually beautiful as it is emotionally draining , Fireflies finds tragedy in the horrors of war and the dangers of human pride .
The story of two Japanese siblings orphaned during the firebombing of their village during World War II , Grave draws out the suffering of Seita and his younger sister Setsuko over 88 quietly horrifying minutes as they struggle , and eventually fail , to survive in a bleak , war - torn landscape .
In spite of its dark subject matter , Fireflies is brightly colored and peppered with sweetly innocent moments between brother and sister , making their eventual fates all the more disturbing .
16 . When The Wind Blows ( 1986 )
This deceptively sweet little British animated feature emphasizes the cost of war on a very personal level , by observing a quiet rural couple preparing for impending nuclear conflict , then slowly dying of radiation poisoning afterward .
Naïvely accepting everything their government pamphlets tell them ( though they do n't understand much of what they 're told , and remain sure that since they can't see or feel any radiation , it can't possibly be hurting them ) , they fumble through their days , gently squabbling and supporting each other in homey old - married fashion without comprehending either the scope or the causes of the fight that 's killing them from afar .
Perhaps the saddest part is their conviction that nuclear war will be no different from World War II , which they lived through , and that if they just tough it out and tighten their belts , they can get through lethal radiation poisoning the way they got through wartime shortages .
Much like Grave Of The Fireflies , When The Wind Blows is adorable in its personal , knowing details , and excruciating in its big picture .

17 . Leaving Las Vegas ( 1996 )
It 's been a long fall for Nicolas Cage , from celebrated Best Actor Oscar winner a mere decade ago to the star of Next , Ghost Rider , and ( tee - hee , " How 'd it get burned ? " )
The Wicker Man .
It 's honestly hard to remember at this point what a revelation he was in his Oscar - winning role in Leaving Las Vegas , as a failed screenwriter pointedly setting out to drink himself to death .
The film , written and directed by Stormy Monday 's Mike Figgis , is more consciously polished and Hollywood -y than most of the films on this list , but it has much the same quality of unstintingly , aggressively delving into just how miserable human beings can get .
It is n't enough , for instance , that co-star Elisabeth Shue is trapped in a degrading life as a Vegas prostitute .
It is n't enough that her best friend is an abusive , suicidal drunk who seems content to drag her down with him .
It is n't enough when she gets gang - raped , and subsequently evicted from her home by landlords clearly uncomfortable with the disreputable appearance of a bruised - up , limping rape victim .
No , she actually has to get mocked and abused on her way home after the rape , as her taxi driver , noticing how gingerly she 's moving , asks if she got " a back - door delivery you were n't expecting , " then tells her she was asking for it by dressing the way she does .
Only Figgis ' glittery , somber direction and the leads ' stellar performances turn this wallow in miserablism into something sadly poetic .
18 . Jonestown : The Life And Death Of Peoples Temple ( 2006 )
19 . S - 21 : The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine ( 2003 )
Though they take drastically different approaches , the Jim Jones documentary Jonestown and S21 are both far too intense and draining for repeat viewing .
S21 coldly but powerfully appraises the devastating aftereffects of totalitarianism through the firsthand stories of survivors of Khmer Rouge terror .
Jonestown , meanwhile , traces the tragic rise and fall of Jim Jones , a fiery idealist and social activist corrupted by power .
People 's Temple attains an almost unbearable intensity in a heart - stopping climax that draws extensively on audio footage miraculously documenting Jones ' endgame strategy of poisoned Kool - Aid and mass suicide .
It 's as close to being there as humanly possible .
20 . The Last House On The Left ( 1972 )
Taxi Driver is considered the definitive rebuke of ' 70s vigilante movies , but it 's a laugh - a- minute joy ride next to the vengeful depravity depicted in The Last House On The Left .
Drawing from Ingmar Bergman's
The Virgin Spring , Wes Craven 's brilliantly unwatchable first feature is a no-holds - barred depiction of the rape and murder of two teenage girls by a pack of hippie lunatics , and the graphic revenge the girls ' parents enact on the murderers .
Last House looks cheap and amateurish , which adds to its snuff - film - style realism .
Never has the gulf between " great film " and " enjoyable " been so wide .
21 . Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 )
The first three - quarters of Million Dollar Baby play like an old - fashioned sports movie , focusing on the heartwarming father - daughter dynamic between coach Clint Eastwood and boxer Hilary Swank .
Then ( spoiler alert ! )
Swank suffers a horrible accident in the ring , and Million Dollar Baby is suddenly rich with ripped - from - the - headlines relevance as Eastwood wrestles with the question of whether he should euthanize his surrogate daughter .
The decision is appropriately gut - wrenching , and Eastwood 's direction is always tasteful , but who wants to ponder the difficulty of putting a loved one out of their misery if fate does n't require it ?
22 . United 93 ( 2006 )
Writer - director Paul Greengrass dramatizes the events of September 11 on the ground and in the air with a " you are there " veracity that 's gut - wrenching and surprisingly probative .
From the initial confusion to the panicked response , United 93 explains what the whole last six years have been like , from shock to violence to exhaustion .
But Greengrass ' refusal to insert any kind of distancing effects means that viewers get to relive every second of sick horror from one of the worst days any of us will ever experience .
A lot of Americans did n't want to see United 93 even once , and it was hard to blame them .
23 . Lilya 4 - Ever ( 2002 )
Just prior to Lilya 4 - Ever , Swedish writer - director Lukas Moodysson made Together , a movie so generous in spirit that a lot of its fans found this follow - up , a comparatively bleak story of a teenage Russian sex slave , too tough to take .
Actually , Lilya follows logically from Together as another profound illustration of how people need people .
( A little familial support would 've prevented most of the movie 's string of tragedies . )
But in spite of a spectacular lead performance by Oksana Akinshina — and a lyrical final scene that tries to put a happy spin on human misery — Lilya 4 - Ever essentially asks its audience to watch the hopes of a bright , pretty girl get crushed one by one .
It 's powerful stuff that lingers in the memory so strongly that a second viewing may not even be necessary .
24 . Nil By Mouth ( 1997 )
Gary Oldman has openly said that he appears in dreck like Air Force One because Hollywood paychecks let him fund his own indie films .
So far , though , his only writing - directing project is Nil By Mouth , a gritty , grueling drama in Mike Leigh mode .
Like Irreversible , it centers on a protracted , nauseating act of violence against a woman , framed within a nervy , talky plot .
But Nil By Mouth is less story - driven ; it mostly captures , intimately and unsparingly , the details of working - class life in South London , among addicts and alcoholics .
It 's an impressively immediate , immersive film , but a hard one to sit through , thanks to its direct look at physical and emotional abuse .
Then again , the accents are so dense , and the dialogue flies so fast and furious , that it may be necessary to watch it twice just to follow what 's going on .
Sometimes even the most exhausting films have to be watched more than once .
ROVE DEVELOPS A PATTERN ….
There ’s nothing wrong with political commentators developing a signature style , but when the common thread of a pundit ’s work is unintentional irony , there ’s a problem .
Let ’s take Karl Rove , for example .
Last week , the Bush / Cheney “ architect ” used his role as a high - profile media professional to accuse the Obama White House of using hardball political tactics .
A couple of weeks before that , Rove accused the president of looking at every policy issue “ from a political perspective . ”
A couple of weeks before that , Rove complained about the scourge of budget deficits .
A couple of weeks before that , Rove accused the president of relying on “ straw men ” for his arguments .
A couple of weeks before that , Rove decried White House “ power grabs . ”
( Rove also , about a year ago , accused the New York Times of having “ outed a CIA agent , ” which “ obviously puts the CIA agent in danger . ”
Rove added that disclosing the name of a CIA operative represents “ a very callous view about our nation ’s security and interests . ” )
Notice the pattern ?
Today , Rove is in rare form , arguing that President Obama is “ polarizing , ” because of his “ petty ” partisanship , while George W. Bush tried to bring Democrats and Republicans together .
The Pew Research Center reported last week that President Barack Obama “ has the most polarized early job approval of any president ” since surveys began tracking this 40 years ago .
The gap between Mr. Obama ’s approval rating among Democrats ( 88 % ) and Republicans ( 27 % ) is 61 points .
This “ approval gap ” is 10 points bigger than George W. Bush ’s at this point in his presidency , despite Mr. Bush winning a bitterly contested election .
Part of Mr. Obama ’s polarized standing can be attributed to a long - term trend .
University of Missouri political scientist John Petrocik points out that since 1980 , each successive first term president has had more polarized support than his predecessor with the exception of 1989 , when George H.W. Bush enjoyed a modest improvement over Ronald Reagan ’s 1981 standing .
But rather than end or ameliorate that trend , Mr. Obama ’s actions and rhetoric have accelerated it .
His campaign promised post - partisanship , but since taking office Mr. Obama has frozen Republicans out of the deliberative process , and his response to their suggestions has been a brusque dismissal that “ I won . ”
Compare this with Mr. Bush ’s actions in the aftermath of his election .
First , the loyal Bushies ’ newfound fascination with the “ polarizing ” talking point is wildly misleading .
Second , for Karl Rove to argue that Bush , far more than Obama , worked to bring people together is simply hilarious .
You do n’t suppose Rove has identified some of his ( and Bush ’s ) biggest faults , and is simply projecting them on to the Obama White House , do you ?
Happy Easter to everyone on the Gregorian Calendar !
Sorry the subject matter of this post is not more …er … fluffy bunny - esque .
When I saw the ads for “ Observe & Report , ” I already knew it probably was n’t going to be my type of movie .
I like Seth Rogen and Anna Faris , and I find Jody Hill likable as well , but the bleak humour of the premise did n’t strike me as particularly awesome , just bleak .
I ’ve worked in a mall before , I ’m even one of those strange little people who enjoys malls ( cue a self - righteous know - it - all with a lecture on my post - Soviet consumerist nihilism ) – probably because there ’s something about the impersonal atmosphere that feels cozy and safe .
Malls contain their own weird , scary , even pretty stories , but this movie seemed like the type that was shocking for the sake of being shocking , and I ’m not usually into that .
Then , of course , I realized that Seth Rogen ’s character rapes an unconscious woman for the sake of … what ?
Nervous laughter ?
A certain “ edginess ” I ’m just not hip or daring enough to appreciate ?
Murder gets played for laughs all the time , you might say , so what makes the scene in “ Observe & Report ” any different ?
Well , there is the fact that murder has a very clear definition : bang , boom , someone ’s dead .
On the other hand , Seth Rogen ( and , presumably , director Jody Hill ) has actually claimed that what happens in this film is n’t rape :
When we ’re having sex and she ’s unconscious like you can literally feel the audience thinking , like , how the fuck are they going to make this okay ?
Like , what can possibly be said or done that I ’m not going to walk out of the movie theater in the next thirty seconds ? . . .
And then she says , like , the one thing that makes it all okay : “ Why are you stopping , motherfucker ? ” – source : The Huffington Post
You know , I ’m pretty sure that if your character is fucking a woman who ’s passed out , you do n’t get to say that “ we ’re having sex and she ’s unconscious . ”
It ’s more like , “ she ’s being raped and she ’s unconscious . ”
When you stick your dick into someone who is not awake , you have no idea if that person wants you or not , and you do n’t give a damn either ( because if you DID give a damn , you would n’t stick your dick into this person in the first place ) .
The woman ’s conscience flickering back on , her acknowledging the situation as much as she is able to and asking you why you ’re stopping does n’t make it “ all okay . ”
Sex can be confusing and weird .
Despite the greeting - card veneer of the American dating scene , anyone who ’s ever been there knows the truth .
I ’m not saying that movies ought to gloss over the often disturbing nature of human sexuality , that they should make us feel safe when we are far from safe , or pretend that scenes like the one described above , complete with late - breaking “ consent ” do not happen .
I ’m also not saying that every woman who has ever been violated in this manner is going to acknowledge the violation , especially if she was horny or if she likes the guy .
Having said that – Seth ?
Your career is on the rise , and you probably party pretty regularly , am I right ?
So what if you have a few too many one night , and wake up with some guy ’s dick in your ass ?
And what if you ’re embarrassed , or maybe * dum dum dum * you even like it , a little or a lot , and so , drunk off your head and tripping balls , you say – “ why are you stopping , motherfucker ? ”
Would it make it all magically OK somehow ?
Oh , I get it – raping a dude is wrong ( unless it happens in prison , in which case it ’s also hilarious , right , fellas ? ) , but a passed - out slut is fair game , because she ’s a passed - out slut and that ’s what passed - out sluts are for !
I ’m not as disturbed by the fact that a movie like “ Observe & Report ” was made – and I do n’t think it should have been censored either – as I am disturbed by the cognitive gymnastics being performed to make us all understand that what happens in the film is NOT RAPE .
Why is this happening ?
Is it because flat - out stating that Rogen ’s clearly odious character is also a rapist , like , totally kills the vibe ?
Dramatic praire dog , help me out here :
We are dramatic prairie dogs when it comes to rape ; the reality of it is too much to deal with .
We would much rather pretend that it ’s not really happening , so we say , “ sure , they had sex , but it was n’t rape because she was too drunk to say no ” or “ sure , they had sex , but it was n’t rape because she invited him over ” or “ yeah , they did it , but she ’s a total slut anyway , so how come she ’s claiming he forced her ?
No one HAS to force her ! ”
We consciously refuse to assign a standard definition to sexual assault , which is why talented , and , I hope , well - meaning guys like Seth Rogen have to talk about making it all “ okay . ”
This is also why women sometimes find themselves wondering if they had been raped , as opposed to knowing it .
If we believe that rape is only something that can happen to a good girl ( unless she ’s wearing a tight top , haw haw ) , or that rape in prisons should only ever be boiled down to a joke about “ surprise buttsecks , ” then it ’s always going to be someone else ’s problem , and that ’s comforting .
Messed - up , yes , but comforting as well .
The ubiquitous nature of sexual assault does n’t have to make a dent in our conscience , because we will hunker down and refuse to let it .
I wonder how Seth Rogen ( or , for that matter , Jody Hill ) might view what actually happens in that scene if he ever has a daughter .
Not saying it will change his mind , but wondering , nonetheless .
It ’s easier to pretend it ’s “ all okay ” from a safe distance .
A forest fire is beautiful if you ’re standing far enough away – right ?
Alright , I found it , the best title ever on a published paper .
And it was published in Review of Modern Physics , a journal with an impact factor of 38 , not any random journal .

Wetting phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology .
A solid substrate exposed to the environment is almost invariably covered by a layer of fluid material .
In this review , the surface forces that lead to wetting are considered , and the equilibrium surface coverage of a substrate in contact with a drop of liquid .
Depending on the nature of the surface forces involved , different scenarios for wetting phase transitions are possible ; recent progress allows us to relate the critical exponents directly to the nature of the surface forces which lead to the different wetting scenarios .
Thermal fluctuation effects , which can be greatly enhanced for wetting of geometrically or chemically structured substrates , and are much stronger in colloidal suspensions , modify the adsorption singularities .
Macroscopic descriptions and microscopic theories have been developed to understand and predict wetting behavior relevant to microfluidics and nanofluidics applications .
Then the dynamics of wetting is examined .
A drop , placed on a substrate which it wets , spreads out to form a film .
Conversely , a nonwetted substrate previously covered by a film dewets upon an appropriate change of system parameters .
The hydrodynamics of both wetting and dewetting is influenced by the presence of the three - phase contact line separating “ wet ” regions from those that are either dry or covered by a microscopic film only .
Recent theoretical , experimental , and numerical progress in the description of moving contact line dynamics are reviewed , and its relation to the thermodynamics of wetting is explored .
In addition , recent progress on rough surfaces is surveyed .
The anchoring of contact lines and contact angle hysteresis are explored resulting from surface inhomogeneities .
Further , new ways to mold wetting characteristics according to technological constraints are discussed , for example , the use of patterned surfaces , surfactants , or complex fluids .
Most of us live hoping we will get a paper published with a title this cool .

This was sent to every member of parliament and over 50 media outlets this morning .
it took me 40 minutes .
better than watching tv .
Dear Honorable Mp ,
I beg you to pull our country out of the hypocritical abyss that Prime Minister Harper and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney seem intent on driving into .
By allowing the self - admitted , torture authorizer , George W Bush into our country last week our government chose to ignore it's own laws and make an exception for one of the most despised criminals on the planet .
Many of us felt disgraced by this visit and worked hard to get some of you to do your job .
There are hundreds of organizations around the world working to bring the Bush Administration to justice .
Our emails and petitions were ignored as nobody in our government showed any backbone to fight for human rights and the Geneva Conventions .
Quite sad considering many Canadians have died to protect these rights .
Enabling a war criminal to collect his blood money is what was accomplished last week .
We would expect nothing less from Calgary Oil executives ( many of which are from Dallas and Houston ) who see nothing but dollar signs and tend to be overwhelmingly racist but for our elected officials to stay silent and be complicit in aiding and abetting the Torturer and Thief is quite pathetic .
There is no doubt that the Bush administration purposefully lied the United States and the World , into war , and sent the planet into chaos for what was always an obvious oil grab .
These blatant lies have lead to hundreds of thousands of slaughtered Iraqi 's and millions displaced .
Is this not a war crime of the highest degree ?
Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney both admitted to authorizing water boarding before leaving their disgraced office .
This is fact .
Undeniable .
Waterboarding is a form of torture which Japanese officers were executed for administering after WWII .
This is fact also undeniable .
Is torture not a crime of the highest degree ?
There is no grey area here .
Mass murder , torture should n't be up for debate .
The fact that you have chosen to look the other way is not politically correct , it 's reprehensible and most cowardly .
Mr Bush has endangered the lives of every member of our armed forces that serve on foreign soil by his torture and rendition programs .
Recently Col. Lawrence Wilkinson , former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell , came out exposing the high level of war crimes / crimes against humanity that Bush Administration officials have committed vis a vis Guantanomo , Iraq and Afghanistan .
Among the detainees was a 13 year - old boy and a man over 90 .
This should be required reading for all of you .
http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2009/03/some_truths_abo/
Less than 1 % of the tens of thousands of detainees were even combatants .
Instead , innocent civilians were grossly abused , tortured and violated , by the Bush Administration 's vile policy .
Most were peasants , farmers , and even taxi drivers and were handed over for a bounty from warlords .
Please listen to credible people like Col. Wilkenson and the lead investigator into prisoner abuse / torture Maj.
Gen.
Antonio Mario Taguba .
In June 2008 , Maj. GenTaguba wrote the preface to a report by Physicians for Human Rights on prisoner abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib prison , in Guantanamo Bay , and in Afghanistan .
In it , he accused the Bush administration of committing war crimes and called for the prosecution of those responsible .
He wrote , " There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes .
The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account . "
It 's beyond reprehensible that Canadian politicians can't find their moral compass when it comes to standing up for human rights .
Allowing war criminals such as George Bush , Colin Powell , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Condaleeza Rice , John Yoo etc .... should not be allowed to happen .
We have strong laws on our books regarding anyone even being suspected of torture .
Deny entry or arrest on site .
Instead you all " looked the other way " .
Pathetic .
Recently in Calgary the CPS arrested a citizen who attempted a citizens arrest on Mr Bush .
Mr Boncore , deserves a medal , instead he received a beating and a court date .
The ridiculous hypocrisy i allude to at the beginning of my plea relates to the recent banning of British MP George Galloway .
While Israel was targeting and bombing U.N relief stations ( war crimes ) in Gaza , Mr Galloway was trying to bring aid .
Israel committed massive atrocities in Gaza while the Canadian government stayed silent .
Many innocent woman and children were massacred .
The hypocrisy of banning a peace activist and allowing a war criminal would be humorous if the results were n't so damaging to Canada 's reputation around the world .
I beg you , as honorable representives of all Canadians to start defending our nation 's image as Prime Minister Harper and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney only seem to care about the needs of special interests such the Oil Industry and attack dog groups like the JDL who interestingly enough have their own terrorist history .
The JDL was specifically referenced by the FBI 's Executive Assistant Director Counterterrorism / Counterintelligence , John S. Pistole , in his formal report before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States .
This has been a disgraceful week for our country and i hope that you find the decency and the courage to follow your moral compass and start pulling Canada out of the terrible abyss that Prime MInister Harper and his minions have throw us into .
I call on you to reverse British MP Galloway 's banishment as it's nothing more than an attack on free speech and blatant anti-war censorship .
I also call on you to investigate the obstruction of justice and subsequent beating of Mr John Boncore ( by the Calgary Police )
Mr Boncore showed more courage than anybody in the nation last week by attempting a citizens arrest on Mr Bush .
He deserves a medal .
History will not look fondly upon those that aided and abetted war criminals .
ask yourself this .
Does that label fit President Bush and his cronies or the peace activists that have been banned and beaten in the past 6 days ?
This country is almost unrecognizable .
It 's time you fought for it .
I thank you for taking the time to consider this letter and to reply ,
yours truly

Anarchism by school - clickable chart
The Anarchist FAQ is a non-sectarian view of anarchism in general .
Another general overview is Bryan Caplan 's Anarchist Theory FAQ .
Separately , GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said on late Tuesday that the automaker is set to resume negotiations with the United Auto Workers union this week , and it believes that everything should be on the table .
GM said in an SEC filing that the reverse split deal would be part of an agreement with the Treasury Department to swap at least half of GM 's debt to the government for company shares .
The filing says both sides are still negotiating the terms of the debt swap , but the government would own at least 50 percent of the company .
GM has received $ 15.4 billion in government loans and faces a June 1 deadline to restructure or be forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
Union to Move Forward
Henderson , who spoke to reporters in Washington about the UAW talks , said the deal that the union had made with Chrysler on restructuring payments due to a retiree healthcare fund was close to what GM was planning in restructuring its own debt .
Chrysler , which like GM has been operating with emergency funding from the federal government , filed for bankruptcy last week under the direction of U.S. officials and expects to emerge in as little as 60 days .
Henderson , who took the top job at GM just over a month ago , said the goal for any bankruptcy filing by GM would also be to emerge quickly from court protection .

How Unions and Governments Destroy Businesses
In the newspapers there is much discussion of what General Motors should do .
This discussion has gone on for many years .
Until now , it was a conversation carried on by serious analysts and auto industry experts .
They all said the same thing : GM needed to clear out its management , dump much of its expensive , “ legacy ” overhead , and produce better cars .
Why did n’t it do so ?
And now , it ’s broke .
And even politicians think they know how to run an auto company .
Just read the papers .
“ Obama insists on changes , ” says one headline .
Normally , the politicos should hold their tongues … and let an industry ’s owners run their businesses .
Alas , as of a few days ago , the politicians ARE the owners .
Here ’s a question :
When the government takes a majority stake in the auto business you know you are :
A ) In a bad dream
B ) In a bad way
C ) In a bad country
D ) In France
Correct answer : well , we we ’re not in France .
But as for the rest , it could be any of them …or all of the above .
Here ’s an easier question .
Who will the U.S. government put on the board of directors of General Motors ?
A ) A political hack
B ) An industry hack
C ) A far - sighted maverick who will shake up the business and put it on the road to growth and prosperity
If you answered “ C ” – you are from another planet .
There is a reason neither governments , nor workers should own businesses .
In the following , roundabout way , we explain why …
But first , a bit of news .
As far as we can tell , the bear market rally is still on .
The Dow rose 44 points on Friday .
Oil closed at $ 53 .
The dollar is still sinking .
And gold lost $ 3 to end the day ’s trading at $ 888 .
Thirty - two banks have shut down so far this year in the United States .
Little , mismanaged banks go broke .
But big , mismanaged banks get federal money .
With these subsidies and bailouts , the big banks get larger … and live to foul - up another day .
Poor Warren Buffett seemed a little discouraged at his annual shareholders ’ fest in Omaha .
He must be nearing the end of his career .
And consumers just are n’t buying as much furniture , cola , and candy as they used to , he told the faithful .
Berkshire Hathaway ’s profits were 10 % below those of last year .
Swine flu seems to be disappearing from the front pages .
Has it gone the way of Y2 K and terrorism ?
Has another great disaster been averted ?
Might be too early to tell …
Oh you doomers and gloomers , cheer up !
There ’s always some other disaster waiting for a headline .
How about this ?
The Seattle Times looks at Las Vegas and sees what it calls “ the next global crisis . ”
After 10 years of drought , Las Vegas is running out of water .
The city fathers are thinking of all sorts of solutions – except , of course , for the obvious and effective one .
They ’re planning on huge pipelines … hundreds of miles long … and sucking water out of aquifers millions of years old .
But , according to the paper , Las Vegas charges only about a tenth as much for its water as Atlanta does .
The simple solution is to let free enterprise provide water … so that it could be priced correctly .
Colleague Chris Mayer has been following the water crisis story since the introduction of his newsletter , Mayer ’s Special Situations , in 2006 .
“ Water is not just a problem in Las Vegas .
The lack of sources for fresh water is a problem facing much of the American West , though the problem is particularly acute there and in the state of Nevada generally .
Nevada is the most arid state in the union , ” says Chris .
“ The tight water supply has implications all over the West .
In Arizona , you ca n’t build a residential development unless you find a ‘ designated assured water supply ’ that can sustain that development for 100 years .
I could go on and on about this kind of thing .
Suffice it to say , the American West faces a water crisis . ”
Maybe the increase in water prices would discourage people from planting Georgia - style grass lawns in the Nevada desert .
Or maybe it would discourage people from moving to Las Vegas in the first place .
But that ’s the thing with capitalism ; it does n’t take people where they want to go …it takes them where they ought to be .
That ’s also why people hate free enterprise so much .
Where they ought to be is , often , where they least want to go .
In the present example , people think they have a right to water – practically for free .
They think there ’s a ‘ water clause ’ in the Constitution that says government is supposed to provide them as much water as they want at a price they can afford .
Most things work better when they are run by private enterprises .
Too bad .
Free enterprise is out of style .
The days of privatizing are over .
Now , everyone wants the government to take charge .
What a turnaround from a few years ago – when people thought they could solve practically every problem by privatizing it .
And then , the voters would buy shares in the newly privatized companies … and we ’d all get rich !
“ For water , the really bad stuff has n’t happened – yet , ” says Chris .
“ As investors , it ’s a good place to be for a long time . ”
Now , over to Addison for a look at this year ’s federal deficit :
“ Panic over the financial system is no longer crowding out discussion of the federal deficit here in I.O.U.S.A. , ” writes Addison in today ’s issue of The 5 Min. Forecast .
“ Even the New York Times is noticing the deficit as a percentage of GDP will likely shoot above 10 % this year – a post - WWII high .
“ Bond investors caught onto this even sooner than the Times .
They ’ve driven yields on the 10 - year Treasury note to their highest since last November – above 3 % .
“ Ben Bernanke and Co. can keep short - term rates as low as they like , but the bond market clearly sees signs of trouble on the longer end of the yield curve . ”
“ ‘ The reality remains that the United States is struggling through the most severe post - World War II recession with a rather compromised credit system , ” writes The Richebächer Letter ’s Rob Parenteau , “ and the only sure area of rising final demand over the next year will be coming from fiscal deficit spending . ’ ”
And back to Bill , with more thoughts :
The proletariat began buying stocks in the ’ 80s .
The ‘ shareholder nation ’ was a dream of Maggie Thatcher and Ronald Reagan : Everyman a Capitalist .
Of course , these new capitalists were not real capitalists .
Instead , the little guys were mostly pigeons for Wall Street .
Instead of really understanding and CONTROLLING the companies they owed , they bought shares in mutual funds … or owned their shares through insurance or pension funds .
These collective investments left the little guys dependent on Wall Street managers – who paid themselves enormous fees and bonuses .
Of course , as long as stocks went up , the new capitalists did n’t mind or notice that the financial industry took advantage of them .
They completely misunderstood what they had gotten into .
In their minds , capitalists made people rich … and Wall Street helped them get in on the deal .
When Francois Mitterand , socialist president of France during the ’ 80s , realized how it worked , he was outraged ; ‘ they make money in their sleep , ’ he remarked of capitalists .
But that was just what most people wanted to do .
So , they began to imitate the capitalists .
“ Buy stocks , ” thundered Wall Street .
And so … the little guys piled in …. and stocks soared .
“ Buy and Hold , ” the pros told them .
“ Stocks for the Long Run , ” wrote professors of finance .
Of course , some people wanted to make money faster .
So ‘ day trading ’ became popular in the late ’90s .
The newspapers were full of stories of people who quit their jobs in order to trade stocks .
In the ’80s and ’90s , too , people began to believe that you could motivate workers by giving them “ a piece of the upside . ”
And the workers , too , believed they might get rich if they had a stake in their employer ’s company .
Especially in the financial sector , ‘ results - based compensation ’ caught on .
Soon , almost everyone had a piece of the upside .
The trouble was , especially in the financial sector , the upside was remarkably short - sighted .
In the near - term , business managers had a huge incentive to push the upside up farther than it ought to go .
Take risks ?
Why not !
If they could increase the quarterly results they would get a bigger bonus .
If , over the long term , the business were weakened … well , that would be the owners problem , would n’t it ?
Managers sometimes had such a big piece of the upside there was scarcely anything left for the owners .
Everybody wanted a piece of the upside .
Owners – including the new capitalists – wanted the business to prosper so their stocks would go up in price .
Managers wanted high quarterly profits – so they could exercise their stock options and pay themselves big bonuses .
They were all ‘ capitalists ’ – but ersatz capitalists .
None had much of an interest in the long - term health of the capitalist institution itself .
A real capitalist is eager to cut his labor costs .
If hourly wages rose too high … he ’d want to move to a lower - cost production center .
And if the managers asked for too much – he ’d fire them and get new ones .
But neither the working stiffs nor the suits shared the owners ’ interest in cutting labor costs and preparing for the future .
While European automakers shifted much of their production to lower - cost countries … GM continued to make cars in the United States of America .
Its unionized , stock - owning , voting employees would n’t allow it to move .
And when it needed to invest in new tools and equipment in order to make autos for the 21st century – suppressing earnings in the short term in order to make the company stronger later on – its bonus - seeking , option - driven managers would n’t permit it .
Lesson :
Let the managers manage .
Let the workers work .
Let the capitalists grub for money .
And let the politicians lie and steal .
Each to his own métier .
If you ’re wondering what that means in today ’s world , you ’re not alone .
We ’re wondering too .
Until tomorrow ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
If there ’s an advantage that comes from not being either a current MP , nor an aspirant MP , it is at least that I can ask a question like this without being lynched by the baying mob .
And I ’m not going to delve in here to the issue of ‘ cheque - book journalism ’ – everyone will have their own views about when it ’s justified and when not .
My personal view is that , though the issue of MPs ’ expenses is very clearly in the public interest , for the Telegraph to have paid a source some £ 100,000 for seemingly stolen information which includes personal and private data of MPs , their families and their staff is seriously dodgy behaviour , given all the expenses details they ’re covering were to be published shortly anyway .
But back to my central question : what has this past week ’s Telegraph revelations done for the reputation of journalism ?
Because amidst the appalling abuses , genuine scandals and likely frauds that our MPs have committed with our money , the Telegraph has also been guilty of flaky fact - checking , unfair distortions and disgraceful smears .
Inevitably on Lib Dem Voice we ’ve been primarily pre-occupied with those allegations relating to our party ’s MPs – in at least two cases , Andrew George and Alan Reid , we firmly believe the Telegraph should be printing prominent apologies for what were unjustified slurs .
As a result , my first instinct now , when I hear of the latest MP of whichever party to be ‘ named and shamed ’ , is “ I wonder if the Telegraph ’s got its facts right this time ? ”
Too many of their expenses stories have failed to stand up to even the most basic scrutiny that I find it hard to take any at face value .
( And I wo n’t reprise here the Telegraph ’s woeful failure to report a major story , ‘ Smeargate ’ , when it was right under its nose , instead choosing to copy ‘ n ’ paste a Number 10 spin operation . )
What ’s worse , though , is that the Telegraph allegations have been uncritically repeated , sometimes with further unproven exaggerations , by other news media – print and broadcast – scared to be caught behind the curve , and fearful that any attempt to question the Telegraph ’s reporting competence will come across as defending ‘ these scrounging MPs ’ .
Has the BBC , has ITN or Sky , has any of the quality press spent any time critically examining the Telegraph ’s allegations , using their own reporters ’ expertise to judge which are fair and accurate , and which have been ‘ lumped - in ’ for the sake of a headline ?
No , of course not – they ’ve all been too busy piling in , lambasting every MP mentioned , upping the ante still further to prove they ’re in touch with voters ’ anger .
Journalists have , it seems , forgotten how to challenge assumptions .
Instead of asking , ‘ Are these allegations true , where ’s the evidence ? ’ , they ’re obsessed with re-iterating this week ’s fatuous vox pop meme , ‘ Tell me how disgusted you are with all MPs , and how you ’ve lost faith in Parliamentary democracy , and that we should get rid of the lot of ’em and “ just start again ” ( whatever the hell that means ) ’ .
Caught up as we are in the maelstrom of the past week ’s revelations , it ’s impossible yet to discern the long - term impact on politics of the Telegraph ’s stories .
Perhaps we ’ll come to look back and view it as a form of ‘ Diana week ’ madness , in which truth and cool rational analysis were brushed to one side in favour of an emotional bloodrush of anger .
Or perhaps it really is the start of some form of anti-politics revolution .
More likely , the anger will subside but the impression that MPs and the current political system are rotten will endure , with a disengaged , passive - aggressive electorate – egged on by supine journalists – resentfully observing it all from the sidelines .
What it certainly shows is the danger of just one news outlet being able to command the monopoly of a story .
The concepts of natural justice and due process have not just been ignored this week : they ’ve been turned on their heads .
‘ Guilty until proven innocent ’ , ‘ no smoke without fire ’ , ‘ they ’re all as bad as each other ’ – such statements have tripped lightly from the lips of even the most intelligent commentators this week .
It ’s a depressing sight .
To be sure , our MPs have brought this on themselves , both through their sometimes crass and bloated claims , and by the repeated refusal of Labour and Tory MPs to reform the expenses system .
But that does not excuse the ugly and OTT response of the Telegraph and other news media this past week .
If ( as seems to be the prevailing view ) we really are better than our MPs , is n’t it about time we started proving it ?
That means allowing more than just Telegraph journalists to see the evidence ; giving those accused time to defend their actions ; and ensuring any appropriate disciplinary action is based on proven fact , not hyperbolic headlines .
Part of being a liberal is about championing minority causes : this week ’s seem to be natural justice and responsible journalism .
Danica or Anna :
Who ’s more Overrated ?
May 26 , 2009
OK , sports fans .
Here ’s a question to ponder while you ’re eating lunch ..
Danica Patrick or Anna Kournikova ?
The fiery car - racing goddess or the tennis - playing siren ?
For those of you who think I ’m going somewhere else with this , get your minds out of the gutter .
Yeah , they ’re both beautiful , and combined , they ’ve graced more magazine covers than the average supermodel .
They ’ve also made tons more money off the playing field than on it , which is highly commendable .
But I digress .
The real question is this :
Which of these divas has been more of a disappointment to their respective sports , Danica or Anna ?
Let ’s first take a look at Kournikova ’s portfolio .
She came to the United States from Russia at a young age and trained with noted coach Nick Bollettieri .
She won some prestigious junior tournaments and made her pro debut at 14 .
Two years later Kournikova reached the semifinals at Wimbledon as a 16 - year - old , and it looked as if her career was going to take off .
It did n’t .
She won a couple of Australian Open doubles titles with Martina Hingis .
Kournikova climbed as high as No. 8 in the singles rankings but never fulfilled the potential people felt she had .
She made headlines for who she was dating and was featured on magazine covers .
By 2003 injuries forced her into semiretirement , and she never won a Women ’s Tennis Association tour singles event in 130 tries .
As for Patrick , she burst onto the racing scene as a 23 - year - old when she qualified fourth for the Indianapolis 500 and went on to finish fourth in the race .
Later that season she won her first pole position .
Patrick showed she could drive just as fast as the guys during qualifying , but winning a race was another story until 2008 , when Patrick won at Twin Ring Motegi in the Indy Japan 300 , becoming the first woman to win an IndyCar race .
Unlike the tennis player , Patrick does seem to possess a strong desire to win , and she ’s not afraid to get in the face of a fellow driver when she believes she was not treated fairly on the track .
The difference between her and Kournikova is this : Patrick ’s won , and she ’s had more overall success than Kournikova did in her sport .
Citizen - Times
I am leaning toward Anna as more overrated in her respective sport .
Looks wise , Danica ca n’t even compete .

The author JG Ballard , famed for novels such as Crash and Empire of the Sun , has died aged 78 after a long illness .
His agent Margaret Hanbury said the author had been ill " for several years " and had died on Sunday morning .
Despite being referred to as a science fiction writer , Jim Ballard said his books were instead " picturing the psychology of the future " .
His most acclaimed novel was Empire of the Sun , based on his childhood in a Japanese prison camp in China .
I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings - up that went on
JG Ballard
Obituary : JG Ballard JG Ballard : Your memories Listen to Iain Sinclair 's tribute
The author of 15 novels and scores of short stories , Ballard grew up amongst the expatriate community in Shanghai .
During World War II , at the age of 12 , he was interned for three years in a camp run by the Japanese along with his parents and younger sister .
He later moved to Britain and in the early 1960s became a full - time writer .
Ballard built up a passionate readership , particularly after Empire of The Sun , a fictionalised account of his childhood , was made into a film by Steven Spielberg .
He said of his experiences : " I have - I wo n't say happy - not unpleasant memories of the camp .
I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings - up that went on , but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time ! "
His friend and fellow author , Iain Sinclair , said Ballard had developed into a major literary figure .
" He was one of the first to take up the whole idea of ecological catastrophe .
He was fascinated by celebrity early on , the cult of the star and suicides of cars , motorways , edgelands of cities .
" All of these things he was one of the first to create almost a philosophy of .
And I think as time has gone on , he 's become a major , major figure . "
' Ballardian world ' Director David Cronenberg brought Ballard 's infamous book about the sexual desires stimulated by car crashes to the screen in the film Crash .
He had a love of the ordinary and surreal at the same time .
He was extraordinary and remarkable
Andrew Motion
Tributes paid to JG Ballard
The film caused a media stir , adding to Ballard 's reputation for courting controversy .
In later years he wrote other acclaimed novels such as Super - Cannes and Millennium People .
Hephzibah Anderson , former fiction editor at the Daily Mail and books columnist for the Observer , said Ballard 's work had anticipated life as it was now .
" If you look at the start of his career , he began writing science fiction stories and we was regarded as very avant garde .
" And there was a kind of violence lurking beneath the texture of these novels .
And they 've come to seem less and less futuristic and you know it 's as if we 're embodying , we 're living in now a kind of Ballardian world . "
Meanwhile , Ballard 's publishers HarperCollins have cancelled the publication of his final book .
Conversations , which chronicled Ballard 's discussions with his oncologist Professor Jonathan Waxman , was due to be published in September .
However , the author became too ill to work on the title and the book was abandoned .

As an administrator at a cardiology practice , Bill Watermeier decided how much to charge for procedures such as nuclear stress tests .
Arbitrarily , he now admits .
First , he 'd find out what Medicare paid for the procedure .
Then he'd " double , triple or quadruple " that amount .
Later , he 'd review how insurers reimbursed for those services .
" I 'd see I 'd get full reimbursement , and I 'd think , ' I 'm not charging enough , ' " he says , now 10 years removed from the job .
" So I 'd boost it upward .
" That 's the way it 's done , " he says .
" And there 's got to be something wrong with this . "
It 's one reason Watermeier , of Bend , has joined the small but growing ranks of medical billing advocates .
The 12 - year - old Medical Billing Advocates of America now has 70 members , including more than a dozen who joined in the past year , says Christine Hudson , the chief operating officer .
Three live in Oregon .
Two of them set up shop this year , and all say they have as much work as they can handle .
No surprise there .
More Americans are paying their own medical bills today , either because they lost their insurance or because their health plan boosted their deductibles .
Errors , meanwhile , are common .
The Salem , Va. - based association claims eight of 10 bills contain mistakes .
I doubt the figure is that high , but billing advocates in Oregon say hospitals particularly are susceptible to making mistakes .
And the longer the stay , the greater the chance for error .
Watermeier , retired after 30 - plus years in health care sales and management , says he started his business , Medical Bill Review , after getting billed by a dermatologist for biopsy analyses he did n't request .
He got the charges removed after threatening to go elsewhere , he said .
He 's convinced the entire medical reimbursement system needs reform .
" It 's just a mess , " he says .
" And they get away with it because few people question their medical bills . "
Until the Obama administration and Congress pulls that off , Watermeier plans to work at least part time on behalf of bill - walloped consumers .
In defense of medicine , there are many good doctors out there who do what they do to help people rather than make loads of money .
And Medicare reimbursements -- the floor that Watermeier used to set fees -- are designed to be low .
The American Medical Association said last year that Medicare reimbursement levels had not changed since 2001 .
That 's why medical practices charge far above those marks .
But Watermeier 's Oregon colleagues share his concerns .
They 're wary either of the inequity in the billing system , the method by which doctors set rates , excessive spending within the industry or the many billing errors they 've seen in their careers .
Often the errors are a matter of humans mucking things up as they enter a code in a computer .
But consumers pay the erroneous charges because they do n't know better or do n't think they can challenge them .
" People need to be their own best advocate , " says Donna Bly , who founded Columbia Medical Review in Tigard in 2006 .
" They need to look out for themselves . "
On top of her advocacy , Bly , a registered nurse , works part time coding emergency room charts for a medical consulting firm .
Recently , a California man with newborn triplets sent Bly an 8 - pound box of medical bills .
He had good insurance but lacked time to even open some of his bills , she says .
Bly is bothered that the insured get steeper discounts than uninsured patients , who sometimes do n't even get offered a break .
In one case she called unusual , she got an uninsured client 40 percent off his Southern California hospital bill and half off a bill from his surgeon , saving him more than $ 16,500 .
Allen Patterson , who started Patterson & Associates Medical Billing Advocates in Salem in March , once worked as a clinical research coordinator at the University of California at San Diego .
He became disillusioned with the amount of money being poured into drug trials .
Big drugmakers repeatedly put him and other contractors in five - star hotels for weeklong stays -- all to get federal approval for a new drug , he says .
" These costs are being passed on to you and I , " he says now , " and to people who are uninsured . "
These advocates are n't free , and their fees differ .
In most cases , they 'll work on a small retainer to start and ask for one - third of the amount they recover .
Medical bills can be complicated and voluminous .
But it 's not beyond belief that consumers can challenge bills themselves .
A lot of information exists online now .
They 're simply unaware it can be done .
" I think to some degree it 's kind of like the fear of do you ask your doctor a question , " Patterson said .
" Our mentality is kind of stuck there to some degree .
We can't question it because they did provide a service . "
But if we do n't question it , these sloppy ( and sometimes unfair ) practices will continue .
You 'll pay for a physical therapy session or sponge bath you did n't get .
None of us can afford that in this economic environment .
And we can't count on the medical establishment to find efficiencies on its own .
" Because there 's so much money coming through , especially in a specialty practice like cardiology , you do n't have to be very precise , " Watermeier explains .
And , dare I say , when health insurance premiums have increased at more than three times the rate of inflation for 10 years , the industry does n't need , or deserve , the extra dough .
" If more people did this and put the medical establishment on alert that they 're not going to simply accept what they 're charged but they 're going to question it , then things would turn around , " Watermeier says .

Here 's how to contest a medical bill
For lots of us , contesting a bill takes guts .
Challenging caregiver bills after they 've just saved your life is downright ulcer - inducing .
But you should if you think something 's wrong or the bill is high .
To help , three medical billing advocates in Oregon offered tips on keeping medical costs down and identifying billing errors .
The strategies
Ask for a detailed statement : Federal law requires that medical providers give you this , advocates say .
But they often do n't , especially if you 're covered by insurance .
Without it , you wo n't know what to contest .
Make sure your insurer covers procedures beforehand : Some wo n't , or they 'll require pre-authorization .
This is especially true for nonemergency measures , such as laser - eye surgery .
Ask for the codes , especially for nonemergency procedures and before you 're treated .
Ask your caregiver or hospital for the billing and diagnostic codes for the services they provide .
Find out how much you 'll be charged for each .
Then call your insurer and see how much it usually pays for the service represented by the code .
Medical billing advocate Bill Watermeier says you can simply ask , " Would you mind giving me the CPT code and the ICD - 9 and I 'll call my insurance company ? "
( See a fuller description of the codes below . )
That will help you determine how much you could be paying out of pocket -- particularly in the case of elective procedures .
You may be able to negotiate the difference .
Just remember , warns Donna Bly , another advocate : Caregivers might not know all the codes they 'll end up using , especially if complications arrive .
Wait to pay any questionable bill : " If you have n't paid , it 's a lot easier than trying to get a refund , " said Watermeier .
" Because then you can negotiate . "
Shop around : Compare prices for surgeries or procedures at other hospitals or practices beforehand .
Such information also comes in handy when challenging your bill .
Plead your situation : Explain any financial duress you 're under , from a job loss or unforeseen medical shock .
" Sometimes that helps , and sometimes it doesn't , " Bly says .
Watch for excess charges for supplies :
If you got charged for time in an operating room , you should not also be charged for supplies such as lap sponges , Bly says .
They 're supposed to be covered in the operating room charge .
Talk to the right person :
At a practice , ask for the billing department .
At a hospital , ask for accounting or the business office .
Pay a visit to them before you 're discharged .
If you 're not getting anywhere , and you still believe you 're right , ask for a supervisor .
Appeal to bigwigs by certified letter : A friend did this recently with success after receiving a high bill for her delivery .
Her previous efforts at the billing - department level went nowhere .
But a letter to a couple of executives resulted in a very good settlement on her behalf .
Remain firm but calm :
Do n't get belligerent , Bly says .
Treating others as you would treat yourself often goes further than yelling .
Still , be firm and be persistent .
One phone call probably wo n't resolve your problem .
The codes
Getting familiar with coding acronyms can help you determine what you 'll pay for a medical procedure beforehand and whether you 've been billed correctly afterward .
CPT is billing or procedure code ( short for Common Procedural Terminology ) used by both private practices and hospitals .
It 's often five or six digits long .
ICD - 9 is diagnostic code ( short for International Classification of Diseases , 9th Revision ) three to five digits long .
Preventive measures , which many insurance plans cover fully , often start with a V .
HCPCS is an additional set of CPT or billing codes used by hospitals ( short for Heathcare Common Procedural Coding System ) .
Usually five characters long with letters sometimes attached , they 're used for supplies , products , medical equipment and prosthetics , Bly says .

Protect consumers from arbitrary interest rate , fee and finance charge increases and prohibit universal default on existing balances
• Require fairness in application and timing of card payments , such as applying payments to the balance with the highest interest rate first
• Protect the rights of financially responsible credit card users by prohibiting interest charges on debt paid on time
• Provide enhanced disclosure of card terms and conditions and strengthen oversight of credit card industry practices
• Ensure adequate safeguards for young people targeted by credit card companies
• Require tougher penalties for companies that violate the Truth in Lending Act
• Protect recipients of gift cards by requiring all gift cards have at least a five - year life span , and eliminate the practice of declining values and hidden fees for cards not used within a reasonable period of time
• Encourage transparency in credit card pricing by requiring a Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) study on the impact of interchange fees on consumers and merchants
Dodd , in a statement , said that the agreement reached with Shelby probably marked the final compromise he would be willing to make on the legislation he has been pushing hard this year .
“ While I expect some battles in the coming days from credit card companies and their allies in an effort to diminish these strict new rules , ” Dodd said , “ I stand ready to fight against any attempt to weaken the strong consumer protections in this bill . ”
I know that dozens of senators -- all the Republicans and most of the reactionary Democrats from Evan Bayh 's anti-Obama Bloc -- are trying to help out the credit card companies by killing the Credit Cardholders ’ Bill of Rights
Act of 2009 , which is similar to a bill passed in the House April 30 .
That one was Carolyn Maloney 's attempt to amend the Truth in Lending Act to " establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan . "
It passed the House 357-70 , with 105 Republicans revolting against their corrupt leadership to cross the aisle and vote with all the Democrats but one a mangy Blue Dog , Stephanie Herseth Sandlin , who is completely owned by South Dakota 's powerful credit card industry .
Most Democrats got behind the Senate version of the bill , the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 , advertised as a way of preventing credit card companies from taking advantage of cash - strapped consumers with abusive and predatory lending practices .
Specifically , what the bill is supposed to accomplish is this :
So what happened today ?
One of the banking industry 's most contemptible anti-consumer shills , Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , who has taken $ 900,422 in legalized bribes from the banksters in the Finance / Insurance / Real Estate sector , offered a poison pill amendment that would allow people to carry automatic weapons in National Parks .
Among the Democratic lemmings who voted for this idiocy are all the anti-working families shills , like Bayh , Baucus , Specter , of course , Begich , Casey , both Nelsons , the two idiots from Arkansas and the two idiots from Colorado , Landrieu , Hagan ... the whole sickening right - wing of the Senate Democratic caucus .
But they were joined by a gaggle of real Democrats too scared of the gun lobby to stand up and act for the good of their own constituents -- Feingold , Reid , Klobuchar , Leahy , even Merkley !
Only 28 Democrats (+ Lamar Alexander ) voted against this idiotic ploy .
I was already getting wary yesterday when I noticed that Dodd , the author of the bill ( and a recipient of more bankster money -- $ 13,238,806 -- than anyone else in Congress other than McCain ) was negotiating with the ranking Republican / bankster shill Dick Shelby to water down the bill and make it more acceptable to a tiny segment of society who should all be lined up against a wall and , after speedy trials , shot .
He did n't do a very good job of it today .

1918 FLU
PBS Airdate : November 21 , 2006
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON : With winter come fears of the flu , and sometimes the flu can be deadly , especially the bird flu .
You 've all heard of it .
It 's a virus that people catch from birds like chickens .
It 's already killed hundreds of people .
Fortunately , this bird flu does not spread easily from person to person , but if it evolves a way to do that , we could be in big trouble .
Correspondent Chad Cohen met up with folks who are trying to stop that from happening by taking a closer look into our past , at the most deadly viral outbreak ever .
CHAD COHEN ( Correspondent ) :
Whatever scary things are lurking in the back of your freezer , I 'll venture a guess you 've got nothing on Terrence Tumpey .
Getting into his deep freeze , at the CDC in Atlanta , is like prepping for a spacewalk .
Frozen inside , sits a tiny vial of what might be the deadliest pathogen in history , a virus that had n't been seen in almost 90 years , the 1918 flu—until Tumpey brought it back from the dead .
IAN WILSON : 1918 was the worst pandemic we 've seen for any virus , and this killed , probably , at least 50 million people worldwide .
CHAD COHEN : In 1918 , flu took three times as many lives as all of World War I .
IAN WILSON : So the question is , " Why was it , in 1918 , so different ?
Why did it cause so many excess deaths , compared to other pandemics ? "
CHAD COHEN : And could a flu that deadly strike again ?
We do know where all flu viruses get their start : in the digestive tracts of birds .
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
They just happily co-exist there , not causing disease , for the most part , in wild birds .
CHAD COHEN : But every once in a while , an ordinary bird flu changes .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : It 's a mistake in nature .
These viruses actually get out and infect other hosts .
CHAD COHEN : Hosts , like people .
That 's what scientists think may have happened in 1918 .
IAN WILSON :
The thought was that , in 1918 , the virus did cross the species barrier and directly infect humans .
CHAD COHEN : That 's one theory , at least .
And when a virus that begins in birds gains the ability to pass from human to human , infecting our lungs , spreading through coughs and sneezes , no one 's immune because it 's never been around before .
And that 's when a pandemic occurs .
We 're hearing a lot , recently , about the threat of a new pandemic , the avian flu .
It 's quite lethal , transmitted through close contact with birds , to people who work and live near birds .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : Fortunately this virus has not figured out how to efficiently transmit itself from human to human .
CHAD COHEN : Infected people , in other words , cannot infect other people .
The question is will they ever be able to ?
And if so , how ?
And when this virus does strike , why does it kill ?
Terrence Tumpey believes he can find the answers by experimenting with a flu that transmitted and killed very well , the 1918 virus .
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
By having this in hand , we can actually try to understand better how these pandemic flu viruses work .
CHAD COHEN :
There was just one small problem : the 1918 virus had n't been around for nine decades .
JEFFREY K. TAUBENBERGER
( Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ) :
No one had ever been able to study the 1918 virus , this horrible killer virus , because there were no isolates .
CHAD COHEN : No living samples .
But biologist Jeffrey Taubenberger , searching through preserved tissue samples of World War I soldiers , was able to recover the 1918 flu's genetic code .
Somewhere , buried within , are instructions that gave it the ability to kill .
But where ?
TERRENCE TUMPEY : Unfortunately , when you look at the genetic sequence , the blueprint of this virus , there 's no smoking gun that tells us that this particular virus is lethal .
CHAD COHEN : Tumpey could n't find an answer by simply reading a recipe for the 1918 flu virus , he needed to experiment with the real thing .
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
We felt like it was important to actually reconstruct this virus .
CHAD COHEN : That 's right , he said , " reconstruct , " rebuild the 1918 flu from scratch , one of the most lethal viruses we 've ever known .
Using Taubenberger 's recipe and a technique called reverse genetics , scientists at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine added all the chemical building blocks in the right order and the right amounts , and it worked .
They created a living 1918 virus so nasty that when Tumpey exposed lab mice to it , they were all dead in just three days .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : I was quite surprised .
I did n't anticipate that they would die that quickly .
That was very quick .
CHAD COHEN : And it was just what happened to humans in 1918 .
Unlike normal flu strains , which can only infect high in the respiratory tract , the 1918 virus attacked tissue deep in the lungs , as well , and that 's a vulnerable spot .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : ... the delicate areas of our lung tissues , causing this extreme inflammation , resulting in death .
CHAD COHEN : The 1918 flu so badly inflamed those areas of its victims ' lungs that many died through suffocation .
And , as it happens , that 's just how the avian flu kills , too .
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
Those are important characteristics and similarities among the 1918 virus as well as the avian virus .
CHAD COHEN : So , these two deadly viruses attack similar parts of the lungs , but that still does n't answer the biggest question : " Will the avian flu ever transmit from people to people like the 1918 virus did ? "
Well , first , let 's back up a little bit .
How does flu infect us in the first place ?
So this is what flu looks like under a microscope ?
TERRENCE TUMPEY : Electron microscope , yeah .
CHAD COHEN : An actual flu virus , but for our purposes , let 's represent a virus by this unpleasant fellow .
For all his nastiness , he is n't all that complex .
In fact , he only has eight genes .
We , by comparison , have more than 20,000 .
We 're going to look at two of these eight flu genes : one , because it 's responsible for getting the virus into a cell , and the other , for getting it out again .
Flu gets into cells with the " hemagglutinin " gene .
IAN WILSON : So , in order to penetrate cells , you could imagine that the hemagglutinin was sort of like a key .
CHAD COHEN : A key , which we 'll refer to simply as " H . "
And that key unlocks the cell , so that the virus can get inside .
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
If it gets into your cell , it will take over the machinery of the cell and start making more copies of itself .
CHAD COHEN : But now the virus has a problem .
These copies are stuck to that cell .
That 's where the other gene comes in .
It 's called Neuraminidase , or " N , " for short .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : Neuraminidase is critical for release .
CHAD COHEN : Getting back out ?
TERRENCE TUMPEY : Getting back out .
CHAD COHEN : The virus copies use N to cut themselves free .
And now each of them , armed with their own Hs and Ns , are off to infect more cells .
In birds , there are 16 different kinds of H genes and nine N genes .
Every flu is some combination of these .
Humans have only caught a few .
The Hong Kong flu , which killed nearly a million people when it broke out , in 1968 , gets in with H3 and out with N2 .
So it 's called H3N2 .
In 1918 , the virus , which killed 50 million people , was H1N1 .
Now there 's the avian flu that 's got everyone so worried , and it has a new combination of Hs and Ns : H5N1 .
The avian flu's H key , or hemagglutinin gene , can open the lock between birds and people , that is , transmit from birds to humans .
But it still cannot open the lock between people and spread from one person to another — yet .
But here 's the problem : once it 's in our bodies , the hemagglutinin gene can change .
It 's as if it can fit the lock , but it can't turn it , which would be great , if it stayed that way .
But a virus 's genetic recipe constantly changes , or mutates , as scientists like to say .
And if just the right changes take place in the hemagglutinin gene , those changes could open the lock , allowing it to spread between people .
But exactly what are those changes ?
Going back to Taubenberger 's recipe for the 1918 virus , Ian Wilson and his colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute found the answer to what the 1918 virus may have needed to spread between humans .
They pinpointed two changes , or mutations .
IAN WILSON : Only two mutations were sufficient to change the virus 's hemagglutinin to adapt to human receptors .
CHAD COHEN : So could those same two mutations in the avian flu's hemagglutinin gene allow it to spread between humans also ?
To find out , they tried those same two mutations .
IAN WILSON : To our surprise , we found that , in fact , we could n't very easily change it with the mutations that occurred in 1918 .
So that suggests that it might actually be a little bit more difficult , and it might take a little bit more time , for an H5N1 virus to be able to adapt to human lung cells .
CHAD COHEN : And that 's good news .
The Scripps team believes the H5N1 , or avian , flu does n't seem to adapt easily , so that people can infect other people .
Back at the CDC , Tumpey is taking a different approach to find out why these viruses are so deadly .
Instead of experimenting with tiny variations in a flu gene , Tumpey is testing entire genes .
He 's looking at each of the 1918 virus 's eight genes , one by one by one , to see which ones caused it to be so lethal and which ones should be the target of new antiviral drugs .
He started with that H key gene .
He took one from his 1918 virus and put it in an ordinary seasonal flu .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : ... a contemporary influenza strain that does n't kill , and , all of a sudden , it was lethal .
CHAD COHEN : And when he did the reverse , took the H key from an ordinary flu and put it on a 1918 virus ...
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
The virus was no longer lethal ; it did n't cause disease .
CHAD COHEN : So all signs seem to point to the H key , or H.A. , as scientists call it , as being , at least partly , responsible for lethality .
TERRENCE TUMPEY : Well , there 's something very intriguing about the H.A .
CHAD COHEN : So intriguing that , now , Tumpey is planning to do something pretty radical : put the hemagglutinin gene from the 1918 flu virus into the avian flu virus , to see if he can create an avian flu virus that can spread from person to person .
You want to combine H1 , 1918 , with H5 ?
What 's going on there ?
TERRENCE TUMPEY : I think it will be important , as a set of experiments to understand how H5N1 works .
And by mix - and - matching it with genes from a virus that actually did that quite well , the 1918 virus , we are hopeful that we can figure that out .
I think , from a scientific point of view , this is the only way to understand how these pandemic viruses work .
CHAD COHEN : Tumpey is one of the few people in the world who has the clearance to work with a live 1918 flu virus .
TERRENCE TUMPEY :
So if we can figure out how to slow it down , studying this virus as a model virus , then perhaps we 'll advance our knowledge on the avian H5N1 virus as well .
Maybe we can figure out how to stop it .
CHAD COHEN : If Terrence Tumpey has his way , the virus that took so many lives in the past may help prevent another from taking more lives in the future .
“ Management ” is a romantic comedy that chronicles a chance meeting between Mike Cranshaw ( Steve Zahn ) and Sue Claussen ( Jennifer Aniston ) .
When Sue checks into the roadside motel owned by Mike ’s parents in Arizona , what starts with a bottle of wine “ compliments of “ Management ” ” soon evolves into a multi- layered , cross-country journey of two people looking for a sense of purpose .
Mike , an aimless dreamer , bets it all on a trip to Sue ’s workplace in Maryland – only to find that she has no place for him in her carefully ordered life .
Buttoned down and obsessed with making a difference in the world , Sue goes back to her yogurt mogul ex-boyfriend Jango ( Woody Harrelson ) , who promises her a chance to head his charity operations .
But , having found something worth fighting for , Mike pits his hopes against Sue ’s practicality , and the two embark on a twisted , bumpy , freeing journey to discover that their place in the world just might be together .
The Sunshine Coast Regional Council on the south - east Queensland coast has been ordered to stop the clean - up of 8.5 kilometres of beaches that have been coated in fuel oil that leaked from a cargo ship .
The ABC has learned that Maritime Safety Queensland ( MSQ ) has told the council it is inappropriate to use machinery on the beach to clean up the oil slick and that staff should use hand tools .
Sunshine Coast Mayor Bob Abbot says he cannot understand the ruling .
" We 're just thinking that 's a bit ridiculous , " he said .
" We can't see the reasons for that , so we 're waiting for further instructions now .
" There 's no way breathing that we 're going to get 8.5 kilometres of beach that we know about now cleaned with shovels and rakes . "
Earlier , the council 's Andrew Ryan said two trucks , an excavator and a front - end loader were being used to clean up part of the oil spill on Marcoola Beach .
" The loader and the excavator are basically skimming up the sand that 's got the oil in it and taking that by trucks , the large articulated trucks , to a stockpile site just in Mudjimba , " he said .
" That 's going to have a plastic lining underneath and that 'll be stockpiled there for the short - term and MSQ need to tell us where they wish to take that to . "
Disaster spreading
MSQ says it will take more than a week to clean up the spill , which leaked from cargo ship the Pacific Adventurer in heavy seas off Stradbroke Island yesterday .
The spill is worse than first thought , with authorities confirming oil has been found on another two Sunshine Coast beaches .
Oil has spread to Wurtulla Beach near Caloundra and Mudjimba Beach next to Marcoola Beach , which is one of the worst - affected areas .
Rough conditions spread the slick from Moreton Island to the Sunshine Coast .
MSQ says charges may be laid against the owner and the captain of the cargo ship .
MSQ's Captain John Watkinson says an investigation into the incident has begun .
" Some of the questions that we 'll be asking [ are ] whether the containers were lashed properly [ and ] whether they were stowed properly , " he said .
Captain Watkinson says 31 containers of ammonium nitrate lost overboard are still missing .
" Some of them can float but I think in the sea conditions in all likelihood they 've found their way to the bottom , " he said .
The shipping company could face fines up to $ 1.5 million .
Clean-up
The clean - up operation is expected to cost about $ 100,000 a day , but State Transport Minister John Mickel says there will be no cost to taxpayers .
" The full cost of this will be met where the ship 's insurers pick up the cost of that , " he said .
Queensland Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg says Mr Mickel must follow through on his commitment that no public money will be spent to clean up the spill .
" The [ Liberal National Party 's ] position is that the EPA have responded appropriately , " he said .
" What we now need to know is that the ship owners and the insurers will be responsible for the clean - up costs and not Queensland taxpayers . "
Clean - up crews are using rakes and shovels to remove oil residue from beaches .
Reefs and wildlife
Along with the beaches , reefs and wildlife have also been covered in the oil .
Trevor Hassard from Tanglalooma Resort on Moreton Island says the oil is threatening a turtle rookery on the island 's east coast .
" The potential for this to become an absolute disaster is really right there , " he said .
But authorities say at this stage no marine animals have been killed .
Red jasper cored from layers 3.46 billion years old suggests that not only did the oceans contain abundant oxygen then , but that the atmosphere was as oxygen rich as it is today , according to geologists .
This jasper or hematite - rich chert formed in ways similar to the way this rock forms around hydrothermal vents in the deep oceans today .
" Many people have assumed that the hematite in ancient rocks formed by the oxidation of siderite in the modern atmosphere , " said Hiroshi Ohmoto , professor of geochemistry , Penn State .
" That is why we wanted to drill deeper , below the water table and recover unweathered rocks . "
The researchers drilled diagonally into the base of a hill in the Pilbara Craton in northwest Western Australia to obtain samples of jasper that could not have been exposed to the atmosphere or water .
These jaspers could be dated to 3.46 billion years ago .
" Everyone agrees that this jasper is 3.46 billion years old , " said Ohmoto .
" If hematite were formed by the oxidation of siderite at any time , the hematite would be found on the outside of the siderite , but it is found inside , " he reported in a recent issue of Nature Geoscience .
The next step was to determine if the hematite formed near the water 's surface or in the depths .
Iron compounds exposed to ultra violet light can form ferric hydroxide , which can sink to the bottom as tiny particles and then be converted to hematite at temperatures of at least 140 degrees Fahrenheit .

" There are a number of cases around the world where hematite is formed in this way , " says Ohmoto .
" So just because there is hematite , there is not necessarily oxygen in the water or the atmosphere . "
The key to determining if ultra violet light or oxygen formed the hematite is the crystalline structure of the hematite itself .
If the precursors of hematite were formed at the surface , the crystalline structure of the rock would have formed from small particles aggregating producing large crystals with lots of empty spaces between .
Using transmission electron microscopy , the researchers did not find that crystalline structure .
" We found that the hematite from this core was made of a single crystal and therefore was not hematite made by ultra violet radiation , " said Ohmoto .
This could only happen if the deep ocean contained oxygen and the iron rich fluids came into contact at high temperatures .
Ohmoto and his team believe that this specific layer of hematite formed when a plume of heated water , like those found today at hydrothermal vents , converted the iron compounds into hematite using oxygen dissolved in the deep ocean water .
" This explains why this hematite is only found in areas with active submarine volcanism , " said Ohmoto .
" It also means that there was oxygen in the atmosphere 3.46 billion years ago , because the only mechanism for oxygen to exist in the deep oceans is for there to be oxygen in the atmosphere . "
In fact , the researchers suggest that to have sufficient oxygen at depth , there had to be as much oxygen in the atmosphere 3.46 billion years ago as there is in today 's atmosphere .
To have this amount of oxygen , the Earth must have had oxygen producing organisms like cyanobacteria actively producing it , placing these organisms much earlier in Earth 's history than previously thought .
advertisement
" Usually , we look at the remnant of what we think is biological activity to understand the Earth 's biology , " said Ohmoto .
" Our approach is unique because we look at the mineral ferric oxide to decipher biological activity . "
Ohmoto suggests that this approach eliminates the problems trying to decide if carbon residues found in sediments were biologically created or simply chemical artifacts .
Other researchers on the study included Masamichi Hoashi , graduate student at Kagoshima University , Japan ; Arthur H. Hickman , geologist with the Geological Survey of Western Australia ; Satoshi Utsunomiya , Kyushu University , Japan , and David C. Bevacqua and Tsubasa Otake , former Penn State master 's and doctoral students , Penn State ; and Yumiko Watanabe , research associate , Penn State .

Mothers invest more of their efforts in healthier , more well - fed offspring Earwig mothers sniff out their " best " offspring and lavish them with care , according to new research .
The insects pick up odours from their clutch of " nymphs " and adjust their maternal behaviour in response .
When they pick up a chemical signal from healthy , well - fed youngsters , they spend more time nursing them , at the expense of their hungrier babies .
The study , which is the first to show this behaviour in insects , is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Earwig parenting , it seems , is about favouritism ; the standard of care drops dramatically when mums pick up the chemical signals from hungry , unhealthy nymphs .
In these cases , the adults invest less time and effort in feeding .
The researchers , who expected to see the opposite result , suggest that this could be " because the insects look for signals of quality instead of need " .
" These insects have a clutch of 30 - 60 offspring , and there is lots of mortality , " explained lead researcher Flore Mas from the Zoological Institute at the University of Basel , Switzerland .
" So there is no point investing ( resources ) in offspring that are already in bad shape . "
While communication via chemicals is common in social insects , this study is the first to show exactly how they have evolved to employ it in parenting .
Survival of the fattest
The team that carried out the study explained " begging signals " were well recognised in the avian world - hungry chicks opened their mouths widely and made specific sounds that were recognised by their parents to mean " feed me " .
The dyed food could be seen in the abdomens of the insects " So we expected to see the opposite of what we found here , " said Ms Mas .
Her team tested this signalling by exposing earwig mothers to odours from well - fed and poorly - fed nymphs , and comparing their reactions .
" We made a chemical extraction using the nymphs , " Ms Mas explained .
" They were divided into two groups - one group was given lots of food and one very little food . "
These two experimental groups of nymphs were then killed and dipped in solvent to extract the hydrocarbon chemicals from their bodies .
The researchers then used these chemicals to make miniature sensory chambers - pieces of nymph - scented filter paper placed in dishes .
Earwig mums , who were still feeding nests of their own young , were then put into these dishes .
" They were presented with the chemical extracts , or to a control solvent , for 30 minutes , and were then allowed to forage in a dish of food for an hour before being returned to their nests , " Ms Mas said .
The insects feed their young by regurgitating what they eat .
By dyeing the food with green colouring , the team was able to see the food in the abdomens of the transparent baby bugs .
Weighing the dish after the mothers ' foraging trips also gave them an accurate measure of how much effort the insects were putting into their foraging expeditions .
Gary Blomquist , professor of biochemistry from the University of Nevada , started investigating the role of " insect hydrocarbons " more than four decades ago .
He explained that the chemicals were involved in many forms of communication , including gender recognition , dominance and fertility cues .
He told BBC News : " It does not surprise me that an additional function , that of offspring quality affecting maternal care , has been determined for [ these ] hydrocarbons . "
But , Professor Blomquist added that when he started working in this area , no one could have predicted the large number of different and important roles that insect hydrocarbons would have in communication .

( CNN ) --
As the summer swim season starts Memorial Day weekend , water quality and health experts have a message for swimmers :
Please do n't pee in the pool .
About one in five adults in a survey reported urinating in community pools .
Although urine in the water probably will not cause swimmers to go to the emergency room , it causes " more of a respiratory , ocular irritation : the red puffy eyes or a cough , an itchy throat , " said Michele Hlavsa , an epidemiologist in the division of parasitic diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" A big health message is not to urinate or pee in the water . "
And it happens far more frequently than water - lovers would like to think .
In a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted in April and May , 17 percent admitted relieving themselves in a swimming pool .
Even the Olympics ' most decorated swimmer , Michael Phelps , confessed to urinating in the water to TV host Jimmy Kimmel .
In a 2008 interview , Kimmel asked the 14 - gold medal winner , " You pee in the pool , true ? "
" Yeah , " Phelps replied .
" Which nationality pees in the pool the most ? " Kimmel asked .
" Probably Americans , " Phelps said .
" Oh , so we 're number one in that too , " Kimmel quipped .
Pool Etiquette
Don't swim when you have diarrhea
Avoid swallowing pool water
Shower before swimming
Wash your hands after using toilet or changing diapers
Take children on bathroom breaks or check diapers often
Change diapers in bathroom and not at poolside

Sometimes , an indoor swimming pool will emit a strong chemical smell .
The swimmers have coughs or red , stinging eyes after emerging from the pool .
Usually those symptoms get dismissed as the effects of chlorine , but their causes are something more organic .
When swimmers sweat or urinate in the pool water , the bodily fluids combine with the chlorine .
It creates chloramines , which causes the strange odor and the eye and respiratory irritations for swimmers , according to the CDC .
No matter how discreet the act may be , " you 're contaminating the pool .
Let 's face it , " said Linda Golodner , the vice chairwoman of the Water Quality and Health Council .
The survey released by Golodner 's group , which advises the American Chemistry Council , found that 11 percent of the surveyed adults said they have swum with a runny nose , 7 percent with an exposed rash or cut and 1 percent when ill with diarrhea .
The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
The most common recreational water illness is spread through diarrhea .
One of the most persistent problems is Cryptosporidium , a parasite that causes diarrhea and can be found in infected stools .
" With Crypto , if you have diarrhea , it 's very watery , " Hlavsa said .
" It 's not a formed stool sitting in the pool or floating on top .
It could be very watery , and no one [ in a pool ] would know . "
During the past two decades , Crypto has become one of the most common causes of waterborne illness .
Unlike E. coli and salmonella , Crypto can resist chlorine .
In 2007 , the parasite sickened more than 1,200 people who had visited recreational water facilities in Utah .
According to the CDC , if someone swallows water that has been contaminated with feces , he or she may become sick even if very little water is consumed .
The agency also recommends that people shower before a swim , because most people have traces of feces on their bottoms , which can contaminate recreational water .
In the Water Quality survey , 35 percent reported skipping a shower before swimming .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Avoid health risks with kids swimming
Recreational water illnesses have been on the rise for the past two decades , according to the CDC .
From 2005 to 2006 , the agency reported 78 outbreaks of recreational water illnesses associated with swimming pools , water parks , hot tubs , lakes , rivers and oceans that affected 4,412 people and resulted in 116 hospitalizations and five deaths .
Melanie Arthur , a mother of two in The Woodlands , Texas , maintains a swimming pool where her children play .
" We are going to great lengths to train our 3 - year - old to not go potty in the pool but to get out and go inside the house , " Arthur said .
" After maintaining our own pool , I hesitate to go to public pools .
I am certain that they are not nearly as clean as my own . "
Just practice good hygiene when going for a swim , Hlavsa advised .
" It 's all about balancing risks , " she said .
" We think swimming is a great way to be physically active with family and friends . "

And remember , if you pee in the pool , you have to swim in it , too .
Here are tips to make sure the pool is clean :
• Look at the pool to see whether it 's clean and clear , and the drain is visible .
• Listen for pool equipment , because the pool pumps and filters should make noise .
• Feel the tiles and pool sides .
They should not be sticky or slippery .
• Beware of a strong chemical odor .
A well - chlorinated pool has little odor .

Professional fatuous windbag Preston Galla , in Lenovo : Linux has no future on netbooks , suggests that Windows 7 will be the end of Linux popularity on netbooks .
He raises a few issues that prompt me to ask what people use for the basis of their complaints .
Are Linux - based systems somehow incapable of improving ?
I ’ve long said that Windows 7 may mean the death knell of Linux on netbooks
In case you have n’t been paying attention , Windows 7 is n’t finished yet .
It ’s still in development .
All the things people are saying about what MS Windows 7 can do are based on Microsoft ’s promises , and not on a finished system .
Do you remember all the great stuff Longhorn was going to do , including a revolutionary new filesystem ?
Years later , Vista came out ( the supposed culmination of more than half a decade of Longhorn development ) , and it still does n’t have most of what was promised .
Speaking of filesystems , Microsoft promised a filesystem that did n’t need defragmenting about fifteen years ago !
Y’know who has filesystems that do n’t need defragmenting ?
FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD , and Linux - based systems all have such filesystems .
MS Windows , on the other hand , still does n’t .
What makes all the promises about Windows 7 any different ?
Why will these promises come true , be fulfilled , and According To Prophecy bring about the downfall of Linux - based systems on netbooks ?
I have a better question , though .
Why — if Microsoft Windows 7 is going to improve from its current development state into something capable of drastically cutting into Linux market share on netbooks given the current state of Linux - based systems — ca n’t Linux - based systems similarly improve to the point where Windows 7 no longer represents a significant leap forward by comparison ?
Why do people assume that Windows 7 will be the only OS to offer any improvements when it ’s released ?
Why is it I can configure the system , but you can’t ?
Gralla cites Lenovo ’s professional fatuous windbag Matt Kohut , who said :
Linux , even if you ’ve got a great distribution and you can argue which one is better or not , still requires a lot more hands - on than somebody who is using Windows .
So , we ’ve seen overwhelmingly people wanting to stay with Windows because it just makes more sense : you just take it out of the box and it ’s ready to go .
The obvious question that comes to my mind is “ What are your people doing wrong , that they ca n’t configure the system to work ‘ out of the box ’ ? ”
Nobody ( at least , nobody but Microsoft employees and the chronically ignorant ) seems to be suggesting that most Linux - based systems and other popular open source Unix - like OSes are incapable of doing the things that MS Windows can do “ out of the box ” .
They just seem to think that , for some reason , Unix - like systems ca n’t do these things “ out of the box ” .
Okay , so if they can do these things , but they require configuration — why the hell are n’t they preconfigured ?
Is there any possible reason that they could not be preconfigured ?
Why are n’t the vendors preconfiguring them ?
Exactly how is software management easier on MS Windows than on Linux ?
Ultimately , Preston Gralla ’s big complaint about Linux on the netbook is :
Although Linux is generally easy to use these days , upgrading and installing software on it is no easy task .
Whenever I see a statement like that , I have to wonder what they think is necessary to upgrade or install software on open source Unix - like systems , and how exactly they think MS Windows does it better .
There ’s never any real description of what anyone thinks is better about upgrading and installing software on MS Windows , except in rare cases where someone refers to people needing to know how to compile software .
Welcome to the 21st century : compiling software from scratch is not any more of a common requirement on most free Unix - like systems than it is on MS Windows .
The question this kind of complaint prompts me to ask is :
Have you used a Linux - based system since 1998 ?
A group of Stanford alumni who took a stand against the Vietnam War 40 years ago met up at their Alma Mater over the weekend and in true style , protested .
Members of the April 3rd Movement marked their anniversary at Stanford University Sunday by calling for the school to sever its ties with Condoleezza Rice .
The upset group nailed a petition to the door of the president 's office demanding that the former Bush administration Secretary of State and National Security Advisor be held accountable for what they say are serious violations of the law , including the approval of torture and misleading the country by going into the Iraq war .
National Lawyers Guild President Marjorie Cohn and leader of the April 3rd Movement was at the demonstration .
" To have a professor as a tenured professor in the political science department of Stanford University who told lies to get us into an illegal war and who authorized torture , which is a war crime and violates our law , " Cohn said , " she has no place in the political science department at Stanford . "
Pictures on the IndyBay Web site show the Raging Grannies at the demonstration and a person wearing an orange jumpsuit and a black hood , reminiscent of the images from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal .
Last week , Rice 's appearance at the university made international headlines because of a confrontation between her and an intern for a political journal who challenged the Rice over the Bush 's administration of enhanced interrogation .
The video , shot by Stanford student Reyna Garcia , was posted on YouTube and has been viewed more than 100,000 times .
In the 6 - minute exchange , Rice tells the student that waterboarding was legal because it was authorized by the president .
From 1993 - 1999 , Rice was Stanford 's provost .
She is also a tenured professor of political science at the university .
She is returning to the university 's Hoover Institution as a senior fellow on public policy .
Eric Maisel , PhD , is the author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction .
His nonfiction titles include Coaching the Artist Within , Fearless Creating , The Van Gogh Blues , The Creativity Book , Performance Anxiety , Ten Zen Seconds , A Writer ’s San Francisco , and A Writer ’s Paris .
A columnist for Art Calendar magazine , Maisel is a creativity coach and creativity coach trainer who presents keynote addresses and workshops nationally and internationally .
His new book is The Atheist ’s Way : Living Well Without Gods .
In this conversation with D.J. Grothe , Eric Maisel addresses atheists who do n’t always find it easy to live as atheists , as well as religious believers who have doubts .
He describes how the atheistic scientific worldview offers more advantages than the religious perspective .
He encourages an understanding of the “ tradition of atheism , ” and explains how to derive inspiration from it .
He talks about how new atheists may cope with the loss of their church communities , even when they satisfy important human needs .
He details the “ main problem ” for atheists , which he argues is making meaning in an indifferent universe .
He talks about the importance of the atheist actively self - creating , being the hero of her own story , defending a radical individualism .
He talks about existential depression that atheists may experience , and ways to respond to this nihilism and ultimate meaninglessness in the universe .
And he defends the position that each atheist should be an “ active moral philosopher , ” and “ make his own ethics . ”
Batteries are attracting a great deal of cleantech buzz these days — a trend that ’s just spiked with General Electric ’s announcement that it will build a $ 100 million plant to make sodium - based batteries for hybrid locomotives and other heavy equipment engines .
With plans to create 350 new jobs , the Albany , N.Y. , project seems be exactly what president Obama had in mind when he predicted a burgeoning green economy .
And government aid it will get , with GE applying for about $ 40 million in economic stimulus funding in addition to a $ 15 million grant from the state of New York .
So far , the state and its governor , David Paterson , have been nothing but enthusiastic about the plans , which could pave the way for New York becoming a force to be reckoned with in the battery and hybrid industries .
Paterson has already been instrumental in funneling $ 25 million into efforts to draw plug - in hybrid electric vehicle makers to the region .
There has also been talk of cultivating a " Lithium Valley " for battery makers along the Erie Canal , according to the Wall Street Journal .
GE is no stranger to the battery market , having already invested $ 150 million in high - tech cell development in the last decade — but this is one of the first opportunities it ’s had to ride the government ’s coattails .
With the federal funds , the company could very well expedite its strategy to generate $ 500 million every year from its battery operations by 2015 .
But it all starts with this initial plant , which should break ground this year and be up and running by the end of 2011 .
The batteries it will produce are designed for hybrid engines that derive extra energy from braking , upping fuel efficiency in locomotives by up to 10 percent .
It might seem like GE is missing the mark by not focusing on batteries for consumer vehicles with this facility — especially considering how many plug - in hybrid electric cars are scheduled to roll into showrooms next year — but the company is n’t putting all its eggs in one basket .
It recently gave $ 30 million in capital to front - running lithium - ion battery maker A123 Systems , headquartered next door in Connecticut .
It has given $ 70 million to the company in all , amounting to a 10 percent stake .
If anyone involved in the plant partnership should be wary , it would be the state of New York .
Other states are not going to relinquish their battery and hybrid business easily .
Last month , Michigan — left battered and desperate by the economic downturn and the auto industry ’s bumbles — passed $ 300 million in tax credits for battery makers , luring them to Detroit as a possible replacement for ailing auto makers .
Incidentally , A123 Systems is one of four companies that has set up shop in that area to supply Chrysler .
Oregon has also made a major play for some EV action , pitching hospitable legislation and landing deals with Nissan , Mitsubishi and potentially Toyota to debut their zero-emission and hybrid vehicles there .
Wherever these projects set down roots , battery makers are sure to follow .
So , for all its lofty plans to foster a battery - churning mecca , New York has n’t gone nearly as far as its rivals .
It will be interesting to see if the state moves to do more , and if GE ’s new Albany plant will beget others like it .
The batteries it turns out may also have applications in boats and mining vehicles , and the jobs it creates will be mostly in areas of skilled trade and manufacturing .
The plant is part of GE ’s broader Transportation division , which will reportedly provide thousands more jobs like these as it grows over the next several years .
Miss M. :
What are your projects and general interests ?
Manuel de Landa : Generally , I consider myself a philosopher , although I dont have any credentials , I m more of a street philosopher .
I am very interested in the Internet because it is an international network of computers which organized itself .
A very good example of what processes of self - organization that is a very complex structure that emerged pretty much spontaneously out of the activities of many different people , each one trying to do something , but overall effect wasnt intended or planned by anyone .
So as a philosopher , I am interested in all kinds of phenomena of self - organization , from the wind patterns that have regulated human life for a long time , like the monsoon or tradewinds which are self - organized winds , to the self - organizing patterns inside our bodies , to the self - organizing processes in the economy , to the self - organizing process that created the Internet .
So that is my general philosophy and I am interested in the Internet because it is a very concrete example of what I am talking about .
Miss M. :
You are presenting a concept which is not quite standard , that of markets and anti-markets .
Could you explain that a little bit ?
Manuel de Landa :
The reason why the concept of self - organization is not very well known is because it is only about 30 or so years old .
It caused a great revolution in science in very different disciplines like physics , chemistry and the dust is just starting to sell and so we are starting to see what the consequences of this revelation will be for human societies .
One of the areas that will be influenced , in fact , that is already being influenced is economics because what we are talking about is here is order that has come out not because someone planned it , because someone commanded it to its existence .
We tend to think that everything about human society which has a certain amount of order as being the result of someone planning it .
For instance , the city of Versailles was perfectly planned up to the last little detail by Louis XIV and his ministers , and that is our image of what human society is .
That everything is on purpose .
There are collective actions and consequences which are unintended , and whatever order there is in those collective consequences that no one planned is self - organizing .
The clearest example of that is markets .
Let s understand them to have a very concrete image : peasant or small - town markets , a place in town where everybody goes and brings their stuff to sell or goes there to buy something , and it meets every week in a certain part of a town and it comes apart and then meets again the following week .
In those very specific places , everybody shows up and everybody shows up with their intentions : I go there with the intention to buy , or I go there with the intention to sell .
So a lot of what happens is planned , is intentional , but the overall effect , for instance the prices that every particular commodity happens to go by is unintended .
In a real market , no one actually sets the price .
There is no one buyer or seller who says ,  I want this to be the price of this . "
No one commands the price , prices set themselves .
That s whats interesting about markets , that they indeed provide you with a coordination mechanism with coordinating demand and supply that does not need a central decider , does not need a centralized agency that does decision - making .
Out of this centralized decision making order comes out .
This is not a new idea , of course .
Adam Smith , at the end of the eighteenth century , came up with the idea of  The Invisible Hand " which was supposed to explain how markets are organized .
My point of view is those theories are obsolete , that indeed , only with the new conceptual technology , that the new concepts of self - organization that have developed in the last thirty years can we understand how markets actually work .
So that is one way in which these new theories will affect our lives , allowing us to understand better how economies work .
On the other hand , another problem with original Adam Smith idea was not so much that it was too simple , but that it applied the term markets , to things that were not self - organized .
All the way back to Venice in the fourteenth century , Florence in the fifteenth , Amsterdam in the eighteenth , London in the nineteenth , in other words , throughout European history , beside these spontaneously coordinated markets , there have been large wholesalers , large banks or foreign trade companies or stock markets that are not self - regulated , these are organizations in which instead of prices self - regulating it , they had commands .
Everything is planned from the top and more or less executed according to planned , everything is more or less intended .
There is very little self - organization going on at all .
And indeed , these large wholesalers , these large merchants , large bankers and so on , made the gigantic profits they made and they became capitalist thanks to the fact that they were not obeying obeying demand and supply , they were manipulating demand and supply .
For example , instead of the peasant that shows up to the market to sell a certain amount of corn , here you have a wholesaler with a huge warehouse where he stores all the corn he can .
If the prices are too low , he can always with drawn certain amounts from the market , put them in the warehouse , and artificially make the prices go up .
When the prices go up , he then sells the rest of the corn at these high prices and he makes a lot of money .
But , of course , he is manipulating demand and supply .
He is not being governed by these anonymous forces .
He is not being subject to self - organization ; he is organizing everything in a planned cunning way .
And so , because economists use the word  market " to describe both , that is one of the main confusions I see in contemporary thought .
We need another word to describe these organizations that are large enough to manipulate markets .
A word has been suggested by historian Fernand Braudel and it is a very simple one : anti-market . "
Why ?
Because they manipulate markets .
And so today , in the United States , there is a very strong political movement , mostly by the right wing , and Newt Gingrich is perhaps the most well known politician in this regards , who are trying , as they say , shrink the size of the government , let market forces have more room to operate .
But , of course , translated into the terms weve just introduced , what they really want to do is let anti-market forces run wild .
They dont really want small producers and small manufacturers and bakers and printers and mom-and - pop shops to have more room to manoeuver and make money .
They want national and international corporations to have more room to manoeuver .
They want to shrink government so that there are less regulations to keep international and national corporations from doing what they want .
But if you go and study one of these corporations , rather than looking like a market , they are like mini-Soviet Unions .
I mean , everything is planned in these corporations .
The managerial hierarchies are exactly like the hierarchies in the Soviet Union : they planned everything , prices play a very small role and most of the organization is done via command .
Now , we used to call the Soviet Union a  command economy , " we still call China a command economy .
Well , international corporations and national corporations are indeed command economies .
They have very little to do with prices .
In the past they did have something to do with prices , because either their suppliers or distributors were little guys .
They had to deal with prices one way or another .
But since the nineteenth century , at least in the United States and I m sure in Europe , a lot of organizations had been internalizing : buying their suppliers and their distributors and making them part of themselves , kind of eating them and digesting them and incorporating them into their own tissue .
The more they do that , the more they internalize these little markets , the less will prices play a role in their coordination , the more the commands play a role .
I guess a good image for this that the United States is far from being a free enterprise economy , it is an economy run by multiplicities of little Soviet Unions .
Miss M. : Coming back to the Internet , how would you apply that concept to the Internet ?
Manuel de Landa :
Well , the Internet , precisely because it is a self - organizing structure , benefits in the first place small producers , in this case , small producers of text , since that is pretty much the only thing you can sell now on the Internet .
I mean , you can sell a few services , searching and Federal Express sort of tracking your packages and so on , but really the main commodity on the Internet right now is text and images .
So the Internet by its very nature , benefits small producers of content .
However , right now we are at a stage in its development for where anti-market forces are making an entry into the Internet in a big form .
Not only Microsoft , not only America On - Line , not only AT&T and so on , but all kinds of corporations have their own web pages and are utilizing the web .
So now you have advertising as a way of reaching consumers in a more direct way .
So the Net could be changed in a few years from a self - organized entity into a planned entity .
I dont have any romantic views about the Internet being able to resist all the forces of planning .
Self - organizing forces can be overrun by these planned forces because they are so gigantic .
The Internet serves a lot of functions , let s just talk about its economic functions .
At the moment that electronic cash and cryptologically secure methods of sending credit card numbers becomes secure , becomes established , becomes standard software , then the internet is going to be a place to do business .
So the question is how do we have to guide its evolution so that it ends up benefiting small producers of content instead of the people who already own the infrastructure : the telephone companies , the cable companies and so on which can also own the content - producing companies since they can always internalize them .
The content - producing companies , lets say Yahoo , which is an index - producing company , even if theyve emerged in a market way --- as spontaneous , entrepreneurial , and small --- Microsoft can buy Yahoo any time , any time they want to .
They havent bought them but they could buy them .
And so the question is that Internet is not protected by this in its self - organization , it could be swallowed up anytime .
So the question is what can we do not you and me -- but everybody who is involved in the Internet .
The thing is that in the next few years the transactional structures will be defined that is , what kind of transactions will happen over the Internet .
To give you a very concrete example , if the standards that are settled are such that the minimum transaction is five dollars per transaction , much like there is a minimum transaction for credit cards now , that will benefit large producers of content .
The only way it will benefit small producers of content , independent freelance writers and so on , is by making the minimum transaction very very small .
We need to make the infrastructure of the Internet and the software that be running these transactions be capable of tracking one - cent transactions so that the small producers of content can sell one page of their essays .
So you can have your home page and people dont have to buy your whole essay in advance .
They can read the first page , you can charge them one cent and if they want to buy the whole essay because they are interested , then they buy the rest .
Again this is a very simple example and the minimum transaction that is allowed by the software the standards will be decided in two or three years and they will be written in stone this is something that matters .
To benefit small producers you need to allow very small transactions .
If the minimum transaction is large , you will be automatically benefiting large producers of content .
So issues like this will be decided in the next few years .
Another issue that will affect the economics of the Internet and whether market or anti-market forces end up winning is the main scarce commodity on the Internet at the moment : bandwidth , the amount of information which can run through the channels .
Right now , if you have a regular modem like a 14.4 modem , you know how long it takes for every web page to come into your system .
It is precisely because bandwidth is scarce .
It is a trickle of bits that is going through this channel so by the time you get to your computer , it takes forever to refresh the screen .
For the Internet to become a place where content can be transacted as a commercial transaction , bandwidth needs to be plenty .
The more bandwidth there is , the more complicated your documents can be and the more complicated the kinds of services you can offer over the Internet .
Right now , the amount and the kinds of services you can offer are very limited by the bandwidth .
So bandwidth is a key issue .
Now there are several forms of bringing cheap bandwidth .
There is one formtelephone companies own a very large portion of the fiber - optic cables that are underneath much of the United States and large parts of Europe , too .
Fiber - optics as opposed to copper cables , can transmit an enormous amount of bits , and all kinds of parallel channels at the same time .
So , yes , fiber - optics is one solution to the bandwidth problem .
But , now , how do we use it ?
One solution would be and this was proposed by a right - wing economist is to let gigantic telephone companies who own the fiber - optic cables to merge together and with cable companies which own the copper which goes from end of the fiber to the home .
Right now , the telephone companies own one part of the thing , the cable companies own another part , and if we allow them to come together into a hugh anti-market institution , they would give us cheap bandwidth .
But what price ?
At a price that one anti-market institution would own the entire infrastructure of the Internet .
That would not be good .
Because at one time in the future when they would want to , they could make the Internet asymmetric to allow more bits into your computer than you can let out .
Right now the Internet is pretty much symmetric : you can consume bits but you can produce bits and that is what makes it unique , that it is a two - way system as opposed to television which is a one - way channel .
The telephone companies and the cable companies could pretty much own the infrastructure of the Internet and at any point they want to , they could change it into an asymmetric design in which there are more bits coming in for you to consume and again they transform it again into a consumer mediaand very few bit go out so if you wanted to produce , you could produce but painfully .
So , obviously , thats not the right way of getting cheap bandwidth .
The best way to get cheap bandwidth is for the government to force telephone companies to rent fiber - optic space to independent little companies .
This is something the government is going to have to understand that a big monopoly made up of a fusion of telephone companies and cable companies would simply become a gigantic entity that would become a powerful company which would be more powerful than the government itself .
The only way to dissipate this danger is precisely by letting the small producers of content rent their own space in these fiber - optics things by forcing telephone companies to rent it out .
So they still would own it but they would not control it .
We would then be able to get cheap bandwidth without the danger of this one huge monolithic company owning the guts of the Internet .
Miss M. :
But looking at the situation now , we are already confronted with gigantic monopolies on the Internet .
One example , Microsoft , who are now developing their own Internet browser , their own web browser , and Netscape , who were for some time looked at as the  good ones " because they were not Microsoft , are now becoming the  bad ones " because they are starting to monopolize as well .
We already have the monopolies .
Manuel de Landa : Yes , absolutely .
I had said in the beginning that we are at a threshold now where anti-market forces are about to enter big - time into the Internet .
The question is whether the all the grass - roots parts of the Internet will thrive on it , whether the mostly grass - roots network of bulletin boards or whether the different European parts of the Internet are robust enough , are strong enough to resist the attack .
I do not believe that because Microsoft is extremely powerful necessarily means that it will win the war .
It certainly has more chances of winning it than any one of us has , but the question is whether those areas of the Internet which were of grass - roots origins will be able to stay there and sustain the spontaneity and originality of the Net .
And whether Microsoft Network will simply become kind of a fancy neighborhood like America On - Line , where they have doors to the Internet but are not really owning the Internet .
On the other hand , what could happen is that what we know as the Internet will become a sort of ghetto : it still survives but it is surrounded by the fiber - optic infrastructure of what they call the Information Highway which is owned by the Microsofts and the MCIs .
All the business and secure transactions would be conducted around there and one would be offered entry this ghetto where all the artists and bohemians are .
The Internet becomes this Greenwich Village where you go for a cafe where you go to hang out the hip people , then youd go back to where the newer fiber - optic networks are to do transactions , to do business .
The gain is not won by either side .
If we could manage to force into the standards of the Internet that small transactions be allowed , it would be a victory for all of us because it would benefit small producers of content .
that would not be winning the war .
This is going to be one little battle at a time .
Miss M. : I would like to bring in Konrad Becker .
You are proposing this theory of propaganda , that the Internet is a tool of propaganda .
How can we merge the two things , the monopolies on one side and the propagandistic possibilities on the other side with the monopolies controlling the Internet ?
Konrad Becker : I do see the Net as a propaganda tool , or as the controller of intellectual stimuli , in different ways and it has its origins in the military apparatus .
Hypermedia as such is an invention of the military apparatus to deal with complex information structures .
So we learn today that information as such is more or less a myth .
 Consensual hallucination " is the generic term for it .
The possibility of reaching people through networks are quite tremendous ; there is a lot of talk that the Third World War will be an information war .
We are getting to that point that there is non-lethal warfare , that is propaganda warfare to be used through networks .
Miss M. : Manuel de Landa , you are an expert on warfare .
Manuel de Landa : I can see his point very well .
Indeed , just the increase of enormous advertising you see on the Web is pointing in that direction .
Again to me the key thing here is whether we keep the network symmetric or asymmetric , whether the same amount of bits can come into your computer is the same as the amount that can leave .
If it becomes asymmetric , if more bits can come in than can go out , then its transformation into a propaganda tool is already a reality .
If it becomes a consumer tool and big producers of content simply send you information to consume , that s it : that is propaganda , that is a means of control .
It is much better than television , it is much more pointed .
It is like personalized television : they know who you are , they know your tastes , they may be even able to track and make consumer profiles out of your Web surfing , therefore put you on a mailing list for very specific people to send you information .
On the other hand , if the cables and the connections are kept symmetric so that criticism can leave the terminal as propaganda comes in , then we have a fighting chance .
That doesnt mean we will win the war or have utopia or anything .
What we can hope for is having a fighting chance .
That s what would make the game still interesting .
It would make it interesting for all us critics , for social critics to be engaged if we feel we still have a fighting chance .
I believe it all boils down to hardware .
If the hardware remains symmetric , and again that is not a necessity -- not something that will happen but could change , then we have a fighting chance because we could fight propaganda with criticism .
Miss M. : Konrad , do you think that being able to criticize is a remedy against propaganda ?
Konrad Becker :
Well , actually , that could be a trap as well .
As Manuel de Landa explained in his lecture , criticism is part of the scheme .
So it is easy to fall into that hypnotic situation where you have an oscillating paradox : on one side you have right wingers and on the other side you have left wingers and you are in the middle , totally snake - charmed .
I sometimes feel that propaganda is a secretion of a higher order .
It is natural for polar theoretical points to embattle themselves , which doesnt change the course of history .
To find means of escape from this hypnotic lock , this propaganda lock of the informational organism or info - body would be the way to go .
These heterogenic activist situation that you find in the early Internet is one of the very interesting points where there could be the window of opportunity to break the gridlock .
Manuel de Landa : I absolutely agree .
Right now , everybody and their mothers call themselves  critical " .
You go to New York City bookstores and there are huge sections of bookshelves called  Critical Theory " .
Of course , those theories are the most uncritical in the whole world .
They call themselves critical but in the end are so uncritical because they take for granted all kinds of assumptions , they dont really criticize themselves , and so forth .
What I meant when I said criticism as an antidote to propaganda " would be a new type of criticism that is much more theoretically grounded and goes beyond the fake kind of criticism , or dogmatic criticism , that we have become used to .
If we criticize the Internet by simply calling it a  capitalist tool " or a  bourgeois tool " .
That was a standard way in which Marxists criticized things in the past , attaching  bourgeois " to everything they wanted to criticize and , bingo , you had instant criticism like you had instant coffee .
Obviously , that kind of criticism is not going to do anything , and indeed has become a kind of propaganda itself .
I mean , you criticize to propagandize your own idea .
The question in front of us now as intellectuals is whether weve inherited so much bullshit and therefore our criticism is bound , is condemned to be ineffective , or whether we can find ways out or escape routes out of this and create a new brand of criticism that recovers its teeth , its ability to bite , its ability to intervene in reality in a more effective way .
Again , it would imply a collective effort of a lot of intellectuals who are fed up with what had been labeled as criticism in the past and is nothing but dogma and repetition , and come up with a new brand of criticism that is capable of fighting propaganda .
Konrad Becker :
The right wing idea of the  Invisible Hand " you mentioned is a good point to make .
And you mentioned the  commodifiers " on the other hand .
You were focusing more on the faults of the  Invisible Hand " than you were on the faults of the  commodifiers " .
One mistake I did mention was the trap that one could fall in .
Could you please specify ?
Manuel de Landa :
We need to distinguish true criticism from false criticism , or at least criticism that more or less gets it right from criticism that is pure dogma .
Belonging to the left , as I suppose we do , we are more affected by the kind of dogmatic criticism labeled as  leftist " rather than rightist " .
Most people who are radicals or who are artists or who are rebels in some way would hardly ever use the term  free enterprise " to talk about the United States .
We are not affected by that dogma , but we are affected by another dogma which is Marxist dogma .
Going back to the distinction between markets and anti-markets , the problem with Marxist dogma is that it fails to distinguish between self - regulating economies where there is no where there is no economic power and the anti-market institutions where economic power is the center and the reason for being of those institutions .
Failing to distinguish that means that , for a Marxist , the very fact that an object acquires a price , that an object goes into a market to be sold as a commodity is a bad thing .
Remember that Marxists proposed that the solution to our problems is Socialism and that Socialism is a society where commands have replaced prices completely .
But if I am right , that every national and international institutions are mini Soviet Unions , mini Socialisims minus the idealism , and that they replace prices with commands only on a smaller scale , then obviously Socialism is not the solution .
Socialism is indeed an intensification of the trend that is enslaving us .
When the Soviet Union dissolved a few years ago , people in Holland and Czechoslovakia began talking about the transition to a market economy .
Everybody was talking about how hard it was to make a transition to a market economy .
But look at what they were trying to do : they werent trying to make a transition from a planned economy to one in which many small producers dispersed .
No , they were trying to make a transition to a few large enterprises which were not owned by the government anymore but were still large , run by a hierarchy of managers with everything commanded and everything planned .
In other words , they were trying to imitate the United States , that is , they were trying to imitate an anti-market economy .
However , because of the dogma we have inherited , we accept immediately that their intentions were to go a market economy .
What I am trying to say is that one of the obstacles to think straight in this regard is the idea that the very entry of an object into a price system is a bad thing .
When you have an object , you give it a price and sell it in a market , it becomes a commodity .
The process by which an object acquires a price and enters a market is called  commodification " .
It really should be  commoditization " but  commodification " is a word that stuck in the Seventies .
But today it has become a cliché , a thing you repeat without thinking .
You believe you are criticizing the system when you say something has become commodified but , indeed , you are not saying anything , if I am right .
If we are supposed to distinguish markets from anti-markets , then to say that something has become commodified doesnt even begin to say anything .
We still dont know if it entered the market as a free commodity , so to speak , which will be affected by supply and demand , or if it entered the market as a manipulated commodity .
When we tend to think of ideological effects of commodities , we tend to think of planned obsolescence creating consumer products that are planned to break down so you have to buy more consumer products .
Or we tend to think of tailfin designs like in the 1950s , when they werent making innovations on cars , they just putting larger and larger tailfins .
But these kind of innovations , these cosmetic innovations which arent market innovations at all , but are anti-market commoditizations .
If we were to use that term in any way that would be meaningful , it would be to refer to certain products of anti-markets which are specifically planned and designed to manipulate consumer needs .
We would need to think of McDonalds burgers .
The moment you have a burger war on TV between McDonalds and Burger King , or the famous cola wars between Pepsi and Coke , that is commodities in the bad sense , in the Marxist sense .
Objects that have zero use value are nothing as technological innovations , they are pure cosmetics , pure simulacrum , pure consumerism .
But , again , if you trace those products to their source , you will find that in a majority of cases they come from anti-markets .
And if you trace every technological innovation , from the steam roller to all the little machines and procedures that were needed for the Industrial Revolution , electricity and so on , they will have almost always have come from small producers .
The majority , again .
Konrad Becker :
The subtitle of one of your essays ,  The Geology of Morals , " which I very much appreciated , is called  The Neo- Materialistic Interpretation " .
How do you interpret  Neo - Materialism " ?
Manuel de Landa : Obviously , I put the word neo " there to distinguish it from Marxist materialism .
The only good thing that Marxism ever gave us was its materialism , the idea that we need to explain things that happen right here without appeals to God , without appeals to Platonic essences , without appeals to anything transcendental .
Of course , Marxists , to the extent that they bought Hegelian dialectics , were never really true materialists since dialectic is not at all something of this world .
That was the good thing about Marxism .
Lenin , as much as I hate many of the things that he did , as a philosopher was not so bad .
He resisted idealistic philosophies in which everything is just our perceptions of it .
By saying that there is a material world out there , we need to take that into account , that not everything is information , that not everything is ideas , that not everything is cerebral stuff .
That there is also concrete fleshy stuff that is also very important to consider .
I call it  neo - materialism " because it is a form of the old philosophy called materialism but it is new in that , by incorporating theories of self - organization , matter and energy themselves without humans and even without life are capable of generating order spontaneously .
This can be seen in lava or in winds or in many phenomena in our planet .
For instance , a hurricane is considered by meteorologists as a self - assembled steam roller , running things through a cycle of cold and hot , running out of energy , and it keeps its shape long enough for us to name them we give them names , we ran out of womens so now we re giving them mens names .
We give them names because they are creatures which inhabit the atmosphere .
However , these are creatures that create themselves .
They dont have genes , they dont have anything that tells them what to do .
They are completely spontaneous creatures .
Now , neo - materialism means acknowledging that we have been neglecting matter for a long time , all the way back to Aristotle .
Aristotle already separated formal causes from material causes in his classification of causes .
It is a classification that has stayed with Western philosophy all the way up to the 20th century .
All the way back to the Greeks , matter was seen as an inert receptacle for forms and humans came up with these forms that they imposed on this inert receptacle .
This has certain class or caste origins because all the way back to the Greeks , the blacksmith , the guy who worked on matter or metals , lived outside of the city , spent all day in front of the fire , dealing with metals , and most importantly , didnt come to the arbora to talk .
So the citizens of Greece didnt trust the blacksmith :  He doesnt talk .
He doesnt come here and blabber . "
They were always slaves or ex-slaves , and manual labor , even if it is crafty manual labor be it women cooking in the kitchen or blacksmiths working with metal or folk artists creating objects was considered a secondary activity , a lower activity .
Intellectual activity was the real activity , to think with concepts .
Neo -materialism means to recover the feeling that we have been neglecting these people for a long time , that there is a much more interesting form of knowledge that relates to this skill to deal with matter in the kitchen , in the blacksmiths shop , in the carpenters shop .
To deal with representations and concepts and mental stuff is interesting , too , but is just as interesting as this direct sensual knowledge of matter .
This has a lot to do with the Internet because the people who created the personal computer and without personal computers we would not have the Internetwere Steve Jobs and Steve Wosnik from Apple .
Steve Jobs was the mental guy , and Steve Wosnik was someone who thought and spoke very little , was the blacksmith of our time , who simply had a sensual love and had a neurotic approach to chips .
He collected chips , he kept chips under his bed , and he created Apple though he didnt have an engineering degree .
He didnt have any formal training yet he created the first Apple II out of this sensual knowledge of electricity , of electronics and of chips and began the revolution , if it does indeed turn out to be a revolution .
So sensual knowledge is not something we left in the past , in the age of craft activity .
It is something that is still very much with us .
If you study the history of the transistor , even though it uses some quantum theories , it uses it after the fact .
If you see photographs , it is just a chuck of silicone stuff with things in it it looks so funky , so home - made .
It was home - made .
These guys were tinkering with matter .
They were trying to understand matter by tinkering with it instead of imposing a pre-conceived idea or form on it .
Konrad Becker : I agree that Aristotle has the position of a creep in history .
But is nt the blacksmith traditionally associated with the position of a shaman , the one tinkering but also tinkering with concepts in a way ?
He was also a psychedelic expert , as far as I understand .
So going back to the military complex , we had a discussion the other day where we noted that the huge American military complex is rather helpless to people who believe that if they take a bomb onto their body and go into a building , they will go straight to heaven .
There is something of immaterialistic value in there on a very practical basis .
On the other side , we see an immaterialization of economy as such from the basic fact that value of money is pulsed in magnetic highways through the globe .
What is the other side of the materialism ?
Dont it you think it is becoming more and more important ?
Manuel de Landa : Absolutely .
The moment in Amsterdam in the 18th century where paper money for the first time became as important as metallic money , there was a de-materialization right there .
All of a sudden , money became purely information .
Dollar bills now came to have value because of and effect of confidence .
As long as everybody believed you could go to the bank and get your golds worth of things , then everything worked just perfectly .
So I agree with you : on top of the material layer , we have been building these virtual layers one at a time .
Virtual money we dont have to wait for e-cash paper money is virtual money .
The more knowledge becomes an input to production , has become as important as the material inputs to production the energy , the labor , the raw materials that go in then knowledge is probably as important as those inputs .
So I completely agree with you .
My point is , rather than making matter and energy the whole thing , that they remain the basis for society .
United States and Europe consumes a much greater amount of energy in the form of electricity than theyve ever consumed in the past .
If you go back all the way to the Industrial Revolution , the increasing consumption of energy is a steep curve and there is no end in sight .
My thesis is that all these virtual layers weve built since the Industrial Revolution , precisely to the point that our energetic basis has become more and more important -- we became aware of this during the 1973 oil crisis when we became aware how much our entire society depended on cheap energy , being able to buy cheap oil from the Arabs .
The Arabs said ,  Well , no one else is going to sell them cheap oil that cheap , " there was a big crisis .
If everything had become virtual already , we would not have had that crisis .
It would have been very easy to switch to another energy source , or use our knowledge to do something else .
The point of the matter is we are much more primitive than we think we are , much more material .
This translates immediately to the fact that , for all the virtual stuff that happens on the Internet , all the web pages and links and so on , there is still all the hardware that forms the basis of it , all of which runs on electricity .
In other words , there is this material basis that is so humble that we take it for granted , because it is not the exciting part .
The exciting part is the virtual level .
But we shouldnt take it for grant because if our philosophy tomorrow is to get it right , we need to always acknowledge this material basis on which we operate .
The token material entity of current textual theory just to back track a bit the 60s in France was the great period of virtualization .
Everything became text .
Kristeva and Derrida and so on we just talking about intertextuality .
Even the weather doesnt exist , it is what we make of it , what we interpret of it .
Everything became virtual in a way .
Baudrillard say that everything is just simulacra , just layers of neon signs on top of layers of television images on top of layers of film images and more and more virtual stuff .
The computer games and simulations .
We need an antidote to that .
We need to acknowledge that weve built these layers of virtuality and that they are real , they are real virtual .
They might not be actual but they are real still but that all of them are running on top of a material basis that ultimately informs the source of power and the basis of society .
Konrad Becker :
What you were proposing in  The Geology of Morals " is that if you extend that metaphor further , you could go into dangerous waters .
There have been proposals along that line from various corners , from the Gaia hypothesis to the bio-organism theory .
Is there a certain point where you would say you wouldnt want it to be interpreted in this way ?
Manuel de Landa : Absolutely .
Dont call me Gaia .
The Gaia hypothesis is a very interesting point .
I am anti-Gaia in that it is such a romanticization of our planet , but beside the romantic aspect , which isnt necessarily that bad because New Age people are at least motivated for something , trying to save Gaia .
Perhaps that will have an impact on the ecological movement by recruiting more people .
We have very serious ecological problems , all of are material , none of which are virtual , all of which have to do with the fact that we never learned how to deal our material fluxes .
We know how to deal with the fluxes that come in , the water that comes in , the electricity that comes in , but all the residues and all the garbage and all the material fluxes that go out simply just go out .
We send all this carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , and we pollute our seas and pollute our rivers because we are ignoring certain material fluxes that are still operating of our material world .
So the Gaia hypothesis , as romantic as it might be to the extent that it inspires a few New Age people to become more actively involved in environmental things , it might be a good thing .
Philosophically , it is a terrible mistake .
It is a terrible mistake precisely in the neo- materialist sense because it takes the metaphor of the organism , it sees life , living flesh as the most magical thing that happened on this planet .
This is of course a chauvinism , a kind of organic chauvinism on our part .
It takes the metaphor of the organism and applies it to the whole planet .
Now the whole planet is alive , that what Gaia is .
Not only do you call it an organism , you also give it a goddess name just to make sure you are ridiculous enough .
The way out of this is to think that the planet is indeed something special , but it what Deleuze and Guttari called a body without organs , which is the exact opposite of an organism .
It is a cauldron or receptacle of non-organic life , a body without organs .
Because it can be alive in the sense of being creative and generating order without having genes or having organs or being an organism .
In my view , the very fact that the atmosphere connected with the hydrosphere can generate things like hurricanes and cyclones and all kinds of self - organizing entities means that indeed the planet , even before living creatures appeared , was already a body without organs , a cauldron of creativity , a receptacle of spontaneously emerging order .
Compared to the atmosphere , compared to the freedom of a hurricane , an organism , even though it is more complex and it lasts much longer , at the same time has more command components than self - organizing components .
The command components come from genes .
Your genes are the one that tell your flesh ,  You are human , you are not a dog , you re not a monkey , you re human and your shape is like this .
You dont have six fingers or seven fingers , you have five fingers .
If you have six fingers , you re a freak , you belong in a circus , you re not a real human . "
Genes are what keeps this flesh that s self - organizing and full of non-organic life from within in order .
And the genes are , of course , completely hierarchical , the genes within the cell obey the cells within the tissue , obey the genes that make up the organs , obey the genes that make up the organism .
We are like perfectly little hierarchical creatures which the command component is much higher than the self - organizing one , whereas the atmosphere s much freer , is really pure self - organization without any command component at all because there are not even genes there that tell them what to do .
And so to call the planet Gaia , to make it an organism , besides being romantic and kind of cheesy , is a philosophical mistake from the strictly materialist point of view .
Konrad Becker :
Yes , but dont you think that the boundaries between life and animate and inanimate matter is getting fuzzy and the famous virus is a borderline product where we are not sure if it is life ?
Manuel de Landa : Absolutely .
The lines are fuzzy but only when you compare viruses with , let s say , crystals .
Crystals also grow by replication , viruses also grow by replication .
In a way , a virus is just a fancy crystal .
But when you compare creatures farther away from the border , say , what we call higher animals like ourselves , you can see the difference with hurricanes .
The command component in the mixture increases with evolution and the higher you get in the evolutionary tree the command component increases .
We call it higher " but we are not any higher than bacteria , we just happen to believe we are special .
So to use the organism as a metaphor is wrong .
Konrad Becker :
But would you consider the possibility of non-organic life ?
Manuel de Landa :
Yes , I believe a hurricane represents a form of non-organic life .
It lasts long enough for us to give it a name .
It assembles itself .
It s not living in the sense that it doesnt breathe .
But to ask it to breathe would be to impose an organic constraint on it .
The thing doesnt have to breathe , it doesnt have to have a pulse .
Even then , certain winds do breathe , say the monsoon , the wind that is most prevalent on the southern coast of Asia .
It is a perfectly rhythmic creature : it blows in one direction for six months of the year , blows in the other direction for another six months , and every sea-faring people in Asia that made a living from the sea had to live with the rhythm of the monsoon .
The monsoon gave those cultures their rhythm .
If you want to go that way , well , you have to go that way in the summer , then you get there and you have to wait for the winter to come back .
You have to plan your life to that rhythm .
So the monsoon is a self - organizing entity , there is no command component at all , it is non-organic life , and it is a pulsing non-organic life .
It even has the beat that we tend to associate without hearts .
As it turns out , when the theorists of self - organization studied cardiac tissue , they discovered that you can take the cells of the heart , put them in a little flat plate and theyll keep beating .
In other words , what is making the heart beat is a similar process as to what is making the monsoon beat .
It has very little to do with genes , that the flesh itself can beat , that non-organic life has this breathing rhythm all to itself .
Have you ever imagined what would happen if we brought modern objects in the past ?
We go through the time and show people something great in the Middle Ages ( the 1400s ) .
In that era , inventions began to be made by humans , even the basis of inventions was developed into great objects that we always use now .
If the objects that exist in the future we bring to the past .
These 5 things will happen and maybe what influences the future .

5 This Will Happen If Modern Technology Brought to the Middle Ages
Code Name ARTICHOKE
By Hugh Turley
There are things in our history that most Americans do n’t know because they have n’t been told , or what they have been told is not true .
Unfortunately , some of the things are so disturbing that many of us would prefer to keep it that way .
Such is the case of the death of Frank Olson .
On Monday , November 23 , 1953 , Olson , a scientist at Fort Detrick , Maryland , told his boss he wanted to quit his job .
The following Saturday Olson fell to his death from a tenth floor window of a hotel in New York City .
Government officials told his widow and three young children that Mr. Olson jumped or fell from the window as a result of a nervous breakdown .
That story remained “ the truth ” for 22 years .
In 1975 the Rockefeller Commission ’s examination of CIA domestic operations was reported in the Washington Post .
The article said that a civilian employee of the Army had unknowingly taken LSD as part of a CIA test .
The Post quoted the commission saying that the subject “ developed serious side effects and was sent to New York with a CIA escort for psychiatric treatment .
Several days later , he jumped from a tenth - floor window of his room and died as a result . ”
Although the victim was unnamed and a number of things in the Post article concerning the death were false , the widow , Alice Olson , and her children recognized that the man in the story was their husband and father .
It was clear to them from the year , the tenth - floor window in New York , and the victim being a scientist .
The family states that it was also clear the truth was being suppressed because the victim was unnamed and no one bothered to tell the family the story was being released .
The family called a press conference and announced that they were filing a lawsuit against the United States government .
The following day , Dick Cheney , then White House deputy staff director , sent a memo to his boss , then Chief of Staff , Donald Rumsfeld , concerning the need to keep classified information secret .
The Olson family would later find the memo at the Ford Presidential Library .
President Gerald Ford invited the Olson family to the White House , apologized to the widow and her children , and promised a full accounting .
CIA Director William Colby then invited Olson ’s widow and her oldest son , Eric , to lunch in his office and gave them a redacted CIA file on Frank Olson .
In return for what finally appeared to be the truth , the family dropped its lawsuit and agreed to a settlement .
But they had been deceived again .
The facts changed to say that Olson ’s death was related to the infamous MK - ULTRA mind control experiments , but the conclusion that he fell or jumped remained the same .
Further investigation convinced the Olsons that Frank had actually been murdered .
The full story with links to official documents can be found on Eric Olson ’s website www.FrankOlsonProject.org.
In 1952 , Dr. Frank Olson was a CIA officer and acting chief of the Special Operations at Fort Detrick , the government ’s most secret biological weapons laboratory .
His division researched and experimented with assassination techniques , biological warfare , terminal interrogations , and LSD mind - control .
A family statement in 2002 alleges Olson ’s death was related to a CIA operation called ARTICHOKE that “ involved the development of special , extreme methods of interrogation . ”
The file given to the family by Colby contained references to “ the Artichoke Committee . ”
The family said that Frank Olson had ethical concerns after he “ witnessed terminal interrogations in Germany in the summer of 1953 ” and he wanted to get out of his job .
The Olson family eventually contacted Norman Cournoyer , one of Frank Olson ’s oldest friends and closest colleagues at Fort Detrick .
Cournoyer told the family that Olson joined the CIA in the late 1940s , and as part of the ARTICHOKE program made numerous trips to Europe where he witnessed torture interrogations of Soviet prisoners , Nazis , and others .
Cournoyer also told them Olson learned biological weapons , including anthrax were used during the Korean War , despite denials by the U.S. government .
Cournoyer repeated his story in a 2002 German TV documentary film , “ Code Name ARTICHOKE , ” which can be seen on www.YouTube.com.
In the past the Communist threat seemed to justify secret immoral activity ; today , terrorism is used to justify secret CIA prisons overseas .
If some official has a crisis of conscience will homicide be necessary ?

The researchers noted differences in two brain regions Scientists say they have located the brain areas that may determine how sociable a person is .
Warm , sentimental people tend to have more brain tissue in the outer strip of the brain just above the eyes and in a structure deep in the brain 's centre .
These are the same zones that allow us to enjoy chocolate and sex , the Cambridge University experts report in the European Journal of Neuroscience .
The work suggests that some people may get a similar buzz from being sociable .
It could also lead to new insights into psychiatric disorders where difficulties in social interaction are prominent , such as autism or schizophrenia .
For some people , socializing is an intrinsic reward , just like chocolate or cannabis
Professor Simon Baron Cohen , of the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge
The brain scan study was carried out on 41 healthy male volunteers .
The men who scored higher on questionnaire - based ratings of emotional warmth and sociability had more grey matter in two brain areas - the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum .
The researchers say it is not clear whether the men were born with these brain differences or whether the brain regions in question grew in response to personal experiences .
Pleasure zones Experts already know that the striatum becomes activated by receiving compliments and the orbitofrontal cortex is activated by attractive faces and smiling .
Lead researcher Dr Graham Murray said : " Sociability and emotional warmth are very complex features of our personality .
" This research helps us understand at a biological level why people differ in the degrees to which we express those traits .
" It 's interesting that the degree to which we find social interaction rewarding relates to the structure of our brains in regions that are important for very simple biological drives such as food , sweet liquids and sex .
" Perhaps this gives us a clue to how complex features like sentimentality and affection evolved from structures that in lower animals originally were only important for basic biological survival processes . "
Professor Simon Baron Cohen , of the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge , said : " This is an important study in showing that the degree to which we find socializing rewarding is correlated with differences in brain structure .
" It reminds us that for some people , socializing is an intrinsic reward , just like chocolate or cannabis .
And that what you find rewarding depends on differences in the brain .
" This research teaches us about individual differences in a typical sample , but has implications for our understanding of clinical conditions like autism , where socializing may be less rewarding . "

PyOpenGL 3.0.1 is pretty much finished AFAICS .
The biggest visible change is support for the OpenGL_accelerate module ( written in Cython ) which provides a noticeable speedup for my applications .
However , the fact that the code is C ( once generated ) means that bugs are going to be introduced ( including possible segfaults ) .
There are also a number of bug - fixes in the code since the 3.0.0 release .
So , if you 'd like to help out , branch the current head , compile the OpenGL_accelerate module and test ( or test without the accelerate module , if you 'd like to help with testing that version as well ) .
Particularly need testing by people with weird and exotic platforms , like Win32 or OSX .
32 - bit Linux could also use testing .

The FBI ’s highest - ranking Arabic - speaking agent is a ghost .
He goes to work each day , but walks the halls like an empty suit .
Fellow agents whisper about his loyalty and talk about throwing him “ off the roof . ”
Bassem Youssef , after all , is the whistleblower at the center of two of the FBI ’s biggest ongoing scandals : its rampant abuse of national security letters to access confidential information on US citizens , and its failure to recruit Arabic - speaking agents .
He ’s sued the bureau for discrimination and has been sidelined to a paper - pushing job .
Yet he wo n’t quit — he remains determined , he says , to fight the war on terror , even if he has to battle his bosses to do it .
It was n’t always so .
In the mid-1990s , if you were to call the FBI and ask for Bassem Youssef , the switchboard operator would tell you there was no such person .
Known in those days by his alias , Adam Shoukry , Youssef was a star counterterrorism specialist , one of only a few agents in bureau history whose work was deemed so sensitive that the attorney general allowed him to go undercover within the FBI itself .
Almost a full decade before the 9/11 attacks , he managed to penetrate “ Blind Sheikh ” Omar Abdel - Rahman ’s Islamic Group , which carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
( Some of its key members later joined Al Qaeda , which Youssef identified as a threat long before it was on most intelligence agents ’ radar . )
The details of Youssef ’s service during this period remain classified , but his value as an agent was such that , in November 1994 , he received the Director of Central Intelligence Award , a high honor reserved for the intelligence community ’s most skilled operators .
But after 9/11 Youssef ’s once - rising star came crashing down .
He charges that he was suddenly bypassed for counterterrorism assignments because of his ethnicity , a fate emblematic of a larger problem with the bureau ’s approach to counterterrorism .
Since 2001 , the FBI ’s budget has grown 114 percent , from $ 3.3 billion to $ 7.1 billion in fiscal year 2009 ; today , its 12,000 special agents include just 57 with even rudimentary knowledge of Arabic .
Only six — including Youssef — were rated “ advanced professional ” in the language as of 2006 .
By comparison , the New York Police Department has more than 60 Arabic - speaking cops .
The FBI ’s failure , Youssef says , is a result of deeply rooted institutional discrimination against Middle Easterners — a population the bureau should be recruiting in droves , but instead has largely shut out .
Though a pariah to his fellow agents , Youssef remains a senior FBI official with a top - level security clearance .
I spent nearly a year trying to gain an interview with him ; when the FBI finally gave permission , it came with the requirement that Youssef ’s lawyer be present to ensure that the conversation did not stray into sensitive areas .
( The bureau itself declined to comment about his case . )
We met on a cold , overcast day at the Georgetown office of Stephen Kohn , one of Washington ’s leading whistleblower advocates ( and Linda Tripp ’s one - time attorney ) .
Youssef arrived looking every bit the G - man stereotype : dark suit , black tie , starched white shirt .
Slight of frame , with close - cropped , charcoal - gray hair and brown eyes , he was easygoing and quick to smile , though his bitterness occasionally showed through .
On the way to a nearby restaurant , we joked about the public - relations obstacle course I ’d overcome to get permission to meet him .
Born in Cairo in 1958 to parents who were both accountants , Youssef grew up in an affluent neighborhood and studied at an English - language prep school .
In 1972 , when he was 13 , the family relocated to Southern California , where Youssef quickly embraced everything American .
He went on to attend California State University - Los Angeles , but his dream was to fly F - 14 Tomcats .
( Top Gun had just come out . )
He made it through the initial rounds of pilot testing , and even had his head measured for a flight helmet , but ultimately failed on account of his mild colorblindness .
( He could n’t distinguish a shade of green displayed on fighter - plane instrument panels . )
Youssef sulked for a couple of months before taking a friend ’s advice to meet with a local FBI recruiter .
A year and a half later , having passed an exhaustive series of background checks , he moved to Virginia .
Youssef became a hot commodity at the bureau , where he single - handedly doubled the number of native Arabic speakers .
In 1988 , right after graduating from the training academy at Quantico , he was assigned to St. Louis , where he joined a small team of agents hunting US - based associates of Abu Nidal , the leader of a Palestinian extremist group .
It was a heady time for the young agent ; he cut his teeth doing surveillance , making arrests , and conducting interrogations in Arabic .
As his reputation spread , Youssef says , agents in other field offices and at FBI headquarters frequently approached him for advice on their own cases .
Before long , he transferred to the Los Angeles field office , where , for security , he assumed the identity of Adam Shoukry .
It was in L.A. that Youssef achieved a major intelligence coup .
He had tried to obtain a wiretap on a terrorist cell associated with the Islamic Group weeks before the 1993 World Trade Center attack .
After the bombing , Youssef and his supervisors set up an intelligence - gathering operation to reach inside Abdel - Rahman ’s organization .
“ It ’s a very , very difficult group to penetrate , ” says one of Youssef ’s former supervisors , Edward Curran , a 38 - year FBI veteran who is now deputy director of New Jersey ’s Office of Counter - Terrorism .
“ [ Youssef ] did it .
He did it day and night .
He was out on the street , was taking opportunities …
He knew how to exploit them more than any other person in the office . ”
The specifics of Youssef ’s work have never been made public , but court documents suggest that by flipping one of Abdel - Rahman ’s key associates , Youssef puzzled together much of the Islamic Group ’s membership .
“ You ca n’t even begin to describe it , ” says Curran .
“ Bassem was the counterterrorism program .
He was the entire program . ”
It was no surprise when Youssef became the FBI ’s legal attaché to Saudi Arabia in February 1997 .
The previous summer , a high - rise apartment complex called the Khobar Towers , home to about 2,000 US military personnel stationed at King Abdul Aziz Air Base , had been torn apart by a truck bomb , killing 19 and injuring 372 .
Historically , the Saudis had been reluctant to cooperate with US investigators , sometimes beheading suspects before they could be interrogated .
But Youssef ’s knowledge of the culture quickly ingratiated him to his Saudi counterparts , who enjoyed teaching the FBI man the subtleties of Saudi slang .
Within three months of his arrival , according to an FBI report drafted in 2000 , Youssef ’s “ efforts led to the establishment of direct communications with senior officials of the Mahabith [ Saudi Arabia ’s security service ] which had previously been unavailable to US Embassy personnel . ”
These contacts helped pave the way for a first - ever meeting between then - FBI director Louis Freeh and top Saudi officials , after which the FBI was given access to all six Khobar bombing suspects .
Youssef , though , had moved on to another target :
He was increasingly troubled by the growing threat posed by Al Qaeda and , according to the report , became “ preoccupied with Bin Laden ’s current status and whereabouts . ”
In 2000 , after four years in Riyadh , he was given a post at the National Counterintelligence Center , an interagency task force housed at the CIA ’s Virginia headquarters .
But in April 2001 , program restructuring eliminated his position .
He was still waiting for reassignment on September 11 , 2001 .
After 9/11 , the bureau — mortified by its failure to pick up the attackers ’ trail despite multiple opportunities — went into overdrive .
It pulled hundreds of agents from its criminal division , even rookies from Quantico , into counterterrorism work .
Youssef ’s phone , though , never rang .
When he finally got his new assignment in March 2002 , he was sent to the Document Exploitation Unit , a team of low - level agents tasked with reviewing evidence recovered in Afghanistan and elsewhere .
A lower - ranking agent with no counterterrorism pedigree became his supervisor .
Stunned , Youssef called his congressman , Rep. Frank Wolf ( R - Va. ) , for help .
On June 28 , 2002 , FBI director Robert Mueller was called to a meeting in Wolf ’s office ; he found Youssef waiting for him .
The agent explained that he had tried hard to find a counterterrorism assignment through the appropriate channels , but now felt he had no recourse but to approach the director personally .
Mueller said he ’d look into the matter and assured Youssef that he would suffer no retaliation .
For a year , nothing happened .
Finally , in July 2003 , Youssef gave up hope and filed suit for discrimination .
As it turned out , the meeting with Mueller had sealed his fate .
Unbeknownst to Youssef , two days earlier Mueller had signed off on his request for a transfer to the International Terrorism Operations Section , the FBI ’s lead unit in the fight against Al Qaeda .
But the director seemed to have had a change of heart .
The transfer never came through , and Youssef did n’t learn of Mueller ’s move until years later .
Youssef ’s meeting with Mueller also appears to have ignited a whisper campaign about his loyalty .
According to an affidavit filed by one FBI agent , Youssef ’s colleagues gossiped that he was a Muslim ( he ’s actually a devout Christian ) , that he “ had refused to carry out orders … because of his religious faith , ” and that his time in Saudi Arabia had been an embarrassment to the bureau .
None of this was true , but similar allegations dogged the two agents who replaced Youssef in Riyadh : an Egyptian Muslim who was accused of refusing to wear a wire , and an American convert who had been Youssef ’s assistant and previously worked airport security for the bureau .
Much of Youssef ’s trouble securing a position after 9/11 may have stemmed also from the FBI ’s astonishing claim that neither fluency in Arabic nor knowledge of the Middle East is necessary for leadership positions in the counterterrorism division .
As Gary Bald , a former top FBI counterterrorism official , told Youssef ’s lawyer , Stephen Kohn , in a deposition , “ You need leadership .
You do n’t need subject - matter expertise .
It is certainly not what I look for in selecting an official for a position . ”
Others in the intelligence community scoff at such claims .
“ Knowing about counterterrorism ( say , for example , that most Al Qaeda operatives have a logistics team that prepares the way for them ) would help a supervisor ensure a proper investigation and avoid missing important aspects of the case , ” wrote former CIA analyst Dan Byman in support of Youssef ’s suit .
Michael German , a counterterrorism agent who quit the bureau in 2004 after blowing the whistle on his superiors for illegal wiretapping , described the FBI ’s position as “ indefensible ” and “ ridiculous . ”
He told me , “ You would n’t hire somebody to remodel your kitchen who did n’t know anything about remodeling a kitchen . ”
Today , Youssef ostensibly heads up the Communications Analysis Unit , charged with processing bureau requests to private telecommunications firms for access to client records .
It ’s a job in which “ my language , my background , my operational experience , [ and ] my liaison experience …are not utilized at all , ” he says .
“ I ’m at a point now where I ’m not even utilized in the decision making within my own unit .
Bosses will go right to my subordinates . ”
But if bureau executives thought that relegating Youssef to a desk job would keep him quiet , they were in for a disappointment .
Shortly after Youssef took over as CAU unit chief in early 2005 , he noticed widespread irregularities in the FBI ’s use of national security letters , a kind of administrative subpoena demanding customer information from private companies .
After 9/11 , the number of NSLs exploded , rising from 8,500 in 2000 to 143,000 between 2003 and 2005 .
Many were sent without any evidence linking them to ongoing counterterrorism investigations .
The bureau also sent out hundreds of “ exigent letters ” demanding immediate access to telephone companies ’ client records without an official subpoena .
Youssef notified his supervisors of the scope of the problem .
For months , they did nothing .
Finally , in September 2005 , the bureau ’s general counsel ’s office called a meeting .
According to staffers for Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , who has pressed for answers on why Youssef was sidelined so abruptly , FBI lawyers initially focused not on eliminating the abuse but on devising a legal work - around : the opening of a series of large , vaguely defined investigative files that could be used to gain access to the private records of US citizens .
Youssef used his position at the CAU to block the plan .
The following year , after word of the abuses leaked , Department of Justice inspector general Glenn Fine opened an official inquiry .
Youssef became a material witness in the case and gave several days ’ worth of testimony , which made him even more unpopular with his colleagues .
Youssef says one agent
Fine interviewed later boasted that he “ threw Youssef under the bus . ”
Another agent was overheard asking a colleague if he was “ getting ready to throw Bassem Youssef off the roof . ”
Historically , in its dealings with whistleblowers like Youssef , the bureau ’s instinct has been to go on the attack .
“ The Youssef case captures the cultural problem at the FBI , ” says Sen. Grassley .
“ It ’s an example of higher - ups and the bureaucracy spending a lot of energy and resources to kill the messenger . ”
Youssef knows there ’s little chance of resurrecting his career .
He stays on at the bureau in the hope of changing the culture by example — though that may be unlikely under Mueller , whom Obama has retained as director .
The counterterrorism division , he says , is no better prepared today than it was before 9/11 , and might even be worse off .
He invoked a M * A * S* H metaphor : “ There ’s an episode where Colonel Potter ’s horse ran away .
B.J. Hunnicutt and Hawkeye go looking for it .
They do n’t know a thing about horses .
Hawkeye ’s got this lasso , and he says , ‘ Anybody know anything about horses ? ’
And his partner , B.J. , says , ‘ I stepped into some horse manure once ! ’
Hawkeye says , ‘ You ’re in charge . ’
That ’s the state of affairs in the counterterrorism division of the FBI . ”

A POINT OF VIEW
Women who believe liberal values exploit their sexuality have something much greater to fear , says Clive James .
In a week when the troubled parliament of Britain continued to swamp the front pages with tales of fiddle , fraud and the incredible disappearing Speaker , there was n't much room for news about the parliaments of other countries , but there was one story in the middle pages that might have been calculated to remind us of why democracy really matters .
The parliament in Kuwait has just acquired its first four women MPs .
The price might have seemed too high , but at least now it is no longer official policy to rape a woman in front of her family
Listen to Clive James ' Point of View Kuwait is by no means , a perfectly constituted democracy .
As far as I can figure out , there is a ruling family whose Emir chooses the government and calls elections for parliament .
But women have now been elected to the parliament , by popular vote .
It should hardly need saying that this would have been unlikely to happen if Saddam Hussein had been allowed to continue to rule the country by terror , but let 's leave his awful memory aside for a moment , if we can , and dare to put forward a general reflection .
Democracy is the best chance for women .
Or if that sounds too naive , too pro-western perhaps , then let 's put it this way .
The absence of democracy is seldom good news for women .
Or , to get down to bedrock , if women can't vote for women , then they have n't got many weapons to fight with when they seek justice .
My own view , which I 'm ready to hear contested , is that this is the main reason why some feminists in the west have been so slow to get behind those women in the world 's all too numerous tyrannies who have to risk their lives to say anything .
It 's just too clear a proof that men have a natural advantage when it comes to the application of violence .
When you say that women have little chance against men if it comes to a physical battle , you are conceding that there really might be an intractable difference between the genders after all .
One of Kuwait 's four elected female MPs - Salwa al - Jassar Ideological feminists in the West were for a long time reluctant to concede this , because they preferred to believe that there was no real difference , and that all female handicaps were imposed by social stereotyping that could be reversed by argument .
But this belief was really possible only in a society where the powers of argument had a preponderance over the powers of violence .
And since many western feminists are still convinced that the social stereotyping of the West is the product of fundamental flaws within liberal democracy itself , they have a tendency to believe that undemocratic societies are somehow valuable in the opposition they offer to the free countries which the feminists are so keen to characterise as not free enough .
I have to pick my words carefully here , because this is the touchiest theme I have ever tackled in these broadcasts , but I do think it 's high time to say that if feminist ideologists find liberal democracy unfriendly , they might consider that the absence of liberal democracy is a lot less friendly still .
Helping to give me courage , here , finally , is that quite a lot of women are already saying it .
But they tend not to be western pundits .
They tend to be women out there , in the thick of a real battle not just an argument .
Why their bravery does n't shame more of our feminist pundits I hesitate to say .
It certainly shames me .
This importance of democracy , or at any rate of an amelioration of tyranny , should have become clear when , after Saddam Hussein was deposed , the first provisional government in Iraq included women members .
But it did n't become clear , because too many of our commentators wanted to call the provisional government a puppet government , under the control of the US .
Vote best hope Even as it became steadily more clear that nothing in Iraq was under the control of the US , feminists in the West continued to do a stunning job of ignoring the risks that women in Iraqi public life were running .
An Iraqi female MP could get murdered and it was held to be a natural result of US imperialism , almost as if she had been murdered by George W Bush in person .
But she had n't been .
She had been murdered by local men who were making an example of her .
They feared what she would bring : the spectre of women claiming an importance equal to that of men .
The late Pamela Bone holds aloft a Women 's Day special issue Last year the excellent Australian feminist journalist Pamela Bone finally died of cancer , but while she was still fighting it she published , in 2005 , in response to what she regarded as the thunderous silence that had greeted the stand taken by Ayaan Hirsi Ali , an article called " Where are the western feminists ? "
What Pamela Bone meant was , that she was amazed why so many of her colleagues could n't see , or did n't want to see , that democracy was the best hope for women .
Pamela
Bone was well aware that there is a necessary quarrel about how democracy can be brought about in countries that do n't have it , and I hasten to concede that of the two possible main views about the invasion of Iraq , for example , my own view , in favour , soon became the minority view .
But Pamela
Bone could n't see how there could be any doubt that women in the countries without democracy were in a battle that they were bound to lose if the men could prevail by force .
Men will always monopolise the means of violence if they can .
Women can learn to shoot guns , but there are no all - female armies , and even the Amazons were probably a myth .
Women , on the whole , would naturally like to do something else , whereas an army , for too many men , is a home away from home , and often their only home .
It 's the only home for the junta in Burma .
The junta is in the news again this week because it found a pretext for locking Aung San Suu Kyi into prison , instead of just leaving her helpless under house arrest .
The terms of Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest were that she should receive no visitors , and some poor demented AmericanVietnam veteran made sure that the terms were violated by swimming to her front door .
Despair heaped on despair - activists ready to march for Aung San Suu Kyi Like many a possible head - case he probably just wanted to discuss his theories about how aliens control everything , but the all - male military junta in Burma really does control everything and here was their chance to dump Aung San Suu Kyi into jail until the next election is over .
Aung San Suu Kyi not only has the stature , she has the right , to lead the government of her county .
If the public got a chance to say so , she would do so , and bring immeasurable improvement not only to Burma but the whole area .
Slow martyrdom I say all this because in some moment of optimism I allowed my name to get put on the masthead of the organisation in this country that campaigns for her release , the Burma Campaign , but I have done nothing else for her before today , mainly because I do n't believe that my going to dinner with like - minded humanitarians is likely to help much .
What she needs is an invading army , but even if there were one available , armed intervention , since the Iraq incursion , has been out of fashion : no doubt with good reason , but those appalled by the moral cost of toppling a tyrannical regime are still stuck with counting the moral cost incurred by leaving it alone .
The regime in Burma will most likely go on being left alone .
Aung San Suu Kyi's slow martyrdom makes the cost obvious .
The current best plan for getting her sprung is to bring persuasion to bear on India so that India will bring pressure to bear on the junta , and so on until she grows old and grey .
Being who she is , she grows old slowly , and at the age of 63 she looks like her own daughter , but time is still against her .
If time is all you 've got going for you , it is n't much .
What justice needs , when it is ranged against naked force , is a contrary force , and the fact that there is n't one is enough to reduce the onlooker to despair .
' Merry face , exultantly elevated thumb ' - Kuwaiti MP
Aseel al Awadhi Despair can coarsen one 's judgment .
I knew enough about what Saddam Hussein and his talented son Uday were doing to women to want that regime toppled .
The price of doing so might have seemed too high , but at least now , six years later , it is no longer official policy to rape a woman in front of her family .
There may be unofficial forces still on the loose in Iraq who would like to do that , but the government no longer does it .
Fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan still seems worth it when you have read about what the Taliban want to do with any woman who seeks an education , but it 's easy to despair when you think of how hard it is to stop them .
Sometimes despair overwhelms us when we read of just a single so - called honour crime in which the men of a family have ruined the life of a daughter for what seems no reason at all , and the men walk free because that 's the culture , and the culture runs the government .
I felt despair when Aung San Suu Kyi got taken off to jail , and for her I thought I had no despair left .
But heartbreak feels out of place when we see this news story about the four women MPs in Kuwait , and there 's a photo of one of them , rejoicing with her friends .
I 'm looking at the photo right now .
Her name is Aseel al Awadhi .
She has a merry face and an exultantly elevated thumb .
It will be a better world for all of us if women like her are free to do well , and if she could hear us it would be our simple duty to say good luck to you .
And another duty , alas , to say : mind how you go .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Well said , Mr James .
I 'm grateful for all that 's been done by campaigning women to improve the lot of women in the West .
But when I hear some of the horrendous stories of abuse and exploitation of women in other areas of the world ( and as an interpreter in the UN I hear a lot of them ) I feel helpless and ashamed too .
Helpless because there seems so little we can do to support them and ashamed that some groups in our society often seem more concerned about changing mankind to humankind in the hymn books than trying to doing so .
Rosemary Hill , Geneva , Switzerland
This article misses a crucial point .
Just because , for instance , women in the Middle East , living in autocracies , would prefer to live in a liberal democracy does not mean that Western feminists ought to or do , indeed , subscribe to the idea that said liberal democracy is the only possible alternative .
This is a absurd argument that really just seeks to shame Western feminists for having the audacity to question the various forms of sexism , genderism and general forms of oppression that manifest themselves in our own cultures .
I have heard no Western feminist say that they would prefer to live in Kuwait , for example , but this does not mean that we can still not imagine a still better alternative for ourselves at home .
JM , Vancouver , Canada Clive James assertion that women are better off under the current Iraqi Government proves he lacks the required brain power to understand ANYTHING about feminism .
Or the true horror of what the invasion of Iraq has been for Iraqi women .
Patrick Sieben , Fitchburg WI USA Congratulations for your stand , Mr James .
It baffles me constantly , when so many underprivileged groups are championed ( probably quite rightly ) that we nevertheless forget that half the world 's population is female , but in many places they are denied the most basic human rights of education , self - determination and representation .
It 's something we should all be ashamed of .
P Bird , Manchester
What on earth has this man been reading ?
The only articles seriously focusing on the plight of women in non-democratic societies , advocating change for them , that I have read , were written by feminists , or to be found on feminist websites or women - centric news pages .
Which feminists exactly is he accusing ?
Why is this article even featured ?
Or is this just a man getting attention and praise for what women have been saying for ages , as usual ?
Sarah Sutcliffe , Egham , UK
You make a good argument .
Maybe the unwillingness of Western " feminists " to acknowledge women in other parts of the world is a remnant the West 's superiority complex .
We do n't want to accept that the best fighters for women do n't come from the west - we 're meant to save them , not the other way around .
Lucy Power , Auckland , New Zealand
The fact that this is still an issue is damning for all countries , be they " pro-liberal " or not .
Women do not have an equal standing in any country .
The fact that women are " better off " in so called " liberal democracies " does n't mean that liberal democracies are the pinnacle of what is to be achieved .
For example , in the UK , since the Equal Pay Act came into force , the narrowing of the gap between the genders in respect of pay has changed very little .
This is not to say that " democracy " or equality should n't be strived for .
It means we all still have an awful lot of work to do .
Jayna , Cornwall Yes , Clive , thank you for your ever cogent arguments .
There are quite a few of us western feminists , but we can not all be famous .
We can just keep plugging away at the importance of democracy , etc , as we do .
The media do n't go much on older ladies with strongly feminist / democratic principles in the west , do they !?
B Cumulus , berwick upon Tweed , Clive , I think your interpretation of why more western women do n't speak out about the awful treatment doled out to women in dictatorships is very charitable .
My own interpretation is that western feminists are overly occupied with their own situation .
Here in America we are concerned with abortion rights , the wage gap and domestic violence .
Quite frankly , a lot of it is selfish - fighting for " our " rights .
We may point to the treatment of women in third world countries to help us win our rights in the first world , but changing the third world is n't the project of feminism , any more than it 's the project of the gay rights movement .
Lisa , San Diego , California Democracy and genuine freedom of speech offer the best hope to all those disempowered by the political system .
This is not to say that western democracy is perfect or noble , but it has allowed the position of women to dramatically improve .
It seems to me that true sisterhood lies in supporting the courageous women who are willing to fight for power with nothing more than words and moral authority .
Lesley Dover , Louth , Lincolnshire I applaud your brave decision to approach this subject unabashedly .
It has been all too common for those who were once oppressed to continue on , forgetting that the world they live in has allowed them freedom .
The world most Westerners live in is the democratic one , and we would do well not to forget its benefits .
Here argument reigns supreme , where in most dictatorships the gun is what has the final say .

He travels the world , dances on TV , tinkers with hardware — oh , and designed the Apple I & II personal computers .
Steve Wozniak answers our questions and shares his hacker - ish means of getting things done .
In computer - loving circles , he 's one of those figures you say needs no introduction — and then go ahead and introduce anyways .
He and Steve Jobs started the Apple Computer Company from a bedroom , and then a garage , and Wozniak himself put together first the Apple I , then the widely successful and iconic Apple II , the computer most of today 's programmers grew up tinkering with as students .
He left Apple in 1987 to indulge his mind in high - tech startups , technology programs for schools , and other projects .
Most recently , he 's been seen earnestly , if not successfully , Dancing with the Stars , and functions as a sort of homebrew / Hackintosh hero at sites like our sibling Gizmodo .

Wozniak spoke with Lifehacker on the phone yesterday , and was nice enough to indulge our prodding into his productivity habits , thoughts on hardware and hacking , and advice for young entrepreneurs .
Lifehacker :
What gadgets and software applications do you use on a day - to - day basis ?
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Steve Wozniak : I have such a crowded life and crowded schedule .
When people send me a link with a gadget , I 'll look at it and buy it if it looks interesting , but I do n't have time to check out everything I 'd like to .
I do have a Nixie Tube watch , which I get a lot of benefit from .
The biggest benefit in my life comes from my Segway , which I use everywhere I am .
If I 'm going to San Antonio , for example , I 'll load it in the car and just go everywhere with it .
The other crucial thing is my Verizon wireless card , which I have to have because hotel Wi -Fi is just so unreliable .
Advertisement
... I have one MacBook Pro , with a 17 - inch screen .
I got into that and consciously separated myself from having 3 , 4 , 5 computers in my life , which just became too much .
As far as the mobile devices , I 've gone through all the different smartphones , all the different gadgets .
For a while I was using a Razr for voice and messing with mobile devices , but now I 'm traveling with an iPhone and a BlackBerry .
I do n't use them very much for email , though , unless I 'm detained for a long , unexpected stretch .
I save answering my email for when I 'm going to be in front of my nice , comfortable keyboard .
Lifehacker :
What are you using to manage your email ?
Steve Wozniak :
The most important thing I use is Eudora , and that 's discontinued .
Advertisement
Lifehacker : Seriously ?
Eudora ?
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak :
The reason I do is , it has an incredible feature that every single mail client should have .
Any feature in the menu list , any action there , can be added as a button .
I changed it so I have a vertical menu bar , so I can have tons and tons of pre-made buttons saved right where I want them up top , and I learn where those place are .
You can script actions to the buttons , too , so I can quickly copy messages to my assistants .
There are scripts I wrote for joke lists so I can forward a message , remove the brackets and formatting , and make sure all the original attachments are included , to a pre-defined " joke " group .
Apple 's Mail app just is n't scriptable enough to really handle my mail buttons .
Advertisement
Some of the buttons will re-direct mail with quote marks , or not .
I 've got another script that will actually customize a mail forward , like my own version of mail merge .
So even if something 's going out to 400 people , I can set it to single out certain people and take away all the forwarding markings , so it looks like I singled out someone to send them mail .
Which is , I hope , a nice little moment for them .
( Laughs )
Lifehacker :
So it 's more important for you to have software that fits your specific email style than having the latest and greatest .
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak : I think that 's fair to say , although I 'm also a fan with sticking with the most standard software that millions of other users also use , because you get the benefit of all those other users ' problems and solutions .
I 'm a fan both ways .
I think you get a great set of programs with Apple 's systems , but from day one , I 've wondered why they did n't just have a standard API that lets you script anything from the menu bar into a button .
Why is n't it just built into the operating system ?
You 've said that email and RSS feeds are a big part of your day , but you also get overwhelmed by email , according to your site .
How do you try and handle all your input ?
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak : I do n't ever have time to just browse , to see what 's new on my favorite sites .
When I get a chance to sit down , I start by checking the average news , on Google News or another site .
Once I 'm up to date on that , and ( I 've ) read about one full article , I 'll go through my RSS news feeds .
Depending on how long I 've been away , it could be up to three hours , but I 'll go as long as my brain does n't get mushed up , on my topics I 'm into and the world .
I save the email for last , and if I 've been flying all day , I just sometimes can't get to it .
Advertisement
I think that 's one of the reasons Twitter , and somewhat blogs , too , have become so appealing .
I have a Twitter feed , but I rarely use it ... a bit more , obviously , during Dancing with the Stars .
But I do n't like to write little things .
I like to write and explain things out ...
... A long , long time ago , I made a long road trip to Yellowstone , and I 'd write to my friends and post updates , manually coding the HTML .
I taught it to the kids in my classes , the HTML , then DreamWeaver , when that was coming out ...
Now that it 's so easy for the masses to do those kind of things , I 'm moving away from it .
That 's how it is for me .

Lifehacker :
What 's your browser of choice ?
Steve Wozniak : A few years ago , the people that I respected the most , the truest geeks , were using Firefox .
Some sites that did n't work for me in Safari did work for me in Firefox , so I started moving over , and I liked it .
Then Safari started getting standardized , and working on more and more sites ...
I still keep Firefox around for when I need it , but I like to reduce , when I can , to the simplest tools that get me where I want to go , and that 's Safari right now .

Lifehacker : A lot of our readers want to know if you use Linux at all , and what you think about where it is today .

Steve Wozniak : I never got into Linux .
I swear to God , it 's only lack of time .
I 'm past the years of my life where I can really dig into something like running a Linux system .
I 'm very sympathetic to the whole idea ; Linux people always think the way I want to think .
Lifehacker :
What can you tell us about your work with Fusion - io ?
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak : I absolutely do not need a salary or a job , that 's the last thing I need .
But smart people , I love to be around ...
It took ( Fusion - io ) a long time to have a meeting with me .
They showed me how far they have come in visualzing a new type of server architecture , and it's two to 20 times better than any competing thing we could come up with .
They 've developed a streamlined way to incorporate all the little tricks you have to do , NAND , flash ram , ... they had solved one after another of server 's technical problems , freed up space and made them run cooler .
The technical people at MySpace were asking one question after another to us , and we had answers that were a lot better than they were expecting ... they 've just done some amazing things in making things run faster and better .
Lifehacker :
You 've said , or at least been attributed with the quote , " Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window . "
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak : I 'm not sure I said exactly that but , hey , I 'll take the attribution ( laughs ) .
I probably said something about a computer 's size , someone added that bit , and I said , " Yeah , that 's right . "
Lifehacker :
Does that relate to how you see the future of server - based computer , " cloud computing " ?
Richard Stallman is certainly concerned about the privacy and security issues there .
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak :
Well , I tend to agree with Stallman , but ... I do think that it really is the end of the line .
I do n't know if that 's good or bad for us , but it seems like the future direction .
Lifehacker :
Is the future focus on servers part of why you 're working with Fusion - io ?
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak : No , I 'm with fusion - io because I 'm more of a hardware guy .
It 's a company that lets me have a close connection from hardware to firmware to drivers .
What they 're doing is cutting out the " middle man " that gets in the ways of performance , and I 'm very intrigued by that .
Lifehacker :
We know you 're a fan of hacking in general , and Hackintoshes — or at least will sign a Dell Mini with OS X installed on it .
A lot of our readers are , too .
But I 'm wondering if you think all the work that 's being done will eventually push companies to offer more open access to hardware and software , or if that kind of hacking will always be a 5 percent type of niche ?
Advertisement
Steve Wozniak : I hate to say it , and Apple never likes it , but I love anything that 's hacker oriented .
I do n't like passing it onto others , or getting things for free .
I do n't like stealing music one bit , at all ...

I think it will always be a 5 percent niche , and I think it 's always been .
When we first started with Apple computers , it was my dream that everyone would learn to program , and that was how they 'd use their computer .
But , obviously , that 's not the way it turned out .
That 's where I think we see the advantages of open - source software .
I think it 's a great thing , and a lot of companies are using mySQL , open - source software , and , well , Linux , too , to make the software work exactly the way they need it to .
That kind of hacking is the center of my heart , that 's who I am .
Lifehacker :
Do you still have a jailbroken iPhone ?
What kind of apps , unofficial and official , are you using on it ?
( Asked by gmerin ) .

Steve Wozniak : I was into jailbreaking earlier on , but then it came time with the firmware revisions to undo it , redo it , redo it again , I got so tired of worrying about losing everything on my unofficial setup .
I 've probably got 100 apps I 've looked at , but the one I use the most tells me what to tip in every country I 'm in ( iTip ) .
I did make a Skype call the other day from my iPhone , but then I found out AT&T might not let that onto their network , so we 'll see .

Lifehacker :
If you were to give advice to someone starting their own technology - focused business right now , as opposed to when you built Apple as a young man , what advice would you give them ?
What would be different than from your own experience ?
( Inspired by ephdel )

Steve Wozniak :
You 'd better have the technology knowledge to do it .
I really urge you not to think you can start a whole company and business with just ideas on paper , because you 'll end up owning so few of those ideas .
You have to create a working model , something that you can show people and demonstrate that it works , and then you can start building a future for it .

Lifehacker :
Is that spoken from experience ?
Steve Wozniak :
It comes through , partly , experience .
Whatever develops your skills — you did certain things in your life that prepared you well , that gave you an open mind , and you should stay closely connected to the technology when you start your company .
People can say , " Well , I 'm the business man , I 'm out trying to make deal , " you might get your company going .
But you 'd better make sure you 're around some good technologists that you can trust , or your business does n't have direction .
A lot of things seem to be worth almost no money .
but if you do them very well , and they help people fill a need , there 's a great business you can build around that .

Advertisement A teenage boy has been praised for helping to save six children aged from five to 15 from their burning house .
Leighton Griffiths , 15 , from Cwmbran , heard the youngsters screaming for help after the fire broke out in the Greenmeadow area early on Saturday .
The mother of five of the children rescued from the fire said her young neighbour had saved their lives .
South Wales Fire Service praised the " swift actions of the public " , firefighters and fire control staff .
Fire crews were called to The Twinings at 0220 BST on Saturday , with the fire at an end - of - terrace house .
Leighton said he used a hosepipe to try to douse the flames while his stepfather Alan Probert and a neighbour put a ladder up to a window and got out three of the youngsters .
They could have died and I could not have lived my life knowing I could have done something
Leighton Griffiths Meanwhile , unbeknown to Mr Probert , Leighton said he had gone into the property and rescued the three other children trapped in the burning house .
He collapsed and had to be taken to hospital afterwards with minor burns and a suspected broken rib .
Leighton said : " No matter how scared you might be , you 've got to be brave enough to go in and get them .
They could have died and I could not have lived my life knowing I could have done something .
" I class everyone who gave a hand at the time a hero because we all played a part in it . "
The fire is believed to have started in the electrical fuse box at the house .
The blaze broke out in the early hours of Saturday
They are the third family to have survived a blaze in the property in recent years .
Tracy Evans and her husband had been on their first evening out in 18 months when the fire started .
Mrs Evans said : " He 's absolutely fantastic .
He saved my children 's lives .
If it was n't for him , my kids would n't be here now , and there 's nothing I can ever do ( for ) that boy or repay him for what he 's done . "
The children have also made a thank you card for Leighton who celebrates his 16th birthday on Tuesday .

BlackBerry billionaire Jim Balsillie has extended an offer to buy the financially strapped Phoenix Coyotes , contingent on moving the franchise to southern Ontario .
Balsillie has offered $ 212.5 million for the franchise , which has spent the past 12 seasons in the desert since leaving Winnipeg , Manitoba prior to the 1996 - 97 season .
" The current team ownership asked that I table an offer to purchase the Coyotes and significant discussions resulted in an offer that is in the best interests of the franchise , the NHL , and the great hockey fans of Canada and southern Ontario , " Balsillie said Tuesday in a statement .
The Coyotes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday .
The filing included the proposed sale of the franchise to PSE Sports & Entertainment , which would move the franchise to southern Ontario .
" Extensive efforts have been undertaken to sell the team , or attract additional investors , who would keep the team in Glendale , " Jerry Moyes , the Coyotes ' chief executive officer , said in a statement announcing the Chapter 11 filing .
" Creating a process under the supervision of a judge assures that anyone wishing to purchase the team will have the opportunity to bid . "
Moyes ' statement added that the intention was to have a new owner and possible new location determined by June 30 in order to keep the team on the 2009 - 10 NHL schedule .
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement Tuesday that the league has been notified of the Coyotes ' dire situation and has stripped Moyes of any further authority with the club .
" We have just become aware of today 's Bankruptcy Court filing purportedly made on behalf of the Phoenix Coyotes , " Daly said .
" We are investigating the circumstances surrounding the petition , including the propriety of its filing .
We have removed Jerry Moyes from all positions of authority to act for or on behalf of the Club .
The League will appear and proceed before the Bankruptcy Court in the best interests of all of the Club 's constituencies , including its fans in Arizona and the League 's 29 other Member Clubs . "
Sources told ESPN.com 's Scott Burnside the NHL will oppose Balsillie 's move to purchase the team , as will the city of Glendale .
It is believed the city will argue that filing for bankruptcy does not give the team the right to break its lease , and that commissioner Gary Bettman already was dealing with the situation in Phoenix when he was informed of the bankruptcy proceedings and the bid to sell the team to Balsillie .
" The decision by the ownership of the Phoenix Coyotes to initiate bankruptcy proceedings without consultation or approval of the National Hockey League is an unfortunate turn of events for the NHL , the State of Arizona and the Coyotes ' loyal fans , " the city of Glendale said in a statement .
" Even as the propriety of this unprecedented action is being thoroughly investigated by the NHL , city officials are working diligently to ensure that the public 's interest is fully protected throughout this process . "
Sources also say Moyes and Balsillie apparently collaborated on this strategy because Moyes believes Balsillie can , and will , pay more money than any other potential buyer or investor who would be interested in keeping the team in Phoenix .
Chip company ARM is prepping to make its move into the netbook market , and now it has shown off a few prototype designs that really show off the benefits of using the ARM platform : thanks to passive cooling , no fans are required , enabling ARM netbooks to be much thinner and lighter than their Intel counterparts .
Thanks to ZDNet , we have a nice video overview of these ARM netbooks – as well as a few very tiny ARM desktop machines .
A few notes : they are all capable of driving HD content , can surf the web for 8 hours , and will cost round and about 250 USD .
They are all focused on Ubuntu ; ARM and several of its licensees have worked with Canonical to bring their ARM - port up to speed .
I must say that I am pretty much impressed .
Pharmacist who shot robber charged with murder Oklahoma
Jerome Ersland is escorted out of a courtroom by Oklahoma County sheriff deputies after a bond hearing at the Oklahoma County Courthouse in Oklahoma City Thursday , May 28 , 2009 .
Confronted by two holdup men , pharmacist Jerome Ersland pulled a gun , shot one of them in the head and chased the other away .
Then , in a scene recorded by the drugstore 's security camera , he went behind the counter , got another gun , and pumped five more bullets into the wounded teenager as he lay on the floor .
Now Ersland has been charged with first - degree murder in a case that has stirred a furious debate over vigilante justice and self - defense and turned the pharmacist into something of a folk hero .

Confronted by two holdup men , pharmacist Jerome Ersland pulled a gun , shot one of them in the head and chased the other away .
Then , in a scene recorded by the drugstore 's security camera , he went behind the counter , got another gun , and pumped five more bullets into the wounded teenager as he lay on the floor .
Now Ersland has been charged with first - degree murder in a case that has stirred a furious debate over vigilante justice and self - defense and turned the pharmacist into something of a folk hero .
Ersland , 57 , is free on $ 100,000 bail , courtesy of an anonymous donor .
He has won praise from the pharmacy 's owner , received an outpouring of cards , letters and checks from supporters , and become the darling of conservative talk radio .
" His adrenaline was going .
You 're just thinking of survival , " said John Paul Hernandez , 60 , a retired Defense Department employee who grew up in the neighborhood .
" All it was is defending your employee , business and livelihood .
If I was in that position and that was me , I probably would have done the same thing . "
District Attorney David Prater said Ersland was justified in shooting 16 - year - old Antwun Parker once in the head , but not in firing the additional shots into his belly .
The prosecutor said the teenager was unconscious , unarmed , lying on his back and posing no threat when Ersland fired what the medical examiner said were the fatal shots .
Anthony Douglas , president of the Oklahoma chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , called it an " execution - style murder " and praised the district attorney for bringing charges .
Ersland is white ; the two suspects were black .
Parker 's parents also expressed relief that Ersland faces a criminal charge .
" He did n't have to shoot my baby like that , " Parker 's mother , Cleta Jennings , told TV station KOCO .
But many of those who have seen the video of the May 19 robbery attempt at Reliable Discount Pharmacy have concluded the teenager in the ski mask got what he deserved .
Mark Shannon , who has a conservative talk show on Oklahoma City 's KTOK , said callers have jammed his lines this week in support of Ersland , a former Air Force lieutenant colonel who wears a back brace on the job and told reporters he is a disabled veteran of the Gulf War .
" There is no gray area , " Shannon said .
One caller " said he should have put all the shots in the head . "
Barbara Bergman , past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law , likened the public reaction to that of the case of Bernard Goetz , the New Yorker who shot four teenagers he said were trying to rob him when they asked for $ 5 on a subway in 1984 .
Goetz was cleared of attempted murder and assault but convicted of illegal gun possession and served 8 1/2 months in jail .
Bergman said those who claim they used deadly force in self - defense have to show they were " in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury . "
Under Oklahoma's Make My Day Law - passed in the late 1980s and named for one of Clint Eastwood 's most famous movie lines - people can use deadly force when they feel threatened by an intruder inside their homes .
In 2006 , Oklahoma 's Stand Your Ground Law extended that to anywhere a citizen has the right to be , such as a car or office .
If convicted , Ersland could be sentenced to life in prison with or without parole , or receive the death penalty .
During coverage of the Obama administration ’s 100 - day mark , MSNBC had war reporter Richard Engel and anchor Tamron Hall interview MSNBC analyst Barry McCaffrey , who CJR.org ‘s Clint Hendler ( 4/29/09 ) calls “ the retired army general whose many conflicts of interest have been analyzed by David Barstow ’s now - Pulitzer Prize winning reporting for the New York Times . ”
When asked by Engel about attempts to “ draw away the Taliban ’s source of funding by cutting down the opium crop or burning it or whatever , ” McCaffrey was emphatic : “ I think we ’ve got to take it on .
But , you know , the lead agent ca n’t be U.S. combat troops .
It ’s got to be Afghans chopping down opium poppy . ”
Hendler thinks he knows the source of McCaffrey ’s enthusiasm , even if the MSNBCers do n’t ( or at least are n’t saying ) :
Neither Hall , Engel nor McCaffrey made mention of DynCorp , a major military contractor that ’s doing exactly that –training Afghans to eradicate poppies .
Nor did they mention that McCaffrey sits on DynCorp ’s board , which according to federal contracting records , garnered contracts in 2008 and 2009 worth over $ 323 million dollars with the State Department ’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs , including its work in Afghanistan .

Windows 7 Fail Posted by Mikko @ 13:25 GMT
Windows 7 RC is out today .
This is great news .
Because surely by now they 've fixed Windows Explorer .
You see , in Windows NT , 2000 , XP and Vista , Explorer used to Hide extensions for known file types .
And virus writers used this " feature " to make people mistake executables for stuff such as document files .
The trick was to rename VIRUS.EXE to VIRUS .
TXT.EXE or VIRUS .JPG.EXE , and Windows would hide the .EXE part of the filename .
Additionally , virus writers would change the icon inside the executable to look like the icon of a text file or an image , and everybody would be fooled .
Surely this wo n't work in Windows 7 .
Lets try .
Hmm .
It sure looks like a text file in Explorer :
But it actually is an executable :

Five Muslim community workers have accused MI5 of waging a campaign of blackmail and harassment in an attempt to recruit them as informants .
The men claim they were given a choice of working for the Security Service or face detention and harassment in the UK and overseas .
They have made official complaints to the police , to the body which oversees the work of the Security Service and to their local MP Frank Dobson .
Now they have decided to speak publicly about their experiences in the hope that publicity will stop similar tactics being used in the future .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Intelligence gathered by informers is crucial to stopping further terror outrages , but the men's allegations raise concerns about the coercion of young Muslim men by the Security Service and the damage this does to the gathering of information in the future .
Three of the men say they were detained at foreign airports on the orders of MI5 after leaving Britain on family holidays last year .
After they were sent back to the UK , they were interviewed by MI5 officers who , they say , falsely accused them of links to Islamic extremism .
On each occasion the agents said they would lift the travel restrictions and threat of detention in return for their co-operation .
When the men refused some of them received what they say were intimidating phone calls and threats .
Two other Muslim men say they were approached by MI5 at their homes after police officers posed as postmen .
Each of the five men , aged between 19 and 25 , was warned that if he did not help the security services he would be considered a terror suspect .
A sixth man was held by MI5 for three hours after returning from his honeymoon in Saudi Arabia .
He too claims he was threatened with travel restrictions if he tried to leave the UK .
An agent who gave her name as Katherine is alleged to have made direct threats to Adydarus Elmi , a 25 - year - old cinema worker from north London .
In one telephone call she rang him at 7 am to congratulate him on the birth of his baby girl .
His wife was still seven months ' pregnant and the couple had expressly told the hospital that they did not want to know the sex of their child .
Mr Elmi further alleges : " Katherine tried to threaten me by saying , and it still runs through my mind now : ' Remember , this wo n't be the last time we ever meet . '
And then during our last conversation she explained : ' If you do not want anything to happen to your family you will co-operate . ' "
Madhi Hashi , a 19 - year - old care worker from Camden , claims he was held for 16 hours in a cell in Djibouti airport on the orders of MI5 .
He alleges that when he was returned to the UK on 9 April this year he was met by an MI5 agent who told him his terror suspect status would remain until he agreed to work for the Security Service .
He alleges that he was to be given the job of informing on his friends by encouraging them to talk about jihad .

Mohamed Nur , 25 , a community youth worker from north London , claims he was threatened by the Security Service after an agent gained access to his home accompanied by a police officer posing as a postman .
" The MI5 agent said , ' Mohamed if you do not work for us we will tell any foreign country you try to travel to that you are a suspected terrorist . ' "
Mohamed Aden , 25 , a community youth worker from Camden , was also approached by someone disguised as a postman in August last year .
He alleges an agent told him : " We 're going to make your travelling harder for you if you do n't co-operate . "
None of the six men , who work with disadvantaged youths at the Kentish Town Community Organisation ( KTCO ) , has ever been arrested for terrorism or a terrorism - related offence .
They have repeatedly complained about their treatment to the police and to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal , which oversees the work of the Security Services .
In a letter to Lord Justice Mummery , who heads the tribunal , Sharhabeel Lone , the chairman of the KTCO , said : " The only thing these young people have in common is that they studied Arabic abroad and are of Somali origin .
They are not involved in any terrorist activity whatsoever , nor have they ever been , and the security services are well aware of this . "
Mr Sharhabeel added : " These incidents smack of racism , Islamophobia and all that undermines social cohesion .
Threatening British citizens , harassing them in their own country , alienating young people who have committed no crime other than practising a particular faith and being a different colour is a recipe for disaster .
" These disgraceful incidents have undermined 10 years of hard work and severely impacted social cohesion in Camden .
Targeting young people that are role models for all young people in our country in such a disparaging way demonstrates a total lack of understanding of on - the - ground reality and can only be counter - productive .
" When people are terrorised by the very same body that is meant to protect them , sowing fear , suspicion and division , we are on a slippery slope to an Orwellian society . "
Frank Dobson said : " To identify real suspects from the Muslim communities MI5 must use informers .
But it seems that from what I have seen some of their methods may be counter - productive . "
Last night MI5 and the police refused to discuss the men's complaints with The Independent .
But on its website , MI5 says it is untrue that the Security Service harasses Muslims .
The organisation says : " We do not investigate any individuals on the grounds of ethnicity or religious beliefs .
Countering the threat from international terrorists , including those who claim to be acting for Islam , is the Security Service 's highest priority .
" We know that attacks are being considered and planned for the UK by al - Qai'da and associated networks .
International terrorists in this country threaten us directly through violence and indirectly through supporting violence overseas . "
It adds : " Muslims are often themselves the victims of this violence – the series of terrorist attacks in Casablanca in May 2003 and Riyadh in May and November 2003 illustrate this .
" The service also employs staff of all religions , including Muslims .
We are committed to recruiting a diverse range of staff from all backgrounds so that we can benefit from their different perspectives and experience . "
MI5 and me :
Three statements
Mahdi Hashi : ' I told him : this is blackmail '
Last month , 19 - year - old Mahdi Hashi arrived at Gatwick airport to take a plane to visit his sick grandmother in Djibouti , but as he was checking in he was stopped by two plainclothes officers .
One of the officers identified himself as Richard and said he was working for MI5 .
Mr Hashi said : " He warned me not to get on the flight .
He said ' Whatever happens to you outside the UK is not our responsibility ' .
I was absolutely shocked . "
The agent handed Mr Hashi a piece of paper with his name and telephone contact details and asked him to call him .
" The whole time he tried to make it seem like he was looking after me .
And just before I left them at my boarding gate I remember ' Richard ' telling me ' It 's your choice , mate , to get on that flight but I advise you not to , ' and then he winked at me . "
When Mr Hashi arrived at Djibouti airport he was stopped at passport control .
He was then held in a room for 16 hours before being deported back to the UK .
He claims the Somali security officers told him that their orders came from London .
More than 24 hours after he first left the UK he arrived back at Heathrow and was detained again .
" I was taken to pick up my luggage and then into a very discreet room .
' Richard ' walked in with a Costa bag with food which he said was for me , my breakfast .
He said it was them who sent me back because I was a terror suspect . "
Mr Hashi , a volunteer youth leader at Kentish Town Community Organisation in north London , alleges that the officer made it clear that his " suspect " status and travel restrictions would only be lifted if he agreed to co-operate with MI5 .
" I told him ' This is blatant blackmail ' ; he said ' No , it 's just proving your innocence .
By co-operating with us we know you 're not guilty . '
" He said I could go and that he'd like to meet me another time , preferably after [ May ] Monday Bank Holiday .
I looked at him and said ' I do n't ever want to see you or hear from you again .
You 've ruined my holiday , upset my family , and you nearly gave my sick grandmother in Somalia a heart attack ' . "
Adydarus Elmi : ' MI5 agent threatened my family '
When the 23 - year - old cinema worker from north London arrived at Chicago 's O'Hare airport with his pregnant wife , they were separated , questioned and deported back to Britain .
Three days later Mr Elmi was contacted on his mobile phone and asked to attend Charing Cross police station to discuss problems he was having with his travel documents .
" I met a man and a woman , " he said .
" She said her name was Katherine and that she worked for MI5 .
I did n't know what MI5 was . "
For two - and - a - half hours Mr Elmi faced questions .
" I felt I was being lured into working for MI5 . "
The contact did not stop there .
Over the following weeks he claims " Katherine " harassed him with dozens of phone calls .
" She would regularly call my mother 's home asking to speak to me , " he said .
" And she would constantly call my mobile . "
In one disturbing call the agent telephoned his home at 7 am to congratulate him on the birth of his baby girl .
His wife was still seven months pregnant and the couple had expressly told the hospital that they did not want to know the sex of their child .
" Katherine tried to threaten me by saying – and it still runs through my mind now – ' Remember , this wo n't be the last time we ever meet " , and then during our last conversation explained : ' If you do not want anything to happen to your family you will co-operate ' . "
Mohamed Nur
Mohamed Nur , 25 , first came into contact with MI5 early one morning in August 2008 when his doorbell rang .
Looking through his spyhole in Camden , north London , he saw a man with a red bag who said he was a postman .
When Mr Nur opened the door the man told him that he was in fact a policeman and that he and his colleague wanted to talk to him .
When they sat down the second man produced ID and said that he worked for MI5 .
The agent told Mr Nur that they suspected him of being an Islamic extremist .
" I immediately said ' And where did you get such an idea ? '
He replied , ' I am not permitted to discuss our sources ' .
I said that I have never done anything extreme . "
Mr Nur claims he was then threatened by the officer .
" The MI5 agent said , ' Mohamed , if you do not work for us we will tell any foreign country you try to travel to that you are a suspected terrorist ' . "
They asked him what travel plans he had .
Mr Nur said he might visit Sweden next year for a football tournament .
The agent told him he would contact him within the next three days .
" I am not interested in meeting you ever . "
Mr Nur replied .
As they left , the agent said to at least consider the approach , as it was in his best interests .

Python , decorators , and database idioms
Now that I ’m a co-maintainer of the MySQL driver for Python I get to see a lot of confused people pop in on the support forums with some elementary problems .
These seem to be mostly young developers who have n’t quite mastered the “ start transaction , work with the database , commit ” pattern that so many of us have become used to after a few years .
I still find the overhead of doing that sort of thing repeatedly to be tiresome .
It does n’t take long for your code to become a mess of try / except blocks , making code reading confusing and arduous .
To avoid this , I ’ve been using a Python decorator to wrap my SQL functions .
It goes a little something like this ( simplified form ) :
def dbwrap ( func ) : " " " Wrap a function in an idomatic SQL transaction .
The wrapped function should take a cursor as its first argument ; other arguments will be preserved . " " " def new_func ( conn , * args , ** kwargs ) : cursor = conn . cursor ( ) try : cursor .
execute ( " BEGIN " ) retval = func ( cursor , * args , ** kwargs ) cursor .
execute ( " COMMIT " ) except : cursor .
execute ( " ROLLBACK " ) raise finally : cursor .
close ( ) return retval # Tidy up the help ( ) - visible docstrings to be nice new_func .
__name__ = func .
__name__ new_func .
__doc__ = func .
__doc__ return new_func @dbwrap def do_something ( cursor , val1 = 1 , val2 = 2 ) : " " " Do that database thing . " " " cursor .
execute ( " SELECT %s , %s " , ( val1 , val2 ) ) return cursor .
fetchall ( ) class SomeClass ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : conn = MySQLdb .
connect ( db = ' test ' ) self .
instance_var = SomeClass .
get_stuff ( conn ) print self .
instance_var conn .
close ( ) @staticmethod @dbwrap def get_stuff ( cursor ) : " " " Load something meaningful from the database . " " " cursor .
execute ( " SELECT ' blah ' " ) return cursor .
fetchall ( ) [ 0 ] [ 0 ] if ' __main__ ' == __name__ : conn = MySQLdb . connect ( db = ' test ' ) print do_something ( conn ) print do_something ( conn , 3 , 4 ) print do_something ( conn , 5 ) print do_something ( conn , val2 = 6 ) # help ( do_something ) s = SomeClass ( ) # help (s )
Now , there are obviously several additions you could make here .
You could add retry / reconnect logic , be a little more careful when closing the cursor ( which can throw exceptions ) , or even attempt some deadlock recovery .
But I think this simple example shows how you can effectively use decorators to implement a useful DB interaction idiom on both functions and object static methods .
And , damn , if it does n’t save a lot of typing .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- George Harrison 's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle 's star on the Walk of Fame .
From left , musicians Tom Petty , Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison 's relatives for dedication of his star .

" There 's someone here from every important stage of George 's life and career , " Harrison 's widow , Olivia , said .
Harrison , who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001 , becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star .
John Lennon was the first .
The new star is next to the iconic Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records , the distributor of much of Harrison 's music for the past five decades .
Tuesday 's ceremony coincided with the Capitol / EMI announcement that it will release Harrison 's first solo greatest hits collection -- " Let it Roll : Songs by George Harrison " -- on June 16 .
Actor Tom Hanks said the world changed for him in January 1964 when he heard his first Beatles song .
" That 's when we escaped the doldrums and moved on to a brighter , better , more joyful future , " Hanks said .
Superstar musicians Paul McCartney , Tom Petty , Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne attended the star 's dedication , but they did not address the crowd .
Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event , with some traveling from as far as Liverpool , England .
" We all have deep feelings for George , because he was such a deep - feeling person , " Olivia Harrison said .
" He was a beautiful , mystical man , living in a material world , " she said .
" He was funny as the day is long and just as perplexing . "
His son , Dhani , 30 , joked about his father 's star .
" It 's good , it 's lovely and it 's nice and shiny and I 'm glad it 's not outside of Frederick 's of Hollywood , " he said .
Harrison was just 15 when schoolmate Paul McCartney asked him to join his and John Lennon 's band , the Quarrymen .
The band evolved into the Beatles and the rest is history .
Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles .
Songs penned by Harrison included " Taxman , " " While My Guitar Gently Weeps , " " Something " and " Here Comes the Sun . "
Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music .
In 1971 , he helped organize the star - studded " Concert for Bangladesh " at New York 's Madison Square Garden .
In addition to his post -Beatles solo career , Harrison played with several groups -- most notably the Traveling Wilburys , alongside Petty , Lynne , Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan .

Sadly , there is no way for you to perform this test at home .
Historical records kept by bloggers of the time indicate that billions of years ago , a Totally Unrelated Munter somehow dropped into the primordial soup of Earth , and became the predecessor of all things Muntish , Muntranquilistic , and Muntoric .
( you can learn more about Muntorics from my paper on Muntorics , but they will not be discussed further here . )
In order for this property to prove evolution , we must realize that , being the direct ancestor if all things Muntish , eventually , evolution would lead to yet another Totally Unrelated Munter , The Banana Munter , and finally , after billions of years of evolution , the Purple Plastic Munter .
( The Squankterdoodlish variables come into play as the things that push change , and therefore evolution to a higher form more adapted to deal with these pressures . )
Experimental Physics Muntropic calculations can be used to break all of these pressures , change , and other such effects down to very simple mathematics .
Other Munters can be used to fill in the gaps between the three constants , but it is best not to push it too far , as this will make the whole thing very complex .
It is best to keep it simple .
( Very simple . )
So I shall endeavor to keep it less complex - esque .
( Exceptions : )
This test will not work on robots or inanimate objects as they never evolve without the assistance of the almighty and righteous Hand of God , ( and the Banana Munter can not be robotic or else you get a whole jumble of worthless equations . )
To test this completely and fully , you would have to conduct it over a period of several billion years , and science has not been around that long ( at least in its modern capacity ) so , there has not yet been time to fully test Evolution using Muntropy , though there is evidence to prove it has happened , such as the fossilized remains of a Banana Munter found in the Neander Valley in Germany and an even older Mauve Keratin Munter that has only recently been discovered on a tiny isle off the northern coast of California .
SAN FRANCISCO – The Obama administration has until Friday to convince a federal judge not to levy sanctions against the government for " failing to obey the court 's orders " in a key NSA wiretapping lawsuit .
U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker is threatening ( .pdf ) to summarily decide the 3 - year - old lawsuit in favor of the plaintiffs , and award unspecified monetary damages to two American lawyers who claim their telephone calls were illegally intercepted by the NSA under the Bush administration .
The lawyer represented a now - defunct Saudi charity that the Treasury Department claimed was linked to terrorism .
If it survived appeal , such a ruling would be a blow to the government , but it would fall far short of deciding the important question the case asks :
Can a sitting president , without congressional authority , create a spying program to eavesdrop on Americans ' electronic communications without warrants , as George W. Bush did in the aftermath of the 2001 terror attacks ?
The San Francisco case began when the government accidentally sent the plaintiffs documents that showed their overseas communications with Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation officials were intercepted without warrants .
The pair sued , but were forced to return the document because it was marked " top secret . "
The Justice Department , under the Bush and Obama administrations , has repeatedly maintained that the lawsuit should be dismissed because it threatens to expose state secrets .
But after years of legal wrangling , Walker decided in January that the documents were admissible , and ordered the government to craft a protective order that would allow the plaintiff 's counsel to review the documents in secret , without them being disclosed to their clients or the public .
A similar process has been applied to lawyers representing Guantanamo Bay prisoners .
This month the Obama administration refused to comply with Walker 's order .
The government is " refusing to cooperate with the court 's orders because , they assert , plaintiffs ' attorneys do not ' need to know ' the information that the court has determined they do need to know , " Walker wrote Friday .
The refusal came after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to override the judge .
Until Walker directly orders the government to turn over the classified document to the plaintiff lawyers , the appeals court will not consider hearing the case .
In defying the court order , the government urged Walker to go ahead and order the release of the secret documents to the lawyers , so the Justice Department could appeal .
But Walker declined that invitation to become the nation 's first judge to disclose data the government has classified as a state secret .
Now Walker has given the Justice Department until Friday to explain why he should n't sanction the government by simply deciding the entire lawsuit in favor of the plaintiffs .
A hearing on the matter is set for June 3 .
Walker is the same judge overseeing a class - action lawsuit targeting the nation 's telecommunication companies of being complicit in Bush 's once - secret spy program .
Congress , with the vote of then - Sen.
Barack Obama , legalized the spy program last summer .
That legislation allows electronic eavesdropping of Americans without obtaining a warrant if the subjects of the wiretap are communicating overseas with somebody believed connected to terrorism .
No such congressional authority was in place when lawyers Wendell Belew and Asim Gafoor 's telephone calls were intercepted in 2005 .
The United States had designated the Al - Haramain charity a terror organization .
The legislation authorizing the spy powers also immunized the telcos from being sued for their part in Bush 's eavesdropping program .
Walker is entertaining a constitutional challenge to the immunity legislation .

A couple 's sexual orientation determines whether or not they prefer to adopt a boy or a girl .
Gay men are more likely to have a gender preference for their adopted child whereas heterosexual men are the least likely .
What 's more , couples in heterosexual relationships are more likely to prefer girls than people in same - gender relationships , according to Dr. Abbie Goldberg from Clark University in the US .
These couples also have very different reasons for their preferences , depending on their sexuality .
These findings ( 1 ) , from the first study to compare the child gender preferences of prospective adoptive parents according to their sexuality , are published online in Springer 's journal Sex Roles .
Unlike biological parents , adoptive parents can choose the gender of their child .
Heterosexual , lesbian and gay male couples approach adoption with very different experiences and expectations as those of expectant biological parents .
Dr. Goldberg looked at whether the unique contexts of adoption and sexual orientation have distinct implications for men's and women 's child gender preferences .
She explored adoptive parents ' child gender preferences in a geographically diverse American sample of 93 heterosexual , 61 lesbian and 48 gay male couples waiting to adopt their first child .
The participants were recruited through adoption agencies in the US as well as national gay and lesbian organizations .
They were interviewed between 2005 and 2008 .
Dr. Goldberg found that many couples , irrespective of sexuality , had no preference for the gender of their adopted child .
They were simply grateful to finally have a child and gender was insignificant in the context of their larger goal of becoming parents .
Among those who expressed a preference , gay men were the most likely to have a preference and heterosexual men were the least likely .
Couples in heterosexual relationships were less likely to prefer boys than couples in same - gender relationships .
The study participants provided a range of reasons for their preferences for girls .
The most common reason among heterosexual women was their inexplicable desire for a daughter , whereas heterosexual men most frequently listed a combination of their inexplicable desire to have a girl , their ideas about father - daughter relationships and their perceived characteristics of girls .
Men felt girls would be easier to bring up , and more interesting and complex than boys , and less physically challenging than boys .
Lesbians tended to focus on their perceived inability to socialize a child of the opposite gender , and gay men most frequently cited concerns about boys being more likely to encounter harassment than girls .
The most common reason for preferring boys among heterosexual women was an inexplicable desire for a son , whereas heterosexual men's preference for a son reflected patriarchal norms , including keeping the family name going and gender identity considerations i.e. their own masculine interests .
When explaining their preference for a boy , lesbians most frequently mentioned their own atypical gender identities , including the fact that their own interests tended to be more masculine and tomboyish , whereas gay men most often highlighted that they felt more confident about their ability to raise and socialize boys .
Dr Goldberg concludes : " This study represents the first investigation known to date that explores the child gender preferences of both heterosexual and sexual minority preadoptive parents .
The data suggest that both the adoption context and the sexual orientation context may have implications for how men and women think about the gender of their future children . "

Do you remember how , a couple of years ago , you could tell someone who was clueless about computers to simply switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox , and that action alone would fix 90 % of all their security problems ?
This has n't been true for a while now , unfortunately .
The fact that Internet Explorer is still the most widely used browser out there , which makes it the biggest target , does n't mean that malicious hackers are n't exploiting security vulnerabilities on other browser platforms .
Today , Google has updated its web browser , Chrome , to version 1.0.154.64 , which fixes two serious security vulnerabilities .
One of those two lets a remote attacker execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged on user - pretty much the worst security problem one can have .
Google Chrome has a small market share , and once upon a time you did n't have to worry ( much ) even about critical security issues like this one , because no one would exploit them .
Nowadays , I 'm not so sure .
Recently , Mozilla also updated Firefox , fixing several security issues .
Just days after version 3.0.9 . was released , there was another security and stability update .
This may sound like business as usual , but security problems and updates for Firefox are showing up at an increasingly fast rate .
At the same time , malicious hackers have been running rampant on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter with a bunch of phishing attacks and hacks .
As a result , it 's once again getting harder and harder to feel safe online .
Although most web browsers are now regularly and automatically updated whenever a security issue is confirmed ( in Opera this functionality is coming in the next major version , Opera 10 ) , a large number of users never have the latest , most secure version of their web browser .
An interesting new paper on how different web browsers do security updates reveals that the implementation of this feature can have a big impact on the overall security .
Google Chrome is leading the pack ; it checks for updates every 5 hours , silently updates to the most secure version without the need to restart the browser , and does n't even let users disable the silent updates .
As a result , 97 % of users have the latest , most secure version installed .
For Firefox , this number is 85 % ; for Safari , 53 % , and for Opera , mere 24 % .
Draw your own conclusions , but hopefully , all the browsers will step up and do what they can to increase these numbers .
Right now , not having the latest version of the browser installed is very , very dangerous .
The movie " Jurassic Park " was a lesson in how resurrecting extinct organisms can go awry .
A new project plans to take a safer route : resurrect a single gene from an extinct species of bacteria .
This tiny snippet of DNA will be implanted in modern - day bacteria , with the goal of seeing whether evolution can be replayed in the lab .
In previous work , paleogeneticist Eric Gaucher from the Georgia Institute of Technology and his colleagues reconstructed earlier forms of a common gene by computing the way different lineages diverged to create the bacterial family tree .
" It is a bit like what historical linguists do when they infer the spelling or pronunciation of an ancient word from its modern derivatives , " Gaucher says .
" Except , we are working with the DNA alphabet . "
As part of NASA 's Astrobiology : Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology program , Gaucher and Betul Kacar , also from Georgia Tech , now plan to plug one of their reconstructed genes in a modern organism 's DNA .
If this genetic anachronism evolves forward along one of the branches that the researchers have computed , then this will provide some verification of this molecular genealogy technique , as well as give support to the notion that evolution is repeatable and not simply a matter of chance .
Ghosts in the code
It is hopeless to think that dinosaur DNA could be recovered from mosquito blood trapped in amber ( or from anywhere else for that matter ) , as the molecular code is n't likely to survive 65 million years .
The chances are far better for more recent extinctions .
A nearly complete DNA sequence of the woolly mammoth ( which died out about 11,000 years ago ) was published last November , giving some people ideas about bringing these giants back to life .
However , finding frozen hair and tissue samples is not the only way to isolate extinct DNA .
Gaucher and his colleagues have shown that it is possible to estimate the genes in organisms that lived several billions of years ago by doing a genetic survey of their family tree .
It is a bit like guessing what color your great - great - great grandmother 's eyes were by cataloguing the eye colors of all her living descendants and playing back the rules of inheritance .
In the case of gene reconstruction , Gaucher 's team estimates the DNA code of an extinct life form by comparing the codes of its living descendants and using theories of genetic mutations .
Sick with age
Gaucher and Kacar now plan to insert one of these ancient genes into a modern E. coli bacteria .
" These bacteria are going to be sick , " Gaucher explains .
That 's because this gene codes for an essential protein , but the outdated version being inserted into the organisms works best at a temperature of 55 degrees Celsius , far above the 37 degrees Celsius that E. coli prefers .
Like a molecular Rip Van Winkle , the ancient EF gene will feel strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to its new cooler surroundings .
" It 's difficult to see evolution , short of building a time machine , " Gaucher says , but their technique may be the next best thing .
The scientists will be verifying whether the mutations in the inserted gene follow the same path as was taken by the line of ancestor bacteria as they evolved over millions of years .
" I do believe that it is now possible , with tools that have recently been developed , to ' replay the molecular tape of life , ' even if it is one ( or a few ) molecules at a time , " says Belinda Chang of the University of Toronto , who is not involved in this work .

A River Falls father is accused of picking up his 10 - year - old son from school while intoxicated last week , then fleeing police and resisting arrest .
Mark Kotowski , 51 , is charged in Pierce County Circuit Court with attempting to flee or elude a traffic officer and misdemeanor charges of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated — his third such offense — and resisting an officer .
It was the quick thinking of the son — who locked Kotowski out of the car after he had stopped — that helped in his arrest , police said .
The episode began about 1:30 p.m. May 21 when a staff member at Rocky Branch Elementary School in River Falls told a school liaison officer that Kotowski had picked up his son and was possibly intoxicated , according to the police report .
The employee mimicked Kotowski ’s poor balance for the officer , swaying back and forth , and noted Kotowski had just left , the police report said .
Officer Chris Gottfredson found Kotowski in a car parked directly behind the officer ’s unmarked cruiser .
Kotowski ’s son was with him .
Gottfredson approached Kotowski , identified himself as a police officer and asked him to get out of the car , court records show .
Kotowski said , “ No , ” and began driving away as Gottfredson warned him he would be pursued if he left , the report states .
The officer got in his squad car and began following Kotowski ’s 1993 Audi 100S .
A speeding Kotowski almost crashed into another vehicle before stopping near his apartment in the 900 block of State Street , according to the report .
He then got out and began walking toward the front of the vehicle as Gottfredson ordered him to stop .
But Kotowski suddenly walked back toward the car and tried to get inside , only to find his son had leaned over and locked him out , the report said .
Kotowski continued to disobey orders and continued to resist even after Gottfredson used pepper spray to subdue him .
Kotowski then walked toward his apartment .
Eventually , with the help of an onlooker at the scene , Kotowski was brought outside , and officers arrested him , the report said .
Kotowski refused a preliminary breath test and later struggled with hospital staff and police as his blood was drawn , according to the police report .
River Falls Police Chief Roger Leque said the results of the blood test were pending .
Leque said Rocky Branch Elementary School staffers should be commended for alerting police .
A call to Principal Chuck Eaton was not immediately returned .
Attempts to contact Kotowski were unsuccessful Wednesday .
Charged on Friday , Kotowski ’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Monday .

PHYS771 Lecture 17 : Fun With the Anthropic Principle
Scott Aaronson
This is a lecture about the Anthropic Principle , and how you apply Bayesian reasoning where you have reason about the probability of your own existence , which seems like a very strange question .
It 's a fun question , though --- which you can almost define as a question where it 's much easier to have an opinion than to have a result .
But then , we can try to at least clarify the issues , and there are some interesting results that we can get .
There 's a central proposition that many people interested in rationality believe they should base their lives around --- even though they generally do n't in practice .
This is Bayes 's Theorem .
The term P[ E|H ] describes how likely you are to observe the evidence E in the case that the hypothesis H holds .
The remaining terms on the right - hand side , P [ H ] and P[ E ] , are the two tricky ones .
The first one describes the probability of the hypothesis being true , independent of any evidence , while the second describes the probability of the evidence being observed , averaged over all possible hypotheses .
Here , you 're making a commitment that there are such probabilities in the first place --- in other words , that it makes sense to talk about what the Bayesians call a prior .
When you 're an infant first born into the world , you estimate there 's some chance that you 're living on the third planet around the local star , some other chance you 're living on the fourth planet and so on .
That 's what a prior means : your beliefs before you 're exposed to any evidence about anything .
You can see already that maybe that 's a little bit of a fiction , but supposing you have such a prior , Bayes ' theorem tells you how to update it given new knowledge .
The proof of the theorem is trivial .
Multiply both sides by P[ E ] , and you get that P[ H|E ] P[ E ] = P[ E|H ] P [ H ] .
This is clearly true , since both sides are equal to the probability of the evidence and the hypothesis together .
So if Bayes '
Theorem seems unobjectionable , then I want to make you feel queasy about it .
That 's my goal .
The way to do that is to take the theorem very , very seriously as an account of how we should reason about the state of the world .
I 'm going to start with a nice thought experiment which is due to the philosopher Nick Bostrom .
This is called God 's Coin Toss .
Last lecture , I described the thought experiment as a puzzle .
Imagine that at the beginning of time , God flips a fair coin ( one that lands heads or tails with equal probability ) .
If the coin lands heads , then God creates two rooms : one has a person with a red hair and the other has a person with green hair .
If the coin lands tails , then God creates one room with a red - haired person .
Q : Are these rooms the entire universe ?
Scott : Yes , and these are the only people in the universe , in either case .
We also imagine that everyone knows the entire situation and that the rooms have mirrors .
Now suppose that you wake up , look in the mirror and learn your hair color .
What you really want to know is which way the coin landed .
Well , in one case , this is easy .
If you have green hair , then the coin must have landed heads .
Suppose that you find you have red hair .
Conditioned on that , what probability should you assign to the coin having landed heads ?
Q : So there 's no door to the other room ?
Scott :
That 's right .
You can't see the other room .
All you can see is the room that you 're in .
So does anyone have a guess ?
A : One half .
One half is the first answer that someone could suggest .
You could just say , " look , we know the coin was equally likely going to land heads or tails , and we know that in either case that there was going to be a red - haired person , so being red - haired does n't really tell you anything about which way it landed , and therefore it should be a half . "
Can anyone defend a different answer ?
A : It seems more likely for it to have landed tails , since in the heads case , the event of waking up with red hair is diluted with the other possible event of waking up with green hair .
The effect would be more dramatic if there were a hundred rooms with green hair .
Scott : Exactly .
Q : It is n't clear at all to me that the choice of whether you 're the red - or the green - haired person in the heads case is at all probabilistic .
We are n't guaranteed that .
Scott : Right .
This is a question .
Q : It could have been that before flipping the coin , God wrote down a rule saying that if the coin lands heads , make you red -haired .
Scott :
Well , then we have to ask , what do we mean by " you ? "
Before you 've looked in the mirror , you really do n't know what your hair color is .
It really could be either , unless you believe that it 's really a part of the " essence " of you to have red hair .
That is , if you believe that there is no possible state of the universe in which you had green hair , but otherwise would have been " you . "
Q : Are both people asked this question , then ?
Scott :
Well , the green - haired person certainly knows how to answer , but you can just imagine that the red - haired people in the heads and tails cases are both asked the question .
To make the argument a little more formal , you can just plop things into Bayes 's Theorem .
We want to know the probability P[ H|R ] that the coin landed heads , given that you have red hair .
We could do the calculation , using that the probability of us being red haired given that the coin lands heads is ½ , all else being equal .
There are two people , and you are n't a priori more likely to be either the red - haired or the green - haired person .
Now , the probability of heads is also ½ — that 's no problem .
What 's the total probability of your having red hair ?
That 's just given by P[ R|H ] P [ H ] + P[ R|T ] P [ T ] .
As we 've said before , if the coin lands tails , you certainly have red hair , so P[ R|T ] = 1 . Moreover , we 've already assumed that P[ R|H ] = ½.
Thus , what you get out is that P [ H|R ] = ¼ / ¾ = ⅓.
So , if we do the Bayesian calculation , it tells us that the probability should be ⅓ and not ½.
Does anyone see an assumption that you could make that would get the probability back to ½?
A : You could make the assumption that whenever you exist , you have red hair .
Scott : Yeah , that 's one way .
But is there a way to do it that does n't require a prior commitment about your hair color ?
Well , there is a way to do it , but it 's going to be a little bit strange .
One way is to point out that in the heads world , there are twice as many people in the first place .
So you could say that you 're a priori twice as likely to exist in a world with twice as many people .
In other words , you could say that your own existence is a piece of evidence you should condition upon .
I guess if you want to make this concrete , the metaphysics that this would correspond to is that there 's some sort of a warehouse full of souls , and depending on how many people there are in the world , a certain number of souls get picked out and placed into bodies .
You should say that in a world with more people , it would be more likely that you'd be picked at all .
If you do make that assumption , then you can run through the same Bayesian ringer .
You find that the assumption precisely negates the effect of reasoning that if the coin landed heads , then you could have had green hair .
So you get back to ½.
Thus , we see that depending on how you want to do it , you can get an answer of either a third or a half .
It 's possible that there are other answers that could be defended , but these seem like the most plausible two .
That was a fairly serene thought experiment .
Can we make it more dramatic ?
Q : Part of the reason that this feels like philosophy is that there are n't any real stakes here .
Scott : Exactly .
Let 's get closer to something with real stakes in it .
The next thought experiment is , I think , due to the philosopher John Leslie .
Let 's call it the Dice Room .
Imagine that there 's a very , very large population of people in the world , and that there 's a madman .
What this madman does is , he kidnaps ten people and puts them in a room .
He then throws a pair of dice .
If the dice land snake - eyes , then he simply murders everyone in the room .
If the dice do not land snake - eyes , then he releases everyone , then kidnaps 100 people .
He now does the same thing : he rolls two dice ; if they land snake - eyes then he kills everyone , and if they do n't land snake - eyes , then he releases them and kidnaps 1,000 people .
He keeps doing this until he gets snake - eyes , at which point he 's done .
So now , imagine that you 've been kidnapped .
You can assume either that you do or do not know how many other people are in the room .
Q : Have you been watching the news ?
Scott :
You have been watching the news and you know the entire situation .
That 's always a convenient assumption .
So you 're in the room .
Conditioned on that fact , how worried should you be ?
How likely is it that you 're going to die ?
A : 1/36 .
Scott : OK .
That would be one guess .
One answer is that the dice have a 1/36 chance of landing snake - eyes , so you should be only a " little bit " worried ( considering ) .
A second reflection you could make is to consider , of people who enter the room , what the fraction is of people who ever get out .
Let 's say that it ends at 1,000 .
Then , 110 people get out and 1,000 die .
If it ends at 10,000 , then 1,110 people get out and 10,000 die .
In either case , about 8/9 of the people who ever go into the room will die .
Q : But that 's not conditioning on the full set of information .
That 's just conditioning on the fact that I 'm in the room at some point .
Scott :
But you 'll basically get the same answer , no matter what time you go into the room .
No matter when you assume the process terminates , about 8/9 of the people who ever enter the room will be killed .
For each termination point , you can imagine being a random person in the set of rooms leading up to that point .
In that case , you 're much more likely to die .
Q : But are n't you conditioning on future events ?
Scott : Yes , but the point is that we can remove that conditioning .
We can say that we 're conditioning on a specific termination point , but that no matter what that point is , we get the same answer .
It could be 10 steps or 50 steps , but no matter what the termination point is , almost all the people who go into the room are going to die , because the number of people is increasing exponentially .
If you 're a Bayesian , then this kind of seems like a problem .
You could see this as a bizarre madman - related thought experiment , or if you preferred to , you could defend the view that this is the actual situation the human species is in .
We 'd like to know what the probability is that we 're going to suffer some cataclysm or go extinct for some reason .
It could be an asteroid hitting the earth , nuclear war , global warming or whatever else .
So there are kind of two ways of looking at it .
The first way is to say that all of these risks seem pretty small --- they have n't killed us yet !
There have been many generations , and in each one , there have been people predicting imminent doom and it never materialized .
So we should condition on that and assign a relatively small probability to our generation being the one to go extinct .
That 's the argument that conservatives like to make ; I 'll call it the Chicken Little Argument .
Against that , there 's the argument that the population has been increasing exponentially , and that if you imagine that the population increases exponentially until it exhausts the resources of the planet and collapses , then the vast majority of the people who ever lived will live close to the end , much like in the dice room .
Even supposing that with each generation there 's only a small chance of doom , the vast majority of the people ever born will be there close to when that chance materializes .
Q : But it still seems to me like that 's conditioning on a future event .
Even if the answer is the same no matter which future event you choose , you 're still conditioning on one of them .
Scott :
Well , if you believe in the axioms of probability theory , then if p = P [ A|B ] = P [ A|¬B ] , then P [ A ] = p .
Q : Yes , but we 're not talking about B and ¬B , we 're talking about an infinite list of choices .
Scott :
So you 're saying the infiniteness makes a difference here ?
Q : Basically .
It 's not clear to me that you can just take that limit , and not worry about it .
If your population is infinite , maybe the madman gets really unlucky and is just failing to roll snake - eyes for all eternity .
Scott : OK , we can admit that the lack of an upper bound on the number of rolls could maybe complicate matters .
However , one can certainly give variants of this thought experiment that do n't involve infinity .
The argument that I 've been talking about goes by the name of The Doomsday Argument .
What it 's basically saying is that you should assign to the event of a cataclysm in the near future a much higher probability that you might naïvely think , because of this sort of reasoning .
One can give a completely finitary version of the Doomsday Argument .
Just imagine for simplicity that there are only two possibilities : Doom Soon and Doom Late .
In one , the human race goes extinct very soon , whereas in the other it colonizes the galaxy .
In each case , we can write down the number of people who will ever have existed .
For the sake of discussion , suppose 80 billion people will have existed in the Doom Soon case , as opposed to 80 quadrillion in the Doom Late case .
So now , suppose that we 're at the point in history where almost 80 billion people have lived .
Now , you basically apply the same sort of argument as in God 's Coin Toss .
You can make it stark and intuitive .
If we 're in the Doom Late situation , then the vast , vast majority of the people who will ever have lived will be born after us .
We 're in the very special position of being in the first 80 billion humans --- we might as well be Adam and Eve !
If we condition on that , we get a much lower probability of being in the Doom Late case than of being in the Doom Soon case .
If you do the Bayesian calculation , you 'll find that if naïvely view the two cases are equally likely , then after applying the Doomsday reasoning , we 're almost certainly in the Doom Soon case .
For conditioned on being in the Doom Late case , we almost certainly would not be in the special position of being amongst the first 80 billion people .
Maybe I should give a little history .
The Doomsday Argument was introduced by a astrophysicist named Brandon Carter in 1974 .
The argument was then discussed intermittently throughout the 80s .
Richard Gott , who was also an astrophysicist , proposed the " mediocrity principle " : if you view the entire history of the human race from a timeless perspective , then all else being equal we should be somewhere in the middle of that history .
That is , the number of people who live after us should not be too much different from the number of people who lived before us .
If the population is increasing exponentially , then that 's very bad news , because it means that humans are not much longer for the world .
This argument seems intuitively appealing , but has been largely rejected because it does n't really fit into the Bayesian formalism .
Not only is it not clear what the prior distribution is , but you may have special information that indicates that you are n't likely to be in the middle .
So the modern form of the Doomsday Argument , which was formalized by Bostrom , is the Bayesian form where you just assume that you have some prior over the possible cases .
Then , all the argument says is that you have to take your own existence into account and adjust the prior .
Bostrom has a book about this where he concludes that the resolution of the Doomsday Argument really depends on how you 'd resolve the God 's Coin Toss puzzle .
If you give ⅓ as your answer to the puzzle , that corresponds to the Self - Sampling Assumption ( SSA ) that you can sample a world according to your prior distribution and then sample a person within that world at random .
is called the Self - Sampling Assumption ( SSA ) .
If you make that assumption about how to apply Bayes 's Theorem , then it seems very hard to escape the doomsday conclusion .
If you want to negate that conclusion , then you need an assumption he calls the Self - Indication Assumption ( SIA ) .
That assumption says that you are more likely to exist in a world with more beings than one with less beings .
You would say in the Doomsday Argument that if the " real " case is the Doom Late case , then while it 's true that you are much less likely to be one of the first 80 billion people , it 's also true that because there 's so many more people , you 're much more likely to exist in the first place .
If you make both assumptions , then they cancel each other out , taking you back to your original prior distribution over Doom Soon and Doom Late , in exactly the same way that making the SIA led us to get back to ½ in the coin toss puzzle .
On this view , it all boils down to which of the SSA and SIA you believe .
There are some arguments against Doomsday that do n't accept these presuppositions at all , but those arguments themselves are open to different objections .
One of the most common arguments that you hear against Doomsday is that cavemen could have made the same argument , but that they would have been completely wrong .
The problem with that argument is that the Doomsday Argument does n't at all ignore that effect .
Sure , some people who make the argument will be wrong ; the point is that the vast majority will be right .
Q : It seems as though there 's a tension between wanting to be right yourself and wanting to design policies that try to maximize the number of people who are right .
Scott :
That 's interesting .
Q : Here 's a variation I want to make on the red room business : suppose that God has a biased coin such that with 0.9 probability , there 's one red and many , many greens .
With 0.1 probability , there 's just a red .
In either case , in the red - haired person 's room , there 's a button .
You have the option to push the button or not .
If you 're in the no-greens case , you get a cookie if you press the button , whereas if you 're in the many - greens case , you get punched in the face if you press the button .
You have to decide whether to press the button .
So now , if I use the SSA and find that I 'm in a red room , then probably we 're in the no-greens case and I should press the button .
Scott : Absolutely .
It 's clear that what probabilities you assign to different states of the world can influence what decisions you consider to be rational .
That , in some sense , is why we care about any of this .
There 's also an objection to the Doomsday Argument that denies that it 's valid at all to talk about you being drawn from some class of observers .
" I 'm not a random person , I 'm just me . "
The response to that is that there are clearly cases where you think of yourself as a random observer .
For example , suppose there 's a drug that kills 99 % of the people who take it , but such that 1 % are fine .
Are you going to say that since you are n't a random person , the fact that it kills 99 % of the people is completely irrelevant ?
Are you going to just take it anyway ?
So for many purposes , you do think of yourself as being drawn over some distribution of people .
The question is when is such an assumption valid and when is n't it ?
Q : I guess to me , there 's a difference between being drawn from a uniform distribution of people and a uniform distribution of time .
Do you weight the probability of being alive in a given time by the population at that time ?
Scott : I agree ; the temporal aspect does introduce something unsettling into all of this .
Later , we 'll get to puzzles that do n't have a temporal aspect .
We 'll see what you think of those .
Q : I 've also sometimes wondered " why am I a human ? "
Maybe I 'm not a random human , but a random fragment of consciousness .
In that case , since humans have more brain matter than other animals , I 'm much more likely to be a human .
Scott : Another question is if you 're more likely to be someone who lives for a long time .
We can go on like this .
Suppose that there 's lots of extraterrestrials .
Does that change the Doomsday reasoning ?
Almost certainly , you would n't have been a human at all .
Q : Maybe this is where you 're going , but it seems like a lot of this comes down to what you even mean by a probability .
Do you mean that you 're somehow encoding a lack of knowledge , or that something is truly random ?
With the Doomsday Argument , has the choice of Doom Soon or Doom Late already been fixed ?
With that drug argument , you could say , " no , I 'm not randomly chosen — I am me — but I do n't know this certain property of me . "
Scott :
That is one of the issues here .
I think that as long as you 're using Bayes 's Theorem in the first place , you may have made some commitment about that .
You certainly made a commitment that it makes sense to assign probabilities to the events in question .
Even if we imagine the world was completely deterministic , and we 're just using all this to encode our own uncertainty , then a Bayesian would tell you that 's what you should do anytime you 're uncertain about anything , no matter what the reason .
You must have some prior over the possible answers , and you just assign probabilities and start updating them .
Certainly , if you take that view and try to be consistent about it , then you 're led to strange situations like these .
As the physicist John Baez has pointed out , anthropic reasoning is kind of like science on the cheap .
When you do more experiments , you can get more knowledge , right ?
Checking to see if you exist is always an experiment that you can do easily .
The question is , what can you learn from having done it ?
It seems like there are some situations where it 's completely unobjectionable and uncontroversial to use anthropic reasoning .
One example is asking why the Earth is 93 million miles away from the Sun and not some other distance .
Can we derive 93 million miles as some sort of a physical constant , or get the number from first principles ?
It seems clear that we can't , and it seems clear that to the extent that there 's an explanation , it has to be that if Earth were much closer , it would be too hot and life would n't have evolved , whereas if it were much further , it'd be too cold .
This is called the " Goldilocks Principle " : of course , life is going to only arise on those planets that are at the right temperature for life to evolve .
It seems like even if there 's a tiny chance of life evolving on a Venus or a Mars , it 'd still be vastly more likely that life would evolve on a planet roughly our distance from the Sun , and so the reasoning still holds .
Then there are much more ambiguous situations .
This is actually a current issue in physics , which the physicists argue over .
Why is the fine structure constant roughly 1/137 and not some other value ?
You can give arguments to the effect that if it were much different , we would n't be here .
Q : Is that the case like with the inverse - square law of gravity ?
If it were n't r⁸² , but just a little bit different , would the universe be kind of clumpy ?
Scott : Yes .
That 's absolutely right .
In the case of gravity , though , we can say that general relativity explains why it's an inverse square and not anything else , as a direct consequence of space having three dimensions .
Q : But we would n't need that kind of advanced explanation if we just did science on the cheap and said " it 's gotta be this way by the Anthropic Principle . "
Scott :
This is exactly what people who object to the Anthropic Principle are worried about — that people will just get lazy and decide that there 's no need to do any experiment about anything , because the world just is how it is .
If it were any other way , we would n't be us ; we'd be observers in a different world .
Q : But the Anthropic Principle does n't predict , does it ?
Scott : Right , in many cases , that 's exactly the problem .
The principle does n't seem to constrain things before we 've seen them .
The reductio ad absurdum that I like is where a kid asks her parents why the moon is round .
" Clearly , if the moon were square , you would n't be you , but you would be the counterpart of you in a square - moon universe .
Given that you are you , clearly the moon has to be round . "
The problem being that if you had n't seen the moon yet , you could n't make a prediction .
On the other hand , if you knew that life was much more likely to evolve on a planet that 's 93 million miles away from the Sun than 300 million miles away , then even before you 'd measured the distance , you could make such a prediction .
In some cases , it seems like the principle really does give you predictions .
Q : So apply the principle exactly when it gives you a concrete prediction ?
Scott :
That would be one point of view , but I guess one question would be what if the prediction comes out wrong ?
Like a student said before , this does feel like it 's just philosophy .
You can set things up , though , so that real decisions depend on it .
Maybe you 've heard of the surefire way of winning the lottery : buy a lottery ticket and if it does n't win , then you kill yourself .
Then , you clearly have to condition on being alive to ask the question of whether you are alive or not , and so because you 're asking the question , you must be alive , and thus must have won the lottery .
What can you say about this ?
You can say that in actual practice , most of us do n't accept as a decision - theoretic axiom that you 're allowed to condition on remaining alive .
You could jump off a building and condition on there happening to be a trampoline or something that will rescue you .
You have to take into account the possibility that your choices are going to kill you .
On the other hand , tragically , some people do kill themselves .
Was this in fact what they were doing ?
Were they eliminating the worlds where things did n't turn out how they wanted ?
Of course , everything must come back to complexity theory at some point .
And indeed , certain versions of the anthropic principle should have consequences for computation .
We 've already seen how it could be the case with the lottery example .
Instead of winning the lottery , you want to do something even better : solve an NP - complete problem .
You could use the same approach .
Pick a random solution , check if it 's satisfying , and if it is n't , kill yourself .
Incidentally , there is a technical problem with that algorithm .
Does anyone see what it is ?
A : Is there a solution at all ?
Scott : Right .
If there 's no solution then you 'd seem to be in trouble .
On the other hand , there 's actually a very simple fix to this problem .
A : Add some dummy string like *n that acts as a " get out of jail free " card .
Scott : Exactly .
So we say that there are these 2n possible solutions , and that there 's also this dummy solution you pick with some tiny probability like 2 - 2n .
If you pick the dummy solution , then you do nothing .
Otherwise , you kill yourself if and only if the solution you picked is unsatisfying .
Conditioned upon their being no solution and your being alive , then you 'll have picked the dummy solution .
Otherwise , if there is a solution , you 'll almost certainly have picked a satisfying solution , again conditioned on your being alive .
As you might expect , you can define a complexity class based on this principle : BPP path .
Recall the definition of BPP : the class of problems solvable by a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm with bounded error .
That is , if the answer to a problem is " yes , " at least 2/3 of the BPP machine 's paths must accept , whereas if the answer is " no , " then at most 1/3 of the paths must accept .
So BPP path is just the same , except that the computation paths can all have different lengths .
They have to be polynomial , but they can be different .
A simple argument shows that BPP path is equivalent to a class which I 'll call PostBPP ( BPP with post selection ) .
PostBPP is again the set of problems solvable by a polynomial time probabilistic algorithm where again you have the 2/3 - 1/3 acceptance condition , but now if you do n't like your choice of random bits , then you can just kill yourself .
You can condition on having chosen random bits such that you remain alive .
Physicists call this postselection .
You can postselect on having random bits with some very special property .
Conditioned on having that property , a " yes " answer should cause 2/3 of the paths to accept , and a " no " answer should cause no more than 1/3 to accept .
Can you see why this is equivalent to BPP path ?
Q : First , I 'm a little unclear on the difference between BPP and BPP path .
You said that the computation paths are of different lengths .
The way I 've always seen BPP , you 're making random choices , but you can make a different number on each path .
Scott : OK .
Here 's the point : in BPP path , if a choice leads to more different paths , then it can get counted more .
Let 's say for example that in 2n − 1 branches , we just accept or reject --- that is , we just halt --- but in one branch , we 're going to flip more coins and do something more .
In BPP path , we can make one branch completely dominate all the other branches .
I 've shown an example of this in the figure at right –suppose we want branch colored in red to dominate everything else .
Then we can hang a whole tree from that path , and it will dominate the paths we do n't want ( colored in black ) .
A : So you just find one path you like , and then just sit there flipping a coin for a while ?
Scott : Exactly , that 's basically a proof that PostBPP ⊆ BPP path .
Given an algorithm with postselection , you make a bunch of random choices and if you like them , you make a bunch more random choices , and those paths overwhelm the paths where you did n't like your random bits .
What about the other direction ?
BPP path ⊆ PostBPP ?
The point is , in BPP path we 've got this tree of paths that have different lengths .
What we could do is complete it to make a balanced binary tree .
Then , we could use postselection to give all these ghost paths suitably lower probabilities than the true paths , and thereby simulate BPP path in PostBPP .
Q : Can you go over the definition of PostBPP again ?
Scott : Yes .
PostBPP is the class of all languages L for which there exist polynomial time Turing machines A and B ( A being the thing that decides whether to accept or reject and B being the thing that decides to postselect ) such that for every x∈L , Pr r [ A ( x , r ) | B( x , r ) ] ≥ 2/3 and such that for every x∉L , Pr r [ A ( x , r ) | B( x , r ) ] ≤ 1/3 .
As a technical issue , we also require that Pr [ B( x , r ) ] >
0 .
Now that we know that PostBPP = BPP path , we can ask how big BPP path is .
By the argument we gave before , NP ⊆ BPP path .
Q : The argument we gave before picked the dummy solution with exponentially small , but non-zero probability .
Scott :
That 's right , but remember that 's allowed here .
It still satisfies our bounded - error conditions .
On the other hand , is NP = BPP path ?
Certainly , that 's going to be hard to show , even if it 's true .
One reason is that BPP path is closed under complement .
Another reason is that it contains BPP .
In fact , you can show that BPP path contains MA and P||NP ( P with parallel queries to an NP oracle ) .
I 'll leave that as an exercise .
In the other direction , it 's possible to show that BPP path is contained in BPP| |NP , and thus in the polynomial hierarchy .
Under a derandomization hypothesis , then , we find that the anthropic principle gives you the same computational power as P||NP .
Q : How does BPP path relate to PP ?
Scott :
That 's a great question .
BPP path ⊆ PP .
Q : PP is so huge .
Scott :
Why is BPP path ⊆ PP ?
Deciding whether to accept or reject is kind of this exponential summation problem .
You can say that each of the paths which is a dummy path contributes both an accept and a reject , while each of the accepting paths contributes two accepts and each of the rejecting paths contributes two rejects .
Then , just ask if there are more accepts than rejects .
That will simulate it in PP .
Of course , none of this would be complete if we did n't consider quantum postselection .
That 's what I wanted to end with .
In direct analogy to PostBPP , we can define PostBQP as the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer with the power of post selection .
What I mean is that this is the class of problems where you get to perform a polynomial - time quantum computation and then you get to make some measurement .
If you do n't like the measurement outcome , you get to kill yourself and condition on still being alive .
Q : Right , but is the B in the definition of PostBPP classical or quantum ?
Scott :
In PostBQP , we 're going to have to define things a bit differently , because there 's no analog of r.
Instead , we 'll say that you perform a polynomial - time quantum computation , make a measurement that accepts with probability greater than 0 , and then condition on the outcome of that measurement .
Finally , you perform a further measurement on the reduced quantum state that tells you whether to accept or reject .
If the answer to the problem is " yes , " then the second measurement should accept with probability at least 2/3 , conditioned on the first measurement accepting .
Likewise , if the answer to the problem is " no , " the second measurement should accept with probability at most 1/3 , conditioned on the first measurement accepting .
Then , we can ask how powerful PostBQP is .
One of the first things you can say is that certainly , PostBPP ⊆ PostBQP .
That is , we can simulate a classical computer with post selection .
In the other direction , we have PostBQP ⊆ PP .
There 's this proof that BQP ⊆ PP due to Adleman , DeMorrais and Huang .
In that proof , they basically do what physicists would call a Feynman path integral , where you sum over all possible contributions to each of the final amplitudes .
It 's just a big PP computation .
From my point of view , Feynman won the Nobel Prize in physics for showing that BQP ⊆ PP , though he did n't state it that way .
Anyway , the proof easily generalizes to show that PostBQP ⊆ PP , because you just have to restrict your summation to those paths where you end up in one of those states you postselect on .
You can make all the other paths not matter by making them contribute an equal number of pluses and minuses .
Q : Once you postselect , can you postselect later on as well ?
Scott : Can you simulate multiple postselections with one postselection ?
That 's another great question .
The answer is yes .
We get to that by using the so - called Principle of Deferred Measurement , which tells us that in any quantum computation , we can assume without loss of generality that there 's only one measurement at the end .
You can simulate all the other measurements using controlled - NOT gates , and then just not look at the qubits containing the measurement outcomes .
The same thing holds for postselection .
You can save up all the postselections until the end .
What I showed three years ago is that the other direction holds as well : PP ⊆ PostBQP .
In particular , this means that quantum postselection is much more powerful than classical postselection , which seems kind of surprising .
Classical postselection leaves you in the polynomial hierarchy while quantum postselection takes you up to the counting classes , which we think of as much larger .
Let 's run through the proof .
So we 've got some Boolean function f : { 0,1}n → {0,1} where f is efficiently computable .
Let s be the number of inputs x for which f( x ) =
1 . Our goal is to decide whether s ≥ 2 n - 1 .
This is clearly a PP - complete problem .
For simplicity , we will assume without loss of generality that s >
0 .
Now using standard quantum computing tricks ( which I 'll skip ) , it 's relatively easy to prepare a single - qubit state like :
α , β
α , β
In the second case , where s ≥ 2n - 1 , the amplitude of |1 〉 is never positive , no matter what α and β are set to , while the amplitude of |0〉 is always positive .
Hence , the state always stays in the lower - right quadrant .
Now , as we vary β/α through a polynomial number of values , |ψ α , β 〉 never gets close to |+〉.
This is a detectable difference .
So I wrote this up , thinking it was a kind of cute proof .
A year later , I realized that there 's this Beigel - Reingold - Spielman Theorem which showed that PP is closed under intersection .
That is , if two languages are both in PP , then the AND of those two languages is also in PP .
This solved a problem that was open for 20 years .
What I noticed is that PostBQP is trivially closed under intersection , because if you want to find the intersection of two PostBQP languages , just run their respective PostBQP machines and postselect on both computations giving a valid outcome , and then see if they both accept .
You can use amplification to stay within the right error bounds .
Since PostBQP is trivially closed under intersection , it provides an alternate proof that PP is closed under intersection that I think is much simpler than the original proof .
The way to get this simpler proof really is by thinking about quantum anthropic postselection .
It 's like a higher - level programming language for constructing the " threshold polynomials " that Beigel - Reingold - Spielman needed for their theorem to work .
It 's just that quantum mechanics and postselection give you a much more intuitive way of constructing these polynomials .
I just had a couple puzzles to leave you with .
You asked about the temporal aspect and how it introduced additional confusion into the Doomsday Argument .
There 's one puzzle that does n't involve any of that , but which is still quite unsettling .
This puzzle — also due to Bostrom — is called the Presumptuous Philosophers .
Imagine that physicists have narrowed the possibilities for a final theory of physics down to two a priori equally likely possibilities .
The main difference between them is that Theory 1 predicts that the universe is a billion times bigger than Theory 2 does .
In particular , assuming the universe is relatively homogenous ( which both theories agree about ) , Theory 2 predicts that there are going to be about a billion times as many sentient observers in the universe .
So the physicists are planning on building a massive particle accelerator to distinguish the two theories — a project that will cost many billions of dollars .
Now , the philosophers come along and say that Theory 2 is the right one to within a billion - to - one confidence , since conditioned on Theory 2 being correct , we 're a billion times more likely to exist in the first place .
The question is whether the philosophers should get the Nobel Prize in Physics for their " discovery . "
Of course , what the philosophers are assuming here is the Self - Indication Assumption .
So here 's where things stand with the SSA and SIA .
The SSA leads to the Doomsday Argument , while the SIA leads to Presumptuous Philosophers .
It seems like whichever one you believe , you get a bizarre consequence .
Finally , if we want to combine the anthropic computing idea with the Doomsday Argument , then there 's the Adam and Eve puzzle .
Suppose that Adam and Eve are the first two observers , and that what they 'd really like is to solve an instance of an NP - complete problem , say 3SAT .
To do so , they pick a random assignment , and form a very clear intention beforehand that if the assignment happens to be satisfying , then they wo n't have any kids , whereas if the assignment is not satisfying , then they will go forth and multiply .
Now , let 's assume the SSA .
Then , conditioned on having chosen an unsatisfying assignment , how likely is it that they would be an Adam and Eve in the first place , as opposed to one of the vast number of future observers ?
If we assume that they 'll ultimately have ( say ) 22n descendants , then the probability would seem to be at most 2 - 2n +
1 . Therefore , conditioned upon the fact that they are the first two observers , the SSA predicts that with overwhelming probability , they will pick a satisfying assignment .
If you 're a hardcore Bayesian , you can take your pick between SSA and SIA and swallow the consequences either way !

' The reality is that 43,000 dealerships is not a reality , ' says Zag founder Scott Painter
The once vaunted car industry has been brought to its knees , partly because of the economy , and mainly because of self - inflicted bad management and lack of innovation .
Now , the heads of the iconic auto institutions are being dethroned - well , at least at General Motors .
While there 's a bunch of talk about the government 's double standards toward how it 's treating Detroit and Wall Street , you wo n't hear much support to go easy on auto companies from Silicon Valley types .
In this segment , Zag 's founder Scott Painter sits down with Bambi Francisco in the second - part interview to talk about why Washington - despite its tough love bailout ultimatum - should n't be bailing out the car companies .
" It 's horrible , " he said , referring to government 's bailout plans .
" We have a protectionist system that prevents market forces from doing their job . "
The auto industry has to change , and it's not necessarily up to the tax payers to make sure that happens .
Why are there 43,000 car dealerships ?
Painter asked .
That 's not rational .
Bankruptcy would clean out the system and get the car industry operating rationally again .
Zag is a new online car - buying service .
It 's the second car startup in Painter 's career as an entrepreneur .
So , he 's got a thing or two to say about the auto industry he 's trying to modernize .
Watch the interview or read the interview ( partly edited ) .
BF : What is the problem with how cars are being bought today ?
SP : I think there is a true retail revolution occurring .
I think the way that cars are sold is fundamentally shifting because dealers are looking for customers in all new ways .
It really stems from the fact that customers are shopping differently than they have .
So the car industry is 100 years old .
Customers for 100 years , have been walking into their local car dealership , saying , ' Give me a brochure , Tell me about the car ; Is it good ? '
But thanks to Henry Ford , all cars are good .
Today , most customers today get their information via the Web .
When they get into the dealership , it 's not about getting the brochure at a dealership .
It really comes down to a price negotiation which really reflects the fact that a car is becoming more of a commodity than ever before .
The way that commodities are sold is through transparency .
That 's the ultimate application of the Web .
The true promise of the Internet is the power of information to level inefficiencies in markets .
And so we 're excited that we are a part of that inflection point .
I see that the economy shifting is having a catalytic effect on dealers going out of business and it's getting a lot of inefficiencies of the business .
The winners are going to be the dealers that are able to control their costs , find customers , and provide a great upfront price .
Dealers who embrace it are going to win .
Dealers who hold back and try to revolve or focus on the optimization of the price are going to lose and go out of business more quickly now than ever before .
It is a revolution and all to the benefit of the consumer and the dealer who actually embraces it .
BF : Your bet is that with services like yours , more dealerships will go out of business ?
SP : Well I actually look at it the other way .
The dealerships we partner with will thrive .
So if you really look at the dealership landscape really look like ?
I 'm from LA but we 've got over 200 Ford stores in southern California all selling the same certain brands .
There are 60 Toyota stores .
The paragon of efficiency .
I do n't know how many stores you need but it is probably closer to nine .
I mean that would give you a Toyota store that would be very convenient for your location and at the same time you would n't have competition between the dealers .
You would have much more efficient showrooms , much more efficient lots , and you would have a much better margin for the dealer .
So I think there has to be a real alignment of the entire business .
There has to be pain .
Some dealers are going to get out of the business and some dealers will remain to survive .
I do believe that we are one of the companies who happens to be in an exciting spot to control the customer at the beginning of the conversation as opposed to waiting for them to walk in the door .
BF : What do you think about government bailouts for the auto industry ?
SP : I think it 's horrible .
I think that markets that are supposed to act rationally .
I think part of the reason that we have a problem with the auto business is that we have unions , we have franchise laws , we have a protectionist system that prevents market forces , supply and demand , from doing their job .
And , the reality is that 43,000 dealers is not a market reality .
The reason why you would have this many is because the franchise system was built on the idea that , ' We could sell more franchises out there , we can get more footprint out there , more service revenue , etc . '
Today if you look at what happens in the case of bankruptcy is that you get to get rid of a bunch of creepy things that would prevent the car business from actually behaving rationally .
One that has nothing to do with auto retail is equally important is that when the price of fuel spiked 100 % , there was a permanent shift in consumer preference for cars that get better gas mileage .
And the American car companies , such as General Motors , Chrysler , and Ford really had not prepared their product line - up to match that radical shift in consumer preference .
And as a result , you 're going to have time to go back and retool the line , and build the product , which is an 18 - 24 month cycle .
So they just do n't have product in the line up today .
And what that means is that they 've got these huge investments in manufacturing SUVs .
And , now they 've shut down those plants .
What are they going to do with these huge investments ?
It 's going to kill them .
One of the great things about bankruptcy is you get to write off and get rid of those legacy investments that are no longer applicable and they could n't have necessarily predicted this but they work caught flat - footed .
BF : Right .
Well you are innovating to help the consumer at least .
SP : I think we are innovating to help them ( not just the consumer ) .
But we 're doing is absolutely the key to success in the auto industry .
We are bringing transparency , which is absolutely important .
We 're bringing an upfront price and we 're bringing customers .
Right now , if you 're a dealer , you are struggling for customers and we 've got people who are ready to buy cars .
But what they expect in this environment is a great upfront price , a better experience , and a dealer who plays ball .
BF : Well I 've always said Washington should look to Silicon Valley or LA or innovation to console their problems as opposed to bailing out Detroit .
SP : I think the free market is a pretty good solution .
Like its real counterpart , this Battleship Yamato is the biggest Lego ship ever constructed .
At 22 feet long , it took 6 years and 4 months to complete by one of our Lego contest winners .
[ Updated ]

The Yamato — along with her sister ship Musashi — was the largest battleship ever constructed : 862 feet and 10 inches long and 121 feet long at its widest point .
Made by Jumpei Mitsui , the Lego version was constructed at minifig scale ( 1/40 ) , which is an amazing task that resulted in these specs :

• 22 feet long .
• 3 feet wide .
• 330 pounds .
• More than 200,000 Lego pieces .
And of course , it looks amazing :

The real Yamato was sunk trying to reach Okinawa in a suicide mission .
The plan — under Operation Ten - Go — was to beach her near Okinawa in order to use its nine 18.1 - inch 40 cm /45
Type 94 naval guns — the largest ever in any warship — as unsinkable artillery against American ground forces .
Fortunately for Allied forces , it failed :
Two US submarines spotted it and it was destroyed by 320 aircraft in two waves from Task Force 58 , resulting in an explosion that was seen from 100 miles away .

Update : Jumpei Mitsui answered a couple of my questions about his stunning model :
Jesus Diaz :
What was the most difficult part ?
Jumpei Mitsui :
It 's a very hard work to express the curves of the bow .
Yamato has a distinct curve at the bow , which I repeated four times to could get the perfect curve .
That means I completely destroyed and made it four times .

It also took more than three years to get the idea about how to make The Chrysanthemum — the symbol of Japanese emperor — correctly .
I think that what I got was the best way to express it with Lego without using glue or a rubber band .
JD : And besides the time spent in the project , how much do all the pieces cost ?
JM : It 's very diffcult to say how much because almost all of the Yamato ( 99.99 % ) is made of old grey bricks .
But I 'm sure that it would costs millions of yen if I got all the pieces new .
Humanity ’s bug - infested past might be why we have more allergies today ( Image : James Gathany / Center for Disease Control and Prevention , USA )
It is well established that intestinal parasites dampen mammalian immune reactions .
But in a surprise result , scientists have found that another kind of parasite – the body louse – does too .
That means the epidemic of allergic disorders in modern , urban people might be due to our having rid ourselves of lice and worms .
The “ hygiene hypothesis ” holds that our immune systems evolved to compensate for continual infections with parasitic gut worms , which secrete chemicals that reduce our immune responses .
People who are now worm - free have overreactive immune systems , which can lead to asthma and autoimmune disorders .
Yet mammals ’ immune systems have mainly been studied in clean , well - fed and parasite - free lab mice .
Jan Bradley , a parasitologist at Nottingham Universtiy , UK , and colleagues reasoned that normal , wild mice might be different .

Need for nasties
The researchers trapped 100 wood mice in the fields around Nottingham and measured their loads of several different parasites , including various worms , mites , ticks , fleas and lice .
As expected , immune cells from mice with roundworms produced less of an inflammatory chemical called TNF - alpha in response to germs than cells from uninfected mice .
But surprisingly , says Bradley , mice with heavy louse infestations showed even stronger immune suppression , producing half as much TNF - alpha as uninfested mice .
None of the other parasites , nor the animal ’s age , sex or general condition , was related to the production of the immune chemical , suggesting that it was n’t just a matter of stressed or sickly animals having more lice and less immunity .
“ The hygiene hypothesis was always associated just with worm infections , but this shows other kinds of parasites may have the same effect , ” Bradley says .
That means ridding ourselves of lice , as well as worms and perhaps other parasites , might have caused the modern epidemic of immune hypersensitivity .
Bradley wants to delouse wild mice to see whether this reverses the immune suppression in them or their descendants .

Exchange Traded Funds : Trading Funds Like Stocks
One of the hottest investment trends right now is the use of exchange traded funds ( ETFs ) .
ETFs are distinguished by their low costs , diversification and the ease with which they are traded — like stocks .
ETFs are known for their “ average Joe ” appeal , as well as their ability to cater to high - end investors .
Because ETFs are traded like stocks , there are no minimums and you can buy only one share if you like .
For the average investor , this makes ETFs easy and , with the advent of low - cost online brokerages , cost - efficient .
Dollar cost averaging is now something that can be profitable for ordinary folks who want to invest in ETFs .
For the sophisticated investor , ETF strategies include options , pairs trading and even a bit of side - stepping that can help you avoid the wash - sale rule .
What are exchange traded funds ?
An ETF is a collection of stocks .
However , that entire collection is traded on a market as if it were a single investment .
A large investment institution — such as Vanguard or Fidelity — takes some of its holdings ( in our example we ’ll use stocks ) and put together a basket of investments from a specific index .
This could be from a clean energy index , the S&P 500 , the Wilshire , the Russell , the Dow or any other index that one wants to track .
The shares are deposited with a holder .
The holder issues what are called creation units .
It ’s way for big institutional investors to buy into a fund without having to use cash .
This creation unit that the firm now owns contains a block of shares of the ETF .
For a creation unit , a block of 50,000 shares is pretty standard .
The institutional investors break up the creation units into individual ETF shares that hold small portions of each of the different stocks in the unit .
Now , each individual ETF share can be sold like a stock .
This means that when you buy and sell an ETF , you will be charged the same fees / commissions as with any other stock trade .
ETFs do n’t just come in stock varieties , however .
There are bond , commodity and currencies ETFs as well .
It is possible to build a diverse investment portfolio entirely with ETFs , using different types of these funds to create an asset allocation that you prefer .
For the average investor , ETFs consisting of stocks and bonds are generally used to create the asset allocation desired .
For more advanced ( and risk tolerant ) investors , it is possible to add faster growth to a portfolio by mixing in currencies and commodities , and adding ETF options .
Because ETFs are traded just like stocks , day traders can become involved , buying and selling whenever they want .
( With mutual funds , you only buy at the end of the day for the net asset value — NAV . )
It is even possible to short when investing with exchange traded funds .
Exchange traded funds are no longer just for investing in indexes , they can now be actively managed as well .
Exchange traded notes ( ETNs ) appear to be similar to ETFs in most characteristics but there are some key structural differences .
ETNs are basically debt instruments issued that may track an index and as such do not impart any fractional ownership of the portfolio of companies in the index .
With ETNs , an investor is not only taking on the investment risk of the index , but also the issuer risk , meaning the issuer of the ETN may not be able to pay up when the note matures .
ETNs therefore do not have a NAV technically as there is no underlying portfolio , just an indicated value which is kept close to the index it tracks by offering arbitrage possibilities to large investors ( similar to ETFs ) .
ETFs : Dividends and taxes
One of the things many people like about mutual funds is the automatic dividend reinvestment options .
With ETFs , that ability is not available .
Yes , you can receive dividends from ETF investments .
However , just as is done with a regular stock , the money shows up in your brokerage account .
When you reinvest that money , you will be charged a fee , since you will have to execute another trade .
It is possible to get around this by looking for a brokerage that allows you to reinvest dividends at no charge to you .
They do exist .
There are myths that ETFs offer you a tax - free option .
This is not true .
While you can use ETFs in a tax - advantaged retirement account ( reduce costs by investing quarterly instead of monthly ) , there are still other considerations .
You have to pay taxes on capital gains and dividends received .
Happily , though , ETFs generally do not have the sort of selling that would result in undistributed capital gains .
Changes to underlying indexes , though , or massive sales of underlying holdings , could cause tax issues down the road .
Still , ETFs that track an index do offer tax efficient investments as the funds are typically passively managed .
Unlike traditional mutual funds , redemptions from some investors will not trigger capital gains implications for other investors in the ETFs so they can also be more tax efficient than an equivalent mutual fund .
ETFs can make solid additions to an investment portfolio .
However , realize that there are risks involved , and that there are costs — albeit usually low — and taxes involved .
There are multiple resources on the internet to research ETFs .
Morningstar can be used to research ETFs in addition to traditional mutual funds .
ETFConnect is another website that is dedicated to ETFs .

To run Seaside on GemStone / S , you need a 64 - bit OS running on 64 - bit hardware .
This tutorial will walk through the process of setting up a hosted virtual private server on Slicehost .
My client machine is a MacBook Pro , and I have n’t tested the process from anything else .
Setup the client machine
In these instructions we will be using your local ( “ client ” ) machine to connect to the new virtual private server ( “ server ” ) machine .
On the client we need a web browser , a telnet / SSH client , and Internet connectivity .
I assume you have a web browser and Internet connectivity .
If you are on a Macintosh running OSX or if you are on Linux ( or another Unix variant ) then you should have a SSH client .
If you are on Windows , I recommend PuTTY as a SSH client .
Get a Slicehost account
Open a web browser on http://www.slicehost.com/
Click the “ SIGN UP ” button Provide your name , email , and billing information Put slicehost@jgfoster.net down as the referral 😉
Leave the Slice Size as 256 ( or more if you want ) Leave the Linux Distribution as “ Ubuntu 8.04.1 LTS ( hardy ) ” Enter “ glass ” ( without the quotes ) as the name for your slice Agree to the terms of service and click “ Build my Slice ! ”
Watch for an email reporting that your slice is built
Add your server IP to your client hosts file
In these instructions , we will use the hostname “ slice ” to identify the server as this is easier than using a full IP address
On Linux or Macintosh , open a local Terminal window and enter the following :
sudo vi /etc/hosts
On Windows , open a command shell ( Start / Run… / cmd ) , and enter the following :
notepad C: \WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
Edit the file to include your new IP address ( as identified in the email from Slicehost ) and save the file .
209.20.83.1 slice # Slicehost server for GLASS
Secure your server
Follow these instructions , with a few changes .
First , replace “ demo ” with “ glass ” as the admin user .
Second , after you create the “ glass ” users , set the default group to “ adm ” :
usermod -g adm glass
As you are setting up iptables , add the following three lines for GemStone ’s use later :
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -- dport 8008 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -- dport 50377 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -- dport 50378 -j ACCEPT
After you finish these changes , you can reboot the machine :
reboot
This will terminate your session and end your SSH connection .
Update your server
Log back into your server using the port you opened when you secured the server and the user you created .
Note that the “ slice ” in the following line will be resolved based on our local hosts file that was edited earlier .
If you did not modify your hosts file , you would need to enter a full IP address instead of “ slice ” .
ssh -p 30000 glass@slice
If you properly secured your server , then this should log you in without a password .
Now , follow these instructions , with a couple minor changes and additions to update your server .
. bashrc —
I want a slightly different color for my command prompt :
export PS1 = '\ [ \e [ 0;35 m\ ] \h \ [ \e [ 0 ; 34 m\ ] \w\ [ \e [ 00 m \ ] $ '
Also , I like to be able to see directories with a shortcut :
alias ll= "ls - al F "
locales —
To reduce the risk , update the locale after everything else ( especially , upgrading the server which might include a fix for this problem ) .
— To reduce the risk , update the locale after everything else ( especially , upgrading the server which might include a fix for this problem ) .
When setting the locale , chose what is right for you ( I use “ en_US ” instead of “ en_GB ” ) .
Time Zone —
Select a timezone using the following command and then answering the questions :
tzselect
Now apply the selection ( shown on the last line ) as the system default :
sudo mv /etc/localtime
/etc/localtime.bak
sudo ln - sf /usr / share / zoneinfo / America / Los_Angeles
/etc/localtime
Install GemStone / S 64 Bit
On the server , navigate to your home directory :
cd ~
Download the GemStone / S install script :
wget http://seaside.gemstone.com/scripts/installGemstone2.3-Linux.sh
Make the script executable .
If copy & paste does n’t work , then go ahead and type the line by hand :
chmod 700 installGemStone2.3-Linux.sh
Install a couple packages that the GemStone script requires :
install bc
install zip
Now run the script ( again , if copy & paste does n’t work , then type the line by hand ) :
./installGemStone2.3-Linux.sh
Among other things , the script will have changed some shared memory kernel settings and we need to reboot for these changes to take effect :
sudo reboot
Configuring GemStone/
S
From your client machine , log back into your server .
ssh -p 30000 glass@slice
At this point we need to make a tweek to the configuration file to reflect the Slicehost configuration .
The system configuration file specifies a 500 MB shared page cache , which is twice our total RAM .
Add a new line to the end of the system config file :
echo " SHR_PAGE_CACHE_SIZE_KB = 100000 ; " \ >>
/opt/gemstone/product/seaside/data/system.conf
Start GemStone /
S
Define some environment variables , start GemStone , and start a web server :
source /opt/ gemstone / product/seaside/defSeaside startGemstone startSeaside_Hyper 8008
Now using a web browser on your client machine , navigate to Seaside :
http://slice:8008/seaside/
This should show the Dispatcher Viewer in your client browser .
Note that we are using a non-standard port ( 8008 ) to reach our Smalltalk web server ( Hyper ) .
At this point , using your client web browser you can “ Toggle Halos ” and open a Class Browser ( click on the Notepad icon next to the word “ WADispatcherViewer ” ) .
To stop the Smalltalk web server , return to your client SSH session and press < Ctrl > + < C > .
At this point you can stop GemStone and logout .
stopGemstone
exit
Conclusion
We have installed GemStone / S on a Slicehost server and served Seaside pages from it .
Further posts will look at additional configurations , including running a maintenance gem that will expire ( and garbage collect ) old sessions .

The police booking photo of alleged child killer Nour Hadid released Tuesday is an “ insult against our religion , ” says Hadid ’s husband , Alaeddin .
Orland Park police detectives say the 26 - year - old Muslim woman was treated as any other suspect in a murder probe would be , and they did not intend to humiliate her when they photographed her Sunday without her headscarf and wearing only a skimpy top .
In her police mugshot , Nour Hadid is shown with bare shoulders and no headscarf ( left ) .
By custom , some practicing women wear a hijab

Many devout American Muslim women wear the “ hijab , ” or traditional headscarf , for religious identity and to signify their modesty , a virtue stressed in Islam for men and women .
There has been some debate among Muslim scholars as to whether the scarf is mandated in religious texts , but for most women who choose to wear the hijab , it is a religious obligation .
To many Muslims , taking off a woman ’s hijab in public is akin to taking off someone ’s clothes and making him or her stand in his or her underwear .
Some Muslim women also wear a “ niqab , ” or veil covering their face .
But the niqab , many argue , is more of a cultural preference than a dress code enforced by Islam .
By Rumanna Hussain , Chicago Sun-Times
Nour Hadid is accused of beating her 2 - year - old niece Bhia Hadid to death over four days at her home on the 9000 block of West 140th Street .
The child had 55 separate bruises and was beaten “ from head to toe , ” according to prosecutors , who say Hadid confessed .
But Alaeddin Hadid – who insists his wife is innocent – said Orland Park police are “ really going to be in big trouble ” for releasing the woman ’s booking photo to the news media after she was charged with first - degree murder .
The Hadids are Muslims and Nour “ never leaves the home without covering up , ” said Alaeddin , who ’s vowed to sue .
By custom , some practicing Muslim women wear the hijab , or headscarf , and cover their arms and legs when in public .
In the mug shot , a bare - headed and obviously emotional Nour appears to be protecting her modesty with her hands .
“ It is against our religion ; we do not do this in our culture , ” Alaeddin said .
“ People have been calling me about this all day . ”
Bhia Hadid ’s funeral took place Thursday .
Suicide threats
Orland Park police Cmdr. Chuck Doll said the mug shot was taken “ for identification purposes ” before Hadid made her confession .
Her headscarf was handed back to her after the photo was taken , Doll said .
“ A matron was with her at all times while she was in our custody , ” Doll said .
A matron is a law enforcement official who works with women held in custody .
“ She was wearing a tank top , and she had the headscarf when she was interviewed . ”
The headscarf later was taken from her after she made suicide threats , he said .
A sobbing Hadid appeared without the headscarf at the Bridgeview courthouse Tuesday and is being held without bail at the Cermak Medical Center at the Cook County Jail , where she remains on suicide watch .
Police have said her husband ’s possible involvement in Bhia ’s death still is under investigation .
Nour Hadid ’s attorney , Frank Celani , said he hopes to speak with her today about the mug shot .
Respecting the accused
Islamic advocacy groups seem wary of taking up Hadid ’s cause .
Spokesmen for the Council on Islamic American Relations , the Islamic Society of North America and the Bridgeview Mosque Foundation all declined to comment Thursday .
But Dr. Mohammed Sahloul , chairman of the Council of Islamic Organizations of Chicago , said that while police should follow the usual procedures with all defendants , “ they should respect the modesty of the accused . ”
Sahloul , who made it clear he was not aware of the Hadid case and was speaking in general terms about the hijab , pointed out that Muslim women are allowed to wear hijabs in photos for their state IDs .
“ If it ’s for the purposes of identification and they cover in public , then that ’s going to be more effective in identifying them anyway , ” he said .
Former chairman Kareem Irfan said , “ It ’s particularly humiliating because she appears to be in her underwear .
“ I do n’t condone what she ’s alleged to have done .
“ But if it was a nun accused of these crimes , would they treat her the same way ? ”
