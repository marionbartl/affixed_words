IT is Moving toward Property Management
Last month I had the unique opportunity to help a large university plan its future curricula for its undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer information systems .
The university recognizes that Information Technology is changing , and wants to make sure that its students are being prepared for the real world .
To this end the university has asked various people to help them see things from an outsider ’s point of view .
The exercise made me think about my own schooling , and how things have changed since that time .
When I first entered MIT as an undergraduate over thirty - five years ago , the only computer - related degree was in the electrical engineering department , and that degree focused on designing and building computers — not using them .
I started in that program and rapidly became disillusioned ; I then moved to the management department because it seemed to be more focused on the business use of computers .
I had to know at a high level how computers work , but I certainly did n’t need to know how to design computers in order to use them .
Now it seems we have moved another level away from the computer itself .
Off - the - shelf software packages from SAP , Oracle , PeopleSoft , and other similar companies have drastically reduced the need to write software from scratch .
And in the few cases where proprietary advantage might be gained by having custom - written software , outsourcing and offshoring have become the dominant methods for creating that custom software .
The net effect is to make the knowledge of how to design software almost as irrelevant to many future IT college students as knowing how to design computers was to me thirty - five years ago .
Real world IT people are moving away from writing software .
Instead , they spend their time buying off - the - shelf software packages and the hardware to run them ; they customize and adapt the software to their business needs ; they interconnect and interface the purchased software and hardware ; and then they keep their infrastructure running smoothly and efficiently .
This new definition of the IT role in business reminds me very much of another business role : real estate property management .
This is the organization that runs your buildings , keeps your offices at the right temperature , repairs leaky plumbing , keeps the grounds attractive , controls the security to the building , and generally gives you a nice , clean , comfortable and safe place to work .
Think about the property management role and its similarity to IT .
The property management organization manages infrastructure .
They have to buy , maintain , and replace large expensive complicated assets like elevator systems and HVAC ( heating , ventilation and air conditioning ) .
They maintain and upgrade a network of pipes and ducts throughout the building .
They handle changes in requirements caused by your evolving business .
Furthermore , as building technology has advanced , the property management role has become more and more computerized .
It ’s not unusual for an extreme temperature registered by one of the building sensors to trigger an alert to someone ’s pager in the middle of the night .
The remote person can then connect to the building HVAC system over the Internet , see a graphical display of the building temperatures and HVAC settings , and make changes to various settings to re-balance the system .
This is exactly the same kind of approach that IT network or server engineers use now to deal with computer problems that occur at odd hours .
Any new technology goes through phases .
In the “ frontier ” phase , there ’s a lawless environment where it ’s “ every man for himself ” because there are few support systems to help , just like the Wild West in the 1800’s .
Then as the use of the technology grows and becomes standardized , and as support systems become common , things become much more practical and ordinary .
Computer information systems went through the frontier phase up until around the 1990’s , but gradually during the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s the systems became more and more standardized , and off - the - shelf software began to proliferate .
Sure , there ’s still room for new frontiers , especially in the communications and medical computer fields .
But for most systems in most businesses , we ’re out of the frontier and into the practical and ordinary .
Life in IT in most companies is about improving business processes by applying technology — not about developing exotic state - of - the - art software .
So where does that leave students in future computer information systems programs ?
I think it provides a choice of directions .
For some students who are more business focused and who are interested in making things incrementally better , the focus should be on many of the same types of skills that are taught to real estate property managers : the tools of the trade , how to work well with customers , how to select and deal with vendors , how to measure and achieve success , and how to manage money and large projects .
For other students who want to work on the next software frontier , the attraction of designing and developing software will be strong , and they should be given the opportunity to learn more , just as our electrical engineers continue to learn new and better ways to design computers .
Eventually , I think the degree titles will change .
Computer information systems will break apart into two degrees : one in “ software engineering ” and one in “ management of information systems ” ( or maybe “ information systems leadership ” ) .
Check back with me in 10 years and we ’ll see if I ’m right .
YORKTOWN HEIGHTS , NY - 19 Aug 2007 : IBM ( NYSE : IBM ( IBM ) and TDK Corporation today announced a joint research and development program to develop high capacity MRAM ( Magnetic Random Access Memory ) technology utilizing the spin momentum transfer effect .
The companies believe that harnessing the spin momentum transfer effect will allow a much more compact memory cell than is possible with present approaches .
The companies will leverage their respective expertise in areas of fundamental research for new memory technology and magnetic device development to create a high density , high capacity MRAM integrated circuit which can be used as standalone memory or embedded into other IC solutions .
" This collaborative initiative reinforces IBM 's commitment to explore new phenomena for memory applications , " said Dr. T.C. Chen , vice president , Science and Technology , IBM Research .
" The project will focus on creating and demonstrating advanced magnetic materials in demanding memory chip designs . "
" This joint research and development will broaden the application of magnetic materials which has been TDK's core technology since 1935 , " said Mr. Minoru Takahashi , CTO , TDK Corporation .
IBM has been a leader in the development of MRAM memory technology and a pioneer in the fundamental research and development of the magnetic tunnel junction ( MTJ ) and in the prediction and study of the spin momentum transfer effect upon which the memory is based .
TDK Corporation is the leader in applying MTJ technology into recording heads for Hard Disk Drives .
Both companies have extensive research and patents in design and materials for magnetic data recording .
The research work will be conducted at IBM's TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , NY , IBM 's Almaden Research Center in San Jose , CA , IBM 's ASIC Design Center in Burlington , VT and TDK 's subsidiary R&D Center in Milpitas , CA .
MRAM offers significant advantages over competing memory technologies including low power usage , high speed , unlimited endurance ( read and write cycles ) , and inherent non-volatility ( retains data without the need for continued power ) .
Market adoption of MRAM has been limited by the inability to cost effectively increase capacity .
Spin momentum transfer technology enables MRAM to significantly reduce cell size and thereby increase capacity cost - effectively while maintaining the low power , endurance and non-volatility advantages , potentially making MRAM a preferred solution for memory applications in the automotive , cell phone , handheld computing , and industrial controls .

With Great Britain under extreme alert after three car bomb attempts over the past two days , George W. Bush and his high level White House cohorts are doing their utmost to goad the terrorists to try harder next time .
To be more " PROFESSIONAL " in their planning .
To detonate bombs that are certain to cause harm .
By all accounts , the failed detonations of the two cars in London and the blazing SUV in Scotland were n't huge or impressive enough for Bush and his buddies .
They did n't do enough damage .
They did n't produce real harm .
They were n't " PROFESSIONAL " enough to get America 's attention .
The underlying message : to be worth your salt as terrorists , you 'll have to do better next time !
Another case of : " Bring it on ! "
R ather than supporting the Brits and their new Prime Minister by publicly commiserating with them on the tragedies that were averted , Bush and his buddies have once again chosen the most irrational , incompetent course .
They 've called the terrorists " AMATEURS " to encourage their devising more sophistocated methods next time .
Bring it on !
In the six and a half years George W. Bush has been President , he and his Administration have never had a logical , well - reasoned , legitimate or successful response to any situation .
He failed miserably after 9/11 .
He attacked Afghanistan , but failed to capture the orchestrators of the World Trade Center 's demise .
He unnecessarily invaded and occupied Iraq , destroyed its infrastructure , killed thousands of Americans , and caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who survived Saddam , but succumbed to him .
And he 's made America the most reviled nation in the world .
Now once again , in the aftermath of a critical incident that requires a sound leadership response , George W. Bush makes another illogical and counter - productive choice .
He faults the terrorists for failing , giving them impetus to improve their attacks .
Could he be more inept ?
Could he be more dangerous ?
Could he be more ill - suited for his job ?
In lieu of goading for more successful terrorism , George Bush should contact the new Prime Minister to offer moral support .
He should state publicly to the Brits that he 's pleased no innocents were harmed .
He should instruct potential attackers that all human life , including their own , is too precious to sacrifice in so heinous a way .
In other words , George Bush should deliver an adult , reasoned , moral message - and not antagonize the frey .
But naturally Mr. Bush is n't doing anything of the sort .
Instead he 's playing with his boat and his bicycle in Kennebunkport , looking into the eyes of Vladimir Putin to once again " know his heart , " and childishly snubbing the new British Prime Minister for taking his Tony 's job .
How long will our nation permit this grievous incompetent to remain in office ?
Every second he 's there our nation and our world fall further apart .

Nanoscale devices present a unique challenge to any optical technology — there ’s just not enough room for light to travel in a straight line .
On the nanoscale , energy may be produced by radiating photons of light between two surfaces very close together ( sometimes as close as 10 nanometers ) , smaller than the wavelength of the light .
Light behaves much differently on the nanoscale as its wavelength is interrupted , producing unstable waves called evanescent waves .
The direction of these unpredictable waves ca n’t be calculated , so researchers face the daunting task of designing nanotechnologies to work with the tiny , yet potentially useful waves of light .
Researchers at Georgia
Tech have discovered a way to predict the behavior of these unruly waves of light during nanoscale radiation heat transfer , opening the door to the design of a spectrum of new nanodevices ( or NEMS ) and nanotechnologies , including solar thermal energy technologies .
“ This discovery gives us the fundamental information to determine things like how far apart plates should be and what size they should be when designing a technology that uses nanoscale radiation heat transfer , ” said Zhuomin Zhang , a lead researcher on the project and a professor in the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering .
“ Understanding the behavior of light at this scale is the key to designing technologies to take advantage of the unique capabilities of this phenomenon . ”
The Georgia Tech research team set out to study evanescent waves in nanoscale radiation energy transfer ( between two very close surfaces at different temperatures by means of thermal radiation ) .
Because the direction of evanescent waves is seemingly unknowable ( an imaginary value ) in physics terms , Zhang ’s group instead decided to follow the direction of the electromagnetic energy flow ( also known as a Poynting vector ) to predict behavior rather than the direction of the photons .
“ We ’re using classic electrodynamics to explain the behavior of the waves , not quantum mechanics , ” Zhang said .
“ We ’re predicting the energy propagation — and not the actual movement — of the photons . ”
The challenge is that electrodynamics work differently on the nanoscale and the Georgia Tech team would need to pinpoint those differences .
Planck ’s law , a more than 100 - year - old theory about how electromagnetic waves radiate , does not apply on the nanoscale due to fact that the space between surfaces is smaller than a wavelength .
The Georgia Tech team observed that instead of normal straight line radiation , the light was bending as protons tunneled through the vacuum in between the two surfaces just nanometers apart .
The team also noticed that the evanescent waves were separating during this thermal process , allowing them to visualize and predict the energy path of the waves .
Understanding the behavior of such waves is critical to the design of many devices that use nanotechnology , including near - field thermophotovoltaic systems , nanoscale imaging based on thermal radiation scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning photon - tunneling microscopy , said Zhang .
These findings were featured on the cover of the Oct. 8 issue of Applied Physics Letters .
Expulsion of American security firm could undermine withdrawal plans Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday September 18 , 2007
Print This Email This Iraqi government restrictions on security contractor Blackwater USA could mean a range of complications for US involvement in the country -- potentially even undermining current plans to remove some troops on the ground , reports the Wall Street Journal in a story by August Cole and Neil King , Jr. After an incident on Sunday in which Blackwater security personnel killed Baghdad civilians during a fight with insurgents , the government of Iraq announced that it plans to deny the firm permission to continue operations .
" The incident may increase strains between the Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , " said the Journal .
" The State Department relies heavily on Blackwater to guard its diplomatic compound within Iraq 's Green Zone and also to provide security for U.S. diplomats as they travel around Iraq .
The work often calls for Blackwater to draw on its fleet of armed helicopters , which give it an arsenal that other security contractors lack . "
Coming at an " awkward time " for the White House , according to the Journal , the incident follows on the heels of an announcement last week that the US plans to withdraw as many as 30,000 troops by July .
" As the U.S. diminishes its military footprint , " Cole and King write , " it is almost certain to rely more heavily on private - security companies to guard the tens of thousands of nonmilitary U.S. personnel working in Iraq . "
" Security contractors , who are more lightly armed than their American military counterparts , play an important role protecting not just U.S. officials but also employees of the many companies working on rebuilding Iraq 's infrastructure , " continued the Journal .
" Blackwater is one of the largest security contractors in Iraq , with some 1,000 contractors there , most of them American .
Picking up any slack should Blackwater 's operations be interrupted or cease would be a tall order for rivals . "
" The reason there is such a strong business for personal security details is that the United States military and the Diplomatic Security Service do n't have the manpower to fulfill the requirement , " Ray DuBois , a former undersecretary of the Army , told the paper .
" We have n't received any official word on this .
We have only seen this in the press , " Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell told the Journal , saying the company had yet receive word about its license from Iraq 's Interior Ministry .
Tyrell confirmed some guards were involved in the fight , although she denied reports that the firm 's helicopters " opened fire . "
" Iraq can be a very difficult place for our diplomats to operate in , and certainly people need to realize the environment in which our people operate , " a spokesman for the State Department said last week .
The elephant in the room :
Whenever one of these morality scandals comes up -- whether it involves homosexuality , adultery , or being on a list compiled by someone the media calls a " Madam " -- it often involves a Republican .
Critics love to charge Republicans with hypocrisy -- preaching traditional family values to the rest of us by day while trolling bathrooms and pressing sweaty palms to computer keyboards by night .
Whatever explains these other public moral dramas , hypocrisy does n't fully capture the GOP 's plainly dysfunctional relationship to homosexuality .
Believe it or not , there are plenty of traditional - values Republicans who are not secretly gay .
They might be wrong about homosexuality , but they 're not hypocrites .
Yes , there are many prominent Republicans whose private actions are inconsistent with their traditional - values personas .
Sen. Larry " I am Not a Gay American " Craig is the latest of them , assuming the various allegations against him are true .
Jim
West had an aggressively anti-gay record both as a Washington state legislator and as mayor of Spokane , yet cruised for gay sex and anonymously told an online acquaintance that he hated the " sex Nazis " who try to regulate people 's private lives .
There are many other examples .
But there are also many closeted gay Republicans not closely associated with the party 's religious right .
Mark Foley , of last year 's congressional page scandal , was not an anti-gay member of Congress .
While he did n't support everything I wish he had , his rating from national gay - rights groups was usually quite good and I 'd take his record on gay issues over many Democrats ' .
There 's an entire website devoted to outing ( mostly ) Republican politicos .
That site does not hurt for news and information .
Its working list of closeted gay Republicans — whether officeholders , staffers , or party officials — is a very , very long one .
I can tell you the website does not even come close to listing all of the gay Republicans working in prominent positions in Washington and elsewhere .
And not nearly all of these gay Republicans are anti-gay , or work directly for anti-gay causes .
Many despise the party 's anti-gay rhetoric and actions .
They are Republicans because they are pro-life , or support low taxes , or want a strong national defense , or desire an exciting job in public policy , or for any of a hundred other reasons .
You could call it hypocrisy to be gay and work for a generally anti-gay political party , regardless of the gay person 's own views or what she does within the party to oppose its anti-gay policy positions , but if so , this is surely a watered - down form of the vice .
What unites these cases is not really hypocrisy .
It 's two other things .
First , nearly all the gay Republicans working in Washington or elsewhere are to one degree or another closeted .
Second , at a personal level , very few Republican officials around them care whether someone is gay .
From the top of the party to the bottom , few Republicans personally and viscerally dislike gay people .
President Bush has had friends he knew were gay .
So has Vice President Cheney .
Even the most prominently and vigorously anti-gay Republican , Sen. Rick " Man on Dog " Santorum , had a gay spokesperson whom he defended when his homosexuality became known .
The big , open secret in Republican politics is that everyone knows someone gay these days and very few people -- excepting some committed anti-gay activists -- really care .
It 's one of the things that drives religious conservatives crazy because it makes the party look like it's not really committed to traditional sexual morality .
So to keep religious conservatives happy the party has done two things .
First , it has steadfastly resisted efforts to ease anti-gay discrimination in public policy , even when Republican politicians know better .
I can't tell you how many Republican staffers told me , for example , that their bosses privately opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment but would be voting for it anyway .
Second , to keep the talent it needs and simply to be as humane and decent as politically possible toward particular individuals , the party has come up with its own unwritten common - law code : you can be gay and work here , we do n't care , but do n't talk about it openly and do n't do anything to make it known publicly in the sense that either the media or the party 's religious base might learn of it .
It 's the GOP 's own internal version of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
This uneasy mix of the public and the private is not exactly what I 'd call hypocrisy .
It 's perhaps better described as a form of ideological schizophrenia : private acceptance welded to public rejection .
It 's a very unstable alloy .
For the closeted gay Republican , this alloy means a life of desperation and fear and loneliness , of expressing one 's true feelings only in the anonymity of the Internet , of furtive bathroom encounters , of late nights darting in and out of dark bars , hoping not to be seen .
It means life without a long - term partner , without real love .
Worst of all , it may mean a life of deceiving a spouse and children .
It 's hardly surprising that most of the men caught cruising in parks , bathrooms , and other public places are deeply closeted and often married .
They do n't see themselves as having many other options .
Nevertheless , it seems to work until the day you get caught tapping your toe next to a cop .
Desperation sets in and you say things that bring everyone much mirth at your expense , like , " I 'm not gay , I just have a wide stance . "
For the GOP , this alloy of public rejection and private acceptance means enduring more of these periodic public morality convulsions .
How to end it ?
The private acceptance will continue and , I predict , become even more prevalent as young conservatives comfortable around gay people take over .
There will be no purging the party of gays .
There is no practical way to purge them , and even if there were , most Republicans would be personally repulsed by such an effort .
These closeted politicians , staffers , and party functionaries will occasionally be found out one way or another and again will come the shock , the pledges to go into rehab , the investigations , the charges of hypocrisy , the schadenfreude from Democrats and libertines , the sense of betrayal from the party 's religious conservatives .
This does n't happen to the Democrats because the party 's public and private attitudes toward homosexuality are fully consistent : acceptance of gays .
Their homosexuals feel little need to remain closeted ( with the recent exception of Jim " I am a Gay American " McGreevey ) .
Notably , past sex scandals involving gay Democrats , like Rep. Barney Frank ( with a prostitute ) and Rep. Gerry Studds ( with a congressional page ) , occurred some two decades ago , when the party was less accepting and the men themselves were still closeted .
The only practical way out of this for the GOP is to come to the point where its homosexuals no longer feel the need to hide .
And that wo n't happen until the party 's public philosophy is more closely aligned with its private one .
That will be the day when the GOP greets its gay supporters the way Larry Craig , with unintended irony , greeted reporters yesterday at his news conference : " Thank you all very much for coming out today . "
UPDATE : I 've re-opened comments after briefly closing them to let a few commenters cool off a bit .
Please try to avoid rudeness and stay on the topic of the post .
If someone responds poorly or stupidly to something brilliant you say , quietly declare victory and go home rather than repeating yourself or cleverly insulting them .
I 'll close comments permanently if things veer off again .
A secret long held by plants has been revealed by Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers .
The new discovery , which builds on more than a decade of painstaking surveillance of cellular communication between different types of plant tissues , shows clearly for the first time how plants " decide " to grow .
The research , conducted by Sigal Savaldi - Goldstein and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Joanne Chory at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , puts to rest a century - old debate over which tissue system in plants drives and restricts cell growth .
" Our work exposes the presence of cell - cell communication during growth , from the epidermis to the inner layers .
Such a mode of communication is important for plants to maintain a coherent and coordinated growth of the shoot , " said Savaldi - Goldstein , a postdoctoral fellow in Chory 's lab .
Chory 's research group is interested in identifying the mechanisms by which plants alter their shape and size in response to changes in their environment .
Chory studies Arabidopsis , a member of the mustard family that is to plant biologists what the mouse is to mammalian geneticists .
" How do organisms decide when to grow and when to stop growing ?
These questions are especially important in plants because they are rooted in the ground and must alter their shape and size in response to their local environment .
Thus , it 's a question of survival , " added Chory .
" It took us 10 years to develop the tools to ask the question .
It is very satisfying for me to see the results . "
Roots and shoots are a plant 's two major organ systems .
For this study , published in the March 8 , 2007 , issue of the journal Nature , the scientists examined shoots and the three layers of tissues that make up the shoot system : the epidermis , which is the waxy , protective skin ; the mesophyl tissue , which contains the plant 's chloroplasts -- cells that conduct photosynthesis ; and the vascular tissue through which water and nutrients are transported .
During the last decade , Chory has made a number of significant discoveries involving a key family of plant hormones called brassinosteroids , as well as the receptors for the hormones and the genetic factors that regulate production and uptake of the hormone in the different layers of plant tissues .
According to Chory , brassinolide is a potent growth hormone involved in the plant 's response to light .
Such responses , which include adjusting plant growth to reach light or strengthening stems to support leaves , are central to plant survival .
Brassinosteroid biosynthesis has become a critically important area of plant biology research with significant implications for commercial agriculture .

" It 's been a matter of some debate for a very long time if one of these tissue layers controls plant growth or if all three layers have to work together , " Chory said .
" Our paper shows very clearly that the epidermis is in control -- in both driving and restricting growth .
In addition , our studies show that the cells in the epidermis " talk " to the cells in the inner layers , communicating that they too should expand . "
Savaldi - Goldstein made the discovery that the signal for growth originates in the epidermis by experimenting with dwarf Arabidopsis plants and the expression of brassinosteroids in the outer and inner layers of the shoot .
When brassinosteroid hormone was expressed and taken up by receptors in the epidermis , dwarf plants grew to their full size .
Savaldi - Goldstein and Chory also found that when a gene is expressed in the epidermis that inactivates brassinosteroid , the plant restricts growth .
Thus , cell signaling began in the epidermis and followed into the inner layers of tissue , directing those cells to grow or to restrict growth .
The outer epidermis , which helps plants retain water and regulate the exchange of gases , clearly plays the role of environmental sentinel , communicating to plant tissues when conditions are right to seize the day for growth or hold back under less opportune conditions .
More study is needed to determine all of the cues that spark the intimate dialogue between the cells of the epidermis and the inner cells of the shoot .
" Our study says that the major target tissue in the shoot for steroid hormones is the epidermis .
Our results also show that these hormones act locally .
As similar studies are done for other plant hormones and in other organs , such as the root , we will know the major sites of action of each plant hormone and will be able to make models to predict how they work together to give rise to the tremendous diversity of shape and form found in the flowering plants , " said Chory .
For the moment , the research is an important addition to the fundamental knowledge of plant growth and survival .
But the research and the work to follow have much broader implications .
" If we want to feed over nine billion people by the year 2050 , then understanding the basic mechanics of plant growth is required , " said Chory .
" This knowledge will ultimately lead to our ability to increase yield , while decreasing the need for fertilizer and pesticides . "
Then came anger .
“ Why me ? ” she remembers thinking , in a refrain she found hard to shake in the coming months .
“ I ’m the good one .
It ’s not like I ’m sick because I have emphysema from smoking or I did something dangerous . ”
The gene that will kill Ms. Moser sits on the short arm of everyone ’s fourth chromosome , where the letters of the genetic alphabet normally repeat C - A - G as many as 35 times in a row .
In people who develop Huntington ’s , however , there are more than 35 repeats .
No one quite knows why this DNA hiccup causes cell death in the brain , leading Huntington ’s patients to jerk and twitch uncontrollably and rendering them progressively unable to walk , talk , think and swallow .
But the greater the number of repeats , the earlier symptoms tend to appear and the faster they progress .
Ms. Moser ’s “ CAG number ” was 45 , the counselor said .
She had more repeats than her grandfather , whose first symptoms — loss of short - term memory , mood swings and a constant ticking noise he made with his mouth — surfaced when he turned 50 .
But it was another year before Ms. Moser would realize that she could have less than 12 years until she showed symptoms .
Immediately after getting her results , Ms. Moser was too busy making plans .
“ I ’m going to become super - strong and super - balanced , ” she vowed over lunch with Ms. Elio , her straight brown hair pulled into a determined bun .
“ So when I start to lose it I ’ll be a little closer to normal . ”
In the tumultuous months that followed , Ms. Moser often found herself unable to remember what normal had once been .
She forced herself to renounce the crush she had long nursed on a certain firefighter , sure that marriage was no longer an option for her .
She threw herself into fund - raising in the hopes that someone would find a cure .
Sometimes , she raged .
She never , she said , regretted being tested .
But at night , crying herself to sleep in the dark of her lavender bedroom , she would go over and over it .
She was the same , but she was also different .
And there was nothing she could do .
So , you ca n’t wait till September 4th huh ?
Neither can that monkey over there whose sitting a little bit off - kilter .
We refer to that ragamuffin as Chewbacca Jr . By the way , he ’s STILL working on eating that SAME damn softball sized orange , just like we ’re STILL working on getting OfferOfTheDay.com up and running the way it was destined to be .
Well , we thought since there are so many OTD Nut - Huggers out there , we would post a little something to hold them over until September 4th .
We call it , “ Chewbacca Jr. ’s Ballad to Vitamin - C “ , and it goes a little something like this :
I ’m not a squirrel , but I love Vitamin - C. Oh Vitamin-C …
The only vitamin on Earth to keep ME scurvy free .
The only vitamin to keep my chest fur as blonde as can be .
The only vitamin that fluoresces my pee .
The only vitamin that keeps my sideburns really pointy .
The only vitamin that keeps me climbin ’ those trees .
And , the only vitamin endorsed by me , an easily distracted , helmet - headed , monkey .

For more than four years since the invasion of Iraq , President Bush most often has defined his objective there with a single , stirring word : “ Victory . ”
“ Victory in Iraq is vital for the United States of America , ” he told cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in May .
“ Victory in this struggle will require more patience , more courage and more sacrifice , ” he warned National Guardsmen in West Virginia in July .
But this week , the word “ victory ” disappeared from the president ’s lexicon .
It was replaced by a slightly more ambiguous goal : “ Success . ”
“ The success of a free Iraq is critical to the security of the United States , ” Bush said Thursday evening in his brief televised address from the Oval Office .

“ Now , because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq , we can begin seeing troops come home , ” he said .
Bush ’s description of his war aims reflected two hard realities about his position on Iraq .
First , a large majority of the American public does not believe “ victory ” is possible .
Dozens of opinion polls have found that fewer than 40 % of voters think the war can be won .
Second , the men who are running the war -- Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker -- made it clear this week that their immediate goals were more limited than “ victory . ”

Where the United States once hoped for a peaceful , united Iraq governed by a Western - style parliament , Petraeus and Crocker described more modest goals : reducing sectarian violence , avoiding all - out civil war and encouraging self - rule with a strong role for tribal sheiks who are not elected .
“ I cannot guarantee success in Iraq , ” Crocker said in hearings before Congress .
“ The challenges . . . are immense . ”
Petraeus shied away from even using the word “ success . ”
When a senator asked whether the United States had “ a realistic chance to be successful ” in Iraq , the general carefully replied : “ I believe we have a realistic chance of achieving our objectives . ”
A senior official said the two men had deliberately chosen to be “ minimalist ” in their promises , recognizing that prior talk of victory had left many Americans disillusioned or doubtful .

The formal reason for the president ’s speech was to endorse Petraeus ’ proposal to begin a long - planned troop drawdown slightly ahead of schedule .
The plan will leave more than 130,000 troops in the battle zone next year , unless Petraeus and Bush decide further withdrawals are possible .
But Bush ’s underlying aim was to regain the initiative in Washington ’s political battles about the deeply unpopular war -- by convincing Americans that the military effort is making progress , that patience and persistence will make further troop withdrawals possible , and that there is , in short , a light at the end of the tunnel .
“ The principle guiding my decisions on troop levels in Iraq is ‘ return on success , ’ ” Bush said .
“ The more successful we are , the more American troops can return home . ”
“ He obviously wants to get our position in Iraq to a point where it ’s in a good place for the next president to come in , ” said a senior administration official who , like others , asked not to be named when discussing Bush ’s thinking .

Bush expressed a hope that his decision to allow the drawdown of troops to occur on schedule would bring supporters and critics of his policies together .
“ The way forward I have described tonight makes it possible , for the first time in years , for people who have been on opposite sides of this difficult debate to come together . ”
There was no sign that such a hope would soon be realized .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and other Democrats denounced Bush ’s proposal even before he spoke .
Pelosi called it “ a path to 10 more years of war in Iraq . ”
But Bush ’s target was not so much his opposition in the Democratic Party as the increasing number of war critics in his own Republican Party .
Bush ’s plan for drawing down the troops , one aide said , should make it possible for members of Congress “ to be for success in Iraq and for beginning to bring troops home . ”

Bush acknowledged that Iraq ’s central government has failed to meet the goals for political reform that were set at the beginning of the year .
But he noted that progress had been made in restoring security to parts of Baghdad and in the provinces of Anbar , west of the capital , and Diyala , to the northeast .
White House officials have said that the progress in those parts of Iraq drew substantial media coverage during the summer and appeared to bolster Republican support in Congress for the war .
The White House ’s challenge , a former aide said , is to convince Americans that any kind of success is possible in Iraq .
Bush must “ overcome a fair amount of skepticism in the conventional wisdom , which thinks all experts believe it is hopeless , ” said Peter D. Feaver , a professor at Duke University who worked on Iraq policy at the National Security Council .

“ They ’re still making the two basic points , ” he said .
“ One , we can win -- something like success is still possible .
Two , the consequences of failure are so bad we should be willing to pay a price to win . ”

Technology and Expectations : Myths About Working From Home
Technology has had a huge effect on how we live and work .
What used to take a whole day to get a response from a client , boss or co-worker now can be nearly instantaneous via IM , cell phones and email .
The rate of how fast we can reply has increased dramatically thanks to these new technologies .
Not only that , but these advances have helped the small business / home office worker out tremendously .
Now just about anyone can have a web - based business , thanks to open source software , etc .
The web has levelled the playing field so that small to medium size companies can compete with large corportations .
Not only that , but the web has opened up lots of doors for non-traditional jobs as well .
( Did you know that you can make a good living blogging ? )
Yes , it ’s a great time to be alive and livin ’ the American dream .
However , since more and more people have switched to working at home , there are still some wrinkles to be ironed out with respect to the general public ’s expectations .
Self - employed types are sometimes seen as lazy , eccentrics who only work about 3 hours a day and then spend the rest of it playing on sites like Digg .
Let ’s dispell a few myths right now about being self - employed and working at home .
Myth # 1 : Self - employed people can be lazy because they do n’t have a boss
I work at home , and it never ceases to amaze me that people think I just fiddly - fart around all day mainly because I do n’t have a “ real boss ” .
But think of it this way :
If I ’m doing my job correctly , my “ boss ” should be the most demanding boss I ’ll ever have .
He always knows if I ’m late or slacking off , and you better believe he can tell when I ’m not managing my time well .
Self - employed people have it even harder .
Most of the time there ’s no company health insurance , no benefits , no retirement plan … you ’re scratching a living with a lot more variables that are just taken care of when you work for a company .
It ’s downright scary if you think about it .
You better believe the self - employeed workers are bustin ’ their humps to make the bottom line every day .
Myth # 2 : People who work out of home offices work whenever they want
Unfortunately , becuase the rest of the world runs from about 8 am - 5 pm , we have to work those ours too .
Granted , this is becoming more and more flexible with our ever growing dependencies on rad , new technologies like email ; but usually talking with people means on their terms , thus the normal work day .
Aside from that , working late at night is n’t really optimal for productivity .
And if we ’re going to scratch a living without working for the man , you better bring your productivity A game .
Myth # 3 : Home offices can be anything ; they ’re not that important because you ’re at your home .
The office is important because it is your personal domain .
It ’s where you are comfortable , and can easily find things when you need them .
And there is a very big difference between a home office and a traditional office space : it ’s much more needed .
With email and laptops , the common misconception is that working at home means you are 100 % portable .
You wanna work on the porch ?
No problem .
The bathroom ?
It ’d be a little weird , but why not ?
We have a freedom that traditional workers do n’t : Mobility .
But we do n’t really want mobility if we ’re going to be productive , we want structure .
Structure is the best thing to happen to productivity since notecards .
Structure sets us in routines , and these routines help free our brains from extra running processes , giving us more juice for the real tasks at hand .
The less we think about our surroundings , the more productive we are .
I ’m not saying that working in a totally white room with no windows is ideal , but rather a place where we ’re comfortable and know where everything is .
Conclusions
In order to work at home , you have to be willing to give up a lot of luxuries for not having a boss .
Things like insurance , paid vacations , retirement plans , and many others .
But there is a lot more freedom attached to your job ; and odds are you ’ll find a lot more satisfaction because you ’re doing the thing you really want to do .
Just do n’t think that working from home is going to be easier than your previous job … it ’ll probably be harder .
Bush chuckles at Iraq success : ' Either we 'll succeed , or we wo n't succeed ' David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This
In remarks made Wednesday to the Associated General Contractors of America , President Bush defined his view of the success in Iraq that he hopes to accomplish .
" Either we 'll succeed , or we wo n't succeed , " he said .
" And the definition of success as I described is sectarian violence down .
Success is not no violence . "
While saying " succeed , " Bush appears to chuckle .
The president then compared Iraq to the United States , saying that there were parts of the US with " a certain level of violence , " but that " people feel comfortable about living their daily lives " in those areas .
That level of violence , said Bush , is what the US is aiming to achieve in Iraq .
At a White House Press Briefing later in the day Suzanne Malveaux of CNN asked Press Secretary Tony Snow to clarify what would constitute an " acceptable level of violence . "
" That 's a very good question , " replied Snow .
" I do n't have an answer . "
Earlier in the press conference
Snow also compared Iraq to the US , saying " Washington for many years was the murder capital of the United States of America .
I believe we are still able to do our jobs .
Now , really what he 's [ President Bush ] talking about -- he 's talking about that . "
Read the full remarks by President Bush here .
Read today 's White House Press Briefing transcript here .
Excerpts from the press briefing are below : Q The President earlier today defined success in Iraq .
He said , " Success is not , no violence .
There are parts of our country that , as you know , have a certain level of violence to it .
But success is a level of violence where the people feel comfortable about living their daily lives , and that 's what we 're trying to achieve . "
What is the President talking about when he says there 's parts in our own country where a certain level of violence that people will accept ?
MR .
SNOW : It means that you have places with high crime rates .
And it is something that is quite often a fact of American life that we do n't like and it is something that is a matter of constant and ongoing concern .
But you could construe that as violence , and it is .
If you take a look at drug - related violence that has wracked many of our cities -- and now , increasingly , in rural areas , as well as suburban -- that is a form of violence .
If you read stories over the years that constantly take a look at murder rates and rape rates , and every time we come out with either the Bureau of Justice statistics or FBI with its reports , it 's a standard part of reporting .
So what he 's really talking about is that there 's certain kinds of violence that do , unfortunately , exist in a society , but he was not arguing , for instance , that there are militias afoot or that sort of thing .
He was simply saying , at some point , you need a level of violence in a society , crime or whatever , that is not going to be undermining your ability to have a functional democracy .
And of course , the endless experiment within democracy is always to make it more effective and attending to the needs and safety of the people .
Q
If the President is using that as an example of saying that the Iraqis , if they find a certain level of violence that is acceptable , that 's defined now as success ?
MR .
SNOW : Yes , in other words , what he 's saying is that if you can have a society that can function more or less normally , where you will have effective police forces that are able to dispense justice fairly , regardless of who you are ; you have a growing economy ; you have a rule of law ; you have political institutions that reflect and protect the rights of all ; you have a political system that is able to adjust over time and to -- amid compromise and full debate ; you have diplomatic roots set down so you are a strong and functional player within the region .
All of those are parts of being a successful state .
Q
But the President -- he argued that this is about freedom , this is about democracy .
But when the President defines success as a level of violence , where people feel comfortable about living their daily lives -- that bar is very , very low .
That 's much lower than a democracy or freedom agenda .
MR .
SNOW : No , it 's not .
No , it 's not .
I mean , look , Washington for many years was the murder capital of the United States of America .
I believe we are still able to do our jobs .
Now , really what he 's talking about -- he 's talking about that .
He is not talking about -- Q
How do you define an acceptable level of violence ?
I mean , how can that possibly be defined ?
MR .
SNOW : That 's a very good question .
I do n't have an answer .
Maybe they have n’t sued the whole Internet , just a good chunk of it .
Polaris IP , a patent firm , has filed a patent infringement suit against Google , Yahoo , Amazon.com , A9.com , Borders , AOL and IAC / InterActiveCorp , which owns Ask.com .
Polaris is the owner of United States Patent No. 6,411,947 , for an “ Automatic Message Interpretation and Routing System . ”
It is not entirely clear what the patent covers or how Google , Yahoo , et. al. infringed on it .
We ’ve contacted the lawyers for Polaris for details .
The patent appears to cover a customer service system that can analyze incoming customer e-mail messages and decide whether they can be handled automatically or need review by a human .
According to the complaint , Polaris claims that Google ’s advertising systems , including AdWords and AdSense , which analyze electronic messages to determine which ads to place next to them , infringes on its patent .
Yahoo and others similarly infringe on the patent , according to the complaint .
Patent claims , of course , are a dime a dozen .
And this case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas , Marshall Division , the nation ’s preferred venue for patent plaintiffs .
But last year Polaris filed a suit against Kana Software alleging that it had infringed the same patent .
Kana settled the case in March and agreed to license the technology from Polaris , though terms of the settlement were not disclosed .
The U.S. economy produced slight improvement in income and poverty levels last year , but failed to bring widespread benefits as the number of people without health insurance climbed to 47 million , according to a major report released Tuesday that reflects the nation ’s underlying economic anxieties .
In its annual report on poverty , income and health insurance , the Census Bureau said that median household income rose slightly to $ 48,201 , but mainly because people were working longer hours , not because they were being paid more .
The nation ’s official poverty rate inched down to 12.3 % .
Again , the improvement was not broad - based , but the result of gains among a single segment of the population : older people .
The number of people without health insurance jumped by 2.2 million , or about 5 % , the biggest increase since 2002 .
And a trend of steady progress in reducing the number of uninsured children seemingly lurched into reverse , as more than 600,000 youths were added to the rolls of the uninsured , an increase of nearly 8 % .
Advertisement
The bleak statistic on children is released at a time when President Bush is threatening to veto legislation that would expand a health insurance program for children of the working poor , and that seemed certain to galvanize opposition to the administration ’s stand .
The economy ’s performance on issues of such importance as income and health coverage helps explain Americans ’ persistent pessimism about their circumstances , including a sharp drop in consumer confidence reported Tuesday by the Conference Board , a business research group .
“ As John Kennedy pointed out : ‘ A rising tide raises all boats , ’ ” said Jared Bernstein , a senior economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
“ What the census numbers reveal is that while most boats got a little lift last year , the big gains of the recovery have accrued to the yachts . ”
Bush portrayed the numbers as a vindication of his economic policies of low taxes and minimal regulation .
“ The census data show that income gains in 2006 were substantial and widespread across all income categories .
And the largest percentage income gains occurred for people in the bottom 20 % of incomes , ” the president said in a statement .
Advertisement
Some analysts said that what Bush failed to note was that , in dollar terms , the gains near the top were 10 times those in the bottom 20 % , and for most Americans , improvement was not the result of raises , but more work .
“ The president is right that incomes rose and rose across the board , ” said Rebecca M. Blank , a University of Michigan public policy professor who has written extensively on money and poverty .
“ But what the census data suggests is that earnings actually fell , which means the whole story is about people working harder and longer hours .
“ This is one of the reasons people are not feeling good about this economic expansion , ” Blank said .
Conservative commentators said the new numbers pictured a standard economic recovery , pointing out that household income had made it most of the way back to its pre-2001 recession levels and the poverty rate was lower than in most years of the boom - time 1990s .
Advertisement
“ What we ’re seeing is a fairly typical pattern for this stage of an economic recovery , ” said Stuart M. Butler , director of economic and domestic studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
“ It ’s not a particularly weak one . ”
But a comparison of census numbers for post - recession recoveries over the last 2 1/ 2 decades suggests that the last five years have been an unusually weak period .
Even with the recent decline , the poverty rate is still six - tenths of a point higher than it was in 2001 .
Median household income is two - tenths of a point higher .
By contrast , during the first five years after the 1982 recession , poverty fell by 1.6 percentage points and income grew by 9.3 percentage points .
The new health coverage numbers disappointed experts across the political spectrum .
“ I ’m disheartened by this report , ” said economist Joseph Antos , of the business - oriented American Enterprise Institute .
“ There is nothing that has happened in the economy or in the health insurance world that would have made me think we would have this large an increase ” in the number of uninsured .
Advertisement
Presidential contenders , particularly Democrats , have been focusing on the uninsured , and the new census figures were already playing a role in the campaign by late Tuesday , with candidates citing them as evidence of the need for change .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) said Tuesday that the number of uninsured was an “ even deeper outrage today ” than when she and her husband , President Clinton , unsuccessfully tried to pass coverage for all in the 1990s .
Last week , Republican Mitt Romney , former governor of Massachusetts , became the latest candidate to unveil his healthcare principles .
“ This is going to force more of the Republican candidates to come out with healthcare plans .
They ’re going to have to respond , ” Antos said .
“ The healthcare chapter of the campaign really starts today .
I think it is going to be a really significant issue for the election . ”
Advertisement
The explanation for the discouraging numbers was familiar .
Employer - provided coverage continued to erode , while government healthcare programs held steady but did not fill the gap .
And with the cost of health insurance rising more rapidly than wages , or general inflation , many people are unable to purchase a personal insurance plan on the individual market , particularly if they have a preexisting health problem .
“ Median income went up seven - tenths of 1 % in 2006 , and in the same year .
. . health insurance premiums went up 8 % , ” said Len Nichols , director of the health policy program at the nonpartisan New America Foundation .
“ There ’s your story . ”
Overall , 15.8 % of the population was uninsured in 2006 , or about 1 in 6 .
Although noncitizens were more likely to be uninsured , native - born Americans accounted for more than 60 % of the increase in the number of people without coverage .
Advertisement
California had about 6.6 million uninsured residents , ranking seventh among the states in the proportion of uninsured .
Latinos were more likely than any other ethnic group to be uninsured , with more than a third lacking coverage .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the census report bolsters Bush ’s argument for tax credits and other changes to make private health insurance more affordable for individuals .
“ The numbers show why it is crucially important to reform the health system in a way that allows Americans to purchase their own health insurance , ” he said .
But others said the salient political message from the figures was that Bush should reconsider his threat to veto an expansion of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
The popular federal - state partnership , known as Healthy Families in California , currently insures about 6 million children and is scheduled to expire Sept. 30 .
“ It ’s just ridiculous that the president and some in Congress could be opposed to this , ” said MIT economist Jonathan Gruber , a technical advisor to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the California Legislature on their deadlocked healthcare effort .
“ This is as close to a no - brainer in government as legislation gets . ”
Advertisement
The U.S. Senate has proposed expanding the $ 5 - billion - a - year program to cover an additional 3 million children , and the House wants to extend coverage to 5 million more .
Bush has proposed to renew the program with a modest funding increase that outside experts say will not be enough to sustain current levels of coverage .
The census report showed that the number of uninsured children rose for the second consecutive year in 2006 , to 8.7 million .
“ The increase in the uninsured rate [ for children ] can be attributed to the decline in private coverage , ” said David Johnson , chief of the bureau division that produced the statistics .

Some people have wanted to see how the inside of my van is set up , so last night I attempted to take some pictures .
It ’s hard to get a picture of the whole van at once , ya know ?
Also it was dark , so I could n’t really see in the view finder until after the picture was taken ( yay for flashes ) .
And my van ’s messy .
Sorry , but that ’s part of life .
Anyways … here goes .
This is the view looking in the back door .
Those are two seperate side - by - side rubbermaid two - drawer - high units ( one drawer for shirts , one for pants , one for food , and one for jars of canned food and photo albums ) .
The head of my bed rests on those , and my workbag there is kinda like a headboard .
Next to them are three crates , which make a bookshelf .
At the back of those three crates are three more facing the inside of the van , and they ’re all zip - tied together .
And , yeah , I have a yarn problem .
This is the view looking back from between the front seats , bed on one side , bookshelves on the other side , garment bag hanging from the wall for herbs and yarn , dulcimer leaning there , and crate for sitting on .
Also , skirts stuffed up on top of the bookshelf .
This is underneath my bed , and you can also see how the bed rests on the dog crate in the front and the drawers in the back .
See the little metal braket thing securing it to the dog crate ?
It ’s small and it ai n’t perfect , but it does a great job .
Then there ’s the bucket of dog food , drawers , dirty laundry , camp stove , baskets , tools , seat - crate , and the empty dog food bag is for trash .
This is my bed .
See the cargo net ?
That ’s this genius idea I got from someone on the VanDweller list .
I ’m gonna put all that errant yarn in it …
I took this picture of my feet while I was laying in bed so you can see how small the space between the bed and the ceiling is .
It ’s not for everyone , but it ’s good enough for me .
Let ’s talk about attatching things to the ceiling .
I took some one by two ’s along the sides .
I unscrewed the hook thingies , and made little metal brackets go under them to attatch the wood to ( another genius idea that was n’t mine ) .
I hope this picture explains it better ….
Same thing down the center , with the lights , tho when we I got to the front I just stuck it under the velcro rather than doing the front light too .
In the back there ’s a bracket between the two AC vents .
And , of course , velcro .
In the winter , I hang an insulated curtain from that velcro so that my bed space is a warm little cacoon .
Privacy ?
Astro ’s have this cool velcro lip thingy right behind the front seats .
I just tuck my nifty skirt / dress / wrap thingy up in there and then I can hide out in the back without being seen .
And , insulation .
Reflectix is da bomb .
On your windows that ’ll vent open , or that you might want to see out of , use velcro , but on the back windows , use copious amounts of the tape that came with it .
And … that ’s all .
If you have questions , leave them in the comments section and I ’ll update this post to answer them .
Also , check out the van set - up ’s at http://www.cheaprvliving.com and http://www.LarenCorie.com

Cramer Pleads for a Fed Rescue
In a truly astonishing clip , Erin Burnett interviewed Jim Cramer on Friday .
It is destined to become a classic Wall Street legend .
I expect it will become required viewing for market historians and technicians alike .
There 's no other way to say this : Jim goes postal .
When Cramer essentially begs the Fed Chair to rescue the big Investment banks , you know things have gone awry .
Highlights include :
" Open the darn Fed window .
" He has no idea what its like out there - None ! "
" They [ the Fed ] know nothing .
The Fed is asleep . "
" My people have been in this game for 25 years . . .
They are losing their jobs -- these firms are going out business " " [ President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ] Bill Poole is shameful " " Cut the rate .
Relieve the pressure " " In the fixed income markets we have Armageddon . "
But do n't take my word for it , watch the video :
CNBC.com ( not a great video feed -- see the YouTube below )
I am not sure what he means about people talking to him every night " off the record " ( was Jim inferring the Fed calls him ? )
>
Ever since TV has been banned from our trading room ( CNBC and Bloomberg alike ) , I only get to see these things when they show up online .
A truly astonishing performance .
Kudos to Erin for maintaining her cool , as well as not adding to the madness .
I have two words for Jim : Moral Hazard .
Contrary to everything we learned under Easy Alan Greenspan , it is not the Fed 's role to backstop speculators and guarantee a one way market .
>
UPDATE August 4 , 2007 9:30 am
I have 2 requests :
1 ) Wo n't someone with more technical expertise than I pull the entire video off of CNBC and upload it to YouTube ?
( Man , does CNBC.com video suck wind , or what ?
2 ) Could someone -- a very clever young dj , perhaps -- please remix / mashup that rant into a new hiphop song ?
( It would be hysterical )

Thanks !

Now for the punchline : " Completely meaningless , it has no relevance whatsoever "

Agreed .
It is the action that Cramer is begging for ( and the mentality that it reflects ) that got us to the mess we 're in .
The Fed should n't do anything to bail anyone out .

I am going to assume that you know nothing about computer programming now .
If you already know something then the first part of this article will seem elementary to you .
Please feel free to skip forward until you get to something you do n't know .
I am going to assume you do know something about the computer you are using .
That is , I am going to assume you already know how to edit a file , copy and delete files , rename files , find information on your system , etc .
For simplicity , I am going to assume that you are using a machine running Windows 95 , 98 , 2000 , NT or XP .
It should be relatively straightforward for people running other operating systems to map the concepts over to those .
I am going to assume that you have a desire to learn .
All of the tools you need to start programming in Java are widely available on the Web for free .
There is also a huge amount of educational material for Java available on the Web , so once you finish this article you can easily go learn more to advance your skills .
You can learn Java programming here without spending any money on compilers , development environments , reading materials , etc .
Once you learn Java it is easy to learn other languages , so this is a good place to start .

Olbermann : Bush 's true motive is ' War today , war tomorrow , war forever ! '

Keith Olbermann offered a special comment on Tuesday 's Countdown concerning President Bush 's recent visit to a military base in Iraq , his suggestion that he might be able to start bringing some of the troops home , and the accidental revelation of his " true motive . "
" He is back from his annual , surprise , gratuitous , photo op in Iraq , and what a sorry spectacle it was , " said Olbermann .
" But it was nothing compared to the spectacle of one unfiltered , unguarded , horrifying quotation in the new biography to which Mr. Bush has consented .
... Mr. Bush probably did not know that , with his own words , he had already been proved to be a liar . "
Olbermann then quoted Bush 's remark to author Robert Draper in interviews for the book Dead Certain : " I 'm playing for October - November ... to get us in a position where the presidential candidates will become comfortable about sustaining a presence . "
" Your goal is not to bring some troops home , " proclaimed Olbermann .
" You are , to use your own disrespectful , tone - deaf word , ' playing ' at getting the next Republican nominee to agree to jump into this bottomless pit with you and take us into it with him . "
" Everything you said about Iraq yesterday , and everything you will say , is a deception for the purpose of this one cynical , unacceptable brutal goal -- perpetuating this war indefinitely , " continued Olbermann .
" War today !
War tomorrow !
War forever ! ... A man with any self - respect , having inadvertently revealed such an evil secret , would have already resigned and fled the country . "
Olbermann then took up Bush 's claim that he would make a decision about troop levels " based on a calm assessment by our military commanders ... not a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results . "
That single phrase , said Olbermann , perfectly displays the president 's " depraved indifference to democracy .. the craven projection of political motives onto to those trying to save lives and save a nation . "
" But this president has ceased to listen , " Olbermann concluded .
" This president has decided that night is day , and death is life , and enraging the world against us is safety .
And this laziest of presidents actually interrupted his precious time off to fly to Iraq to ' play ' at a photo opportunity with soldiers , some of whom will -- on his orders -- be killed before the year , maybe before the month , is out . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on September 4 .
A full transcript of Olbermann 's special comment is available from MSNBC .
We do n't cover much X Games around here — we probably do n't need to explain why — but last night , some guy named Jake Brown pulled off one of the most amazing moves in X Games history ... and then took a fall that amazingly did n't kill him .
We 're still not sure it 's sports , but man , it 's tough not to salute anyone who can survive that .
We mean ... his shoes popped off .
That happens during car wrecks .

Youth activists , veterans , and antiwar organizers have taken the street near Constitution Ave. , Pennsylvania Ave. , and 4th St. NW in the middle of Washington , D.C .
Several hundred people have completely shut down the street , including people from as far away as Oregon and Florida .
They intend to keep the street closed for as long as possible .
Hundreds of supporters have gathered on the sidewalks , as youth are erecting tents from the Encampment in the middle of the street .
br >
They are asking for the progressive and antiwar community in the area to come out and support them .
Bring food , water , signs , and join youth from across the U.S. who are moving from protest to resistance to shut down the war .

Update from Rally at the Encampment Site
Thousands of people are joining us here at the Encampment , despite efforts by the
police to block access to the rally .
We have been informed that police have blocked an entire highway into the city in
order to stop the buses that are coming from dozens of organizing centers .
We have
been on the phone with organizers , planning alternate routes into the city tobypass .
We are determined not to let the police block the outpour of resistance and
opposition to Bush ’s criminal war .
The mall in front of Congress is full of thousands of activists , some from as far
away as Washington State and Hawaii .
The march is stepping off in just a few minutes , and we ’ve just heard that a group
of youth are planning civil disobedience at the end of the march .
Details and
updates to follow .

Colbert : Today 's kids do n't know how to help except by linking Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 20 , 2007
Print This Email This Stephen Colbert added his own slant to the story of a University of Florida student tasered by campus police after he became obnoxious in asking questions following a John Kerry speech .
" Look at these guys in the back , " Colbert said , highlighting one frame from the video of the event .
" You do n't need a Fox body language expert to tell you that kid in orange is bored .
He 's probably thinking something like , ' I wish they 'd stop tasering this guy so I could go home and watch this guy getting tasered on YouTube . ' "
" I do n't know whether the tasered gentleman had a legitimate point to make or was just being an ass , " continued Colbert .
" One thing you can't argue is that his cause was joined by hordes of no one .
...
Students used to be a rebellious bunch .
... Today 's kids are so different . "
" The kids in that auditorium who sat idly by as their fellow student was seized , thrown to the ground , and tasered did n't lack the courage to help , " Colbert went on .
" They 're just so used to watching videos like ' Crazy guys thrown out of lecture hall ' that they did n't know how to help other than to link to it .
I 'm sure that guy in the orange is going to spring into action as soon as he gets home and fires up his blog . "
" And that 's what 's so great about this new kind of activism , " Colbert concluded .
" It 's convenient .
Just like masturbation .
It 's better than sex because it 's on your own time .
So ... make me proud , young people .
Continue waging your protests from the polite distance of your home computers .
Make ' the Man ' wish he'd never visited your site .
And if a fellow - student is denied the right to speak , remember , the best way to stand shoulder - to - shoulder with him is by sitting alone in your seat . "

System overload
Erlang is highly concurrent .
Damien is not .
CouchDb has been getting tons of interest .
I can barely keep up with it .
I wish I were n't so busy so I could actually respond to some of the stuff people are writing .
Between my newborn daughter , my full time job at MySQL , finishing the CouchDb JSON work and the week long MySQL engineering meeting in Germany next week , I 'm stretched about as far I can go .
Anyway , I 'm going to do a brain dump here :
DB or not DB ?
That is the question .
;/p>
First , the most important thing of all .
Everyone keeps referring to CouchDb with an uppercase B . So maybe it should CouchDB .
Why did I choose a lowercase b to begin with ?
Because I .... uh , um .... I do n't really remember .
I think it was because it fit the camel - case convention we used at Kubi , and I tend to use the same conventions as whatever I was coding last .
Anyway , for the rest of this posting I 'm going to try the uppercase way .
Also , anyone want to create a CouchDB logo ?
I 'm thinking someone RESTing comfortably on a couch , but since you 'll be doing it for free , you can make it be anything you want .
Jan announces " The Couch Book " .
He 's already got a good chunk written .
Can I write the foreward ?
Sam has been spending a lot of time with CouchDB , and has provided a lot of excellent feedback and suggestions .
He gets the simplicity and access angles .
Sam Ruby - Ascetic Database Architectures :
What API ’s / drivers to I need to integrate it with Ruby ?
HTTP and JSON .
What API ’s / drivers would I need to integrate it with Java ?
HTTP and JSON .
What API ’s / drivers would I need to integrate it with AJAX ?
HTTP and JSON .
What API ’s / drivers would I need to integrate it with ... oh , you get my point .
Do HTTP and JSON work with existing J2EE servers ?
You betcha .
What tooling do I need ?
Um , a browser , perhaps ?
Dare Obasanjo has a much more measured response , Some Thoughts on CouchDB and Relational Databases :
Document oriented database work well for semi-structured data where each item is mostly independent and is often processed or retrieved in isolation .
This describes a large category of Web applications which are primarily about documents which may link to each other but are n’t processed or requested often based on those links ( e.g. blog posts , email inboxes , RSS feeds , etc ) .
However there are also lots of Web applications that are about managing heavily structured , highly interrelated data ( e.g. sites that heavily utilize tagging or social networking ) where the document - centric model does n’t quite fit .
I mostly agree with that but I then picked out one of the most agreeable paragraphs in his post .
You need to read it all to get his full take .
I disagree there is anything inherently relational about tagging or social networks ( excepts of course , for the actual human relationships ) .
I have a feeling the document model with views and map / reduce is actually a better fit than for these sort of applications .
Think about how Google is figuring out what is interesting and interrelated in our world wide web of documents .
They 're not using SQL my friends .
SQL is great when you have highly structured data .
The problem is much of the data we generate day to day is n't easily extractable into carefully planned schemas and are challenging to represent and query in a SQL databases .
That means lots of useful data that could be stored and queried ends up unused or lost because we do n't have the time and resources to build schemas to store them .
A big goal of CouchDB is to free you from worry about carefully pre-structuring and normalizing your data , and instead just let you start storing your data in a natural and self describing way and evolve your queries over time .
The idea is there is a lot of data that could be accessible , indexable and shareable with very little work .
But there are lots of other database problems with very different data and consistency needs that wo n't fit well into the CouchDB model .
When data is highly structured and relational in nature , or when you need complex transaction processing , SQL is going to take CouchDB out to the woodshed and beat it with its own GPL license .
The right tools for the right job and all that .
Also Dare seems to imply that CouchDB is trendy because JSON is the current format de jour .
Possibly , but that 's not why I chose it .
I 'll tell you why I finally gave up on XML and chose JSON :
XML FUCKING SUCKS
And yes , the swear words are necessary , because you need to understand how much fucking frustration it has caused .
I 'll tell you the one thing XML is good for ( and I could be wrong because I really do n't know many alternatives ) , it 's good for marking - up textual documents .
For anything else , ESPECIALLY PROGRAMMATIC INTERFACES , it 's a goddamn nightmare .
I finally saw the light .
JSON also has warts , but it has been an absolute dream in comparison .
Sam Ruby also responds Dare Takes a Look at CouchDB , I highly recommend you read it :
At a certain point , referential integrity has to be given up .
Scale a bit further , and even the notion of a relation in the relational database sense of the word starts to break down .
To cope , you denormalize a bit , not so much for performance reasons ( though that ’s important too ) , but as a self defense mechanism so that the pieces of data that you do have have enough context to be meaningful .
And Assaf Arkin responds as well Conflicting Reads and Writes
Relational databases have failed the software industry in much the same way XML , Java and client - server failed the software industry .
In other words , no failure to see here , move along .
Those are all excellent technologies for solving a wide range of problems .
Just that there are some problems they ’re particularly poor at solving .
Exactly !
We need a wide range of tools , my screwdriver does n't negate the value of your hammer .
Lastly , there is no large file support on Erlang , the current Erlang file drivers are limited to 32 bit files sizes .
Obviously that is a bad thing for a database engine .
CouchDB needs a custom file system driver with large file support .
I think a good approach is to copy the existing file driver code and go from there .
This is the approach I was going to take and I figured it would take me less than a week .
Anyway , if anyway knows of a large file driver , please let me know .
If anyone wants to write a large file driver , please do and then give it to me .
Then the rest of Erlang land can benefit too .

George Bush 's Saturday Radio Address was another installment of , " do n't believe your lying eyes , " as the Commander guy told the nation that really , that interim report on how the escalation is working is n't as bad as the cut and runners are making it out to be .
This is a preliminary report .
In September , General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will return to Washington to provide a more comprehensive assessment . [...]
Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost are pointing to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the political benchmarks .
Those of us who believe the battle in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for optimism .
For the record , the Maliki government has failed on legislation for oil revenue sharing , scheduling provincial elections and reforming de-Baathification laws , three of the benchmarks that the Bush administration has been touting as vital to political reconciliation .
On the bright side , the Iraqi government did pony up $ 10 billion for reconstruction ( versus the $ 450 billion we 've spent so far ) .
But Bush is optimistic , because they do have eight weeks before that September report .
Well , not quite eight weeks :
Q Is the Iraqi government and the Iraqi parliament taking the month of August off ?
MR .
SNOW : Probably , yes .
Just not -- Q
They 're taking the entire month of August off , before the September deadline ?
MR .
SNOW : It looks like they may , yes .
Just like the U.S. Congress is .
Q
Have you tried to talk them out of that ?
MR .
SNOW : You know , it 's 130 degrees in Baghdad in August , I 'll pass on your recommendation .
Q
Well ,
Tony ,
Tony , I 'm sorry , that 's -- you know -- I mean , there are a lot of things that happen by September and it's 130 degrees for the U.S. military also on the ground -- MR .
SNOW : You know , that 's a good point .
And it 's 130 degrees for the Iraqi military .
The Iraqis , you know , I 'll let them -- my understanding is that at this juncture they 're going to take August off , but , you know , they may change their minds .
Well sure , our Congress is taking August off , so why should n't the Iraqi Parliment ?
That 's a fair comparison .
Bush finished by saying :
Most Americans want to see two things in Iraq :
They want to see our troops succeed , and they want to see our troops begin to come home .
We can do both , and we will . [...]
Thank you for listening .
No , most Americans , in fact , 70 % of Americans , want a timetable for troop withdrawal now .
When is George Bush going to start listening to us ?

It 's incredible what you can find in an ordinary garden if you look closely enough .
Amateur photographer Brian Valentine specialises in making the everyday look exotic with the wonders of macro photography , using special lens to magnify his subjects .
Scroll down for more ...
All these pictures were taken in his garden in Worthing , Sussex , and show the incredible beauty of flowers reflected in dewdrops and raindrops , usually on a simple blade of grass .
WASHINGTON  Breaking his self - imposed vow of silence , President Bush is wading deeper into the campaign to succeed him , declaring that he is a " strong asset " to Republican hopefuls and castigating Democrats who failed to denounce a MoveOn.org ad that mocked General David Petraeus .
Click Image to Enlarge Alex Wong / Getty President Bush speaks during a news conference at the White House today .
" I thought the ad was disgusting , " Mr. Bush said this morning at a White House press conference , referring to the New York Times display in which MoveOn.org referred to the commander of American forces in Iraq as " General Betray Us . "
" I was disappointed that not more leaders in the Democrat Party spoke out strongly against that kind of ad , " the president said when asked about Democratic candidates who did not rebuke the MoveOn.org ad , accusing them of being more fearful of alienating a left - wing anti-war group than of alienating America 's military .
" That leads me to come to this conclusion : that most Democrats are afraid of irritating a left - wing group like MoveOn.org  or more afraid of irritating them than they are of irritating the United States military . "
Mr. Bush added : " That was a sorry deal .
It 's one thing to attack me ; it 's another thing to attack somebody like General Petraeus . "
The leading Democratic presidential candidates , Senator Clinton , Senator Obama , and John Edwards , have largely dodged direct questions about the ad while emphasizing that their criticisms of Iraq war policy are aimed at Mr. Bush , not General Petraeus .
The executive director of MoveOn.org 's political action committee , Eli Pariser , responded quickly with a statement saying , " What 's disgusting is that the president has more interest in political attacks than developing an exit strategy to get our troops out of Iraq and end this awful war . "
Early this afternoon , the Senate voted 72 - 25 in favor of a resolution that said General Petraeus " deserves the full support of the Senate " and that lawmakers " strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all members of the United States Armed Forces . "
Mrs. Clinton and another Democratic presidential hopeful , Senator Dodd of Connecticut , voted against the symbolic measure , while Mr. Obama and Senator Biden of Delaware did not vote .
Mrs. Clinton 's vote drew an immediate attack from a Republican candidate , Mitt Romney , who issued a statement saying : " The idea that she would be a credible commander - in - chief of our armed forces requires the willing suspension of disbelief . "
There was no immediate response from the Democratic White House hopefuls to the president 's comments this morning .
The party 's national chairman , Howard Dean , responded by accusing Mr. Bush of " spinning the facts to try to sell his failed stay - the - course strategy in Iraq . "
He also criticized Republicans for blocking a vote yesterday on a bill requiring longer breaks between overseas deployment for American troops .
The president has repeatedly refused to engage in questions about the presidential race that has been heating up for months , saying he will resist the temptation to be " pundit - in- chief . "
But he strayed from that line this morning , offering advice to Republicans and declaring that he would be a " strong asset " rather than a liability , despite his low approval ratings .
" Candidates who go out and say that the United States is vulnerable to attack and we 're going to make sure our professionals have the tools necessary to protect us are going to do well , " he said .
" Candidates who go out and say that helping these Iraqis realize the benefits of democracy are going to do well . "
He added that candidates should state " clear principles " on foreign policy and that " candidates who say we 're not going to raise your taxes are going to do well . "
Following decisions by the leading GOP candidates to decline invitations to speak at forums before black and Hispanic audiences , Mr. Bush also pushed them to reach out more to minority communities .
" My advice to whoever will be our nominee is to reach out to the African American community , as well as other communities , because I believe that we 've got a very strong record when it comes to empowerment , when it comes to education , or home ownership , or small business formation , " he said .
An entire issue of the journal Homeopathy has been devoted to speculations about the memory of water .
The link to this issue is http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/14754916 , but sadly you ca n’t read the papers without a subscription to the journal ( and believe me , they are n’t worth paying much for ) .
With luck , Ben Goldacre will be able to post the full text at badscience .
net .
The first paper , The Memory of Water : a scientific heresy ? , is by Peter Fisher , the editor of the journal .
Peter Fisher , Homeopathic physician to the Queen , is a person whose name appears often in the original IMPROBABLE SCIENCE page , is not at unreasonable man , by the standards of homeopaths .
He condemned roundly the recommendation by less - educated homeopaths of homeopathic pills for prevention of malaria .
And he did agree with me that homeopathy had not got sufficient scientific basis to justify a BSc degree .
Peter Fisher ’s introduction to the issue admits quite frankly that there is no strong evidence for water having memory of the sort that would be needed to explain the claims of homeopaths .
There is nothing that explains the bizarre proposition that the medicine gets stronger the more you dilute it .
There is nothing that explains the equally bizarre proposition that the water ‘ remembers ’ only the ingredient that you add , but conveniently forgets the countless other substances that it has encountered in the oceans and the bodies of the vast numbers of animals and plants through which it has passed .
Fisher is also sufficiently honest to include in his special issue a contribution “ Can water possibly have a memory ?
A sceptical view “ , written by JosÃ© Teixeira ( a physicist from the European Neutron scattering lab - see some of his publications ) .
Conclusion
To summarize this short overview , one can say that water is a ‘ complex ’ liquid with many fascinating , sometimes unique aspects .
Except for some academic aspects concerning supercooled water , the structure of the liquid is well known .
In particular , it is certain that :
( a) There are no water clusters in pure liquid water , but only density fluctuations .
( b)
The longest life of any structure observed in liquid water is of the order of 1 ps [ one millionth of a millionth of a second ]
This is why any interpretation calling for ‘ memory ’.effects in pure water must be totally excluded .
The special issue on the memory of water takes us no further .
After 200 years , there is still no good evidence .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The White House disclosed Wednesday that President Bush was treated for Lyme disease last summer .
President Bush rides with cyclist Lance Armstrong at his ranch in Crawford , Texas .
A spokesman says it's " not uncommon " for Bush to get tick bites during his bike rides
The revelation is in an annual report on Bush 's health that declares him " fit for duty . "
It shows that he was treated last August for symptoms " consistent with early , localized Lyme disease " without any reoccurrence .
White House spokesman Scott Stanzel told CNN that it is " not uncommon " for Bush to get tick bites during his frequent bike rides .
Lyme disease can be transmitted through the bite of a tick that carries the disease .
He said the president noticed he had a small rash in a " localized area " of his body last summer , and his doctors treated it .
" It 's been resolved , " Stanzel said .
" He 's had no reoccurrence and no other symptoms . "
Stanzel said the disclosure was not made sooner because the rash was n't serious enough to be revealed .
" This was a rash and did not impact his duties , so it 's being reported now , " he said .
Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta describe symptoms of Lyme disease »
During a colonoscopy last month , the president had five small growths removed from his colon , though his doctors said the growths were not cancerous .
The overall summary of the president 's medical history , signed by all 11 doctors who have examined him over the past year , say he 's in terrific health .
Brig .
Gen. Richard Tubb , the White House physician , and Dr. Kenneth Cooper , president of The Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas , Texas , oversaw the examinations .
Bush exercises six times a week , according to the report , and has an impressively low body - fat percentage of 16.6 .
His weight dropped four pounds from last year , down to 192 .
While the president had to slightly rearrange his schedule after suffering flu - like symptoms at the Group of Eight Summit in Germany in June , the report says he has not " otherwise missed work due to illness since his last physical exam " in 2006 .

This Is Why We Revile Them
The centerpiece of Edwards 's campaign is his anti-poverty efforts ; he presents himself as a dedicated messenger for the cause , and he likes expensive haircuts , bought a gimungous house , etc. etc .
His credibility as a messenger comes into question when he spends money ostentatiously .
( The haircut was inadvertently billed to the campaign , a spokesman later said ) .
There is a difference in the political reality : fairly or unfairly , a healthy chunk of the national political press corps does n't like John Edwards .
Fairly or unfairly , there 's also a difference in narrative timing : when the first quarter ended , the press was trying to bury Edwards .
It 's not so much interested in burying Romney right now -- many reporters think he 's the Republican frontrunner .

The traditional belief that Jupiter acts as a celestial shield , deflecting asteroids and comets away from the inner Solar System , has been challenged by the first in a series of studies evaluating the impact risk to the Earth posed by different groups of object .
On Friday 24th August at the European Planetary Science Congress in Potsdam , Dr Jonathan Horner presented a study of the impact hazard posed to Earth by the Centaurs , the parent population of the Jupiter Family of comets ( JFCs ) .
The results show that the presence of a Jupiter - like planet in the Solar System does not necessarily lead to a lower impact rate at the Earth .
Dr Horner , from the UK's Open University ( OU ) , said , " The idea that a Jupiter - like planet plays an important role in lessening the impact risk on potentially habitable planets is a common belief but there has only really been one study done on this in the past , which looked at the hazard due to the Long Period Comets .
We are carrying out an ongoing series of studies of the impact risks in planetary systems , starting off by looking at our own Solar System , since we know the most about it ! "
The team at the OU developed a computer model that could track the paths of 100,000 Centaurs around the Solar System over 10 million years .
The simulation was run five times : once with Jupiter at its current mass , once without a Jupiter , and then with planets of three - quarters , a half and a quarter the mass of Jupiter ( for comparison , Saturn is about a third of the mass of Jupiter ) .
The team found that the impact rate in a Solar System with a planet like our Jupiter is about comparable to the case where there is no Jupiter at all .
However , when the mass of Jupiter was between these two extremes , the Earth suffered an increased number of impacts from the JFCs .
Dr Horner said , " We 've found that if a planet about the mass of Saturn or a bit larger occupied Jupiter 's place , then the number of impacts on Earth would increase .
However if nothing was there at all , there would n't be any difference from our current impact rate .
Rather than it being a clear cut case that Jupiter acts as a shield , it seems that Jupiter almost gives with one hand and takes away with the other ! "
The study shows that if there is no giant planet present , the JFCs will not be diverted onto Earth - crossing orbits , so the impact rate at the Earth is low .
A Saturn - mass planet would have the gravitational pull to inject objects onto Earth - crossing orbits , but would not be massive enough to easily eject objects from the Solar System .
This means that there would be more objects on Earth - crossing orbits at any given time , and therefore more impacts .
However , a planet with Jupiter 's vast mass can give objects the gravitational boost to eject them from the Solar System .
Therefore , if Jupiter deflects JFCs to an Earth - crossing orbit , it may well later sweep them right out of the Solar System and off the collision course with the Earth .
The group is now assessing the impact risk posed to the Earth by the Asteroids and will go on to study the Long Period Comets , before examining the role of the position of Jupiter within our system .
Jupiter family of comets
The Jupiter Family of Comets ( JFCs ) are short period comets with an orbital period of less than 20 years .
Their orbits are controlled by Jupiter and they are believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt , a vast population of small icy bodies that orbit just beyond Neptune .
Famous JFCs include Comet 81P / Wild 2 , which was encountered by the Stardust spacecraft in January 2004 and Comet Shoemaker Levy - 9 , which broke up and collided with Jupiter in July 1994 .
WASHINGTON : US President George W. Bush signaled Saturday his unwillingness to consider early US troop reductions in Iraq , saying new offensive operations there were just in their " early stages .
"
The statement , made in his weekly radio address , followed a fervent plea by John Warner , the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , who publicly asked the president to initiate by September 15 at least a symbolic drawdown of US military forces from Iraq .
Warner , a former secretary of the Navy and a widely respected authority on military affairs , suggested Thursday the president bring home up to 5,000 US troops as " the first step in a withdrawal of armed forces " in order to " send a sharp and clear message " to the Iraqi government that the US commitment was not open - ended .
Bush has not formally responded to the appeal .
But in his address , he expressed satisfaction with offensive operations launched in the wake of a nearly 30,000 - troop surge he announced at the beginning of the year -- and said they were just beginning .
" We are still in the early stages of our new operations , " the president said .
" But the success of the past couple of months have shown that conditions on the ground can change -- and they are changing .
" He argued that every month since January , US forces have killed or captured on average more than 1,500 Al - Qaeda fighters and other insurgents in Iraq .
Young Iraqi men are signing up for the army , Bush went on to say , police are patrolling the streets , and neighborhood watch groups are being formed in Iraqi cities .
Bush said Iraqis were now volunteering important information about insurgents and other extremists hiding in their midst more frequently , which had led to a " marked reduction " in sectarian murders .
"
We cannot expect the new strategy we are carrying out to bring success overnight , " the president concluded .
" But by standing with the Iraqi people as they build their democracy , we will deliver a devastating blow to Al - Qaeda , we will help provide new hope for millions of people throughout the Middle East , we will gain a friend and ally in the war on terror , and we will make the American people safer .
"
The address was part of a broad public relations offensive launched by the White House ahead of a crucial report to Congress by the top US military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
The two officials are to present their views in mid-September on whether efforts to halt sectarian violence and return Iraq to viable self - governance with the help of about 160,000 US troops now in the country were bearing fruit .
Bush defended his Iraq strategy in a major speech before an annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Kansas City this past week and is expected to reinforce the message on Tuesday , when he addresses members of the American Legion at their convention in Reno , Nevada .
But his upbeat assessment of the military campaign has been undercut by a somber analysis presented Thursday by the US intelligence community , which warned in a declassified estimate that despite security gains , " Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively " and sectarian violence " probably will intensify .
" Warner , who has just visited Iraq together with Democratic Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , also came back in a pessimistic mood .
The two senators said in a joint statement that while the US troop " surge " had given Iraqi politician some " breathing space " to make compromises " which are essential for a political solution in Iraq , we are not optimistic about the prospects for those compromises .
" However , The Washington Post reported Saturday the White House plans to keep its existing military strategy and troop levels in Iraq in place , even after the report by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday May 21 2007
In the next few days an unprecedented meeting between US and Iranian officials is expected to take place in Baghdad ; both sides have insisted that discussions are limited to Iraq .
Could this first official encounter since the Islamic revolution herald detente between Washington and Tehran ?
At the moment nothing suggests that is likely , as each country continues to try to mobilise the states of the region .
The US vice - president , Dick Cheney , has been touring the Arab world , reiterating Washington 's determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , meanwhile , is visiting the UAE , the first by an Iranian leader since independence in 1971 and all the more important because of a serious territorial dispute .
Responding to the threatening noises from Cheney , President Ahmadinejad declared : " The US can not strike Iran .
The Iranian people can protect themselves and retaliate . "
Although the US administration 's current priority is Iraq , it has not given up on Iran .
Silently , stealthily , unseen by cameras , the war on Iran has begun .
Many sources confirm that the US has increased its aid to armed movements among the ethnic minorities that make up about 40 % of Iran 's population .
ABC
News reported in April that the US had secretly assisted the Baluchi group Jund al - Islam ( Soldiers of Islam ) , responsible for a recent attack that killed 20 Revolutionary Guards .
According to an American Foundation report , US commandos have operated inside Iran since 2004 .
President Bush categorised Iran as part of the " axis of evil " in 2002 ; the following year he said the US " would not tolerate " an Iranian nuclear weapon .
It is worth recalling the context in which these statements were made .
Tehran had actively helped the US to overthrow the Taliban .
At a meeting in Geneva on May 2 2003 between Javad Zaraf , the Iranian ambassador , and Zalmay Khalilzad , Bush 's special envoy to Afghanistan , the Tehran government submitted a proposal for general negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , terrorism and security , and economic cooperation .
The Islamic Republic said it was ready to support the Arab peace initiative tabled in 2002 and help to transform Hizbullah into a political party .
And in December 2003 , Iran became one of the few countries to sign the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty , which strengthens the International Atomic Energy Agency 's supervisory powers .
However , the US swept all these overtures aside since its only objective is to overthrow the mullahs .
To create the conditions for military intervention , it constantly brandishes " the nuclear threat " .
In 1995 the director of the US arms control and disarmament agency said Iran could have the bomb by 2003 ; Clinton 's defence secretary William Perry predicted 2000 , a forecast repeated by Israel 's Shimon Peres .
Yet last month the IAEA considered that it would be four to six years before Tehran had the capability to produce the bomb .
What is the truth ?
Since the 1960s , Iran has sought to develop nuclear power in preparation for the post - oil era .
Technological developments have made it easier to pass from civil to military applications .
Have Tehran 's leaders decided to do so ?
There is no evidence that they have .
Is there a risk that they may ?
Yes , for obvious reasons .
During the Iran - Iraq war , Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against Iran , but there was no outcry in the US , whose troops are now deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Two neighbouring countries , Pakistan and Israel , have nuclear weapons .
No Iranian leader could fail to be aware of this situation .
So how is Tehran to be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons , a move that would start a new arms race in an unstable region and deal a fatal blow to the non-proliferation treaty ?
Contrary to common assumptions , the main obstacle is not Tehran 's determination to enrich uranium .
Iran has a right to do so under the non-proliferation treaty but has always said it was prepared to impose voluntary restrictions on that right and to agree to increased IAEA inspections .
The Islamic Republic 's fundamental concern lies elsewhere .
Witness the agreement signed in 2004 with France , Britain and Germany , in which Iran agreed to suspend enrichment on the understanding that a long - term agreement would " provide firm commitments on security issues " .
Washington refused to give any such commitments and Iran resumed its programme .
The EU chose to follow Washington 's lead .
The proposals of the five members of the UN security council and Germany in June 2006 contained no guarantee of non-intervention in Iranian affairs .
In response , Tehran suggested " that the western parties who want to participate in the negotiation team announce on behalf of their own and other European countries , to set aside the policy of intimidation , pressure and sanctions " .
Without such a commitment escalation is inevitable .
Ahmadinejad 's election as president in 2005 has not made dialogue any easier , given his taste for provocative statements about the Holocaust and Israel .
But Iran is a big country rich in history , and there is more to it than its president .
There is much tension within the government , and Ahmadinejad had severe setbacks both in the local elections and in elections to the Assembly of Experts last December .
There are substantial challenges , economic and social , and forceful demands for more freedom , especially among women and young people .
The only strong card the regime has to win their loyalty is nationalism , a refusal to accept the kind of foreign interference Iran suffered throughout the past century .
Despite the disaster in Iraq , there is no indication that Bush has given up the idea of attacking Iran .
The insistence at the weekend by Gordon Brown that there would be no attack on Iran seems unwarranted optimism rather than objective assessment .
The idea of an assault against Iran is after all part of the Bushite vision of a " third world war " against " Islamic fascism " , an ideological war that can end only in complete victory .
The demonisation of Iran , aggravated by the attitude of its president , is part of this strategy and may well culminate in yet another military venture .
That would be a disaster , not only for Iran and the Arab world , but for western , and especially European , relations with the Middle East .
Europe 's newest leaders - Nicolas Sarkozy and Brown - would do well to remember that .

Monkeys seem to learn the same way humans do , a new research study indicates .
" Like humans , monkeys benefit enormously from being actively involved in learning instead of having information presented to them passively , " said Nate Kornell , a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in psychology and lead author of the study , which appears in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science .
" The advantage of active learning appears to be a fundamental property of memory in humans and nonhumans alike . "
In Kornell 's study , conducted when he was a psychology graduate student at Columbia University , two rhesus macaque monkeys learned to place five photographs in a particular order .
The photographs were displayed on a touch - screen computer monitor similar to those found on ATMs .
When the monkeys pressed a correct photograph , a border appeared around it .
When either monkey pressed all five photographs in the correct order , he received a food reward .
The chance of guessing all five accurately is less than one percent .
In all , each monkey learned to order at least 18 separate series of photographs , which included such items as a fish , a human face , a building , a football field and a flame from a match .
They underwent three days of training before being tested .
In some of the training trials , the monkeys had to figure out the correct order themselves , while in others , they had the option of getting help by pushing an icon in the corner of the screen that caused the border of the correct photograph to flash .
They were rewarded with an M&M candy each time they correctly completed the task without help and with a less desirable food pellet when they completed the task with hints from the help icon .
After three days , the monkeys were tested without the benefit of the help icon .
" Both monkeys did much better if they had studied without a hint than if they had studied with a hint , " Kornell said .
" The monkeys did much better on the first three days when they had the help than when they did n't , but on the test day , it completely reversed .
When they studied with the hint , there is no evidence they learned anything about the list .
They learned the lists when they did n't get the help . "
The findings are closely related to findings in humans that recalling answers from memory enhances long - term learning .

" The findings were somewhat unintuitive , because passively using the hint appeared to enhance performance during the study phase of the experiment but had a deleterious effect on long - term learning , " Kornell said .
What are the implications for human learning ?
" Many people incorrectly assume the better you do as you 're studying , the more you 're learning , " said Kornell , who works in the laboratory of Robert A. Bjork , professor and chair of psychology at UCLA .
" If students do n't test themselves when they read a chapter , they can easily think they know the material when they do n't .
When you test yourself as you study , you may feel like you 're making it harder on yourself , but on the test , you will do much better .
Robert Bjork calls this ' desirable difficulty . '
If you want to learn something well , when you 're reading , stop and think about what you 've read , and test yourself ; you learn by testing yourself .
If you make it more difficult for yourself while you study , you feel like you 're doing worse , but you 're learning more .
" Active learning is important in humans and -- this study demonstrates -- in monkeys as well , " he added .
Less effective passive learning includes listening to a presentation and reading without testing yourself or summarizing what you have learned .
" When you summarize the material in your own words , that 's much more active , " Kornell said .
" You ca n't do that if you do n't understand it . "
advertisement
Cramming right before a test does not work as well as spacing studying out over a longer period of time , Kornell added , citing other research on learning and memory .
Kornell 's research , supported by the National Institute of Mental Health , was conducted with Herbert Terrace , a professor of psychology at Columbia .
The two monkeys , Macduff and Oberon , are housed at the New York State Psychiatric Institute , where Terrace has a joint appointment .
Neither animal was harmed in the study , and they were fed daily regardless of how they performed in the trials .
" Many people , " Kornell noted , " have had the experience of listening to a computer instructor open a menu and go through a series of steps .
Then you try to do it , and you do n't even know which menu or what the first step is .
If you are passively following along , you wo n't remember it as well as if you 're forced to do it yourself .
Active learning is much harder , but if you can do it successfully , you will remember it much better in the long run .
" If you 're learning to serve a tennis ball , you wo n't get much out of an instructor taking your arm and practicing the swing over and over , " he said .
" That 's not going to help you nearly as much as if you serve the ball yourself . "
The situation is the same for monkeys , according to Kornell .
" The way the monkeys learn to remember the correct answers is through active learning , like humans , " he said .
" They have to generate the answers themselves from memory .
Generating the correct sequence from memory resulted in more long - term learning than the more passive training with hints . "
Kornell noted that more than a century ago , author William James remarked on the importance of being actively involved in learning .
Since then , science has proven him correct .
Kornell also noted that his research confirms the teachings of another monkey : Curious George .

This week 's hottest topic on Live Journal , Russia 's most popular Internet forum , was the scaling of a Moscow skyscraper by a French daredevil who calls himself " Spiderman .
" Running a close second was a heated debate on Russian politics , which , according to the person who started the discussion , are pointless and a waste of time .
Hundreds of Live Journal users responded to the posting -- an act some of them said proved that political debate is alive and well .
Masha Lipman , a political expert at the Moscow Carnegie Center , says that web forums like Live Journal provide an arena for free debate that is no longer available in much of the conventional media .
" There is indeed a lot of free exchange on the Internet , " Lipman says .
" The question in Russia is not that there are no outlets where free expression is possible .
The question is that the Kremlin has radically marginalized all outlets that pursue even reasonably independent editorial lines .
" Russians are the second - largest group of users of Live Journal , a popular U.S. blogger site .
In Russia , the site currently has more than 1.1 million users and 67,500 interest groups .
On September 5 alone , 1,600 new users joined Live Journal in Russia and almost 500,000 new comments were posted .
" Actually , I think the Internet is one of the reasons Russia is still not an authoritarian regime , because you cannot really shut down the Internet without very serious measures , " says Yulia Latynina , a political commentator whose columns are frequently posted on Live Journal .
Most Russians get their news and current affairs from three main television channels , all of which are controlled by the government or state - owned enterprises .
A handful of independently owned television and radio stations and some of the national newspapers provide some alternative to the Kremlin 's view of events .
Earlier this year , President Vladimir Putin created a new government agency to monitor the media and the Internet , sparking fears that sites like Live Journal would be censored .
Opposition parties frequently use Live Journal and similar websites to give information about forthcoming political rallies .
Critics say the creation of the agency will allow the Kremlin to stifle opposition voices on websites and introduce Soviet - era controls in the run-up to a parliamentary election in December and a presidential vote next spring .
But Lipman says the way the government approaches sites like Live Journal is more sophisticated :
" The Kremlin has lots of sites under its control , financed by businesses associated with the Kremlin or otherwise , which create an environment in which those more independent ones are easily dissolved , " she says .
" This dissolution , I think , is one thing that the Kremlin is using to counter or neutralize the potentially stirring effect .
" And those Kremlin - backed websites , she says , are often difficult to spot .
" It 's not that they are necessarily loyal or produce bland propaganda , similar to what you see on television , " Lipman says .
" They may be critical themselves , but this will be criticism that the Kremlin itself sort of oversees .
" But with the number of visitors to Internet forums increasing every day , the appetite for free debate shows no signs of abating .
I am much better employed from every point of view , when I live solely for my own satisfaction , than when I begin to worry about the world .
The world frightens me , and a frightened man is no good for anything .

Wow .
That girl who just walked over to the frozen food section is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen : tall , slim , beautiful long , dark , silky hair , and a skimpy summer outfit that is almost frustratingly revealing of her perfect figure .
That , you tell yourself , is exactly the kind of girl you want .
Of course , you never actually say anything to her , because she ’d probably think you ’re weird to just go up and talk to her like that …right ?
The biggest roadblock that is holding most of us back from living exactly the life we want is entirely self - created :
It ’s that we actually care what other people think .
Imagine what your life would be like if you just did what you wanted to do , instead of being imprisoned by social conditioning .
Imagine if every time you saw that beautiful girl in the supermarket , you said hi to her .
Imagine how much happier you ’d be if you stopped doing things that other people thought were cool , and started living every moment as the full expression of who you are .
The most adrenaline - pumping risk you can take in life is to be yourself .
Authenticity is a learnable skill and developing that skill requires taking action .
As Einstein said , “ Nothing happens until something moves . ”
Acknowledge the Problem
If you feel that your actions ( or lack thereof ) are governed in large part by social conditioning , the first step to not caring what other people think is to not only accept that this is a problem in your life , but that it is the most serious problem of all .
It ’s holding you back from meeting the girl of your dreams .
It ’s tearing you apart when you choose to define yourself by what other people think of you .
It ’s preventing you from doing things you really want to do , because you ’re worried that other people may look down upon you or criticize your efforts .
By making authenticity your top priority , you ’ll grant yourself the time and energy required to learn how to stand up for your own truth .
Give Yourself Permission to Be You
Friends are n’t forever , lovers often go their separate ways , and even families sometimes fall apart .
The only person who is guaranteed to be by your side through thick and thin from your first breath to your last sputter is you .
Be your own role model .
The only person you need validation from is yourself .
You ’re here for a reason because you choose to have a reason to be here .
If you see life as something to endure rather than to enjoy , it ’s because you ’re letting yourself be controlled by the world , rather than being your own force of nature .
Would you date yourself ?
Would you hire yourself ?
Would you invite yourself to your own party ?
If not , consider the reasons why and do something about it .
Be more of what you want to attract into your life .
Hit the gym and burn the fat .
Stop torturing yourself by choosing to drag yourself through the daily grind , and find something meaningful that you can really sink your teeth into .
Instead of being the wallflower , use social occasions as a chance to amuse yourself .
Experience Massive Rejection
One of the biggest risks of being yourself is getting rejected .
The girl might ignore you .
The prospective employer may catch you off - guard with questions you have no idea how to answer ( never mind that you could Google them in about five seconds ) .
Your work might get strongly criticized , or even discarded .
The best way of getting over this fear , in my experience , is exposure therapy .
To experience rejection on a massive scale , go out into the world and talk to everyone .
Do n’t go out with the intention of getting anything , just do it to prove to yourself that rejection is no big deal .
As I ’ve mentioned before , you can even give a friend some money and try to earn it back for each person you talk to , a few dollars at a time .
Another enlightening lesson is to invite one of your “ natural ” buddies ( you know , the guys who seem to get all the women without even trying ) to do these approaches too .
Then you ’ll see that naturals get constantly rejected too .
While rejection comes in many forms , from getting cut from the basketball team to having your most prized work be thrown away , I find that social skydiving provides the most direct lessons in the art of getting blown out , and it ’s a great way to build character . :)
Remember that no matter what you do , how you dress , how you act , what you say , or what your opinions are , you will polarize people .
Some girls , for example , will look at you like you ’re an alien from another planet .
Others will think you ’re a fire hydrant with feet .
So you might as well just be yourself , and gravitate towards only those who amuse you .
Make Talking to Strangers a Habit
While the previous exercise is meant to be short - lived , I ’m also a big fan of making meeting people a habit .
Though some kamikaze social experimentation can be instructive , talking to people you do n’t know on a regular basis will help you develop reusable social skills and a capacity to deal with social pressure .
Not only is this a great way to meet people , and even get dates , but it can teach you a lot about not caring what people think .
For example , you ’ll eventually realize that you can open a conversation with absolutely anything .
And even that HUGE pimple on your nose and a bad hair day do n’t have to impede your ability to connect with strangers .
All that time you spend worrying about what to say or “ being cool ” is for naught .
What matters most is your energy .
Not entertainment monkey gymnastic energy , but the awe - inspiring courage you have to go for exactly what you want and make yourself vulnerable .
Do n’t Get High on Positive Feedback
I get feedback from readers every single day about this blog and it ’s almost unanimously positive .
And while it ’s extremely rewarding to connect with people in a way that inspires them to change their lives , I do n’t define myself by reader opinion .
If you start believing people when they tell you how much you rock , then you ’ll start believing them when they tell you how much you suck .
Moderate your emotional response .
Be the impartial spectator observing the emotional sugar rush you get from a good reaction , and the pain and frustration you feel from being criticized or shutdown .
Use feedback as a chance to learn something , but do n’t let it mess with your head .
Likewise , do n’t take ownership of nasty responses .
Think about it :
If a girl is truly happy with herself , enjoying life , thankful for being where she is , and at peace with the world around her , why would she look at you like you ’re an alien just because you said hi ?
Realize that the way a person reacts to the world around them says more about the person than the world around them .
Angry people react angrily .
Depressing people bring sadness to every circumstance .
Complainers will always find something wrong .
Knowing Authenticity
While you might say that you do n’t care what other people think , truly living authentically is another matter .
You can hide the truth from other people , but you ca n’t hide it from yourself .
It ’s not about what you say , but what you feel .
The best way to know that you ’re living an authentic life is to listen to your emotions .
Are you living paycheque to paycheque emotionally , relying on the occasional positive response to give you a much - needed boost , or are you enjoying the riches of self - approval ?
Do you need a relationship to feel “ complete ” or do you blaze your own trail and let others come along for the ride ?
Would you trade your life for anyone else’s ?
Caring what other people think will ensure you live a small life .
The biggest risk we can take is to not risk being who we really are .
No matter what you do , you will polarize people , so you might as well be yourself .
You owe it to the world to be authentic .
The good news is that authenticity is a learnable skill .
Like anything else , it all comes down to practice .
Firefox , the browser that dared to challenge the supremacy of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , has just reached 400 m downloads - and deservedly so .
It now claims a market share of nearly 20 % in the UK and 30 % in Germany .
Firefox , part of the admirable Mozilla Foundation , is based on open source , created and improved on by volunteers all over the world .
The cooperative spirit that infused the open source movement is now taking over the world as people and corporations collaborate on music , videos , products or the Wikipedia .
All of which makes it scandalous that the open source movement has not taken off in the UK as it has in other countries .
You would have thought that a Labour government , struggling to marry the success of market forces with the socialist endowment of its founding fathers , would have latched on to this new cooperativism which brings people together for a common purpose with a burning zeal .
In fact , its wanton neglect could damage our economic prospects .
The depth of its neglect was made plain by speakers at a seminar last week hosted by Westminster eForum , which tries to make parliament aware of IT issues .
It turns out , in contrast to what other governments are doing , that most departments - including Health , Work and the Foreign Office - are so risk - averse they have virtually no open source in their IT infrastructures .
The Treasury runs less than 1 % of its operations with open source .
The Conservatives , who rightly believe Labour is vulnerable in this area , claim that nearly £ 700 m could be saved by switching to open source .
This is disputed by others who point to the high initial cost of switching from an embedded system and retraining everyone .
But in the long run , low maintenance costs plus the absence of licence fees and upgrade charges must give open source the edge and , even if it did n't , there is still a strong case for encouraging it because a workforce skilled in open source would be well placed to exploit the enormous opportunities opening up for the future .
Schools are not much better , a double tragedy because they not only do n't benefit from savings but also lose the opportunity to train children in the skills of the future .
Equally serious is the indifference of small companies .
This , we were told , was down to a suspicion that anything that is free can't be any good .
This is not a view shared by Google or Amazon - both huge users of open source .
It was strongly disputed by a representative from Malmaison , the very cool hotel group which has put most of its operations on to open source for one simple reason : " high performance and low cost " .
Alfresco , a British software company which has been successful in the US and has a 100,000 user project with the European Commission , reported that barely 5 % of its business is in the UK .
The flagship of open source is the Linux operating system , a potential rival to Windows .
It operates successfully in lots of places , including a Nokia N800 mobile device I have been testing , where it works apparently faultlessly in the background .
But , despite improvements , including Ubuntu , its latest highly regarded incarnation , Linux still gives the impression of being made by engineers for engineers and has n't made the critical jump to consumer friendliness .
This can be seen in comments on websites to help you install Ubuntu such as : " It 's normal that WinXP does n't see your Linux partition .
Disk management in XP admin tools will . "
Easily understood by a geek but a turnoff for someone who wants an easy consumer experience .
Which is exactly what Mozilla has managed to do with Firefox , which is easy to download and modify .
They have even taken away some functions to reduce the " button count " .
Maybe Mozilla 's marketing skills should be harnessed by Linux to turn a wonderful product into something people actually want to use .

As you enjoy your weekend , ponder this bit of humor : while the iPhone may be master of the digital mobile experience ( for now ) , dead trees come in for a flogging , as AT&T's iPhone bills are quite impressive in their own right .
We 're starting to get bills for the iPhone here at Ars , and while many of us have had smartphones for some time , we 've never seen a bill like this .
One of our bills is a whopping 52 pages long , and my own bill is 34 pages long .
They 're printed on both sides , too .
What gives ?
The AT&T bill itemizes your data usage whenever you surf the Internet via EDGE , even if you 're signed up for the unlimited data plan .
AT&T also goes into an incredible amount of detail to tell you — well , almost nothing .
For instance , I know that on July 27 at 3:21 p.m.
I had some data use that , under the To / From heading , AT&T has helpfully listed as " Data Transfer . "
The Type of file ?
" Data . "
My total charge ?
$ 0.00 .
This mind - numbing detail goes on for 52 double - sided pages ( for 104 printed pages ! ) with absolutely no variance except the size of the files .
The picture above is one half of one page .
As you can plainly see , with all the information they give away as to my surfing habits , that image makes me a ripe target for identity theft .
Or not .
Okay , so maybe we should be happy that the pages upon pages of info in this bill are n't going to send privacy advocates into seizures , but then again , why waste the paper ?
Guess which one is the iPhone bill
Apple 's renown for elegance and simplicity has been ironically mocked by this ridiculous document of excess .
Why would we possibly need to know how many times we were n't charged to access something of the type DATA using our Data Transfer at the Rate Code MBRF ?
Our Blackberry users ' round these parts are n't seeing bills like this .
Oh , well — I suppose when I 'm out using my iPhone , I can imagine AT&T 's line printer working tirelessly to provide me and thousands of others with an IRS - sized document dump every month .
Ah , how simple and easy it is to live in the digital age .
People say , " Oh , that Henry is a crazy type . "
But they do n't mean it in a bad way .
Because MicroUnity 's Henry Massalin is not just crazy – he may be the ultimate nerd genius .
We 're sitting in a coffee shop in Sunnyvale , California .
It 's late .
I 've had a few beers , and my dinner date has downed a few plum wines .
I peer deep into his eyes , trying to figure out why so many people throughout the high tech universe think Henry Massalin could be the Einstein of our time .
Massalin's hands are together , as if praying .
He looks at me , eyes widening , and yells : " Qua ! "
What does that mean ?
Is he trying to communicate with a higher life form ?
You feel kind of stupid when you do n't understand a genius .
At first glance , Massalin is simply one strange dude .
He wears a koala T - shirt and babyGap - sized running shorts pulled up tight , like he 's giving himself a wedgie .
He likes to be called Qua ! , which he says is the sound koalas make .
Spend any time with him and you 're bombarded with jokes that would make a ninth - grader cringe .
But the weirdest part of the Massalin experience is that he 's always hinting - like every four minutes !
- about giving me a piggyback ride .
It 's his " hobby . "
Massalin rattles off a list of people who 've hoisted themselves onto his back , gripped those waifish shoulders , and gone for a bouncy spin : Unix creators Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson , artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky , 200 - pound Perot Systems chair Mort Meyerson , Teller ( of the comedy team Penn & Teller ) .
Massalin makes another plea for a late - night , sweaty - summer ride .
I 'm just not ready for it .
I must admit I 'm slightly Henryphobic .
An hour later we 're in his Motel 6 - like apartment .
It 's around midnight .
We 're alone , except for his straight - out - of - nerd - central - casting tools : an X station , a LEGO set , a synthesizer , an oscillator , a soldering iron , an air purifier ( because of his allergies ) , and his so - called " Qua ! Machine " - a homemade 68030 - based workstation .
The apartment is devoid of photographs of people .
Massalin is holding a stuffed koala named Quincy .
He looks at it lovingly , then passes the fuzzy marsupial to me .
" Hold my koala ? " he asks , hopefully .
If these are the ways of genius , who am I to resist ?
I squeeze his koala and look it right in the eye .
" Er ... uh ... hi ! "
" Say hi , Quincy ! "
Am I the only person who thinks this behavior is odd ?
Later , after kissing Quincy goodbye , I 'm feeling a little weird .
It would be easy to write off Massalin as just another high tech eccentric who holds two groundbreaking patents .
But geniuses nowadays are supposed to be strange , and I recall the words of people who adulate Massalin :
" He 's a bright and sensible guy who 's really not nutty , " says Stephen Wolfram , creator of the scientific software Mathematica and the youngest recipient , at the time , of a MacArthur " Genius " Fellowship .
" Henry is the most creative person I 've ever met , " says Ken Phillips , a phone phreak / hacker / Jungian professor of the psychology of creativity at New York University .
" If someone can harness him and direct him , then it 's boundless what he can do , " says Chris Arnone , an old college buddy and a distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T .
Adds John Moussouris , Massalin 's boss and a former Rhodes scholar : " I wish the rest of the world was more like Henry . "
Really ?
Chip champ
Henry Massalin is a 34 - year - old research scientist at MicroUnity Systems Engineering , a mysterious Sunnyvale firm that is creating chips for smart set - top boxes .
MicroUnity 's MediaProcessor will facilitate broadband processing , simultaneously handling radio , video , cellular , and network sources .
It would serve thousands of people wanting to do the same thing at once , such as accessing the same movie on an interactive TV network .
MicroUnity hopes MediaProcessors will someday be ubiquitous throughout communications networks , serving as the universal processing engine both at central head - end facilities and in end - user equipment .
Moussouris , the company 's CEO and chair , believes that combining all these functions in a single , programmable chip will significantly reduce the cost of systems ranging from cable modems and interactive set - top boxes to cellular base stations .
Instead of requiring a jumble of special - purpose ASICs , DSPs , and microcontrollers - each with its own private memory - all functions will be performed by the MediaProcessor .
The result should be a dramatic decrease in chip count , and potentially in price .
MicroUnity hopes to sell MediaProcessors for less than US $ 100 each .
It 's an enormously tall order .
Creating a brand - new microprocessor architecture and an operating system to go with it is no stroll in the park .
The MediaProcessor will deliver not just a few times the performance of today 's high - end chips , but hundreds of times their performance .
This is much more than a souped - up digital signal processor .
And that 's where Massalin comes in .
He rattles off his skills : " Heavy - duty signal processing .
Working with cable modems , demodulating , decoding , filters , filter design .
A lot of mathematics .
A lot of optimization .
Trying to come up with methods to solve these problems , many of which are n't even yet known . "
Massalin joined MicroUnity because he was attracted to this fusion of so much technology - audio , video , microprocessors , algorithms , operating system design - into one product .
And MicroUnity has a lot riding on Massalin , who by all accounts is the best in the business .
Says Michael Hawley , a member of the faculty at MIT : " I 've had the good fortune to work with extraordinary , brilliant people at places like Lucasfilm , NeXT , Bell Labs , and MIT .
No one holds a candle to Henry . "
Creative gurus are always imploring people to act like a child and ask stupid questions .
Massalin does this 24 hours a day .
Coming from an adult , this can be either enchanting or immature and bothersome .
Often both .
Numerous times , he tells me to stop " starting your sentences with non sequiturs . "
Are you serious ?
I ask .
Each time , he shoots back : " No , I 'm Henry . "
But Massalin also has a childlike ability to see through complex computational problems .
For example , several years ago he wanted a workstation with good sound .
This was when the SPARCstation II was the cutting edge ; it was n't good enough , so Massalin built his own .
" The Sun barely did telephone - quality audio mono !
Why did n't they go all the way ? " he asks .
" I did n't need my own silicon fab - you could put the CD chips on the same board as the computer .
Somehow it never dawned on anyone . "
Still , Massalin is not the kind of guy to brag , and the genius talk can wear thin .
" A lot of what I do seems to be common sense , " he says , matter - of - factly .
" It feels good to be regarded highly , but why is everything so often a win / lose competition ?
I love talking with smart people . "
Massalin 's special skills - à la Netscape 's Marc Andreessen - had the potential to turn MicroUnity into one of 1995 's techno - out - of - control IPOs , in which everyone becomes a zillionaire overnight .
All the pieces seemed to be in place .
At the head of the privately held company was Moussouris , cofounder of MIPS Technologies Inc. Moussouris was able to raise more than $ 120 million from several prominent players including Microsoft , Tele - Communications Inc. , Hewlett - Packard , and Time Warner .
That May , Richard Doherty , an analyst with the Envisioneering consulting firm in Seabrook , New York , noted : " MicroUnity could change the whole ball game and give a big shock to Intel and a lot of other companies . "
Bad prediction .
MicroUnity has been hobbled by slow demand in several target markets ( read : the Web has muted the cable industry 's initial foray into interactive TV ) .
The MediaProcessor was supposed to begin shipping in volume by the end of 1996 , but that 's just not going to happen .
In some ways , MicroUnity has suffered from the Steve Jobs Syndrome : a visionary leader ( in this case , Moussouris ) inspires his employees , the media , and investors into believing in a really cool product - which gets developed before the market exists .
" MicroUnity never had a good business plan , " says Linley Gwennap , editor of the newsletter Microprocessor Report .
" They had some really good ideas , but the set - top box industry never happened . "
Indeed , in July MicroUnity dismissed at least 100 of its 259 employees and put its semiconductor manufacturing facility up for sale .
Since the company started skidding , recruiters have called Massalin nearly every day .
But jumping ship is n't his style .
Still , it 's sad to him , and Massalin tries to get off the subject of MicroUnity .
So for the past 55 minutes he 's been talking about his girlfriend , Renate .
" She gives great snuggles , " he says .
Snuggles ?
Meaning sex ?
" Not necessarily - just snuggles .
More than a hug .
Snuggly . "
Do you only give snuggles to women ?
Massalin responds with a wry smile .
" A friend of mine best described me as bi-snuggly . "
Giddy yap
Massalin makes me drive him to Safeway to get some milk .
( His salary is " around $ 100,000 " a year , but he does n't own a car . )
At the store , he skips - his ponytail flopping behind him - then jumps over a flowerbed and screams " Wheeeee ! " as if he were a 6 - year - old .
On the way back to his apartment , he explains how stressful it is to pay bills .
" They all come at different times ... and ... it 's confusing , " he says , in his nasally New Yawk accent .
Brains aside , it 's clearly not easy being Henry Massalin .
" It takes me a long time to make friends , " he says .
" I 've been at MicroUnity four years , but I do n't have any close friends .
If you 're in front of a terminal all day , nothing much happens .
People say , ' Oh , that Henry is a crazy type . '
But they do n't mean it in a bad way . "
Massalin seems forever to be inventing ways to soften the hard edge of the world around him .
His parents were Croatian refugees who moved to a row house in Astoria , Queens , in the 1940s .
His dad became a construction worker , his mother a housewife , and they raised three children - Henry was the oldest .
The kids had a difficult time expressing emotions in the hyperstrict Catholic household , recalls Henry 's sister , Lucy .
" We communicated through our stuffed animals , " she says .
" When Henry gave me a heart pendant for my 16th birthday , his teddy bear gave it to me . "
Mom and Dad did n't like Henry to leave the house , so interaction with other children was limited .
Result : " He 's been slow growing up , " says Lucy .
At school , Massalin was teased relentlessly .
The only consolation his father offered for being beaten consistently by schoolmates was " It 'll all work out in heaven . "
Physically , Massalin was a wimp .
He weighed 80 pounds and was so weak that he could n't hit the hoop with a basketball .
He had no girlfriends or boyfriends or , for that matter , friends .
" I was scared of everything , " he says .
" Scared of heights , scared of falling , scared of this , scared of that , scared of the other thing . "
He was n't afraid of creating things , however .
Little Henry was the type of kid who made a device that set off an alarm in his room whenever his father came up the stairs .
He had a telephone in his treehouse .
He also had an impish side ; Lucy remembers him playing practical jokes on her - with such gut - busters as filling the television screen with static .
He once built a radio frequency device that took over control of boomboxes .
If someone was blasting the Beastie Boys on the subway , Henry could remotely turn down the volume .
His interest in electronics paid off when he was given a scholarship to the Cooper Union School of Engineering in Manhattan .
It was there that his genius began to shine .
For instance : Massalin wanted to make his own bicycle to get in better shape .
He found junked bikes and parts in the city and began to create a Frankenstein two - wheeler .
In his lab at home , he and his brother Peter built a blast furnace - two coffee cans , one inside the other , wound with toaster wire , thus electronically and thermally insulated .
" Apply 240 volts and 15 amps and it melted aluminum quite nicely , " recalls Henry Massalin .
With a mill and a lathe operating under computer control , he and Peter put together the bike .
Massalin wanted his bike to be special - an " optimal bike " suited to his build .
To figure out his leg power curve , he carried people up stairs .
He timed how long it took and then calibrated the gear ratios to fit his particular strength - or lack thereof .
He had such an " outburst of fun " giving piggyback rides that it became his hobby , which in turn fueled his self - identity .
He was no longer just a smart guy , or a wimpy guy , or a weird guy .
At Cooper Union , he became The Piggyback Guy .
" Whenever I gave someone a ride , " he says , " there was an overwhelming feeling of Wheeeee ! "
Code cracker
Massalin received his bachelor 's and master 's degrees in electrical engineering from Cooper Union in 1984 .
He was 21 but looked 16 .
He went for his PhD at Columbia University , where he started to come out socially .
One could find Massalin not just in the computer science lab , but playing hearts until 5 a .m. in the lounge , or giving and receiving piggyback rides .
It was at Columbia that Massalin created his first breakthrough product .
He decided to build a kernel , the essential part of any operating system , responsible for resource allocation , low - level hardware interfaces , and security .
Massalin 's kernel , called Synthesis , also created executable machine code to improve performance .
Massalin provided a critical insight .
" Henry wanted to use run-time information to optimize critical operating system code , " says Calton Pu , Massalin 's adviser at Columbia .
" This was a departure from the old wisdom , since compiler optimizations at that time primarily used static information .
People thought that the compilation overhead was too high for run -time code generation and optimization .
Henry showed that by using a variety of tricks you could do it efficiently . "
Massalin also wanted Synthesis to be accessible using a C - language interface .
That meant the system needed to be able to compile C code on the fly .
He could n't find a satisfactory C compiler .
So he wrote one .
From scratch .
Now , a compiler is an extremely complex bit of programming .
It converts source language ( or programming code ) to machine language ( object code ) .
When Massalin wrote the compiler , 200 lines per second was considered extremely fast .
Massalin 's ran at about 10,000 lines per second .
Ten thousand lines is about 150 pages - say , a Shakespeare play .
During all this research he also wrote the superoptimizer .
It was built to find the shortest sequence of assembly language instructions that took you from beginning to end .
Assembly language instructions are lines of code that transform memory and register it from one state to another .
Each line is like a decision branch .
The superoptimizer wrote a program that wrote a program , uncovering superoptimal idioms that no human mind would think up .
Then Massalin discovered that he could turn it around and use the superoptimizer to discover and design better machine languages .
Simple , right ?
Massalin speaks of his work with a reserved pride .
" A lot of research is grandiose - but a lot of the insight comes from grunt work , " he says .
" After you 've done it 50 times , you figure out a better way .
But I like to do the neat implementations that circumvent the classical problems .
Like in operating systems - a lot of people optimized the hell out of remote procedure calls .
My tack was : ca n't you avoid remote procedure calls ? "
Chris Arnone , a former schoolmate now at AT&T , says he still uses programs written by Massalin when he was a grad student .
" Even 10 years later he 's ahead of his time , " Arnone says .
While at Columbia , Massalin also hooked up with Mort Meyerson , or " my friend Mort , " as Massalin calls him .
" He was one of the most unusual people I had met , " says Meyerson .
" He had a childlike enthusiasm and yet was so technically competent he astounded me .
I really liked him and thought :
Here is an authentic ' somebody ' who is willing to be himself and not some caricature . "
Columbia was a long haul for Massalin .
Each day , he weathered a two - hour commute from his parents ' home in Queens to the university on the border of Harlem .
He went through three different thesis advisers .
Most people finish their PhD in five years ; Massalin took eight .
He even finally found his first girlfriend , when he was 28 years old .
Renate Valencia was an administrator at Columbia 's computer science department when she started seeing Massalin .
" I like big , strong women , " says Massalin .
" I adore how physically they can be so much better than me . "
When Valencia first touched him , she says , " he jumped about 20 feet .
He was n't used to affection , or , for that matter , much human contact . "
While he found human love , Massalin also began his obsession with koalas both real and stuffed .
" Koalas are so warm , cuddly , and affectionate , " he says .
" I own many stuffed koalas now .
I rescue them from street vendors .
I give them to friends .
Sometimes I sleep with my koala bears .
Mostly in the winter .
You know , toys were considered frills in our house . "
By the time Massalin received his doctorate in computer science in 1992 , the buzz around Synthesis had already made him a national reputation .
Massalin was like an engineering first - round draft choice , and every A - list company and university wanted to sign him , including Digital Equipment , AT&T Bell Labs , Microsoft , Silicon Graphics , Apple , the University of Washington , MIT .
Even the University of Utah .
" I was not interested , " he says , eyes flickering .
" I did n't think the piggyback situation would be very good in Utah . "
Family members encouraged him to take one of the $ 200,000 - a- year computer networking jobs that Wall Street firms were dangling in front of him .
But he did n't concern himself with money as much as how interesting and intellectually satisfying the work would be .
Massalin had met John Moussouris at a conference and liked him .
Moussouris is a personable guy .
He understands the nuances of the technology .
He read Massalin 's thesis and was impressed ; he also knew Massalin by reputation in the small community of computer science intelligentsia .
The challenge of developing new stuff excited Massalin ; he went out to Sunnyvale and liked the atmosphere .
Moussouris further promised a " signing bonus piggyback ride . "
How could he resist ?
A dream deferred
For the last four years , Massalin has been developing stuff that might never see the light of day .
Original microprocessor architectures do n't come along often , and it 's easy to understand why .
After seven years of hard work , the MediaProcessor is still months away from volume production , with years more before it can reach its potential .
MicroUnity pulls in some money from technology licensing , but it will probably need additional equity investments to help fund the production ramp .
Despite the heady allure of interactive TV , MicroUnity is anything but a flashy Silicon Valley start - up .
The company is located in an office park , next to a basketball court without any shoe skid marks ; the staff has no time to play b- ball on lunch breaks .
MicroUnity does n't let outsiders into its office building , which has no sign indicating its presence .
Fact is , the act of creating machinery that will make interactive TV happen is far less glamorous than the final product .
Massalin 's days bear a certain grinding similarity to each other .
" I tend to come in at around 11:30 or 12:30 .
I start answering questions .
Check email .
I 'll keep working until 9 or 10 at night .
I come home , log in , and work .
Lots of work .
Lots of work . "
After countless 15 - plus - hour days slaving over a computer , Massalin says he has no regrets .
" I have no idea what will happen , " he says .
" I 'm just really hoping the architecture can make it one way or the other . "
So does Mathematica creator Wolfram .
He compares Massalin 's work to Adobe 's creation of the graphics language PostScript .
" Before PostScript , there were just a bunch of hacks for graphics , " Wolfram says .
" Henry 's doing the signal processing equivalent .
There are a lot of people who could build a career around Henry 's ideas .
But in terms of success , the significance of the idea does n't always matter .
Maybe Henry 's at the right place at the wrong time . "
Outside Ebisu Restaurant ,
San Francisco , 9:38 p.m .
We 're on Irving , a busy San Francisco street full of coffeehouses , bars , and restaurants .
It 's a foggy night .
I can remember it well .
You never forget the first time .
Friends had warned me .
" Is n't that kinky ?
Are you sure you want to do that ?
Are you really going to do that ? "
After a sushi dinner with Massalin , his sister , and her husband , we 're walking , and I 'm thinking about something Massalin told me : " My mom thinks I 'm strange .
The piggybacks got on my father 's nerves .
Do something useful .
Another power supply ?
Why do n't you become a doctor or a lawyer ?
We did n't get along .
You 're not a kid anymore !
Yeah , but can't I still have some fun ? "
The scrawny genius seems so alone .
I get up my nerve and jump on .
" Relax , " he says , soothingly .
" Relax your legs and hold on tight . "
He twirls me around and laughs .
People passing by look at us as if we are strange .
I do n't disagree .
We walk about a block .
I 'm praying that no one sees me , especially my wife .
Massalin weighs 120 pounds but barely breathes hard .
He 's experienced .
Then he gets on my back .
He forces his legs against me tightly .
He 's light .
I spin him around because he told me he liked it when his sister danced while he was on her back .
I do n't think I 'm really very good at it .
First - time jitters , I guess .
I walk a block and feel odd and tired .
I do n't care if anyone sees us .
Most people have pretty bourgeois desires .
But Massalin ?
" It 's not Will they be thinking of me 20 years from now ? " - he pauses , smiles - " but Will there still be a piggyback 20 years from now ? "
He laughs .
" People move on .
They buy houses .
They have kids .
I 'm not sure if I 'm delayed , or if I 'm mentally stuck and moving from adventure to adventure .
Skipping and hopping as I go . "
Massalin digs in his heels , and I begin to walk a little faster .
The fog has moved in .
We turn down a quiet side street .
The buildings in the distance disappear in the gray mist .
On this damp and chilly night , the city has begun to slow down .
All except Massalin .
" Let 's go , " he says .
" Wheeeee ! "

‘ Supporting the troops ’ means withdrawing them
COMMENTARY | July 05 , 2007
By William E. Odom
[ William E. Odom is a retired U.S. Army 3 - star general , and former Director of the NSA under President Ronald Reagan ]
To force him to begin a withdrawal before then , the first step should be to rally the public by providing an honest and candid definition of what “ supporting the troops ” really means and pointing out who is and who is not supporting our troops at war .
The next step should be a flat refusal to appropriate money for to be used in Iraq for anything but withdrawal operations with a clear deadline for completion .
The final step should be to put that president on notice that if ignores this legislative action and tries to extort Congress into providing funds by keeping U.S. forces in peril , impeachment proceeding will proceed in the House of Representatives .
Such presidential behavior surely would constitute the “ high crime ” of squandering the lives of soldiers and Marines for his own personal interest .

The Daily Show has fun with FL Rep. fellatio jokes

Jon Stewart this week had some fun at the expense of a Florida state representative 's claim that he was not actually offering to give an undercover officer $ 20 in exchange for letting him perform oral sex on the officer , rather was afraid that he would " become a statistic " because he was surrounded by " stocky black guys . "
" He 's not gay , he 's afraid , " Stewart mocked in a Daily Show segment .
" His thinking is , hey you would n't hit a guy with a ( cock ) in his mouth , would ya ?
I mean , c'mon , it 's your ( cock ) . "
Correspondent John Oliver further belittled the Republican legislator 's lame excuse .
" It 's pathetic .
I thought of a couple off the top of my head just standing here , " Oliver says .
" I have a terrible lip condition that can only be cured through contact with other men's penises .
I had a bad headache and I thought I saw an Advil on another man 's penis .
I tripped and fell mouth first ... onto his penis . "
But Oliver defended Florida State Rep. Bob Allen because , " black people are terrifying . "
" I remember the Million Man March back in 1996 , " he said .
" White people were lined on both sides of East Capitol Street , and out of sheer terror were ( blowing ) everyone who walked past them . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 7 .
What is a hedge fund ?
Forward looking due diligence on whether the manager 's strategy is likely to produce absolute returns in DIFFICULT times is surely the acid test .
The subprime meltdown has revealed numerous beta repackagers but their bull market dependence was obvious .
Plenty of alpha exists at the manager and strategy selection level .
If a fund can't make money or manage risk in down markets , it 's just not skilled .
Anyone with genuine talent and experience knows illiquidity gets expensive during financial turbulence .
Hopefully other investors dumb enough to gear up long only in subprime CDOs and other credit exotica and think they would n't have to pay the piper will be wiped out .
Like every meltdown it is a POSITIVE development to shake out the weak and an alpha opportunity for REAL hedge funds .
Subprime mortgages still seem to be causing trouble and the effects are NOT yet fully " contained " despite what the vested interests claim .
Some hedge fund managers like John Paulson positioned well and some credit risk premium players like Bear Stearns Asset Management , Dillon Read Capital Management , Queen 's Walk and Caliber revealed their lack of skill and NON hedge fund status .
I never considered any of these fools since they were obviously not hedge funds despite claiming to be .
There WILL be others ; skill is rare so other incompetent " hedgies " marketing themselves as hedge funds have probably been caught out too .
Being forced to adjust April performance numbers from - 6.5 % to - 19 % shows just how poorly Bear Stearns 's portfolio managers had stress tested for difficult conditions or understood credit markets .
Why do amateurs think the good times will last for ever ?
There has been a lot of commentary on the so - called Bear Stearns hedge fund debacle .
It will indeed negatively affect the markets particularly in leveraged credit structured products but it just enhances the case for quality hedge funds .
It was clear since inception that Bear Stearns ' two troubled credit investment products were never hedge funds .
They were just playing credit risk premium spreads and dependent on stable credit conditions .
A few due diligence questions to detect a proper hedge fund IN ADVANCE .
1 ) Will it make money in a bear market for equity or credit ?
2 ) Are the potential returns sufficient to compensate for the illiquidity risk ?
3 ) Is most of the personal wealth of the senior management of the sponsoring firm invested in that particular product ?
A true hedge fund would be able to answer " yes " to each question but it was all " no's " for the elegantly named Bear Stearns High - Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund and its " safer " sister .
More questions
4 ) Will you blame funding counterparties if you blow up ?
5 ) Is your " hedge " really a hedge ?
6 ) How independent is your " independent " valuation .
There is NO excuse for not understanding how the game is played or the behavior of your portfolio in ALL scenarios .
There have been numerous credit collapses in the past ; it is only if you just look at " recent " data that credit looks consistent .
The familiar problems of overoptimistic model assumptions , stale valuation , gearing up thinly traded assets and disguising beta as alpha to charge higher fees emerge yet again .
Whether it is SIVs , emerging market equities , rare metals or violins , if a fund is n't likely to thrive during future NEGATIVE return periods for the assets in which it trades then it is NOT a hedge fund .
Investors should not relax the criteria differentiating a real hedge fund from a bull market product .
Hedged means you are able to manage your risks and STILL generate performance with such insurance in place .
I can't forecast but I can certainly anticipate and prepare for ANY eventuality .
Credit hedge funds will receive end of quarter pricing marks soon .
Will others soon join Bear Stearns , Cheyne Capital and Cambridge Place in getting rather different prices than their " mark to model " valuations implied ?
Definitely .
Pricing to a model is fraught with issues not the least of which is ASSUMING the model is correct .
There was obvious serial correlation and Sharpe ratio " enhancement " when I looked at those funds and some others in the credit space over a year ago .
Model arbitrage is a great investment strategy since counterparties tend to think they have made money out of you , until the tide turns .
Then they also discover that they are short lots of optionality and will not be able to cover that negative liquidity , convexity and gamma anywhere near prices they assumed .
The biggest risk in pricing models is Assumption Risk .
The trouble with bull and bear markets is that the price behavior and the width of bid - offer spreads can be quite different under the two regimes .
If you are in roach motel assets getting out can become expensive .
Bear Stearns was leveraged long CDOs of illiquid securities and " hedged " by shorting liquid ABX indices .
As with similar problems in the past , the funds were long illiquid , short liquid .
If a fund is leveraged and can only sell to a limited number of counterparties that KNOW it has a problem , getting out becomes difficult .
Software for measuring risk does n't help when risks are unmeasurable .
And are n't you supposed to have proper risk management in place BEFORE you lose money not AFTER the fact ?
You really have to know what you are doing when designing models of prepayment and mortgage default risks ; nothing in the academic literature or public domain works .
Credit is neither stochastic nor continuous and when it jumps it really jumps .
I can count the number of good mortgage - backed securities hedge funds on one hand but I would need many more limbs for the traders who have been blown away by not having adequate trading AND quantitative abilities to manage ALL the exposures in this complex field .
When a product is very thinly traded , indicative dealer prices are pretty useless .
If a fund is investing in illiquid instruments the fund valuation needs to be marked to the real bid , in size .
Mark to market is possible only when there is a market .
There is nothing inherently wrong with investing in " untraded " assets provided the risk - adjusted returns are sufficient to compensate .
In bearish credit conditions ideally you usually want to be long the liquid and short the illiquid but weaker credit funds and less experienced managers do the opposite .
Of course there have been skilled hedge funds in the areas of distressed debt and collateralised loans for a long time but their returns have justified the risks .
But with some funds , even with apparently high absolute performance , often the excess RISK - ADJUSTED returns ( the alpha ! ) was negative .
Just as with Long - Term Capital Management , being long the illiquid and short the liquid works well until the market reverses and then years of consistently positive months get given back in one massively negative month .
Leverage , liquidity and valuation risks are ONLY worth taking if you are compensated for those risks and plainly this was not the case .
This is where investors in a hedge fund need to look at whether the potential returns justify the potential risk .
With good hedge funds it does but NOT with the many " hedge fund " journeyman .
With public equities , liquid bonds , fx and futures valuation is immediate , transparent , generally unarguable and there is plenty of alpha available in these liquid arenas IF you have the tools and expertise to find it .
While liquidity is a variable even on an exchange you have access to the widest number of potential buyers and sellers .
Venturing into illiquid areas raises the risk exponentially when there are much fewer counterparties to trade with .
Leverage just exacerbates those problems .
Funds investing in illiquid assets should be targeting MUCH higher performance than liquid funds as compensation for that extra risk .
Yet some investors seems to compare them side by side without modelling the non-linear risks of gearing thinly traded securities .
What 's even worse than a closet index fund ?
A leveraged closet index fund .
And that is what most of these toxic waste CDO funds were in effect running .
Making money in BAD conditions is what hedge fund clients pay the 2 and 20 for ; long only funds are the ONLY products you need in good times .
Having criticised some of John Bogle 's thinking in my previous post let 's make something clear ; index equity and credit funds are the best investment IF ( and only IF ! ) you think the asset class is going up .
It is a waste of time and money to allocate to higher fee actively managed funds that simply fall apart when their underlying market falls apart .
Investors need to verify that a money management product purporting to be a hedge fund and charging hedge fund fees actually is one .
Out of 10,000 funds that claim to be hedge funds , how many actually are hedge funds ?
The best estimate I have is maybe 25 % tops .
But of those how many are skilled ?
Perhaps 500 - 1000 at most .
In other words probably only 10 % of products that say they are hedge funds actually are GOOD hedge funds .
Skill is rare by definition .
While some investors might be discouraged by the bad news of 1/10 odds of picking a skilled fund , the good news is that they CAN be isolated in advance .
Identifying a good hedge fund is as rare a skill as being able to identify a good security .
Some multi-manager products and weaker funds of funds have reduced their fees because they think picking hedge funds is easy !
Most of them do n't have the experience or analytical resources to decide what is and what is NOT a hedge fund , let alone trying to find the BEST ones .
It is difficult but NOT impossible .
Do " lower " fees help if an " advisor " puts you into a fund that drops 100 % ?
There will always be semantically - challenged products that screw up which is why due diligence and alignment of interests are so important .
Investors should select real hedge funds NOT leveraged beta products that SAY they are hedge funds .
The industry needs to rid itself of non hedge funds who can't measure , manage or hedge their risks and ride beta when proper managers aim for alpha .
Fortunately we can rely on the market to conduct these shakeouts over time .
Unfortunately for some amnesiac investors it has been a long time since difficult credit conditions .
The colleagues of Ralph Cioffi may have liked the fund but how much personal cash did James Cayne have in ?
A necessary condition for a product to be considered a hedge fund is to verify senior management are eating their own cooking .
In bull markets many unskilled traders make money ; it is bear markets that tend to show who is good and who knows how to hedge .
Many REAL hedge funds are MAKING MONEY out of these ongoing credit events .
Marketing something is a hedge fund does not mean it is .
When Jim Cunningham pulls into a gas station , his fondest hope is that prices will have risen .
Instead of $ 3.25 a gallon , he 'd rather pay , well , $ 4 a gallon – or more .
" I just like the positive impact high gas prices are having on public consciousness – like getting people to buy more fuel - efficient cars , " says the industrial - package designer in Denver , who spends $ 50 to fill a gas guzzler that he hopes to unload soon .
Hank Leukart , a Seattle travel writer , pays about four times more for gasoline today than he did nine years ago .
But " I love high gas prices , " he wrote in a blog essay last year .
In the long run , " high gas prices have so many good repercussions [ in the form of less traffic , accidents , air pollution and a boost for renewable fuels ] that the temporary loss of expendable income seems worth it . "
Such views are n't limited to drivers .
Across the American landscape , a sprinkling of economists , authors , bloggers , and pundits are making the case that there 's a silver lining to high gasoline prices .
Instead of pain at the pump , they see payoffs : less traffic , fewer accidents , reduced air pollution , better efficiency , more reliance on renewable fuels , and less dependence on foreign oil .
While most motorists may wonder whether these iconoclasts are sitting at the wrong end of the tailpipe , they 're nevertheless reviving debate over a long - dormant idea – boosting federal gas taxes so that pump prices stay high .
Permanently .
" People use vehicles less or buy smaller , more efficient cars the longer prices stay high , " says Ian Parry , an economist at Resources for the Future , a Washington think tank .
" They put greater demand on manufacturers to produce more fuel - efficient vehicles , which , in turn , cuts oil use and reduces greenhouse - gas emissions . "
Of course , there 's a downside .
High gas prices act as a drag on the economy .
The more they rise , the more consumers have to spend on fuel and the less they have to spend on other goods and services .
The effects are also uneven .
People who drive a lot and the poor feel the pinch more than the average consumer .
Such costs are regrettable , high - price proponents say , but pale in comparison to the gains that can be had – and can be somewhat compensated by federal tax rebates .
The key , they say , is to keep gas prices high enough long enough to force permanent change .
That did n't happen in the last price spike .
After soaring in the 1970s and early 1980s , gasoline prices plummeted due to expanding supply .
Falling prices torpedoed public support for further fuel efficiency .
Today , the US auto fleet is less efficient : 25.4 miles per gallon versus 26.2 m.p.g. in 1987 .
" Had we been able to keep gas prices up throughout the 1980s , the nation would be far more fuel - efficient today , " says Frank Zarb , who was the president 's chief energy adviser during the Ford administration , now managing director at Hellman & Friedman LLC , , a private equity firm .
The backsliding could happen again , some analysts warn , if gas prices plunge .
Under pressure from competitors and Congress , US automakers say they will produce more high - mileage models .
High gas prices may not only be desirable , but vital , says John Sterman , a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
A recent study he co-wrote found that sustained high gasoline prices are a critical factor in developing US markets for alternative - fuel vehicles .
But prices would need to go up to and remain at European levels of $ 4 to $ 5 a gallon , he says .
In the US , however , gas prices typically soar , then sink back – but to levels higher than before .
That lulls the public into feeling price hikes are temporary despite the long upward trend , economists say .
To ensure that gas prices send a long - term " price signal " to consumers and industry , some economists are calling for a gasoline tax of 50 cents to $ 1 per gallon – on top of today 's 18 cents per gallon federal tax .
Revenues from such a tax could be used to develop new energy technologies , with most of it returned to US taxpayers in the form of income - tax refunds .
Such a tax would hit those that drive more miles for work and low - income drivers the hardest .
Even so , economists say it should be possible to target refunds to them .
" There is indeed a bit of a silver lining to higher gas prices all by themselves , " says N. Gregory Mankiw , an economics professor at Harvard University and former chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 - 05 .
" But high prices by themselves are not as attractive as if those prices are higher because of taxes – because unlike our government , the Saudis are n't going to give you a tax rebate . "
Energy - security experts say a gas tax could in the long run replace some of the costs taxpayers already pay – but do n't see at the pump – to maintain military forces that keep global oil lanes open .
Yet the gas - tax idea is a " third - rail " for most politicians , who fear nobody would support it .
Well , maybe not nobody .
A February 2006 New York Times poll showed 85 percent of Americans opposed a gasoline tax , but 55 percent favored it if it would cut reliance on foreign oil , and 59 percent supported it if it would help curb global warming .
" It 's like tough love , " says Mr. Cunningham in Denver .
Branches of AI
Q. What are the branches of AI ?
A . Here 's a list , but some branches are surely missing , because no - one has identified them yet .
Some of these may be regarded as concepts or topics rather than full branches .
logical AI
What a program knows about the world in general the facts of the specific situation in which it must act , and its goals are all represented by sentences of some mathematical logical language .
The program decides what to do by inferring that certain actions are appropriate for achieving its goals .
The first article proposing this was [ McC59 ] .
[ McC89 ] is a more recent summary .
[ McC96b ] lists some of the concepts involved in logical aI . [ Sha97 ] is an important text .
search AI programs often examine large numbers of possibilities , e.g. moves in a chess game or inferences by a theorem proving program .
Discoveries are continually made about how to do this more efficiently in various domains .
pattern recognition
When a program makes observations of some kind , it is often programmed to compare what it sees with a pattern .
For example , a vision program may try to match a pattern of eyes and a nose in a scene in order to find a face .
More complex patterns , e.g. in a natural language text , in a chess position , or in the history of some event are also studied .
These more complex patterns require quite different methods than do the simple patterns that have been studied the most .
representation Facts about the world have to be represented in some way .
Usually languages of mathematical logic are used .
inference From some facts , others can be inferred .
Mathematical logical deduction is adequate for some purposes , but new methods of non-monotonic inference have been added to logic since the 1970s .
The simplest kind of non-monotonic reasoning is default reasoning in which a conclusion is to be inferred by default , but the conclusion can be withdrawn if there is evidence to the contrary .
For example , when we hear of a bird , we man infer that it can fly , but this conclusion can be reversed when we hear that it is a penguin .
It is the possibility that a conclusion may have to be withdrawn that constitutes the non-monotonic character of the reasoning .
Ordinary logical reasoning is monotonic in that the set of conclusions that can the drawn from a set of premises is a monotonic increasing function of the premises .
Circumscription is another form of non-monotonic reasoning .
common sense knowledge and reasoning
This is the area in which AI is farthest from human - level , in spite of the fact that it has been an active research area since the 1950s .
While there has been considerable progress , e.g. in developing systems of non-monotonic reasoning and theories of action , yet more new ideas are needed .
The Cyc system contains a large but spotty collection of common sense facts .
learning from experience Programs do that .
The approaches to AI based on connectionism and neural nets specialize in that .
There is also learning of laws expressed in logic .
[ Mit97 ] is a comprehensive undergraduate text on machine learning .
Programs can only learn what facts or behaviors their formalisms can represent , and unfortunately learning systems are almost all based on very limited abilities to represent information .
planning Planning programs start with general facts about the world ( especially facts about the effects of actions ) , facts about the particular situation and a statement of a goal .
From these , they generate a strategy for achieving the goal .
In the most common cases , the strategy is just a sequence of actions .
epistemology
This is a study of the kinds of knowledge that are required for solving problems in the world .
ontology Ontology is the study of the kinds of things that exist .
In AI , the programs and sentences deal with various kinds of objects , and we study what these kinds are and what their basic properties are .
Emphasis on ontology begins in the 1990s .
heuristics
A heuristic is a way of trying to discover something or an idea imbedded in a program .
The term is used variously in AI .
Heuristic functions are used in some approaches to search to measure how far a node in a search tree seems to be from a goal .
Heuristic predicates that compare two nodes in a search tree to see if one is better than the other , i.e. constitutes an advance toward the goal , may be more useful .
[ My opinion ] .
genetic programming Genetic programming is a technique for getting programs to solve a task by mating random Lisp programs and selecting fittest in millions of generations .
It is being developed by John Koza 's group and here 's a tutorial .

A key Senate vote on Iraq is due next week
Richard Lugar and John Warner said sectarian violence could not be stopped " any time soon " and " probably can not be controlled from the top " .
They want Mr Bush to submit " transition " plans by 16 October but have not set a date for withdrawal .
The White House and Democrats have already reacted coolly to the proposal .
Their proposal came a day after the Iraqi interim report which highlighted among other issues a lack of progress in training Iraqi security forces .
The number of Iraqi battalions ready and able to fight on their own has halved in recent months , despite increased efforts by the US to train them .
Tackling terrorism
Senators Lugar and Warner said they wanted to ensure US policy was prepared for change when the long - awaited report by US commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , is published in September .
Their new blueprint urges Mr Bush to begin troop withdrawal by the end of the year .
It calls on him to submit a plan for the " transition of US combat forces from policing the civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq " to more narrowly defined goals of tackling terrorism , guarding borders and protecting assets and coalition forces .
But the Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the plan did not insist on any implementation .
He backed legislation to be set before the Senate next week that would require troops to leave by spring next year .
" If you give this president a choice , he will stay hunkered down in Iraq for years to come , " Mr Reid said .
A spokesman for Mr Bush , Tony Fratto , said the White House would look at the new proposal but believed the security surge under way in Iraq " deserves the time to succeed " .
Analysts say the Lugar - Warner proposal may draw support from Republicans who have expressed concern over Iraq but are not prepared to support Democratic measures .

BBC News , Balkh , northern Afghanistan
Rumi made Sufi mysticism popular ( Courtesy : Haydar Hatemi )
For many years now , the most popular poet in America has been a 13th - century mystical Muslim scholar .
Translations of Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi's - better known as Rumi - verse are hugely popular and have been used by Western pop stars such as Madonna .
They are attracted by his tributes to the power of love and his belief in the spiritual use of music and dancing - although scholars stress that he was talking about spiritual love between people and God , not earthly love .
Rumi , whose 800th birth anniversary falls on Sunday , was born in 1207 in Balkh in Central Asia , now part of Afghanistan .
I came here to see whether he has much resonance in his native country which , under the Taleban , went so far as to ban music .
Still standing
A young Afghan archaeologist , Reza Hosseini , took me to the ruins of the mud-and - brick - built khanaqa - a kind of madrassa or religious school - where Rumi's father taught and the young boy is believed to have studied , lying just outside the old mud city walls and probably within yards of his birthplace .
It is a quiet and melancholy place , the structure eroded and encroached on by shrubs and bushes .
An amazing amount of the madrassa is still surprisingly intact
But an amazing amount of it is still standing - the square structure , its four arches with pointed tops , in the Islamic style , and half of the graceful dome .
Mr Hosseini says the floor was originally constructed of baked bricks and lined with carpets donated by those who came to share the learning .
Sufism - or Islamic mysticism - was already enshrined here before Rumi's time and Mr Hosseini imagines that this corner of the town , by the madrassa , would have echoed to the sound of Sufi singing and prayer .
But , he says , it is unclear how widespread , or acceptable , practices such as music and dance were in the wider population .
When Rumi was barely out of his teens , Balkh was reduced to rubble by Genghis Khan 's marauding Mongol invaders .
Rumi had fled in advance with his family and settled in Konya , now in Turkey .
After the murder of his close friend , a Persian wandering dervish called Shams - i- Tabriz , he was depressed for years but later wrote his greatest poetic work , the Mathnawi .
It describes the soul 's separation from God and the mutual yearning to reunite .
With his injunctions of tolerance and love , he has universal appeal , says Abdul Qadir Misbah , a culture specialist in the Balkh provincial government .
" Whether a person is from East or West , he can feel the roar of Rumi , " he says .
Great love
" When a religious scholar reads the Mathnawi , he interprets it religiously .
And when sociologists study it , they say how powerful a sociologist Rumi was .
When people in the West study it , they see that it 's full of emotions of humanity . "
The Sufi mystical tradition is not immediately apparent in modern Afghanistan .
But with Mr Hosseini's help , I traced a small group of eight Sufi musicians in the city of Mazar - e - Sharif whose great love is Rumi 's poetry .
First there is a solo from Rumi 's favoured instrument , the reed flute .
Mr Hosseini says Sufism was enshrined in Balkh before Rumi
Then the flute player is joined by Mohammed Zakir , usually a shopkeeper , who fills the room with his powerful voice in interpreting the words " I 'm a man who 's not afraid of love ; I 'm a moth who 's not afraid of burning " .
In the third song , all the men join in with an extraordinary , percussive vocal sound which , Mr Zakir says , comes straight from the heart .
It continues for nearly 10 intense minutes .
I meet Professor Abdulah Rohen , a local expert on the poet , who says that , regrettably , knowledge of Rumi - also known as Mawlana - has declined recently .
" Forty years ago the economic situation of the people was good .
People would work in the summer time collecting food and would eat it in winter .
In winter they were free .
They would gather in mosques and sing Mawlana 's poems .
' Disfavour '
" But in the past 10 or 15 years people 's economic situation has deteriorated , so they are far from Mawlana . "
He says the advent of communism in Afghanistan brought poetry into disfavour because it was seen as backward - looking .
The reed flute was Rumi 's favourite instrument
Then the Taleban attempted to crush Sufism and outlawed all music , but Prof Rohen says it has since regained huge popularity .
According to him , Rumi brought Sufi mysticism away from asceticism and into the heart of the people .
Many western fans of Rumi have secularised his message .
It was in fact a religious one ; and , says Prof Rohen , Christians and Jews as well as Muslims flocked to his funeral .
I ask him to sum up the poet 's message and he offers a quote .
" Mawlana says - if the sky is not in love , then it will not be so clear .
If the sun is not in love , then it will not be giving any light .
If the river is not in love , then it will be in silence , it will not be moving .
If the mountains , the earth are not in love , then there will be nothing growing . "

Your male geek friends , that is .
Type some code in your editor , save file and … a smiling Doom Marine tells you that all your tests passed .
Or , if there were some errors , the Marine is bleeding .
The more errors , the more blood .
Is it cool or is it cool ?
Just look at the screenshots .
First : Marine is happy that your tests passed .
Next : there were some failures .
The blood starts to flow !
Even more failures , even more blood .
Oh my , it looks like we killed him , we bastards !
How to do this ?

Could the humble chickpea have changed the course of history ?
As one of the founder crops cultivated in the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia , the chickpea ’s nutritional benefits have been cited as one of the reasons for the rise of civilisation there .
Now Zohar Kerem from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel , thinks he has evidence to support that view .
Kerem and colleagues collected wild chickpeas ( Cicer reticulatum ) and compared their nutritional value with that of cultivated varieties .
Wild chickpeas are rare and difficult to cultivate , so there must have been a good reason why our ancestors persevered with growing …
The Republican propaganda machine has done an excellent job of staying on message .
That message ?
Fear .
They have done such a good job of it that fear now permeates every level of governmental election , from the federal to the local .
Fear is :
If we do n't fight the terrorists there , they 'll follow us home .
Hey , buddy , I got news for you .
No matter what we do from this point on in Iraq and Afghanistan , they will follow us home .
In fact , I 'd bet a whole lot of money that a bunch of " them " are already " here . "
Fear is : " We 'd better find all them illegals and ship 'em home before they rape all our women , poison our kids with drugs waste all our money ! "
The truth , of course , is that violent crime is not exclusive to the illegal immigrant community ; the government , courtesy of the CIA and the Vietnam War , opened the floodgates to dope in this country decades ago ; and , if you want to talk about wasted money , what about the trillions being tossed down the toilet in Iraq ?
Fear is :
The opposition to growth in so many of our communities .
Why ?
The more newcomers there are , the less power the old - timers hold .
And , growth means people of different race , creed and color , the convenient warning flags to heighten suspicion .
Fear is : Rock - solid objection to individual choice , whether it 's gay marriage or abortion .
Nothing creates more fear than challenging one 's values , no matter how hypocritical one 's actions are .
And , finally , fear is :
That driving force to silence those of opposing viewpoints .
It 's easily done by branding them as " troublemakers , " " unpatriotic " and " anti-American . "
No matter that the founders of this country were a contrary , rebellious bunch of hooligans , " Thou shalt not differ from the norm " is the 11th Commandment in today 's day and age .
This culture of fear is manifesting itself in the vilification of Democratic Party candidates for the White House , particularly Hillary Clinton .
Even Fred Thompson , the erstwhile goober from Tennessee who thinks he can lug his image around in the bed of a red pickup truck to heist votes , has joined the fray .
One of the first manifestos he issued after tossing his hat into the ring was a chilling warning about the possibility of electing Clinton to the White House .
There was no substance , no reason , only the seed of fear that Clinton could become the first Madame President .
There was no rebuttal of policy , no alternative , just a reinforcement of fear .
What Americans must truly fear is the remaining term of the man now sitting in the Oval Office as he continues to bloody the killing fields in Iraq and Afghanistan and threatens , according to a recent report , to level the entire Iran military in three days .
Shock and Awe , Redux , I guess .
What Americans must also fear is the fragile economy that is reeling like a punch - drunk pugilist as the mortgage industry sucks for clean air in the waste of its excesses .
But , what Americans must fear the most is the complete and total alienation of a public that sees no way out , sees no knight in shining armor riding to their rescue , sees no real leadership standing in the wings .
We 've struck the iceberg , folks , and are sinking fast by allowing ourselves to fall into the web of the fearmongers who would have you believe there is danger in every face of a different color , faith that does n't fit your particular belief system or lifestyle that differs from the so - called norm .

Our friends at Blackwater Security are creating their own air force .
The company which provides “ security solutions ” by contract to the United States in Iraq ( and is building bases in every coastal state in the US ) , already has a fleet of armed helicopters which it uses in Iraq .
The first of the planes that Blackwater is buying , the Embraer Super Tucano light combat prop jets , will be shipped to the US so that Blackwater may begin training pilots shortly .
So why does Blackwater need an air force ?
Well , let ’s look at the Super Tucano ’s capabilities :
These five ton , single engine , single seat aircraft are built for pilot training , but also perform quite well for counter - insurgency work .
So .
The planes will be used as air support in the fight against insurgents in Iraq , right ?
Why else would Erik Prince ’s private army want such materiel ?
But does n’t our “ regular ” military do that ?
So what would Blackwater need such planes for if we have the USAF ?
Well , let ’s not forget this observation by Blackwater expert ( and biographer ) Jeremy Scahill :
Blackwaterâ€™s been in negotiations with several state governments in the United States .
Blackwater met recently with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger about doing disaster response in California .
Theyâ€™re opening up a new private military base in San Diego .
Another one is in Mount Carroll , Illinois .
They have applied for operating licenses in every coastal U.S. state .
This is the expansion of a privatized army .
But why would a large private army be needed ?
Especially with large stateside bases already built and more coming ?
And with air power at its disposal ?
Well , as S&R has noted earlier , Blackwater ’s founder and “ leader , ” Erik Prince , has his own agenda , as Scahill notes :
Weâ€ ™re talking about a company that was founded by a man named Erik Prince , who comes from a family that was one of the top bank rollers of , not only the â€œRepublican revolutionâ€ of the 1990s that brought Newt Gingrich and the Contract with America to power , but also the rise of what we now know as the religious right or the Christian conservative movement .
Erik Princeâ€™s family helped James Dobson found Focus on the Family .
Erik Princeâ€™s family gave the seed money for Gary Bauer to found the Family Research Council .
Erik Prince himself is a major bank roller of President Bush , his allies , and the Christian conservative movement in this country .
That , added to some of the training that the federal government is giving to clergy to enlist them in “ quelling ” citizen unrest in the event martial law is imposed after some “ disaster ” such as a “ new terrorist ” attack , and Blackwater ’s role in New Orleans after Katrina , puts Blackwater ’s purchase of war planes in an interesting light .
Having planes that are good at counter - insurgency in the hands of a dedicated private army headed by an evangelical dominionist could be a back - up in case pastoral diplomacy fails … .
Of course , this could merely be a business decision on the part of Blackwater .
After all , as we ’ve noted already , there ’s no business like war business .
And to do business properly , you ’ve got to have the right tools … .
The suspects had ties with a dangerous Islamic group that once engineered a deadly coup attempt in Trinidad and Tobago , which was approached about underwriting a plot , but in the end , the men decided to stop courting that group and resolved to shop elsewhere overseas for financing .
No one would second - guess the authorities for pursuing and arresting suspected plotters .
An enduring lesson that the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , have taught prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the danger of inaction .
But as with many post - 9/11 terror plots , the line between terrible aspiration and reality can get lost in a murky haze .
In case after case , from what authorities said was a dirty bomber to the Lackawanna Six , federal prosecutors hail arrests of terrorists and disruptions of what they describe as sinister plots .
But as these legal cases unfold , the true nature of the threats can come into question .
Ms. Mauskopf and Mr. Kelly declined yesterday to discuss their characterizations of the airport case .
Mark J. Mershon , assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. ’s New York office , also spoke at the news conference , and he said yesterday that his message was very clear :
“ I believe I spoke the simple truth at the press conference : the ambitions were horrific , the capacities were very limited , but they kept trying .
Their signature was their persistence . ”
Neal R. Sonnett , a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor who was chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney ’s office in Miami , congratulated the F.B.I. for fine police work in what was clearly “ a prosecutable case . ”
But he said : “ There unfortunately has been a tendency to shout too loudly about such cases . ”
“ It has a bit of the gang that could n’t shoot straight to it , ” Mr. Sonnett said .
“ It would have served the federal government well to say that . ”

Bombs Detonate in Kathmandu , Ending Calm in Nepal
At least two women died and 23 other people have been injured in a wave of near simultaneous bombings in and around the Nepalese capital .
Authorities say there were at least four blasts .
As VOA 's Steve Herman reports from our South Asia bureau in New Delhi , the attacks might be intended to disrupt key elections slated to take place in less than three months .
The bombings in Kathmandu mark the most serious outbreak of violence there since a truce between Maoists and the government last year .
Authorities report the high intensity bombs went off within a half hour period in the Nepalese capital Sunday afternoon .
A crowded passenger bus was one of the targets , seriously injuring many onboard .
Another detonation took place near an army officers ' club and others occurred in crowded commercial districts .
The Home Ministry says there has been no claim of responsibility .
Nepal 's Maoists , who waged a decade - long war against the monarchy , want the interim government to declare the country a republic before the election , a move Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has resisted .
U.N. Mission in Nepal spokesman Kieran Dwyer says this type of attack was not a tactic the communist group used during the civil war .
" Even in the 10 - year conflict there were not bombs planted in the capital in this way .
So this will raise , certainly , a new level of fear here in Kathmandu , " Dwyer said .
On Saturday , Nepal 's home secretary , Umesh Mainali , warned there are 18 armed groups carrying out violent activities in the country in an effort to force cancellation of the upcoming national elections .
The November 22 polling would likely decide the fate of the embattled monarch , King Gyanendra , who was stripped of most of his powers following a 14 - month period of authoritarian rule that ended last April .
Widespread opposition to the king led to political parties , including the Maoists , agreeing to participate this year in a new , interim government .
Have you ever observed an old couple holding hands ?
Watched them waltz with their feet never being more than an inch apart ?
Have you ever wondered if you will have a similar fate with the divorce rate being so high ?
I have always wondered what the secret is to a successful marriage .
Well , I believe that last question led me to read Project Everlasting : Two Bachelors Discover the Secrets of Americas Greatest Marriages written by Mathew Boggs and Jason Miller .
The authors traveled across North America interviewing over 200 Marriage Masters ( what the authors affectionately call the couples they interviewed ) that have been married over 40 years in their quest to find out what their secret was for a lasting loving marriage .
After absorbing every last word , this is what I discovered from reading this book …
RESPECT was a common theme that the Marriage Masters said played a key part in their marriage success .
You would think that would be a given but it is amazing how easily we slip into a disrespectful mode – especially when we are stressed .
These disrespectful moments accumulate until you find yourself in a pattern revolving around nothing but disrespect .
You may not even realize it is happening until one day you wake up wondering why your partner is no longer your best friend .
I observed this phenomenon during dinner at an ex-boyfriend ’s house .
The meal had started out with polite conversation between us and his parents … his mother made a not - so - flattering comment about his father and really , before I knew what has happening , his parents started bickering .
After a few minutes , that felt like hours , my ex brought his parents under control .
It did n’t take long before the pattern repeated itself a few more times before the meal ended .
Was this pattern so prevalent in their marriage that they had no idea how hurtful they were being to each other ?
Through out the entire evening ( and many other dinners I attended at their residence ) they never once spoke kindly to each other or agreed with what the other person was saying .
With the high number of marriages ending in divorce , I wonder if the problem is we do n’t really know how to be respectful ?
Or maybe a better description is that we do n’t recognize that our behaviour is disrespectful .
I know that sounds crazy but could you define what respect is right now ?
And now that you have defined it , would you say you ACT respectful to your partner ?
Even in the tough times ?
To me , respect means listening to your partner and validating / supporting what they are saying / requesting .
It does n’t mean agreeing with everything .
It does mean not belittling them when disagreements happen .
When your partner makes a request of you and it is in your power to do it … then DO IT !
Unless , of course , it goes against your values or moral compass .
If I tell my partner that it really stresses me out to be late for things and he is constantly making me late … that is disrespectful – his actions are saying that my need is not important .
When you are in public with your partner , are you supportive of them or do you try to prove them wrong so you can use it as ammunition in your next discussion of the topic ?
I found the following excerpt from the book really gave a great explanation of what respect looks like in a marriage .
You have to be vigilant about honing this discipline ( being respectful ) .
It was like a muscle they had built up over the years and , when compared to mine ( the author ) , it was like Schwarzenegger ’s quadriceps next to a drumstick .
Do n’t get me wrong , the Marriage Masters treated their spouses disrespectfully at times , too .
But whether it was single incident or an emerging pattern , they not only recognized what was happening , they did something about it .
They allowed each other to grow and change .
They listened when they ’d have rather tuned out .
And each stood up for the other , even at the expense of their own comfort .
This newfound and deepened respect became the pattern that defined their relationship over decades to come .
So I suggest you take a closer look at your relationship / marriage .
Are you respectful ?
Swallow your pride / ego and be honest with yourself … as that is the only way to truly make improvements .
There is so much information and great relationship advice in this book that I could not possibly discuss it all within one article so I have decided to give the different ‘ secrets ’ more attention by dividing them into multiple articles .
So stay tuned for my next article that will discuss another very important secret to having a long lasting successful marriage .
WASHINGTON — Northrop Grumman Corp. agreed July 5 to increase its stake in Scaled Composites — the builder of the Ansari X - Prize Cup - winning SpaceShipOne and a host of record - breaking aircraft — from 40 percent to 100 percent , Northrop Grumman spokesman Dan McClain confirmed July 20 .
McClain , who declined to disclose the value of the deal , said the company expects it to close in August pending regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Justice .
Scaled Composites currently is working with Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic venture on a vehicle designated for now as SpaceShipTwo , which would carry two pilots and six paying passengers into suborbital space for a few minutes of weightlessness .
The company also is building a new carrier aircraft , dubbed WhiteKnight2 , that will carry SpaceShipTwo to an altitude of 15 kilometers before releasing it to soar to suborbital space .
The two companies last year formed a joint venture called the Spaceship Company to build the new vehicles .
Alex Tai , chief operating officer of Virgin Galactic , declined to comment when asked July 20 how the acquisition would affect his company 's dealings with Scaled Composites .
" I 'm afraid I can't provide you with any comment at this stage and I do n't think [ Scaled Composites ] can either , " Tai said .
Scaled Composites , with the backing of Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen , won the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 when SpaceShipOne was piloted to an altitude just above the internationally recognized border of space twice in a two - week period .

Students applauded for performing play on Iraq War banned by school
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This
ABC News reported Saturday on what happened when students in a Connecticut town tried to put on a play telling the stories of actual soldiers in Iraq .
When the school canceled the production , for fear of offending town residents , the students were offered an off - Broadway alternative stage by the New York City theater community .
" It 's about the troops ... not whether not the war is an issue , " said one student .
A transcript of part of the ABC report is available here .

BBC News , Sydney
Australia were strongly tipped to beat world champions England
The southern hemisphere teams were expected to dominate the tournament .
Instead the northern hemisphere has hit back and the south is in shock , with tears on both sides of the Tasman Sea .
For rugby - obsessed New Zealand , this is nothing short of a national disaster , as the All Blacks went into the tournament as overwhelming favourites .
They have been dominant for the past three years and were confident of lifting the World Cup for the first time since hosting the inaugural tournament way back in 1987 .
To fail again and in the quarter final is a colossal underachievement .
Broken dreams
After watching the game in Cardiff , the country 's Prime Minister Helen Clark wore a brave smile as she congratulated the French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
But she knows her country will be in mourning .
New Zealand have been the best team in the world for three years
For Australia too , abject misery - beaten by England , the old enemy .
The Wallabies had hoped to avenge their defeat in the 2003 World Cup final .
They were clear favourites to do so .
But they once again fell victim to the boot of England 's star player Jonny Wilkinson , who kicked the world champions to victory as he did four years ago .
In this part of the world there had been heady talk of an all - southern hemisphere final four involving Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and Argentina .
Their teams were thought to be faster , stronger and more adventurous .
But France and England have demonstrated that a bit of grit , fight and determination can go a long way too .
Clashes with US forces occur frequently in Sadr City
Enlarge Image
" The operation 's objective was an individual reported to be a long - time Special Groups member specialising in kidnapping operations , " it said .
Iraqi sources said women and children were among those killed , but the US said it was not aware of this .
Sadr City is a stronghold of radical Shia cleric , Moqtada Sadr .
The poor district has been the scene of much fighting between militants and US forces .
' Barbaric '
US military said its troops had returned fire after coming under sustained attack from automatic weapons and rocket - propelled grenades from nearby buildings as they began to raid a series of buildings in the district .
Ground forces then called in air strikes .
The statement by the US military said : " Coalition forces estimate that 49 criminals were killed in three separate engagements during this operation . "
Clouds of black smoke rose from Sadr City , where heavy gunfire continued on Sunday morning with US helicopters circling overhead , Reuters news agency reported .
" We were waking in the morning and all of a sudden rockets landed in the house and the children were screaming , " it quoted a woman as saying .
An official loyal to Moqtada Sadr said the attack was " simply barbaric " .
" Most of those killed and wounded were women , children and elderly men which shows the indiscriminate monstrosity of the attacks on this crowded area , " Abdul - Mehdi al - Muteyri told Reuters news agency .
But the US military denied civilians had been killed .
" Ground forces reported they were unaware of any innocent civilians being killed as a result of this operation , " its statement said .

Alistair Darling is not the first to call for credit agencies to be probed
Mr Darling called for " international action " to review the regulation of the agencies and banking systems .
The agencies have been criticised for giving upbeat assessments of investments which turned out to be linked to risky home loans in the US .
Because of heavy losses on these deals , there is less willingness to lend cash .
Mr Darling , who approved emergency Bank of England funding to Northern Rock on Thursday , said that a probe was warranted .
" International action is needed to ensure that in the future we can reduce the risk of this sort of turbulence occurring again , " he said at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Porto , Portugal .
' Conflict of interest '
On Friday , the US Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets said that it would hold a hearing into the role of credit rating agencies in the structured finance market - including mortgage - backed securities .
And the EU Financial Services Commissioner , Charlie McCreevy has called on the EU and the US to join forces to investigate the role of credit rating agencies .
That rating agencies were rating investments without the ultimate investors knowing what was behind the bonds is a problem
Jean - Claude Trichet
President
European Central Bank
Earlier , president of the European Central Bank , Jean - Claude Trichet , said that lessons needed to be learned from the fact that the fees of the credit rating agencies were paid by the very financial institutions whose bonds they are assessing .
" The fact that conflict of interest might appear is something we must reflect upon , as is the fact that we have very few credit rating agencies at a global level , " Mr Trichet said .
" And that rating agencies , in a number of cases , were rating investments without the ultimate investors knowing what was behind the bonds is a problem .
" The credit rating agencies knew , but it was considered confidential information . "
German banks have been badly hit by the problems linked to the US sub - prime mortgage crisis , and Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been critical of the agencies for not alerting the markets to companies with problems amid the current market instability .
There has been criticism of the high ratings given to bundles of debt that included sub - prime mortgages , which are offered to homebuyers with inferior credit ratings .
Mortgage default rates have risen in the US as it emerged that many people had been given loans on which they were unable to meet repayments .
" Life in the village is better , we have food to support our children .
In the jungle , the children were going hungry , " Mr Kamon , 42 , a father of seven , told The Age at the bamboo worker 's shack on his small plot .
Later , he admitted that while life had improved , his family still did not have enough .
" One small thing makes me worried — the food shortage , " he said .
He is also discovering that the seductive new world of technology has its limits .
When we met two years ago , he proudly showed off a gold wristwatch his parents had just given him .
He laughs and shrugs when asked about it now .
" It broke , " he said .
His wife , Banyao
At , sitting bare - breasted , has no regrets about their return — relishing the food and the company .
Her children crowd around to look at an Age newspaper clipping titled The Lost Tribe documenting their return to the village .
They point themselves out in the picture .
Still wearing the Khmer Rouge bob hairstyle she had then , she says : " In the jungle it was difficult to grow vegetables .
In the village we have neighbours .
In the jungle all you could see was the jungle all around you .
I had a small farm but it was difficult to find food and especially ingredients for cooking . "
" Life is happier now . "
But the couple feel a little cheated by their years in the jungle .
In 1979 , they were part of a group of 100 villagers who ran to the forests as the Khmer Rouge regime collapsed , told they would be tortured and killed by the invading Vietnamese army .
For 10 years , they cleared land and lived in the forest .
Then the Vietnamese discovered their hiding place and , suspecting they were a rump of Khmer Rouge forces , surrounded the village .
The community split up .
Mr Kamon joined a group of 12 — four couples , each with a small child — and moved into the dragon 's tail , an arrow of Cambodian territory bounded by Laos and Vietnam .
All they took with them was a small tin of rice , herbs and vegetable seeds .
Using their subsistence farming skills , they built a new life in the jungle .
They had one machete , a cooking pot for each couple and woven back baskets .
In the next 15 years , the group grew to 34 , their children married and had children of their own , only one older man died .
When news of the tribe 's extraordinary survival emerged two years ago , the world 's media came calling .
Their story was featured in Paris Match and Marie Claire and on the front page of The Age .
At first there was help .
The group , made up of ethnic Kreung and Tom Puon people , was warmly received by local and international authorities .
Their old villages gave each family a small plot of communal land to farm .
The Ratanakiri provincial governor gave each family a tonne of rice to help them through the first year .
The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees helped with housing and everyone got a medical screening .
Mr Kamon says he built his one - room wooden house in Krala village with $ A380 given to him by a European magazine for an interview .
But the media caravan moved on , and there was no more assistance from provincial authorities .
Mr Kamon and his family were left to find their own feet .
Chung Ravuth , the UNHCR 's senior field officer in Phnom Penh , says the families were given rice and housing , " but we only gave once .
We do n't have a program for them any more , they were welcomed by their local community .
There is no ongoing special assistance , they were provided land by their local communities . "
Krala village , a traditional Kreung community , has given Mr Kamon one hectare of land each year to clear and cultivate .
Each day he and his wife hack away at the forest and tend the young cashew nut trees they have planted .
They will not bear nuts for five years .
Below the trees are sparse clumps of wild rice .
Everywhere in Ratanakiri , villagers are moving from subsistence crops to cash crops such as cashew nuts , increasing their chances of making money but also exposing themselves to the whims of markets they do not understand .
Inside Mr Kamon 's home there is no light , no bed , no chair , and not enough to eat .
" My farm is very large .
I grow rice but I ( only ) get a little bit because my rice is not growing well , " he says of the rough ridge top he was given to cultivate .
" No one gives me any food .
I wo n't get food unless I am working for them . "
The story is similar for a Tom Puon family from the lost tribe , now living in Loet village , an hour to the east .
The two families are related by jungle marriage .
Mr Kamon 's daughter married the son of Ting Luong .
Ting Luong has also received a hectare of land each year from his village .
He works it in the burning midday sun , dressed in a black , long - sleeved polyester shirt and rough cotton pants .
" I can find clothes to wear here , in the jungle we used the leaves of trees , " Mr Luong says .
" Here you can find food .
In the jungle we hunted deer , monkey , wild pig , but we had no salt or ingredients for cooking .
Here we have beef and pig but also the ingredients for cooking — salt , seasoning and chilli . "
Mr Luong 's return to his village was tempered by loss .
His youngest child died soon after birth , in their last days in the jungle .
His wife died within a month of emerging from the forest .
He says she ate something bad in the forest , but health authorities diagnosed her with malaria .
His daughter , Ting Khem , looks careworn at 20 .
She was born in the jungle and had the first of her two children there .
" My life is still difficult .
It is getting better than the jungle and for the children I can grow rice and cashews , but it is still not enough .
We do n't have enough , " she says as her 2 ½ - year - old son wails on her back .
" I was born in the jungle and I did n't go to school , but I am willing to send my children to school . "
There are village schools but the young ones in both families are helping their parents in the field .
The world 's fascination with lost tribes continues .
Last month , a new " jungle girl " emerged who had allegedly survived 19 years in the wilderness since she disappeared as an eight - year - old .
The international media again trekked up the red dirt tracks of Ratanakiri , bypassing Mr Kamon 's village for the new phenomenon .
But this jungle girl was less convincing .
The callous - free soles of her feet raised doubts about how long she would have spent barefoot in the jungle .
Mr Kamon spent 25 years in the jungle .
" I feel very sorry because I was lied to by someone ( his community chief under the Khmer Rouge ) .
I was told that if I came back to the village I would be tortured , " he said .
" I feel angry and so sad that someone would lie to me to make me live in the jungle for so long . "
When they emerged from the jungle , the tribe talked about the tyre tracks they saw and wondered about cars .
They would always run deeper into the forest if they heard an engine , fearing the Vietnamese .
But they dreamed of seeing and riding in a car .
Now , to make a little cash , Mr Kamon sees plenty of cars .
He gets occasional work upgrading the dirt track between Krala village and the provincial capital Ban Lung .
There is only one car in his village , owned by a family who sold some land .
He doubts that he will ever own one .
Yet , amid the struggle to fill hungry bellies , there is new joy of Khmer music .
In the forest , there was only birdsong .
" I listen to music every day , Khmer music on a neighbour 's radio , " he says .
" And the children are very happy to listen to music — they have never heard it before . "

Genes of micro-organisms are being modified to create something new
And rumours abound that closest to the finish line in constructing a lifeform in the laboratory is US genome - entrepreneur Craig Venter 's research team .
The J Craig Venter Institute scientists are aiming to craft a " minimal genome " - the smallest group of genes an organism needs to survive and function - and insert it into an empty cell .
This stripped - down genome has been established with the help of a simple bacterium , Mycoplasma genitalium , by knocking out its genes , one by one , until only the genetic material vital for survival was found .
Dr Venter could be on the cusp of creating life
Dr Venter 's work on synthetic life is described by some as " top - down " , meaning that he is taking an existing organism and changing it to create something new .
Drew Endy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , US , says : " Venter is not creating life from scratch .
" He is constructing a genome , which is more or less a slightly modified copy of an existing genome , then putting it back into an existing cell . "
Dr Endy , who is working on standard building blocks , called BioBrick parts , which can be assembled to build larger biological systems , says he sees Dr Venter 's work as a " genome construction project " , albeit " an incredibly significant " one .
BioBrick parts are building blocks for synthetic biological systems
If you can build the biological parts , they argue , then creating something that meets the criteria for life - has a metabolism , replicates and evolves - is surely the next step .
Cell ' blueprint '
Anthony Forster from Vanderbilt University Medical Center , Tennessee , US , says : " There has been a fair amount of talk about how you might synthesise self replication and life in a test tube , but nobody really had a detailed plan for it . "
We have abandoned so much of what traditional biology is doing , many biologists view us as heretics
Steen Rasmussen
The team is now in the process of using the blueprint to begin to piece together its prototype cell .
But what are the reasons for creating synthetic life ?
Dr Venter hopes to modify genes in his new organism so that it can mop up greenhouse gases .
Other tasks such organisms might be able to do include cleaning up oil spills or producing plastics .
Giovanni Murtas , from the Enrico Fermi Centre , University of Rome Three , Italy , plans to build a new lifeform to look at the more fundamental question of the origins of life .
Synthetic organisms might be able to help clear up oil spills
So far , his team has successfully built a cell system that can synthesise proteins , which is important for demonstrating that a basic metabolism can be created .
Replication is the next step , he explains .
" If you want to understand more about how life was set up , then you want to recreate the principal steps for life ; and you can obviously learn something new about life from using this approach , " Dr Murtas tells BBC News .
Ron Weiss from Princeton University , US , who is focussing on programming biological organisms , believes the technology could also have biomedical applications .
" One thing people are trying to do is to use cells as factories to make drugs or fabricate structures , " he says .
New take on life
The top - down and bottom - up teams have something in common : they are mimicking what nature does already .
Some scientists , though , have gone back to the drawing broad in their quest to produce synthetic life .
Steen Rasmussen from Los Alamos National Laboratory , US , is one of them .
The biggest challenge is not necessarily creating life , but knowing that you have created life
George Attard
Rather than turning to biological cell design as his starting point , Dr Rasmussen is looking to see if there might be simpler structures that he can use as the basis of his synthetic organism .
He is creating a cell in which the essential parts , such as genes and metabolic chemicals , are stuck to the surface of it rather than held inside like a traditional cell .
He says : " This means you can exchange resources and waste directly with the environment and that simplifies things enormously . "
Some are moving away from traditional cell structures
However , George Attard from Southampton University , UK , adds a word or two of caution .
" The biggest challenge is not necessarily creating life , but knowing that you have created life - doing the experiment that unambiguously tells you that you 've got it , " he says .
" That 's because you are going to be looking at a ' soup ' that contains several hundred , possibly several thousand , chemical species .
How on Earth can you tell that what you have is n't just a chemical waste bottle but something that is exhibiting the signs of life ? "
The 70 cm - wide flying surveillance device , fitted with high - resolution still and colour video cameras as well as infrared night vision capability , was used to keep tabs on people thought to be acting suspiciously in car parks and to gather intelligence on individuals in the crowd .
Staffordshire police said the drone 's images did not lead directly to any arrests , but one reason for using it had been to deter would - be thieves .
It was not flown over the main arena because of fears that a crash might cause injuries .
The battery - operated drone 's four carbon - fibre rotors are so quiet they cannot be heard from the ground once it is higher than 50 metres , and at 100 metres up it can not be seen with the naked eye .
It can fly 500 metres high , but the Civil Aviation Authority has set an operating limit of 120 metres .
The vehicle , which takes off vertically , can be flown even when out of sight , because it beams images back to video goggles worn by the operator .
Since May , Merseyside police have been using two drones - originally developed by a German company for military use - to police public order situations and prevent antisocial behaviour .
One tactic is to fly the drone over groups of young people causing a nuisance in parks .
The force has also used it for covert surveillance .
The West Midlands fire service plans to use drones to get a bird 's eye view of buildings on fire .
" Being able to look down on the scene will allow us to get a full picture of the incident and the surrounding environment , which will aid incident commanders to make vital , potentially life - saving decisions , " said the deputy chief fire officer , Vij Randeniya .
The Metropolitan police is interested in using drones to police the Olympics .
Firearms officers also believe they could be useful in a standoff with armed criminals
MW Power , the company that distributes the technology in the UK , plans to improve the drone 's capability by adding a so - called " smart water " spray - a liquid infused with unique artificial DNA sequences which can be squirted on to a suspect from above .
It infuses their clothes and skin and the DNA code can be used later to identify them .
There is no legal barrier preventing a private security firm or a paparazzo photographer from using the technology , but MW Power said that it was only licensing the vehicle to customers from the military or emergency services .
It costs less than £ 1,000 a month to lease - an amount that would buy less than an hour 's use of a conventional helicopter .
Some experts fear it represents an unwarranted intrusion of privacy .
" We should find out whether the public wants this , " said Noel Sharkey , an expert in robotics at Sheffield University who is worried about the increasing use of robotic vehicles in military conflicts and policing .
While most people would support its use to catch car thieves , the technology could be put to more draconian uses in future , he said .
" How long will it be before someone gets Tasered from the air for dropping litter , or even for relieving themselves down an alleyway under cover of night ? "
· The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday August 22 2007 .
" Smart water " , the security spray mentioned above , is not infused with artificial DNA as was claimed , but with chemicals that give each batch of the liquid a unique identity .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has taken up the case of a California man who has been sued by Universal Music Group for selling promotional CDs .
Like other record labels , UMG distributes free CDs to radio stations and music reviewers in the hopes of drumming up publicity .
The CDs come stamped with the label " promotional copy , not for sale . "
Based on this notice and the fact that the copies were given away rather than sold , the labels argue that these " promo CDs " remain the property of the labels and are only leased to recipients for their personal use .
California resident Troy Augustino makes a living selling various merchandise , including promo CDs , on eBay .
UMG sued him in May for copyright infringement , claiming that it had merely licensed the CDs rather than transferring ownership and that Augustino was therefore committing copyright infringement by reselling them .
The fundamental issue in the case is the First Sale Doctrine , which says that when a copyright holder sells a copy of a CD , the new owner of the CD is entitled to give or sell that copy to someone else without getting the copyright holder 's permission .
This is the principle that makes libraries and used book stores possible .
It was first articulated by the Supreme Court in 1908 and has since been codified into statute .
Not surprisingly , copyright holders do n't like this provision of copyright law , because used copies of their works compete with new copies .
In May , we reported on state laws aimed at undermining the First Sale Doctrine by curtailing the sale of used CDs .
Attempts to circumvent the first sale principle using license agreements are not unique to UMG .
The practice is especially common among software firms , which routinely distribute their products with a shrinkwrap license .
Such end - user license agreements typically state that the software has not been sold to users but has only been licensed for the customer 's personal use , subject to a variety of conditions spelled out in the EULA .
Software firms contend that because their software is merely licensed to users rather than sold , the First Sale Doctrine does not apply .
Such shrinkwrap licenses have generated considerable controversy , and some courts have rejected them outright .
For example , in a 2001 case , a California judge ruled that Adobe 's EULA did not apply to a California businessman who bought bundled Adobe software and resold the individual components .
In that case , the judge held that despite Adobe 's contention that it merely licensed its software , " the circumstances surrounding the transaction strongly suggest that the transaction is in fact a sale rather than a license . "
UMG 's lawsuit against Augustino will test the boundaries of the First Sale Doctrine .
UMG may argue that the First Sale Doctrine only applies to sales of copyrighted materials and not to CDs it gives away .
But EFF attorney Fred von Lohmann tells
Ars that the courts have applied the First Sale Doctrine to gifts in the past .
For example , he points to a 1984 case in which Disney tried to prevent the auction of film cells that had been given to a former employee .
The court found that the First Sale Doctrine applied and allowed the auction to go forward .
In addition to responding to UMG's charges , EFF has countersued UMG for sending " takedown " letters to eBay claiming that Augustino 's CDs infringed copyright .
In a post on EFF 's blog , von Lohmann charges that UMG has been " harassing a number of promo CD merchants , sending bogus DMCA takedown notices to eBay , getting auctions suspended , and accounts terminated . "
Victory in the case would make it easier for other eBay sellers to resist UMG 's efforts to shut them down .
Beyond its effects on the used music market , the case could have important implications for the software industry .
If the courts holds that the " not for sale " notice stamped on a CD is not an enforceable contract , it will cast further doubt on the enforceability of shrinkwrap EULAs .
Signaling another departure from the music industry ’s longtime antipiracy strategy , the Universal Music Group will sell a significant portion of its catalog without the customary copy protection software for at least the next few months , the company announced yesterday .
Universal , the world ’s biggest music conglomerate , said it would offer albums and songs without the software , known as digital rights management , through existing digital music retail services like RealNetworks and Wal - Mart , nascent services from Amazon.com and Google , and some artists ’
Web sites .
But the music will not be offered D.R.M. - free through Apple ’s iTunes , the leading music service .
The use of copy protection software has become a major bone of contention in the digital music business , where iTunes accounts for the vast majority of download sales .
The record labels generally have required that retailers place electronic locks to limit copying of music files .
But Apple ’s proprietary D.R.M. does not work with most rivals ’ devices or software — meaning that music sold by competing services cannot play on Apple ’s popular iPod .
Some record executives say they believe that the stalemate has capped the growth of digital music sales , which the industry is relying on more heavily as sales of plastic CDs slide .
T he skew in the global financial system -- commonly called ' global imbalance ' -- seems to be fast spiralling out of control .
For some time now economists have been engaged in the mother of all debates : whether the US dollar would collapse by as much as 40 % when compared to other currencies ( some are even betting on the US dollar going belly - up ) or whether there would be an orderly devaluation -- that is , a gradual revaluation of other currencies vis -� - vis the US dollar .
In effect , the question that is confronting us is not ' whether ' but ' when ' and by ' how much . '
This global imbalance can be understood in economic terms by simply examining the massive size of America 's twin deficits -- trade and budgetary .
Put modestly , Americans have been living way beyond their means , consuming much more than what they could possibly afford and , in the process , borrowing far beyond their capacity for too long .
This was facilitated by a policy of maintaining weak currencies across the world , notably in Asia .
This policy of maintaining a competitive exchange rate for their currency to boost exports has resulted in a race to the bottom amongst various countries .
Nevertheless , this arrangement suited countries , both Asian ( with a huge unemployed population ) and American , ( as it provided cheap imports for its huge consumption binge ) .
While the going was good , everyone profited and expected the arrangement to continue indefinitely .
Unfortunately , linearity as a concept has limited appeal in real life , much less is global macroeconomics .
No wonder , of late , countries are discovering that this arrangement has its limitations .
The current account deficit of the United States translates into current account surplus of exporting countries .
To cover this deficit , US borrows : this corresponds to the forex reserves of exporting countries .
The crux of the issue is that no other country , barring the US , has such a huge consumption pattern and an ability to absorb this huge export surplus .
In substance , countries are producing their goods , exporting it mostly to the US , and parking the resulting export surpluses with the US to facilitate US to finance its imports !
Clearly , the global imbalance is a by - product of this mindless competition by various countries to devalue their own currencies and the reckless consumption in US .
Naturally , it is indeed tempting to blame US consumption for this crisis .
However , one must hasten to add that the emerging economies -- notably Asian countries , especially after the1998 currency crisis -- with their fixation for weak currencies , are equally to be blamed .
The net result ?
Well , consider these facts :
By mid-May 2007 , the US National Debt stood at approximately at mind - boggling $ 8.85 trillion -- i.e. approximately $ 28,000 for every American .
The basic structure of the American economy is that the deficit of the US government is 4 % of the GDP and the household sector 6 % , which are offset by a domestic savings of 3 % , largely from corporates , leaving a substantial national deficit of 7 % to be covered by the capital flows from the rest of the world .
The current account deficit of the United States for 2006 is estimated to be in excess of $ 850 billion .
This approximates to 7 % of its GDP .
Surely , even for the US , this is unsustainable .
In order to ensure that this money is routed into America and to sustain its gargantuan borrowing programme , the US has repeatedly raised its interest rate to its current levels of 5.5 % .
While the very size of the US debt makes any further increase in interest rates virtually impossible ( as it would make borrowings uneconomical ) , any cut in interest rates to stimulate its economy and make it competitive would mean that the US may not get the money it requires to sustain itself .
On March 28 , 2006 , the Asian Development Bank [ Get Quote ] is reported to have issued a memo , advising members to be ready for a collapse of the US dollar .
Since end March 2006 , the US Federal Reserve has stopped publishing the quantum of broad money ( that is the aggregate of US dollars circulating in the entire world -- technically called ' M3 ' ) in the US economy .
This is the worst possible signal that the US Federal Reserve could have sent to the world .
Suspended sense of disbelief
Obviously , what aids and sustains the US dollar is a ' suspended sense of disbelief ' amongst countries about the value of US dollar .
Yet , common sense tells us that the excess supply will obviously result in a fall in the value of any product .
The US dollar is no exception .
Late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was fully aware of this paradigm .
Seeking to exploit the inherent weakness of the US dollar , Saddam wanted to trade his crude in Euros , which would have lead to a lower demand for the US Dollar and thereby triggered a dollar collapse .
And those were his ' weapons of mass destruction -- WMD .'
And if some analysts are to be believed , Venezuela and Iran too possess the very same WMD .
Naturally , it requires some specious arguments and military intervention to protect the US dollar .
Never in the history of mankind has a national army protected the national currency so vigorously as the US Army has done is the past decade or so .
What is bizarre to note here is that despite the fact that crude is produced mainly in the Middle East ; officially it can be purchased in dollar terms from one of the two oil exchanges situated in New York and London .
Obviously , should Iran carry out the threat to commence oil trade in Euros or better still an oil exchange , the US dollar would come under tremendous pressure .
The US dollar is akin to the promissory note of a defunct finance company .
It is common knowledge that a currency , when not backed by anything precious is just a piece of paper .
When US abandoned the Gold Standard in early 70s , countries habituated by then to the US dollar under the Bretton Woods arrangement continued to accept the US dollar as an international currency without demur as the world was not prepared for any other alternative .
Else , the global economy would have collapsed by 1971 .
But the diplomatic silence did not solve the problem .
It merely postponed it and it has come back to haunt us .
Post gold standard , by a tacit approval of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and strategic manoeuvring , the US had ensured that its currency is implicitly backed by crude , instead of gold .
This explains the American ' geo- political and strategic interests ' in the Middle East .
But over time even this was found to be insufficient and consequently the oil standard of the 70s gave way to an implicit multiple commodity standard of today .
Naturally , commodity prices -- including crude prices -- have soared in the past few years .
Unfortunately , this arrangement too is failing the US .
No wonder , the US dollar increasingly resembles a promisory note of a defunct finance company .
It is no coincidence that global trade in most commodities , including oil , is denominated in US dollars as the respective international exchanges are located in the US .
To what extent are the prices of these commodities manipulated to protect the US dollar is anybody 's guess .
However , it may not be out of place to mention that a barrel of oil which cost less than $ 10 to produce is sold approximately at $ 70 in the international market .
But as commodity prices go up it has lead to inflation across the globe .
No wonder , countries are forced to increase their interest rates to fight inflation .
This has triggered an interest rate hike across continents and the US is finding it extremely difficult to sustain its current borrowing programme : it hardly has any elbow room to manoeuvre .
Doomed if it does , damned if it does n't
Meanwhile , countries are increasingly realizing that the value of the US dollar that they are holding is fast eroding , whatever be the ' officially managed exchange rate . '
And if fewer people want the US dollar -- as for instance when oil is traded in Euro the demand for the US dollar will fall -- it would trigger an avalanche .
No wonder , the US Fed is unwilling to make public the M3 figures , as it does not want the holding position of the US dollar to be publicised .
Interestingly , in such a doomsday scenario , some economists are still betting on central banks of other countries to defend the US dollar .
It would seem that the US has ' outsourced ' even this sovereign function to the central banks of other countries .
After all , should the US dollar collapse , the biggest losers will not be the US but those who have US dollar - denominated forex reserves .
Naturally , countries holding US dollar reserves are caught on the horns of a serious dilemma -- should they seek to correct the global imbalance , it could result in the imminent collapse of the US dollar , and should they continue to defend the US dollar , they would be a long - term loser as the current arrangement has seeds of self - destruction .
While every central banker is conscious of this fact and thereby seeks to postpone the inevitable while nervously looking for his counterpart in any other country to break ranks and thereby trigger the collapse .
Surely , the emperor is without any clothes .
There are only two possibilities from here on : Either we are witness a global meltdown of the US dollar , or allow controlled US dollar devaluation ( read , revaluation of other currencies ) .
If it is a global meltdown the global economy is doomed , if is an orderly devaluation , it is damned .

On your first sleepover , your best friend ’s mother asks if you would like a tuna - fish - salad sandwich .
Your own mother gives you tuna - fish - salad sandwiches all the time , so you say , “ Sure . ”
When you bite into the sandwich , though , you realize , too late , that your best friend ’s mother ’s tuna - fish salad tastes nothing like the tuna - fish salad your mother makes .
You never dreamed that it was possible for there to be more than one way to prepare tuna - fish salad .
And what ’s with the bread ?
It ’s brown , and appears to have tiny seeds in it .
What is more unnerving is the fact that your best friend obviously considers his mother ’s tuna - fish salad to be perfectly normal and has been eating it with enjoyment all his life .
Later on , you discover that the pillows in your best friend ’s house are filled with some kind of foam - rubber stuff instead of feathers .
The toilet paper is pink .
What kind of human beings are these ?
At two o’clock in the morning , you throw up , and your mother comes and takes you home .
College , from which some 1.5 million people will graduate this year , is , basically , a sleepover with grades .
In college , it is not so cool to throw up or for your mother to come and take you home .
But plenty of students do throw up , and undergo other forms of mental and bodily distress , and plenty take time off from school or drop out .
Almost half the people who go to college never graduate .
Except in the case of a few highfliers and a somewhat larger number of inveterate slackers , college is a stressful experience .
American colleges notoriously inflate grades , but they can never inflate them enough , because education in the United States has become hypercompetitive and every little difference matters .
In 1960 , Harvard College had around five thousand applicants and accepted roughly thirty per cent ; this year , it had almost twenty - three thousand applicants and accepted nine per cent .
And the narrower the funnel , the finer applicants grind themselves in order to squeeze through it .
Perversely , though , the competitiveness is a sign that the system is doing what Americans want it to be doing .
Americans want education to be two things , universal and meritocratic .
They want everyone to have a slot who wants one , and they want the slots to be awarded according to merit .
The system is not perfect : children from higher - income families enjoy an advantage in competing for the top slots .
But there are lots of slots .
There are more than four thousand institutions of higher education in the United States , enrolling more than seventeen million students .
Can you name fifty colleges ?
Even if you could name a thousand , there would be three thousand you had n’t heard of .
Most of these schools accept virtually all qualified applicants .
What makes for the stress is meritocracy .
Meritocratic systems are democratic ( since , in theory , everyone gets a place at the starting line ) and efficient ( since resources are not wasted on the unqualified ) , but they are huge engines of anxiety .
The more purely meritocratic the system — the more open , the more efficient , the fairer — the more anxiety it produces , because there is no haven from competition .
Your mother ca n’t come over and help you out — that would be cheating !
You ’re on your own .
Everything you do in a meritocratic society is some kind of test , and there is never a final exam .
There is only another test .
People seem to pick up on this earlier and earlier in their lives , and at some point it starts to get in the way of their becoming educated .
You ca n’t learn when you ’re afraid of being wrong .
The biggest undergraduate major by far in the United States today is business .
Twenty - two per cent of bachelor ’s degrees are awarded in that field .
Eight per cent are awarded in education , five per cent in the health professions .
By contrast , fewer than four per cent of college graduates major in English , and only two per cent major in history .
There are more bachelor ’s degrees awarded every year in Parks , Recreation , Leisure , and Fitness Studies than in all foreign languages and literatures combined .
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , which classifies institutions of higher education , no longer uses the concept “ liberal arts ” in making its distinctions .
This makes the obsession of some critics of American higher education with things like whether Shakespeare is being required of English majors beside the point .
The question is n’t what the English majors are n’t taking ; the question is what everyone else is n’t taking .
More than fifty per cent of Americans spend some time in college , and American higher education is the most expensive in the world .
The average annual tuition at a four - year private college is more than twenty - two thousand dollars .
What do we want from college , though ?
It is hard to imagine that there could be one answer that was right for each of the 1.5 million or so people graduating this year , one part of the college experience they all must have had .
Any prescription that had to spread itself across that many institutions would not be very deep .
One thing that might be hoped for , though , is that , somewhere along the way , every student had a moment of vertigo ( without unpleasant side effects ) .
In commencement speeches and the like , people say that education is all about opportunity and expanding your horizons .
But some part of it is about shrinking people , about teaching them that they are not the measure of everything .
College should give them the intellectual equivalent of their childhood sleepover experience .
We want to give graduates confidence to face the world , but we also want to protect the world a little from their confidence .
Humility is good .
There is not enough of it these days . ♦
As a presence in the world — a body hanging from a subway strap or pressed into an elevator , a figure crossing the street — I am neither markedly masculine nor notably effeminate .
Nor am I typically perceived as androgynous , not in my uniform of Diesels and boots , not even when I was younger and favored dangling earrings and bright Jack Purcells .
But most people immediately read me ( correctly ) as gay .
It takes only a glance to make my truth obvious .
I know this from strangers who find gay people offensive enough to elicit a remark — catcalls from cab windows , to use a recent example — as well as from countless casual social engagements in which people easily assume my orientation , no sensitive gaydar necessary .
I ’m not so much out - of - the - closet as “ self - evident , ” to use Quentin Crisp ’s phrase , although being of a younger generation , I ca n’t subscribe to his belief that it is a kind of disfigurement requiring lavender hair rinse .
I once placed a personal ad in which I described myself as “ gay - acting / gay - appearing , ” partly as a jab at my peers who prefer to be thought of as “ str8 ” but mostly because it ’s just who I am .
Maybe a better way to phrase it would have been “ third - sexer , ” the category advanced by the gay German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld 100 years ago .
The label fell into disrepute , but lately a number of well - known researchers in the field of sexual orientation have been reviving it based on an extensive new body of research showing that most of us , whether top or bottom , butch or femme , or somewhere in between , share a kind of physical otherness that locates us in our own quadrant of the gender matrix , more like one another than not .
Whatever that otherness is seems to come from somewhere deep within us .
It mostly defies our efforts to disguise it .
That ’s what we mean by gaydar — not the skill of the viewer so much as the telltale signs most gay people project , the set of traits that make us unmistakably one .
The late psychologist and sexologist John Money famously called these the details of our “ gendermaps , ” which he believed are drawn primarily by life ’s experience and social conditioning .
Money planted some of the earliest flags in the nature - versus - nurture war by claiming that dysfunctional parents , not inborn biology , is what produced “ sissy boys , ” tomboys , and other gender variants .
But today , the pendulum has swung just about as far in the other direction as possible .
A small constellation of researchers is specifically analyzing the traits and characteristics that , though more pronounced in some than in others , not only make us gay but also make us appear gay .
At first read , their findings seem like a string of unlinked , esoteric observations .
Statistically , for instance , gay men and lesbians have about a 50 percent greater chance of being left - handed or ambidextrous than straight men or women .
The relative lengths of our fingers offer another hint :
The index fingers of most straight men are shorter than their ring fingers , while for most women they are closer in length , or even reversed in ratio .
But some researchers have noted that gay men are likely to have finger - length ratios more in line with those of straight women , and a study of self - described “ butch ” lesbians showed significantly masculinized ratios .
The same goes for the way we hear , the way we process spatial reasoning , and even the ring of our voices .
One study , involving tape - recordings of gay and straight men , found that 75 percent of gay men sounded gay to a general audience .
It ’s unclear what the listeners responded to , whether there is a recognized gay “ accent ” or vocal quality .
And there is no hint as to whether this idiosyncrasy is owed to biology or cultural influences — only that it ’s unmistakable .
What is there in Rufus Wainwright ’s “ uninhibited , yearning , ugly - duckling voice , ” as the Los Angeles Times wrote a few weeks ago , that we recognize as uniquely gay ?
Does biology account for Rosie O’Donnell ’s crisp trumpet and Charles Nelson Reilly ’s gnyuck - gnyuck - gnyuck ?
“ These are all part and parcel of the idea that being gay is different — that we are different animals to some extent , ” says Simon LeVay , the British - born neuroscientist who has dedicated himself to studying these issues .
“ Hirschfeld was right .
I support the idea that we ’re a third sex — or a third sex and a fourth sex , gay men and lesbians .
Today , there ’s scientific documentation behind this . ”
Richard Lippa , a psychologist from California State University at Fullerton , is one of the leading cataloguers of the many ways in which gay people are different .
I caught up with him a few weeks ago at a booth at the Long Beach Pride Festival in Southern California , where he was researching another hypothesis — that the hair - whorl patterns on gay heads are more likely to go counterclockwise .
If true , it will be one more clue to our biological uniqueness .
As he recruited experiment subjects , Lippa scanned the passing scalps , some shaved clean , some piled in colorful tresses .
“ It ’s like a kind of art .
You look at the back of people ’s heads , and it ’s literally like a vector field , ” he says .
“ We assume that whatever causes people to be right - handed or left - handed is also causing hair whorl .
The theory we ’re testing is that there ’s a common gene responsible for both . ”
And that gene might be a marker for sexual orientation .
So , as part of his study , he has swabbed the inside cheek of his subjects .
It will be months before that DNA testing is complete .
I was surprised at how many people quickly agreed to lend five minutes of their pride celebration to science .
“ If I could tell my mother it ’s a gene , she would be so happy , ” said one , Scott Quesada , 42 , who sat in a chair for Lippa ’s inspection .
“ Classic counterclockwise whorl , ” the researcher pronounced , snapping a photo .
Quesada , who is right - handed and seemed to have a typically masculinized finger - length ratio , was impressed .
“ I did n’t know I had a whorl at all , ” he said .
By the end of the two - day festival , Lippa had gathered survey data from more than 50 short - haired men and photographed their pates ( women were excluded because their hairstyles , even at the pride festival , were too long for simple determination ; crewcuts are the ideal Rorschach , he explains ) .
About 23 percent had counterclockwise hair whorls .
In the general population , that figure is 8 percent .
A string of other studies , most of them conducted quietly and with small budgets , has offered up a number of other biological indicators .
According to this research , for instance , gay men , like straight women , have an increased density of fingerprint ridges on the thumb and the pinkie of the left hand ; and overall their arms , legs , and hands are smaller relative to stature ( among whites but not blacks ) .
There are technical differences in the way most men and most women hear , except among lesbians , whose ears function more like men’s .
And there are gender - based cognitive differences in which gay men appear more like women .
One involves mentally rotating a 3 - D object , something males tend to do better than females — except gay men score more like straight women and lesbians function more like straight men .
In navigational tasks and verbal - fluency tests , gay men and lesbians tend to have sex- atypical scores .
From these findings , it might be tempting to conclude that lesbians are universally masculinized and gay men are somehow feminized — the classic “ inversion model ” of homosexuality advanced by Freud .
But the picture is more complicated than that .
There is also evidence — some more silly - sounding than serious — that homosexuals may be simultaneously more feminine and more masculine , respectively .
The stereotypes — that lesbians tend to commit to relationships early and have little interest in casual sex ; that gay men have more sexual partners than their counterparts — turn out to be true .
One study that supports the hyper - masculinity theory of male homosexuality involves penis size .
An Ontario - based psychological researcher named Anthony Bogaert re-sorted Kinsey Institute data — in which 5,000 men answered detailed questions about their sex lives , practices , fantasies , and , it turns out , measurements of their erect organs — along sexual - orientation lines .
Gay men ’s penises were thicker ( 4.95 inches versus 4.80 ) and longer ( 6.32 inches versus 5.99 ) .
The measurements , it should be noted , were self - reported and perhaps involve reporting bias , but no one has done a study investigating whether gay men are more prone to exaggerating their assets , so , well , draw your own conclusions .
But if true , these findings negate the inversion model , Bogaert says .
Instead of picturing gender and orientation along a line , with straight men and women on either end and gay people in the middle , he suggests , a matrix might be a more accurate way to map the possibilities .
Some of this work has been derided as modern - day phrenology , and obviously possessing one trait or another — a counterclockwise hair whorl here , an elongated ring finger there — does n’t necessarily make a person gay or straight .
But researchers point out that these are statistical averages from the community as a whole .
And the cumulative findings support the belief now widely held in the scientific community that sexual orientation — perhaps along with the characteristics we typically associate with gayness — is biological .
“ We ’re reaching a consensus on a broad question , ” says J. Michael Bailey , a psychologist at Northwestern University .
Is sexual orientation “ something we ’re born with or something we largely acquire through social experience ?
The answer is clear .
It ’s something we ’re born with . ”
Because many of these newly identified “ gay ” traits and characteristics are known to be influenced in utero , researchers think they may be narrowing in on when gayness is set — and identifying its possible triggers .
They believe that homosexuality may be the result of some interaction between a pregnant mother and her fetus .
Several hypothetical mechanisms have been identified , most pointing to an alteration in the flow of male hormones in the formation of boys and female hormones in the gestation of girls .
What causes this ?
Nobody has any direct evidence one way or another , but a list of suspects includes germs , genes , maternal stress , and even allergy — maybe the mother mounts some immunological response to the fetal hormones .
Immunological response is the ascendant theory , in fact .
We know from a string of surveys that in any family , the second - born son is 33 percent more likely than the first to be gay , and the third is 33 percent more likely than the second , and so on , as though there is some sort of “ maternal memory , ” similar to the way antibodies are memories of an infection .
Perhaps she mounts a more effective immunological response to fetal hormones with each new male fetus .
To determine whether the fraternal birth order might also suggest that baby brothers are treated differently in a way that impacts their sexual expression , researchers have studied boys who were n’t raised in their biological families , or who may have been firstborn but grew up as the youngest in Brady Bunch–type homes .
In every permutation , the results were the same :
What mattered was only how many boys had occupied your mother ’s uterus before you .
Some of this research may prove to be significant ; some will ultimately get chalked up to coincidence .
But the thrust of these developing findings puts activists in a bind and brings gay rights to a major crossroads , perhaps its most significant since the American Psychiatric Association voted to declassify homosexuality as a disease in 1973 .
If sexual orientation is biological , and we are learning to identify how it happens inside the uterus , does n’t it suggest a future in which gay people can be prevented ?
This spring , R. Albert Mohler Jr. , the president of a Southern Baptist theological seminary in Kentucky and one of the country ’s leading Evangelical voices , advocated just that .
“ We want to understand why some persons will struggle with that particular sin , ” he explained .
“ If there is a way we can help with the struggle , we should certainly be open to it , the same way we would help alcoholics deal with their temptation . ”
That in part is why gay people have not hungered for this breakthrough .
Late last year , Martina Navratilova joined activists from PETA to speak out against an experiment that sought to intentionally turn sheep gay ( it failed , but another experiment successfully turned ferrets into homosexuals , and the sexual orientations of fruit flies have been switched in laboratories ) .
Some 20,000 angry e-mails clogged the researchers ’ inboxes , comparing the work to Nazi eugenics and arguing that it held no promise of any kind to gay people .
“ There are positives , but many negatives ” to this kind of research , says Matt Foreman , executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
“ I will bet my life that if a quote - unquote cure was found , that the religious right would have no problem with genetic or other kind of prenatal manipulations .
People who do n’t think that ’s a clear and present danger are simply not living in reality . ”
A study found that 75 percent of gay men sounded gay to a general audience .
Were they responding to a recognized gay “ accent ” ?
At the dawn of gay politics a half - century ago , the government treated gay people as a menace to national security , and much of the public , kept from any ordinary depictions of gay life , lived in terror of encountering one of us .
It was routine , and reliably successful , for defendants in murder cases to prevail by alleging they were fending off a gay assault .
( If confronted by the pathology of homosexuality , jurors believed , force was not only appropriate but utterly forgivable . )
Back then , many psychiatrists treated homosexuality with shock therapy , detention , or a mind - twisting intervention called “ aversion therapy ” — a practice that was still in vogue in the late seventies , when a lumpy - faced psychiatrist put me through a regimen of staring at Playboy centerfolds .
The groundwork for change began when Evelyn Hooker , a UCLA psychologist , was approached by a gay former student in the fifties .
He had noticed that all research on homosexuals looked at men and women who were imprisoned or institutionalized , thereby advancing the belief that homosexuals were abnormal .
He proposed that she study men like him as a counterpoint .
Over the next two decades , she did just that , proving that none of the known psychological screens could detect a healthy gay person — that there was no clinical pathology to sexual orientation .
Of necessity , research at the time was focused on demonstrating how unremarkable gay men and lesbians are : indistinguishable on all personality inventories , equally good at all jobs , benign as parents , unthreatening as neighbors , and so on .
On the strength of Hooker ’s findings , and a Gandhian effort by activists , the APA changed its view on homosexuals 34 years ago .
Thereafter , the field of sexual - orientation research fell dormant until 1991 , when Simon LeVay conducted the very first study of homosexual biological uniqueness .
He had been a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , when his lover fell ill with AIDS .
He took a year off to care for him , but his partner ultimately died .
Returning to work , LeVay decided he wanted to concentrate on gay themes .
“ Just like a lot of gay people who ’d been directly affected by the epidemic , I felt a desire to do something more relevant to my identity as a gay man , ” says LeVay .
“ Some people have said I was out to try and prove that it was n’t my fault that I was gay .
I reject that .
In my case , since neuroscience was my work , that just seemed like the way to go . ”
Ironically , AIDS had also given LeVay opportunity .
Before the epidemic , cadavers available for dissecting came with scant personal background besides age and cause of death .
But because AIDS was still largely a gay disease , it was possible for the first time to do detailed neuroanatomical studies on the bodies of known gay men .
( Being lucky enough to have no proprietary cause of death , lesbians were excluded from the study . )
LeVay decided to make the first detailed comparison of the brain ’s hypothalamus , a small region at the base of the brain responsible for regulating everything from blood pressure and body temperature to hunger and wake - sleep cycles .
And because it ’s awash in more hormones than any other part of the brain , it also helps control emotions and sex drive and enjoys a reputation among neurologists , as LeVay noted in his book The Sexual Brain , for being “ haunted by animal spirits and the ghosts of primal urges . ”
LeVay suspected the secret to sexual orientation might lurk there as well .
It was already known that in ( presumably straight ) men , a cell cluster in the hypothalamus called INAH3 is more than twice the size of the cluster in ( presumably straight ) women , a distinction probably created during fetal development when male hormones begin acting on boy fetuses and the two genders embark on different biological courses .
LeVay designed a study to see if there were any size differences inside gay brains .
His results were startling and unexpected .
In gay men , INAH3 is similar in size to straight women’s .
This finding challenged a lot of what scientists believed .
“ The brain was considered pretty hardwired , ” says Roger Gorski , a neurobiologist at UCLA who researches sexual differentiation .
“ It was male or female , period .
Then Simon ’s study shows that there could be intermediates .
That was n’t just a watershed — it pushed the water over the waterfall . ”
At the time , LeVay presented his findings with caution , acknowledging that HIV or AIDS medications might have been responsible for altering brain structure .
But more recently , an important study of sheep brains has replicated his findings .
Sheep are among 500 animal species where homosexuality has been documented .
They are also among the few who practice exclusive homosexuality , like many humans .
In any population of sheep , about 8 percent of males show exclusive homosexual behavior .
Little is known about the romantic life of Sapphic sheep because ewes tend to express their sexual interests by standing entirely still , yielding no clues about their partner preferences .
Slicing open the brains of ten ewes , eight female - oriented rams , and nine males who preferred other rams , researchers in the Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine found nearly the same variations in hypothalamus that LeVay first noticed .
Male sheep who were attracted to females had a significantly larger hypothalamus dimension than females or male - oriented males .
A second study in humans also found size differences , though less dramatic , in the hypothalamus cluster identified by LeVay .
“ There ’s now more reason to think my results are right , that the gay brain has this distinction , ” he says .
If LeVay ’s research suggested that biology — not environment , vice , or sinfulness — was likely responsible for male homosexuality , the geneticist Dean Hamer , an author and molecular biologist at the National Institutes of Health , hoped to pinpoint the exact biological mechanism responsible .
He scanned gene groups in pairs of gay siblings looking for sites where the relatives had inherited the same DNA more frequently than would be expected on the basis of chance .
In 1993 , he located a region in the human genome , called Xq28 , that appeared to be associated with gayness , a finding that has generated some controversy among researchers who have not fully confirmed the results .
A large - scale study within the next year is expected to determine more conclusively if a gene ( or genes ) is linked to sexual orientation .
Alan R. Sanders , a psychiatrist from Northwestern University , is enrolling 1,000 pairs of gay brothers in one of the largest sexual - orientation studies ever undertaken .
With the experiment , funded by an NIH grant of over $ 1 million , Sanders will attempt to map genes that influence sexual orientation .
Why has it taken fourteen years to carry out such an investigation ?
Hamer says there is very little research money , and almost no glory , to be gained in the hunt for gayness .
“ At about the same time as Xq28 came out , we found another gene involved in anxiety — the target gene for Prozac , and since that time , there have been now almost 800 peer - reviewed publications on that gene .
Whereas for the gay gene , every experiment has been done by three or four students , most of them my students . ”
One of the riddles still vexing geneticists is why only 50 percent of gay identical twins share a sexual orientation with their sibling , despite being genetically identical .
“ We know from all sorts of research that it ’s not your upbringing , not relationship with parents or siblings , not early - childhood sexual experiences and whether you go to a Catholic school or not , ” says Sven Bocklandt , a geneticist at UCLA .
“ What I believe is that it is the ‘ epigenetics environment , ’ meaning the environment on top of our DNA — meaning the way that the gene is regulated .
If you have identical twins , the genes are identical , but they are used differently .
Every man and every woman has all the genes to make a vagina and womb and penis and testicles .
In the same way , arguably , every man and woman has the genetic code for the brain networks that make you attracted to men and to women .
You activate one or the other — and if you activate the wrong one , you ’re gay . ”
I ca n’t ignore Bocklandt ’s use of the word wrong in relation to gay genetic codes .
I do n’t believe Bocklandt has any agenda in his work beyond scientific exploration , nor do I have any reason to believe he is anti-gay .
Rather , Bocklandt is driven , as he likes to say , by a voracious curiosity about all sorts of sexual orientations .
“ This is not about a gay gene , ” he says .
“ This is about sexual attraction , and about love .
And about why crocodiles mate and why pigeons mate .
It ’s amazing to me that we do n’t understand how that works .
It ’s so fundamental .
Life on Earth would be very different if heterosexuality did n’t exist .
That ’s what we ’re trying to figure out . ”
But every discovery in this field ignites a new discussion of morality .
Politically , there is something very powerful about the notion that sexual orientation is a matter of biology , not choice .
In poll after poll , of the one third of Americans who believe homosexuality is socially influenced , in other words “ a choice , ” about 70 percent think being gay is “ not acceptable . ”
But for those who believe it is biologically mandated , the statistic reverses , and four out of five Americans find gayness “ acceptable . ”
As Bocklandt ’s slip of the tongue illustrates , subtle judgments abound in the field .
It is true that homosexuality does not make a whole lot of sense biologically .
It lacks an obvious purpose .
That ’s the reason evolution - theory scholars call it “ maladaptive ” and radio shock jock Laura Schlessinger labeled it a “ biological error . ”
But Stanford biology professor Joan Roughgarden points out in her book Evolution ’s Rainbow that most homosexual activity in the animal kingdom serves a fundamentally social purpose .
Japanese macaques , for instance , live in female - only societies , arranged in rigid hierarchies .
Power and cohesion are established through lesbian couplings , which can last up to four days and seem to prevent violence and aggression .
Among many species , in fact , gayness seems to facilitate complex societies .
One species of bird has males , females , and “ marriage brokers ” of a third gender , there to keep the species perpetuating .
As adolescents , male bottlenose dolphins perform a kind of oral sex on one another — or in threesomes or foursomes — in rituals that create lifelong friendships and defense partnerships against sharks and other predators .
If we identify how sexual orientation is set in utero , does n’t that suggest a future in which gay people can be prevented ?
But for most in the animal kingdom , same - sex pairing is either fleeting or situational .
Even Silo and Roy , for six years the poster - penguins for same - sex love in the Central Park Zoo — they famously raised a daughter together — were not destined to last forever .
Silo waddled off with a female named Scrappy in 2005 , says zoo director Dan Wharton , adding that we should n’t worry about Roy ’s hurt feelings .
“ Penguins are matter - of - fact about these things . ”
That still leaves a million questions about those gay rams and humans like me , who fall on the far edge of Alfred Kinsey ’s sexual - orientation scale , exclusively gay .
In a universe in which we look for purpose in order to appoint value , what is the purpose of my gayness ?
Dean Hamer sees one possible answer in the fraternal - birth - order studies .
“ In Polynesian cultures , where you ’re talking about very big families , it was typical to have the last - born son be mahu , or gay , ” he says .
Explorers described young boys who looked after the family and sometimes dressed as girls .
“ They suspected that their families had made them that way .
But you just ca n’t take a guy and make him clean up and have him become gay .
He ’s got to have some gayness inside .
Maybe that ’s the biological purpose to the mahu : taking care of Mom . ”
He says this half in jest , I think , but some other evidence bolsters his argument , including the appearance of transgender younger sons among Native Americans ( the so - called two - spirits ) and in premodern corners of India , Samoa , and Indonesia .
A survey published this year suggested that transgender fa’afafines in Samoa are more “ avuncular ” than heterosexuals — that is , more likely to care for kin .
Another study says that female relatives of gay men may have more children ; perhaps the very thing that makes their brothers and sons gay makes them more fertile , an ideal situation with extra babysitters on hand .
You can slice this stuff any way you want .
Fewer studies have focused specifically on lesbians , perhaps because AIDS did n’t provide the same urgent impetus for studying female sexuality .
But the research that has been conducted has yielded some interesting , though decidedly cloudy , results .
According to some studies , lesbians are more likely to have homosexual relatives than nonlesbians .
They also have notably longer bone growth in their arms , legs , and hands , hinting that they had greater androgen exposure during development , according to James Martin , a physiologist with Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona , California .
Another indicator comes in a 2003 study in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience that measured something called “ prepulse inhibition , ” which is the part of our startle mechanism that ’s believed to defy practice or training — something hardwired , in other words .
Men tend to blink less than women in such experiments ; gay and heterosexual men had similar responses , but lesbians , it turns out , were more like men than not .
In many other studies , though , lesbians have appeared less unique than gay men , leading some people to wonder if their sexual orientation is innate .
Michael Bailey — who , as a heterosexual researcher , is a minority in this field — even doubts the existence of female sexual orientation , if by orientation we mean a fundamental drive that defies our conscious choices .
He bases this provocative gambit on a sexual - arousal study he and his students conducted .
When shown pornographic videos , men have an undeniable response either to gay or straight images but not both , according to sensitive gauges attached to their genitals — it ’s that binary .
Female sexual response is more democratic , opaque , and unpredictable : Arousal itself is harder to track , and there is evidence that it defies easy categorization .
“ I do n’t yet understand female partner choices very well , and neither does anyone else , ” Bailey wrote me in an e-mail .
“ What I do think it ’s time to do is admit that female sexuality looks in some ways very different from male sexuality , and that there is no clear analog in women of men ’s directed sexual - arousal pattern , which I think is their sexual orientation .
I am not sure that women do n’t have a sexual orientation , but it is certainly unclear that they do . ”
He contends that what they have instead is sexual preference — they might prefer sex with women , but something in their brains can still sizzle at the thought of men .
Many feminist scholars agree with this assessment , and consider sexuality more of a fluid than an either - or proposition , but some do n’t .
“ I think women do have orientations , but they do n’t circumscribe the range of desires that women can experience to the same degree as men , ” says Lisa Diamond , a psychology professor at the University of Utah , who is writing a book on the subject .
“ For women , there ’s more wiggle room .
You can think of orientation as defining a range of possible responses , and for women , it ’s much broader . ”
Bailey stops short of saying that lesbianism is a myth ( although he has notoriously declared that true male bisexuality does n’t exist and dismissed many transgender people as peculiar sexual fetishists , drawing lasting enmity from gay and trans groups ) .
But it may be less hard - wired .
And it appears to have separate triggers and correlates that have n’t been identified yet .
In studies of twins , there is a lower correlation of sexual orientation between female siblings than male siblings , for instance .
“ We ’re at a place , ” agrees Diamond , “ where everyone agrees that whatever is going on is quite distinct between the sexes . ”
I suppose the main upside to this kind of work , besides any impact it might have on securing gay rights , is the comfort of self - knowledge .
The secrets lurking in the hypothalamus ( and the ring finger and the hair whorl ) are n’t just about who we desire but about a more fundamental organization of our personalities , individually and collectively .
Still , some have dismissed all this field - guide work as wrongheaded .
Gaydar can no more be proved than a sixth sense , they say .
What ’s being classified as fundamentally gay is nothing more than cultural signals that vary so much from one part of the world to another that they ’re worthless as clues to anything .
It is surely true that gaydar has its blind spots .
When I traveled through Nigeria a few years ago , I was unable after nearly a month to say with any conviction that I had encountered any gay people along my way .
No knowing eye contact , no species recognition .
( Then again , it ’s not as if I was able to measure index - to - ring finger ratios . )
Where were they all ?
In Lagos , the morning newspaper offered an answer .
According to a tiny news squib , a court had just convicted a young man of sodomy and sentenced him to death by stoning .
Two other death sentences were handed down to gay people in the few days before I boarded my airplane .
I paid a visit to one of the top human - rights agencies in the country and asked why they were n’t protesting these cases .
The director looked at me dumbstruck .
“ Because sodomy , ” he said as if speaking to a child , “ is illegal . ”
To survive , they were hiding , even from me — they had edited down their gendermaps to the barest minimum and disappeared .
Still , Dr. Lippa , the hair - whorl researcher , is publishing a paper in the Archives of Sexual Behavior later this year that seems to prove the existence of gay - typical behavior across the globe .
Lippa is looking at a 2005 BBC Internet survey , part of a BBC documentary project called Secrets of the Sexes , which included more than 200,000 respondents in 53 countries answering questions about everything from their occupational interests to their sexual histories and personalities .
Lippa , a tall and slender man who came out to his parents in his thirties , analyzed the data first along gender lines , then compared straight people to gay people .
What he found , he says , is a cross-cultural confirmation of what amount to stereotypes .
“ It probably comes as no shock to you that on average men say they ’re interested in being mechanics , or electrical engineers , or construction workers , whereas on average women are more interested in , say , being an interior decorator or a social worker or an artist , ” he tells me .
“ Similarly , the differences between gay men and straight men are pretty large .
On average , gay men are interested more in what you would consider female - typical occupations and hobbies than straight men .
Same with women .
It ’s not universal .
Some gay men like football games and like working on cars and are electrical engineers .
But a large majority answer this way . ”
It could be that his study says more about the limited number of vocations where gay men feel comfortable expressing themselves , and we might be equally drawn to construction sites if we thought we might be accepted there .
It could be that the study says as much about the globalization of culture as the biological nature of gayness .
Even Lippa hesitates to say that gay people are essentially different from straight .
“ Essentialism , ” he explains , “ is the enemy of a lot of academics , ” because it shuts down inquiry into all the possible influences .
Perhaps there are a dozen possible routes to homosexuality , any combination of which might produce a number of the traits being catalogued now .
It might be that there is no single thing called homosexuality — that there are instead dozens of homosexualities , scores of potential outcomes in terms of personality , and endless potentials for describing them .
“ For example , do gay men who have older brothers show more or less feminine ?
Do gay men with counterclockwise hair have more masculine traits ?
One cause might create a more feminine homosexuality than another . ”
Of course , biology does n’t determine everything .
And some critics of sexual - orientation researchers blame them for minimizing the role of experience in determining our affectional course in life .
The feminist biologist Anne Fausto - Sterling has waged a constant battle against their research , which she calls “ a big house of cards ” that ignores the power of environment in creating personality .
Nurture , she argues , can and should be studied as a link to sexual orientation .
The baby penguin raised by her two dads is a potential case study — though genetically unrelated to either parent , in the last few mating seasons she has mated with another female .
The rush to declare a biological mandate is motivated by a political agenda , says Fausto - Sterling , the author of Sexing the Body , who is married to a woman after a marriage to a man .
“ For me and for any feminist , I think it ’s a pretty fragile way to argue for human rights .
I want to see the claims for gay rights made on moral , ethical , legal , and constitutional bases that do n’t rely on a particular scientific view of sexual development . ”
Especially if that view invites the opponents of gay people to consider dramatic interventions meant to stop the development of homosexual orientation in a fetus .
What if prenatal tests were able to show a predisposition to gayness ?
How long would it be before some pharmaceutical company develops a patch to regulate hormone flow and direct the baby ’s orientation ?
Michael Bailey , for one , is n’t troubled by the moral implications any more than he would oppose fetal screens for potential birth defects , though he quickly adds his personal belief that homosexuality is “ a good ” on par with heterosexuality .
“ There ’s no reason to ban , or become hysterical about , selecting for heterosexuality , ” he says .
“ That ’s precisely what parenting is about : shaping the children to have traits the parents value . ”
It ’s bizarre to think some value systems might lump gayness in with — say — sickle - cell anemia or Down syndrome .
As Matt Foreman from the Task Force put it , “ It ’s not playing with the number of toes you have ; it ’s really manipulating your very essence .
So many people see gay people only in terms of sexual behavior , as opposed to what sexual orientation is really about , which is how you fit into the world .
I do n’t want to get mushy , but it ’s about your soul . ”
Back in January , I wrote a post about the injustice that befell seventeen year old Genarlow Wilson who was sentenced to ten years in prison for engaging in oral sex with a fifteen year old girl ( just a few months shy of sixteen ) at a New Yearâ€™s party .
Wilson was charged with aggravated child molesting .
Wilson is now twenty - one and has served his first two years of his ten year sentence .
Today , Judge Thomas H. Wilson ( no relation to Genarlow Wilson ) ordered the release of Genarlow Wilson stating in his ruling : “ The fact that Genarlow Wilson has spent two years in prison for what is now classified as a misdemeanor , and without assistance from this Court , will spend eight more years in prison , is a grave miscarriage of justice . ”
Even though the Georgia legislature failed to make the law retroactive , Judge Wilson downgraded the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor because the legislatureâ€™s intent was to clarify what the state determined to be child molesting .
The reason the legislature passed the bill was in direct response to the Genarlow Wilson case .
Despite pleas from Wilsonâ€™s lawyer to the Georgia Attorney General to not file an appeal , the Attorney General made the decision less than two hours after Judge Wilsonâ€™s ruling to file an appeal , effectively placing the judgeâ€™s ruling on hold and keeping Wilson in prison until his case can be heard by a higher court .
This begs the question : what possible purpose is being served by Genarlow Wilson spending ten years in prison for what most people agree is minor offense ?
Is it really fair to characterize a seventeen year old having sexual contact with someone less than two years younger than him as a child molester ?
Is this young man truly a threat to children if he is released back into society ?
Judge Wilson had it right : two years for this offense is enough .
Hopefully , the next judge who hears this case will also be as reasonable .
Jimmy Carter has dedicated his life after the White House to conflict resolution around the world .
Presidents George Bush the elder and Bill Clinton have campaigned together on behalf of communities devastated by Hurricane Katrina .
So how does President George Bush junior imagine spending his retirement years ?
" I can just envision getting in the car , getting bored , going down to the ranch , " he says .
He also has big plans for making money .
" I 'll give some speeches , to replenish the ol ' coffers , " says Mr Bush , who is already estimated to be worth $ 20 m .
" I do n't know what my dad gets - it 's more than 50 - 75 [ thousand dollars a speech ] , and " Clinton 's making a lot of money " .
The insights into Mr Bush 's ambitions once he steps down from the most powerful job on Earth in January 2009 are contained in a series of interviews he gave to a journalist from GQ magazine .
It may be that the writer , Robert Draper , comes from Texas , like his subject , but whatever the reason , Mr Bush has chosen to be singularly open with the author and provide a rare glimpse into the inner life of a very private president .
During the course of six one - hour interviews , Mr Bush , feet up on his desk , munching on low - fat hotdogs , tells Draper of the loneliness of the US commander - in - chief .
" Self - pity is the worst thing that can happen to a presidency .
This is a job where you can have a lot of self - pity , " Mr Bush says .
When it all gets too much for the president , his wife Laura storms to the rescue .
" She reminds me that I decided to do this , " he tells Draper .
The interviews came after Draper lobbied the president for several years to give him access , arguing that he would write the first draft of history on the Bush presidency .
The book to emerge from their conversations will be published tomorrow , but an early taste was given in yesterday 's New York Times .
The book 's title , Dead Certain , is ominously ambiguous , given the 3,728 US personnel - and by some estimates more than 70,000 civilians - who have died in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
For those around the world who are already perplexed by Mr Bush 's strategy in Iraq , his comments to Draper will not be reassuring .
The president says to the writer that one of the failings of his prosecution of the war was that Saddam Hussein 's army was broken up , in contravention of Washington policy and leading to looting and chaos across Iraq .
" The policy was to keep the army intact ; [ it ] did n't happen , " Mr Bush says .
But , Draper points out , it was Paul Bremer , the man chosen by the president to administer country after the invasion , who ordered the disbandment of the Iraqi army .
What did Mr Bush think when he learnt of that ?
" Yeah , I can't remember .
I 'm sure I said : ' This is the policy - what happened ? ' "
It gets worse .
Mr Bush reveals that whenever he feels depressed about the death toll in Iraq , he turns to God for comfort .
" I 've got God 's shoulder to cry on , and I cry a lot , " he says .
" I 'll bet I 've shed more tears than you can count . "
Mr Bush says when his time in office is up , he will be only 62 and " really young " .
Apart from the joy of getting bored , he is looking forward to setting up a " fantastic freedom institute in Dallas " for young democratic leaders around the world .
There is at least one point on which the president and his detractors will agree .
In a moment of breathtaking candour , Mr Bush laments the fact that the media no longer listens to him .
" I 've been here too long , " he says .
There are concerns that antibiotics will lose their effect
The British Pharmaceutical Conference heard one in eight prescriptions in one area were for more modern drugs , often breaching guidelines .
Experts say these drugs should be held back as a " last line of defence " - to cut the risk of bacterial resistance .
Doctors ' leaders said there might be good reasons for GPs ' choices .
Doctors in both hospitals and GP surgeries are under great pressure to curb their antibiotic use , as over - use can lead to the development of " superbugs " resistant to all but a few modern drugs .
In recent years , new classes of powerful antibiotics have been developed to counter this threat , and guidelines say these should be used sparingly and only on certain conditions and where earlier antibiotics have failed .
Guidelines not followed
Four out of five prescriptions for antibiotics are written in the GP surgery , and a team from Liverpool John Moores University wanted to check what they were using and how often .
They looked at computer records and found that 15 % of all antibiotic prescriptions were for more modern , expensive drugs , and that guidelines designed to restrict their use were not being followed .
The problem with guidelines is that none of them perfectly fits every situation
Dr Jim Kennedy , RCGP
" The risks associated with this behaviour are that the drug may be unnecessary or inappropriate , increasing the potential of resistance and increasing costs to the primary care trust . "
Dr Jim Kennedy , the Royal College of GPs Head of Prescribing , said that a more detailed picture of prescribing would be needed to identify a problem .
" We do n't know if this is a couple of rogue prescribers , or whether there were good reasons why the guidelines were n't being followed .
" The problem with guidelines is that none of them perfectly fits every situation . "
He said that it was possible that the overall downward trend in antibiotic prescribing in recent years might mean that the appropriate use of stronger , modern antibiotics appeared to increase , as GPs continued to use these appropriately in the treatment of more serious bacterial infections .
Hospital overdose
Another study presented to the conference in Manchester highlighted the difficulties faced by those trying to curb overuse of antibiotics - this time within hospitals .
We think that doctors are still being overcautious about the risk of hospital acquired infections
Dr Rachel Etherington , Sunderland University RCGP
Many patients undergoing surgery are given a handful of doses of antibiotics to cut their chances of developing an infection , but Sunderland University researchers found in 2005 that more than half were getting too many in nearby City Hospitals Sunderland .
One woman patient was reportedly given 81 doses of antibiotics rather than the three to five required .
The trust changed its electronic prescribing system so that doctors would have to write in a date past which no antibiotics would be given .
However , the conference was told that the result was that 74 % of patients received too much antibiotic , rather than 55 % before the change , as doctors allowed for too many days of treatment .
Lead researcher Dr Rachel Etherington : " We think that doctors are still being overcautious about the risk of hospital acquired infections - perhaps partly due to media coverage of ' superbugs ' . "
Update :
The latest version of the Wall Street Journal story at 4:19 on Friday afternoon says that the talks between Microsoft and Yahoo “ are no longer active , ” according to the paper ’s sources — although “ the two companies may still explore other ways of cooperating . ”
Original post :
I wonder if Rupert Murdoch has any shares in Yahoo he ’s trying to get rid of .
Just kidding 🙂
But now would be a pretty good time to unload them .
The New York Post ignited a firestorm of rumour this morning — and lit a fire under Yahoo ’s share price too — with a story saying Microsoft is back in merger talks with the Internet portal .
That pushed Yahoo ’s moribund stock up by 17 per cent or so , adding about $ 6 - billion to its market cap .
As the Wall Street Journal points out in its story , the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo is not a new idea .
The two companies were reportedly talking a year or so ago about a possible deal , and now those talks have apparently been revived .
But does it make any sense ?
That depends on how you look at it .
It makes sense when you consider that Microsoft ’s search and related assets are running a distant — and I mean distant — third in the market .
And Yahoo , for all of its faults , is a big property with a snappy new engine behind its search , which is ( theoretically ) supposed to close the gap with Google .
That ’s the “ glass is half full ” argument .
The half - empty argument is that both Microsoft and Yahoo are lumbering behemoths with hardly an agile bone left in their sclerotic bodies .
Most of their problems stem from the fact that they have accumulated immense bureaucracies — a big part of the impetus for Yahoo exec Brad Garlinghouse ’s infamous “ peanut butter ” manifesto — and a collection of legacy businesses that keep getting in the way .
They are like icebergs : not only is nine - tenths of them unseen , but they are slow - moving and difficult to steer .
Impressive ?
Yes .
Powerful ?
No doubt about it .
But fast , or nimble or imaginative ?
No .
Roping them together would do nothing but compound their problems .
Further reading :
Paul Kedrosky does n’t think the merger would be a good thing , even though he has been speculating that Microsoft would probably take a run at Yahoo for some time now .
Even Henry “ I used to be a famous Wall Street analyst ” Blodget does n’t like the idea .
And Charlene Li of Forrester Research takes a look at both sides of the argument here .

携帯電話向けのソーシャルネットワーキングサービス（SNS）が盛り上がっている。現在トップを走るのはディー・エヌ・エー（DeNA）が提供する「モバゲータウン」だ。同サイトは2006年2月に開始され、2007年5月の時点で会員数が500万人、1日のページビューは4億を超えている。
そのような中、ウェブドゥジャパンが7月2日にオープンした携帯電話向けSNS「プチゲーフレンズ」がネットで話題を集めている。
このサイトでは、無料のミニゲームなどで遊べるほか、サークルや日記などでユーザー同士がコミュニケーションできる。また会員登録をしたユーザーは、サイト内通貨「プチゴールド」を使って、髪型や目、服装などのパーツを自由に組み合わせ、自分そっくりのアバターを作ることも可能だ。
ここまで聞くと、プチゲーフレンズが話題となっている理由がわかってくるだろう。そのサービス内容が先行する携帯電話向けSNS「モバゲータウン」にそっくりなのである。
ウェブドゥジャパン 「 真摯に勉強した結果として似た形に 」
とはいえ、SNSに限らずネットのサービス内容は突き詰めていけば最終的に似通っていってしまうのかもしれない。無料ゲームや日記、アバターなどはどのサービスでも提供している。サービス内容がある程度似てくるのはよくあることである。
ところが、だ。サイトの画面を見比べてみると、プチゲーフレンズとモバゲータウンには驚くほどの共通点があることに気づく。むしろ差異を見つける方が難しいのではないか。
左 が 「 モバゲータウン」、右が 「 プチゲーフレンズ」（7月26日現在）
左が「モバゲータウン」、右が「プチゲーフレンズ」（7月26日現在）
サイトオープン当初はさらに酷似していた。レイアウトやデザイン、文言など、共通する部分が非常に多い。例えば両サイトともトップページには「お知らせ＆新着情報」でサービスの新機能などを告知し、その下には「遊ぼう」と題してミニゲームなどを配置している。

ウェブドゥジャパン取締役の櫻井英哉氏 ウェブドゥジャパン取締役の櫻井英哉氏
両サイトの類似性について、ウェブドゥジャパン取締役の櫻井英哉氏に話を聞くと、「結果的に似たということ。当然いろいろなSNSを勉強させていただいて、その結果としてやはりもっとも優れているのはモバゲーさんなのかなと。そこを真摯に勉強させていただいた結果としてあの形になったというのがあります」とした。
両サイトが似ていることはネットでも話題となっているが、これは社内でも認識しているという。
その点について櫻井氏に感想を求めると、「結果的に似ているので特に感想はない」という回答。「まあ似てないのかと言われると、似てないことはないですよね、と思います。」（櫻井氏）
ただ、モバゲータウンが急成長し、ユーザーのみならず業界全体から注目を受けるなかで、そのサイトと似すぎている箇所をあえて変えようとは考えなかったのだろうか。
「 たぶんレベルの差だと思うんです。パクリなのかオマージュなのか、とかよく言うじゃないですか。そこの線引きって特にないと思うんですね。あくまでも我々は先ほど申し上げたとおり、真摯に勉強させていただき、すべてにおいて一番いい形と思われるものを選択させていただいた結果として、似た形になっている、かもしれません」（櫻井氏）

“ Is it powerful enough that you want to ostracize your kid ?
It is very socially impacting if children can’t eat the things that their friends do . ”
Still , Dr. Spencer called the advice of the British food agency “ sensible , ” noting that some children may be “ supersensitive to additives ” just as some people are more sensitive to caffeine .
The Lancet study focused on a variety of food colorings and on sodium benzoate , a common preservative .
The researchers note that removing this preservative from food could cause problems in itself by increasing spoilage .
In the six - week trial , researchers gave a randomly selected group of several hundred 3 - year - olds and of 8 - and 9 - year - olds drinks with additives — colors and sodium benzoate — that mimicked the mix in children ’s drinks that are commercially available .
The dose of additives consumed was equivalent to that in one or two servings of candy a day , the researchers said .
Their diet was otherwise controlled to avoid other sources of the additives .
A control group was given an additive - free placebo drink that looked and tasted the same .
All of the children were evaluated for inattention and hyperactivity by parents , teachers ( for school - age children ) and through a computer test .
Neither the researchers nor the subject knew which drink any of the children had consumed .
The researchers discovered that children in both age groups were significantly more hyperactive and that they had shorter attention spans if they had consumed the drink containing the additives .
The study did not try to link specific consumption with specific behaviors .
The study ’s authors noted that other research suggested that the hyperactivity could increase in as little as an hour after artificial additives were consumed .
The Lancet study could not determine which of the additives caused the poor performances because all the children received a mix .
“ This was a very complicated study , and it will take an even more complicated study to figure out which components caused the effect , ” Professor Stevenson said .
According to Bankrate , the 10 things listed below that “ DECREASE ” the value to your home .
Based on my recent purchase of a new construction single - family home , I have added my comments for each of these items .
1. A Pool
Personally , I ’m not too fond of having a pool in my backyard , mainly because of the maintenance costs .
I do like swimming , but fortunately our community has a pool .
Also , when it comes time to sell your home , you have automatically limited your buyer market .
2 . No garage or a small garage
Unless you ’re living in a condo , a retirement community , or historical or in - town neighborhood most buyers will look for at least a two - car garage .
If you do n’t have a garage , it ’s a real negative .
Personally , for a young family of mine having a 2 car garage is a must .
I like having the extra storage space too .
3. Garbled Floor Plan
Since we went for a new construction home , we had to choose one of the floor plans that builder was offering .
Fortunately , there was also a model home of the floorplan we liked .
Mentally , we have already made plans for each room in the house .
We liked the Master Suite a lot .
Small rooms and bathrooms , an inconvenient floor plan or a layout that requires you to access bedrooms or bathrooms through other rooms will detract value from your home .
4. Outmoded appliances or systems
When a buyer walks into a home , one of the biggest concerns that they have is that the appliances should be in a working condition and should look good too .
If you try to open the oven and the door falls off , the buyer is out ta there .
We actually chose our own appliances , so no problem there .
5 . Stale or overly personal decor
Personally , I do n’t like a red color wall .
But many of us do like bright colors in our house .
That well and good , but when its time to sell , its a good idea to paint your walls with a neutral color , that would surely appeal to more buyers .
6 . A bad roof
I do n’t understand much about how a house is built , but as a buyer , if my home inspector tells me that the house has a bad roof , that would be scary and I will run away from there and never look back .
7. Bad location
This is an important one .
When we were looking for a home , our criteria was an area with good schools for my daughter , shopping close by and quiet and peaceful neighborhood .
If our house was anywhere near an airport or an interstate , we would not have considered that location .
8 . Poor maintenance
I would put this one under the category of “ Curb Appeal ” .
If I ’m looking for a home and when I drive to it , I see some old chipped paint on it , uneven grass on the ground and just overall shabby looking , I would just drive past it .
I know these are cosmetic changes , but when I ’m buying a home I want the whole package , not just updated appliances in the kitchen .
It ’s worth investing in the maintenance of your home to increase the resale value .
9. Environmental hazards
This where a home inspection comes in real handy .
Your inspector should be able to tell you if you might have a problem with mold , lead or asbestos .
Even though , these things can be fixed , I , and many other buyers would not like the sound of that .
10 .
A laundry list of needed improvements
As a buyer , if you are looking at a house and realize that there is some significant work / improvements that would need to be done before you actually start enjoying your home , that ’s a big turn off .
You have enough things to worry about like buying new furniture etc. and spending money on basic improvements that should have been done in the first place does not leave a good taste in my mouth .

Seriously .
Let 's just add the charge to everybody 's taxes next year , a nice little line - item .
Total costs of the war in Iraq will soon be $ 500 billion , to date , and with 100 million Americans filing tax returns each year ( the actual number is somewhat higher , but for the life of me I can't find it ) , that comes to about $ 5000 a taxpayer .
( And I 'm just talking about the actual up front defense costs - the real cost of the war is estimated at $ 2 trillion dollars , that 's four times what we 're paying for the defense side of it , so that makes the real cost to taxpayers around $ 20,000 . )
We 're paying for it anyway , why not put it in our tax returns so that we 're forced to see exactly how much the Republicans ' little patriotic venture in Iraq is costing every American taxpayer .
Most Americans have no idea what the costs of this war are , in lives , in money , in national prestige .
But the one thing we can show , quite personally , is the cost in dollars .
The Iraq war is the biggest tax increase in American history .
I 'd love to see someone amend the tax code and require a line - item on all of tax forms adding $ 5,000 .
Then see how long the war goes on for .

In June 2003 , Shirley Loewe went to Good Shepherd Medical Center here with a softball - size lump in her breast and was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 13 — In his first 15 months as president of the World Bank , Paul D. Wolfowitz has made the fight against corruption in poor countries a hallmark issue , waging an aggressive campaign that has led to the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and contracts to nations including India , Chad , Kenya , Congo , Ethiopia and Bangladesh .
It is a new incarnation for Mr. Wolfowitz , a neoconservative intellectual who was a primary architect of the Iraq war during four years as deputy secretary of defense .
At the World Bank , Mr. Wolfowitz , 62 , has maintained an assertive but soft - spoken style , saying recently that the bank ’s mission was “ to send children to school , to help mothers be healthier , to provide jobs for poor people — not to have resources siphoned off into the hands of the corrupt and greedy . ”
In recent months , however , his campaign has run into a host of critics , both at the bank and among financial officials outside the United States , who say that developing countries are being threatened with arbitrary punishment in a way that jeopardizes the bank ’s longtime mission to reduce poverty .
You may have heard of something called " life hacking . "
This may have disoriented and frightened you , just like that soda they used to make with little balls of tapioca floating in it .
That 's OK – we 're here to clear up your blemished psyche with a generous , oleaginous dose of information .
What is life hacking ?
Is it like computer hacking ?
Is someone going to break into my life ?
Will my dog like him better than me ?
OK , hold on , one question at a time .
Life hacking has little or nothing to do with home invasion .
It 's the practice of using clever little tips and tricks to make your life easier , more efficient or more productive .

That sounds kind of familiar .
Has n't it been around for a while ?
Yes , previously it was known as Hints From Heloise .
But life hacking is different , right ?
Judge for yourself .
As I write this , the top entry at lifehacker.com is " 10 uses for lemons . "
Yeah , but they 're like cool techno-uses for lemons , like overclocking your Wii or shorting out surveillance cameras , right ?
" No. 8 - Freshen up your dishwasher . "
So why is it called life hacking ?
Because a new name makes it sound like a new idea .
Geeks can't admit that anything worthwhile was invented before 1981 .
Soon , " making cocoa " will be called " milk hacking . "
Does life hacking have any uses unrelated to the freshness of my appliances ?
Oh , sure .
You can apply the term " life hacking " to nearly anything to make it sound clever and hypermodern !
In fact , that last sentence was itself a life hack !
You know how sometimes you just eat the ramen out of the pan instead of pouring it into a bowl ?

The largest increases in immigration since 2002 have been from Poland , Lithuania and Nigeria .
The latest census showed 63,276 Poles living permanently in Ireland , up from 2,124 four years earlier .
In some small districts in Dublin , Limerick and Cork , the census showed , 52 percent of residents were non-Irish , said Aidan Punch , a senior census statistician .
Ireland permits all residents , not just Irish citizens , to cast ballots in local elections .
That has helped immigrants win seats in local councils .
The mayor of the midlands town of Portlaoise , Rotimi Adebari , is from Nigeria .
To encourage assimilation , the government recently named a minister for integration , Conor Lenihan .
The department was organized , Mr. Lenihan said in an interview , to show Ireland ’s commitment to share and develop its new wealth with new arrivals .
“ We have chosen a midpoint between the U.S. and Europe in terms of our economic success , ” he said .
“ I think we can choose a midpoint in integration as well . ”
Mr. Lenihan said his department would investigate ways to provide extensive language classes for adult immigrants and to increase training for unskilled local Irish workers .
But immigrants ’ representatives say the government needs to do more .
“ Ireland should be taking a lead in Europe , ” said Jean - Pierre Eyanga Ekumeloko , a naturalized Irish citizen from Congo and a co-founder of Integrating Ireland , an independent support group for immigrants .
Mr. Ekumeloko said the Irish prime minister should lay out a plan for welcoming and integrating immigrants .
He said many were working jobs for which they were overqualified .
“ A lot of things have changed in interactions between the Irish community and immigrants , ” he said , adding that in the past he had heard racist remarks .
“ Things have changed very positively .
Now Irish people know Africans . ”
Quantum mechanics is a notoriously confusing and difficult subject , which is terribly unfortunate given its status as a fundamental theory of how the world works .
When I was an undergraduate and graduate student of physics in the 1980’s , I was always unsatisfied with the way the subject was presented .
We basically learned how to calculate solutions to certain problems , and there was an understanding that you were better off just avoiding the philosophical issues or the paradoxes surrounding the subject .
After all , everybody knew that all the challenges raised by physicists as eminent as Einstein had ultimately been resolved experimentally in favor of the “ Copenhagen interpretation . ”
Still , there was a lot of weird stuff in the Copenhagen interpretation like the “ collapse of the wave - function ” caused by a measurement , or apparently non-local effects .
What I wished existed was a clearly - defined and sensible set of “ rules of the game ” for using quantum mechanics .
The need for such a set of rules has only increased with time with the advent of the field of quantum computing .
In his book , “ Consistent Quantum Theory , ” ( the first 12 out of 27 chapters are available online ) noted mathematical physicist Robert Griffiths provides the textbook I wished I had as a student .
With contributions from Murray Gell - Mann , Roland Omnes , and James Hartle , Griffiths originated the “ consistent history ” approach to quantum mechanics which is explained in this book , .
The best summary of the approach can be obtained from the comparison Griffiths makes between quantum mechanics and the previous classical mechanics .
Quantum mechanics differs from classical mechanics in the following ways :
1. Physical objects never posses a completely precise position or momentum .
2 . The fundamental dynamical laws of physics are stochastic and not deterministic , so from the present state of the world one cannot infer a unique future ( or past ) course of events .
3 . The principle of unicity does not hold : there is not a unique exhaustive description of a physical system or a physical process .
Instead reality is such that it can be described in various alternative , incompatible ways , using descriptions which cannot be combined or compared .
It is the 3rd point which is the heart of the approach .
In quantum mechanics , you are permitted to describe systems using one “ consistent framework ” or another , but you may not mix incompatible frameworks ( basically frameworks using operators that do n’t commute ) together .
Griffiths uses toy models to illustrate the approach throughout the book , and provides resolutions for a large number of quantum paradoxes .
He stresses that measurement plays no fundamental role in quantum mechanics , that wave function collapse is not a physical process , that quantum mechanics is a strictly local theory , and that reality exists independent of any observers .
All of these points might seem philosphically natural and unremarkable , except for the fact that they contradict the standard Copenhagen interpretation .
This is a book that will take some commitment from the reader to understand , but it is the best explanation of quantum mechanics that I know of .

Researchers have found stronger evidence for a link between a parasite in cat faeces and undercooked meat and an increased risk of schizophrenia .
Research published in Procedings of the Royal Society B , shows how the invasion or replication of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii in rats may be inhibited by using anti-psychotic or mood stabilising drugs .
The researchers tested anti-psychotic and mood stabilising medications used for the treatment of schizophrenia on rats infected with T. gondii and found they were as , or more , effective at preventing behaviourial alterations as anti-T. gondii drugs .
This led them to believe that T. gondii may have a role in the development of some cases of schizophrenia .
Dr Joanne Webster from Imperial College London , and lead researcher said : " Although we are certainly not saying that exposure to this parasite does definitely lead to the development of schizophrenia , this and previous studies do show there may be a link in a few individuals , providing new clues for how we treat toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia . "
Previous epidemiological and neuropathological studies have indicated some cases of schizophrenia may be associated with environmental factors , such as exposure to the parasite T. gondii .
At the same time several of the medications used to treat schizophrenia have been shown to posess anti-parasitic and in particular anti-T.gondii properties .
This led the authors to suspect that the anti-psychotic activity of these medications may be due in part to their inhibition of these parasites .
When the rats were given Haloperidol , an anti-psychotic , and Valporic acid , a mood stabiliser , the behavioural symptoms of T.gondii were reduced .
They found the drugs were able to limit the ' suicidal feline ' attraction by which the rats became less aware of the dangers of cats .
Dr Joanne Webster added : " By showing that drugs used to treat schizophrenia affect the parasite T. gondii , this does provide further evidence for its role in the development of some cases schizophrenia .
It may be that anti-psychotic drugs work partly by parasite inhibition , and this could lead to new medicine and treatment combinations . "
The researchers have already begun human clinical trials using anti-T. gondii treatments as adjunct therapies for schizophrenia with researchers at Johns Hopkins University .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 30 — President Bush lashed out at Congress today , the third time he has done so in two weeks , this time saying the House had wasted time on “ a constant string of investigations ” and the Senate had similarly wasted its efforts by trying to rein in the Iraq war .
Its failure to send a single annual appropriations bill to his desk , he said , amounted to “ the worst record for a Congress in 20 years . ”
“ Congress is not getting its work done , ” the president said in brief remarks from the North Portico of the White House .
He urged Congress to act on defense - funding legislation and on a compromise on the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , or S - CHIP .
As he spoke , Mr. Bush was flanked by two senior Republicans , Representative John Boehner of Ohio , the minority leader , and Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri , the minority whip .
The three had emerged from a meeting in the East Room of the House Republican Conference , and perhaps reflecting the campaign season under way , the president ’s words took on a partisan edge .

With the integration of CWS dba23a , database objects ( queries , forms , reports ) cannot contain slashes / in their name anymore .
This character never reliably worked when used , and since it 's used in another meaning already - separating hierarchies when you , for instance , put forms or reports into folders - , they have been completely forbidden .
Every attempt to create or rename an object , giving it a name with a slash , will now be rejected with an error message .
If Base reads a document which already contains such broken names , then the slashes will silently be converted to underscores _ - which implies the objects will then work , again .

Extension can integrate options pages in the options dialog i75869 Options Dialog for Extensions
An extension may require to be configured before it can be used reasonably or in order to adapt it to personal preferences .
For example , a spell checker extension could be configured to use different sets of grammar rules , a clock extension could be configured to show twelve or twenty four hours , etc .
Configuring the extension should be as easy as possible for the user .
That is , a dialog should be used rather then some obscure configuration files which need to be edited .
And , of course , this dialog should be easily accessible , that is , it needs to be found intuitively .
Future extensions shall be able to integrate own options pages into the options dialog .
An options page is similar to a dialog but is lacking the title bar and border so that it can be shown in a parent window , which is the option dialog .
The options dialog can also be started from the Extension Manager , in which case it shows only the options pages of the selected extension .

Support of inline matrix / array constants in formulas i32342 feature - info :
Calc now supports inline matrix / array constants in formulas .
An inline array is surrounded by curly braces ' { ' and ' } '.
Elements can be each a number ( including negatives ) , a logical constant ( TRUE , FALSE ) or a literal string .
Non-constant expressions are not allowed .
Arrays can be entered with one or more rows , and one or more columns .
All rows must consist of the same number of elements , all columns must consist of the same number of elements , so that a two - dimensional array has no sparse elements .
The column separator ( separating elements in one row ) is the ' ;' semicolon , the row separator is a ' | ' pipe symbol .
They were chosen because the upcoming ODF formula specification uses these separators .
Contrary to Excel , the separators are not UI - version and / or locale dependent .
Arrays can not be nested .
Import / export from / to Excel are implemented .
Examples : ={ 1;2;3}
An array with one row consisting of the three numbers 1 , 2 and 3 .
={1;2;3|4;5;6}
An array with two rows and three values in each row .
={0;1;2|FALSE ;TRUE ;" two " } A mixed data array .
= SIN ( { 1;2;3} )
Entered as a matrix formula delivers the result of three SIN calculations with the arguments 1 , 2 respectively three .
={1;2|4;5;6} Invalid array , the first row misses an element .
This results in Err:512 " Formula overflow " .
={ 1;2+3} Invalid array , the second element is not a constant .
This results in Err:512 " Formula overflow " .
={1;2;{3;4;5}} Invalid array , nested arrays are not allowed .
This results in Err:533 " Nested arrays are not supported " .
This is a new error condition relevant for translation .

Dynamic ranges as formula results in validation lists i56566 feature - info :
Calc now supports dynamic ranges as formula results in validation lists , menu Data .
Validity , pick " Cell range " .
Previously , only directly entered range references such as A1:A5 or defined names that simply ( recursively ) evaluated to a range were supported .
Now also a formula that evaluates to a range or an array can be entered , such as INDIRECT ( A1 ) if A1 contains a string that evaluates to a range , such as B2:C3 .
Defined names are deeply evaluated now and do n't need to be defined to a simple range , a formula returning a range or an array here is fine as well .
This makes it possible to define a name to a complex formula that calculates a rectangular area and enter that defined name in the validation dialog .
The restriction that a range has to be exactly one column or one row was removed .
If a two - dimensional area is given , the elements in the selection list are listed row - wise if not sorted .
If the range or formula calculation results in an error , that error is displayed as the only value of the selection list box .

Thus toggling of automatic updates for charts is now fully a flag on it's own .
If that flag is set and changes to a table cell ( with a chart attached ) are made the chart will be updated a moment after the cursor leaves the current cell .
And this is right after the formula fields in a table got updated .
Thus chart will get the correct value for every field .
Previously the chart was only updated if cells / rows / columns got deleted / inserted or if a cell changed that was used in a formula field of another cell .
Now all changes to a cells content will trigger the automatic update for the chart object if the cursor leaves the cell .

' Enough is enough , ' S.F. says of homeless Residents of a famously liberal city appear to be changing views
Jenny Kiely and her three boys pose outside their apartment building on Natoma Street .
Jenny Kiely and her three boys Dylan ( 7 ) , Nick ( 4 ) and Thomas ( 1 ) live with her husband David south of Market Street in San Francisco .
The Kiely 's have owned the home there for 18 years and love the neighborhood but they 've had it with the vagrants and homeless in the neighborhood .

San Francisco - the liberal , left - coast city conservatives love to mock - could be undergoing a transformation when it comes to homeless people .
Although the city would still be a poor choice for a pep rally for the war in Iraq , indications are that residents have had it with aggressive panhandlers , street squatters and drug users .
" Maybe there has been an epiphany , " says David Latterman , president of Fall Line Analytics , a local market research firm .
" People have realized they can hate George Bush but still not want people crapping in their doorway . "
Consider the case of David Kiely , who has lived in the South of Market area for 18 years .
He bought a home when prices were low and now lives there with his wife , Jenny , and their three boys , ages 7 , 4 and 1 .
Kiely insists " we 're not some white , yuppie parents saying we can't take this . "
In fact , he says , they donate to programs for homeless people at Glide Memorial Methodist Church and the food bank at St. Anthony Dining Room .
But he 's finally saying " enough is enough . "
" I do n't expect it to be Cow Hollow or Pacific Heights , " he says .
" But the other day Jenny is bringing the kids back from the park , and some guy is standing on the corner throwing up on himself . "
Trent Rhorer , executive director of San Francisco 's Human Services Agency , is at ground zero for homelessness concerns .
He 's heard it from local residents at meetings , he 's read the polls , and he noted the huge response to Chronicle columns about the homeless people and intravenous drug users in Golden Gate park .
Like others , he thinks there 's been a change in the way San Franciscans think the homelessness problem should be approached .
" I do n't think this is a conservative or liberal thing , " he says .
" This is quality of life for everyone .
What research has shown and what we have seen from visits to cities like Philadelphia , Chicago , Portland and New York is that you need to combine good social outreach with law enforcement . "
That means something more than an offer of help , which often is declined anyhow .
( One city official estimated that nine out of 10 say they are not interested in a shelter or housing when approached . )
" Maybe , " Rhorer says , " you just need a guy with a badge standing over them and saying , you can't stay there any more . "
That 's tough talk for a city that 's been known as a friendly place for those down on their luck .
And in previous years it would have been a political non-starter .
When Mayor Frank Jordan tried to push homeless people off the street with his " Matrix " program , the crackdown got much of the blame for his failure to win a second term .
But this has the feel of a new day in San Francisco .
" Homelessness , and quality of life issues , are dividing the liberals and the progressives in this city , " says David Binder , a statistical analyst and founder of David Binder Research .
" The liberals will say we 've got to get tough on the homeless and the progressives are more old - line liberal . "
How that debate will come out is anyone 's guess , but it is hard to disagree with Latterman 's blunt assessment , which is , " People are just pissed .
For the first time , even the left is saying they 've had enough . "
In an informal poll by SFGate.com , 90 percent of respondents said Mayor Gavin Newsom 's crackdown South of Market was a great idea .
Latterman points to the neighborhood uprising in the Haight when it was proposed that a needle exchange program be moved to the Hamilton Methodist Church .
When some 200 residents showed up , mostly to protest the idea , it was shelved .
" One sample does n't make a trend , but it is telling , " says Latterman .
" C'mon , they live in the upper Haight .
They 're liberal by definition . "
But they are also , in many cases , homeowners and thus have a sense of ownership and emotional investment .
That 's another part of what has caused this sea change in thinking .
From TIC ( tenants in common ) units , to condominiums , to luxury townhouses , the city has created the potential for an influx of buyers , despite the downward trend in home sales in much of the country .
Cathy Pickering , assistant project manager for the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency , suggests a look to South of Market , which is within Newsom 's pilot program to issue citations to vagrants on the sidewalks and streets .
What once was an area of old warehouses now is booming .
" As you travel around South of Market , " she says , " there is no doubt there has been a huge increase in residents . "
Some of them are young couples , able to buy into their first home .
And some might be empty nesters who have sold their home in the suburbs , following the national trend and moving to an urban center .
But either way , they can understand the objections of a father like Kiely .
" We go out to drive the kids to school , " he says , " and there 's human poop between the cars . "
There must be many who are as fed up as Kiely , because politicians like Newsom are taking a tough stand .
In an election year , you can bet he would n't go out on an unpopular limb .
Now it will be interesting to see how the Board of Supervisors , traditionally progressive and more pro-homeless people , will react .
One proposal that could come from the Newsom administration is some form of a " sit- lie " law .
Rhorer says the idea is " that you can't be in the same place on the sidewalk for longer than a certain time . "
( Even Berkeley has a version of that for Telegraph Avenue . )
That would create howls of protests from the advocates for homeless people ( and it should be said that such laws have had mixed success ) , but usual arguments against strong action against vagrants might not be as effective with the new mind - set of city residents .
" This is n't the war in the Iraq , " says Latterman .
" We 've been fed that line for a long time .
If you support this , you 're a Bush supporter .
You 're a fascist .
Maybe people are fed up with that . "

 Democrats who captured control of the House last year after a 12 - year hiatus are dominating the first clash of the 2008 elections : the money race .
The most vulnerable House Democrats — freshmen who won in districts that went for President Bush in 2004 — raised an average of $ 600,000 in the first six months of this year , according to campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission .
That 's nearly double what Republican freshmen raised .
If the trend continues , it will make it difficult for the GOP to reduce Democrats ' 231-202 House majority .
DEMS RAISE BIG : House Dems go on fundraising offense for 2008 TABLE : Total raised by new members " Our goal is to put our members in the strongest position as possible , as quickly as possible , " said Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D - Md. , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
" We are right on target . "
The 42 Democratic freshmen raised an average of $ 1.8 million to win election in November , half of them in Bush districts .
Four raised more than $ 3 million .
This year , they have picked up where they left off : •
The median amount raised by Democratic freshmen is $ 503,643 , compared to $ 203,988 by the 13 GOP freshmen .
• Fourteen freshman Democrats have raised more than the $ 600,000 six - month goal set by Van Hollen .
Only one Republican freshman , Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida , has raised that much .
• Five Democrats who won in 2006 with just 50 % of the vote have raised an average of $ 711,000 .
•
Three have raised more than $ 1 million : Reps.
Kirsten Gillibrand of New York , Ron Klein of Florida and Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania .
" Democrats are energized and organized , and that 's leading to big fundraising , " said Nathan Gonzales of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report .
Ken Spain of the National Republican Congressional Committee downplayed the Democrats ' dollars .
" If their goal is to scare off Republican challengers , then they have failed miserably , " he said .
Democrats came to power partly by advocating ethics changes .
Still , about 45 % of their money is coming from political action committees , not individuals .
" Given the system that exists , this is what happens , " said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 , which supports public financing of elections .

One of the " holy grails " of 3d computer animation is , of course , creating a lifelike human face with realistic looking hair and features .
These computer - constructed images would be so realistic , that it would be impossible or very difficult to discern the animated model from a digital photograph of a real person .
In animation circles , they call this " photo realism " .
One of the secrets of photo realism is making " virtual skin " look realistic by manipulating how light interacts with natural skin .
Light tends to penetrate our skin , just below the surface , and scatter at different points .
It does not just bounce off the surface like it does with plastic , metal , etc .

According to
The FLIP research vessel ( Floating Instrument Platform ) is the only ship in the world having the ability to flip from a horizontal position to a vertical position while at sea .
The FLIP ship is designed to study wave height , acoustic signals , water temperature and density , and for the collection of meteorological data .
FLIP is 108 meters long and weighs 700 long tons .
According to Alan Bellows , " when in horizontal traveling mode , the long , hollow ballast area trails behind .
When it reaches the desired location , the " tail " is flooded until the nose sticks straight up into the air , taking about twenty - eight minutes to reach vertical position " .
You can see the process in this video :
Even in stormy conditions , it is as stable as a fencepost , because most of its length lies in the untroubled waters beneath the waves .
During the flip , the crew stand on the outside decks .
Scientists and crewmembers literally walk up the walls to stay upright .
Suddenly , the aft side of the barge becomes its floor .
That makes for some ingenious engineering feats in equipping its bridge , galley , crew quarters and scientific laboratory .
Even its head , or bathroom , had to be constructed to operate in a vertical and horizontal position .
As you can see in the video , some of FLIP 's furnishings are also built so they can rotate to a new position .
In 1995 , FLIP received a $ 2,000,000 modernization .
The structural build is currently excellent and instrumentation will allow FLIP to be an oceanographic powerhouse in the future .

July 25 , 2007  -- Lawsuits could be putting " Ladies ' Nights " at bars and clubs across the country on the rocks .
In about two dozen cases , plaintiffs contend these drink and admission deals for women constitute discrimination against men and should be banned .
Roy Den Hollander is a New York lawyer who says Ladies '
Night drinks and admission specials are unconstitutional , and he says he 's suffered personally .
Hollander is also a graduate of Columbia Business School and seems like a guy who should be able to get into a decent bar and afford the drinks .
So what irks him ?
" I 'm tired of having my rights violated and being treated as a second - class citizen , " said Hollander , who is seeking class - action status for his suit in federal court .
Tim Gleason , general manager of the China Club in New York , calls Hollander 's complaint " pathetic " and echoes other club owners who argue that the discounts actually help both sexes by balancing out the ratio between men and women .
Nevermind that some men are more than happy to pay for inequality in the ratio department .
Over the last 30 years , lawsuits stemming from promotions involving Ladies '
Night have enjoyed considerable success in courts across the country where judges have held that single - sex discounts violate state and federal statutes guaranteeing equal protection under the law .
George Washington University law professor John Banzhaf , whose students have brought a Ladies '
Night suit , says that these promotions are part of a broader class of gender - based price discrimination tactics like those used by hairdressers and dry cleaners who charge men and women different prices for the same service .
In Washington , D.C. , he hopes to pursue what he calls restroom equity or " squatter 's rights " in which he will sue public venues whose restroom availability , though seemingly equal for both sexes , has a " disparate impact " on women who must deal with longer lines and wait times .
Nightclub spokespersons and activists express concern that a class - action victory in a Ladies '
Night lawsuit based on federal law could open the floodgates to a host of other suits against private businesses .
Kiss Ladies ' Night Goodbye ?
Hollander seeks to be the lead plaintiff and the representing attorney in a class - action suit against several Manhattan venues including the China Club , Copacabana Nightclub , A.E.R. Nightclub and Sol .
As a patron of these venues , he alleges that Ladies '
Night discounts violate the 14th Amendment that guarantees equal protection to " similarly situated " persons .
But are men and women really similarly situated in the dating marketplace ?
The law is one thing , but the mating game has its own set of intrinsic rules .
So where should the line be drawn ?
Basic Supreme
Court case law says a state cannot discriminate unless it is for an important reason like public health and safety .
Hollander argues the clubs have no legitimate reason for treating males and females differently in their admission policies .
" This is a constitutional - question suit , which means if I win , in theory any guy in America could bring a similar suit and use this as persuasive precedent , " he said .
Legal analysts say Hollander 's claim may be difficult to prove .
He will have to demonstrate that there is a genuine constitutional issue .
In court papers , he cites a 1970 case against a bar called McSorley 's Old Ale House .
The ruling in the case struck down a policy excluding women , claiming it violated the Constitution 's guarantee of equal protection .
Club owners maintain that Ladies '
Night is not a policy of exclusion , but rather an economic enticement to increase business and satisfy their customers .
They say the marketplace dictates whether the promotions are abandoned , not the courts .
" Ladies '
Night benefits the men as much as it benefits the ladies , the clubs and society , " said John Juliano , owner of the recently closed Copacabana Nightclub .
" And the only loser here is this grouch with a warped point of view . "
But , Hollander said these perks do not justify discriminatory prices because the same beneficial end could be achieved by charging men less or equal to the amount women are charged .
" Each guy that walks into that club will have more money to buy her a drink , and the more she drinks , the more fun she and the guys will have , " he said .
Ladies ' Night Lawsuits
The recent slew of Ladies ' Night lawsuits dates back to a 1972 case against the New York Yankees .
A lot fewer women were going to games than men .
The Yankees gave discounts on special " Ladies " games .
An angry male fan sued and a court ruled the practice was illegal .
The Seattle Sonics basketball team was also sued in 1981 by a man who alleged discrimination because he was forced to pay full price for a ticket while his wife paid half .
In that case the court ruled that the purpose of the promotion was " not to exclude anyone but to encourage attendance . "
In recent years , Ladies '
Night promotions have been the subject of litigation in California , New Jersey and New York , where the state - level courts consistently have ruled against Ladies '
Night promotions .

WHEN a majority of Supreme Court justices adopt a manifestly ideological agenda , it plunges the court into the vortex of American politics .
If the Roberts court has entered voluntarily what Justice Felix Frankfurter once called the “ political thicket , ” it may require a political solution to set it straight .
The framers of the Constitution did not envisage the Supreme Court as arbiter of all national issues .
As Chief Justice John Marshall made clear in Marbury v. Madison , the court ’s authority extends only to legal issues .
When the court overreaches , the Constitution provides checks and balances .
In 1805 , after persistent political activity by Justice Samuel Chase , Congress responded with its power of impeachment .
Chase was acquitted , but never again did he step across the line to mingle law and politics .
After the Civil War , when a Republican Congress feared the court might tamper with Reconstruction in the South , it removed those questions from the court ’s appellate jurisdiction .
But the method most frequently employed to bring the court to heel has been increasing or decreasing its membership .
The size of the Supreme Court is not fixed by the Constitution .
It is determined by Congress .

I. Introduction
In contrast to older historians who regarded World War I as the destruction of progressive reform , I am convinced that the war came to the United States as the " fulfillment , " the culmination , the veritable apotheosis of progressivism in American life . [ 1 ]
I regard progressivism as basically a movement on behalf of Big Government in all walks of the economy and society , in a fusion or coalition between various groups of big businessmen , led by the House of Morgan , and rising groups of technocratic and statist intellectuals .
In this fusion , the values and interests of both groups would be pursued through government .
Big business would be able to use the government to cartelize the economy , restrict competition , and regulate production and prices , and also to be able to wield a militaristic and imperialist foreign policy to force open markets abroad and apply the sword of the State to protect foreign investments .
Intellectuals would be able to use the government to restrict entry into their professions and to assume jobs in Big Government to apologize for , and to help plan and staff , government operations .
Both groups also believed that , in this fusion , the Big State could be used to harmonize and interpret the " national interest " and thereby provide a " middle way " between the extremes of " dog- eat - dog " laissez faire and the bitter conflicts of proletarian Marxism .
Also animating both groups of progressives was a postmillennial pietist Protestantism that had conquered " Yankee " areas of northern Protestantism by the 1830s and had impelled the pietists to use local , state , and finally federal governments to stamp out " sin , " to make America and eventually the world holy , and thereby to bring about the Kingdom of God on earth .
The victory of the Bryanite forces at the Democratic national convention of 1896 destroyed the Democratic Party as the vehicle of " liturgical " Roman Catholics and German Lutherans devoted to personal liberty and laissez faire and created the roughly homogenized and relatively non-ideological party system we have today .
After the turn of the century , this development created an ideological and power vacuum for the expanding number of progressive technocrats and administrators to fill .
In that way , the locus of government shifted from the legislature , at least partially subject to democratic check , to the oligarchic and technocratic executive branch .
World War I brought the fulfillment of all these progressive trends .
Militarism , conscription , massive intervention at home and abroad , a collectivized war economy , all came about during the war and created a mighty cartelized system that most of its leaders spent the rest of their lives trying to recreate , in peace as well as war .
In the World War I chapter of his outstanding work , Crisis and Leviathan , Professor Robert Higgs concentrates on the war economy and illuminates the interconnections with conscription .
In this paper , I would like to concentrate on an area that Professor Higgs relatively neglects : the coming to power during the war of the various groups of progressive intellectuals . [ 2 ]
I use the term " intellectual " in the broad sense penetratingly described by F.A.
Hayek : that is , not merely theorists and academicians , but also all manner of opinion - molders in society — writers , journalists , preachers , scientists , activists of all sort — what Hayek calls " secondhand dealers in ideas . " [ 3 ]
Most of these intellectuals , of whatever strand or occupation , were either dedicated , messianic postmillennial pietists or else former pietists , born in a deeply pietist home , who , though now secularized , still possessed an intense messianic belief in national and world salvation through Big Government .
But , in addition , oddly but characteristically , most combined in their thought and agitation messianic moral or religious fervor with an empirical , allegedly " value - free , " and strictly " scientific " devotion to social science .
Whether it be the medical profession 's combined scientific and moralistic devotion to stamping out sin or a similar position among economists or philosophers , this blend is typical of progressive intellectuals .
In this paper , I will be dealing with various examples of individual or groups of progressive intellectuals , exulting in the triumph of their creed and their own place in it , as a result of America 's entry into World War I .
Unfortunately , limitations of space and time preclude dealing with all facets of the wartime activity of progressive intellectuals ; in particular , I regret having to omit treatment of the conscription movement , a fascinating example of the creed of the " therapy " of " discipline " led by upper - class intellectuals and businessmen in the J.P. Morgan ambit . [ 4 ]
I shall also have to omit both the highly significant trooping to the war colors of the nation 's preachers , and the wartime impetus toward the permanent centralization of scientific research . [ 5 ]
There is no better epigraph for the remainder of this paper than a congratulatory note sent to President Wilson after the delivery of his war message on April 2 , 1917 .
The note was sent by Wilson 's son-in - law and fellow Southern pietist and progressive , Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo , a man who had spent his entire life as an industrialist in New York City , solidly in the J.P. Morgan ambit .
McAdoo wrote to Wilson : " You have done a great thing nobly !
I firmly believe that it is God 's will that America should do this transcendent service for humanity throughout the world and that you are His chosen instrument . " [ 6 ]
It was not a sentiment with which the president could disagree .
II . Pietism and Prohibition
One of the few important omissions in Professor Higgs 's book is the crucial role of postmillennial pietist Protestantism in the drive toward statism in the United States .
Dominant in the " Yankee " areas of the North from the 1830s on , the aggressive " evangelical " form of pietism conquered Southern Protestantism by the 1890s and played a crucial role in progressivism after the turn of the century and through World War I .
Evangelical pietism held that requisite to any man 's salvation is that he do his best to see to it that everyone else is saved , and doing one 's best inevitably meant that the State must become a crucial instrument in maximizing people 's chances for salvation .
In particular , the State plays a pivotal role in stamping out sin , and in " making America holy . "
To the pietists , sin was very broadly defined as any force that might cloud men's minds so that they could not exercise their theological free will to achieve salvation .
Of particular importance were slavery ( until the Civil War ) , Demon Rum , and the Roman Catholic Church , headed by the Antichrist in Rome .
For decades after the Civil War , " rebellion " took the place of slavery in the pietist charges against their great political enemy , the Democratic party . [ 7 ]
Then in 1896 , with the evangelical conversion of Southern Protestantism and the admission to the Union of the sparsely populated and pietist Mountain states , William Jennings Bryan was able to put together a coalition that transformed the Democrats into a pietist party and ended forever that party 's once proud role as the champion of " liturgical " ( Catholic and High German Lutheran ) Christianity and of personal liberty and laissez faire . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
The pietists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were all postmillennialist :
They believed that the Second Advent of Christ will occur only after the millennium — a thousand years of the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth — has been brought about by human effort .
Postmillennialists have therefore tended to be statists , with the State becoming an important instrument of stamping out sin and Christianizing the social order so as to speed Jesus ' return . [ 10 ]
Professor Timberlake neatly sums up this politico - religious conflict :
Unlike those extremist and apocalyptic sects that rejected and withdrew from the world as hopelessly corrupt , and unlike the more conservative churches , such as the Roman Catholic , Protestant Episcopal , and Lutheran , that tended to assume a more relaxed attitude toward the influence of religion in culture , evangelical Protestantism sought to overcome the corruption of the world in a dynamic manner , not only by converting men to belief in Christ but also by Christianizing the social order through the power and force of law .
According to this view , the Christian 's duty was to use the secular power of the state to transform culture so that the community of the faithful might be kept pure and the work of saving the unregenerate might be made easier .
Thus the function of law was not simply to restrain evil but to educate and uplift . [ 11 ]
Both prohibition and progressive reform were pietistic , and as both movements expanded after 1900 they became increasingly intertwined .
The Prohibition Party , once confined — at least in its platform — to a single issue , became increasingly and frankly progressive after 1904 .
The Anti-Saloon League , the major vehicle for prohibitionist agitation after 1900 , was also markedly devoted to progressive reform .
Thus at the League 's annual convention in 1905 , Rev. Howard H. Russell rejoiced in the growing movement for progressive reform and particularly hailed Theodore Roosevelt , as that " leader of heroic mould , of absolute honesty of character and purity of life , that foremost man of this world … . " [ 12 ]
At the Anti-Saloon League 's convention of 1909 , Rev. Purley A. Baker lauded the labor union movement as a holy crusade for justice and a square deal .
The League 's 1915 convention , which attracted 10,000 people , was noted for the same blend of statism , social service , and combative Christianity that had marked the national convention of the Progressive Party in 1912 . [ 13 ]
And at the League 's June 1916 convention , Bishop Luther B. Wilson stated , without contradiction , that everyone present would undoubtedly hail the progressive reforms then being proposed .
During the Progressive years , the Social Gospel became part of the mainstream of pietist Protestantism .
Most of the evangelical churches created commissions on social service to promulgate the Social Gospel , and virtually all of the denominations adopted the Social Creed drawn up in 1912 by the Commission of the Church and Social Service of the Federal Council of Churches .
The creed called for the abolition of child labor , the regulation of female labor , the right of labor to organize ( i.e. , compulsory collective bargaining ) , the elimination of poverty , and an " equitable " division of the national product .
And right up there as a matter of social concern was the liquor problem .
The creed maintained that liquor was a grave hindrance toward the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth , and it advocated the " protection of the individual and society from the social , economic , and moral waste of the liquor traffic . [ 14 ]
The Social Gospel leaders were fervent advocates of statism and of prohibition .
These included Rev. Walter Rauschenbusch and Rev. Charles Stelzle , whose tract Why Prohibition ! ( 1918 ) was distributed , after the United States ' entry into World War I , by the Commission on Temperance of the Federal Council of Churches to labor leaders , members of Congress , and important government officials .
A particularly important Social Gospel leader was Rev. Josiah Strong , whose monthly journal , The Gospel of the Kingdom , was published by Strong 's American Institute of Social Service .
In an article supporting prohibition in the July 1914 issue , The Gospel of the Kingdom hailed the progressive spirit that was at last putting an end to " personal liberty " :
" Personal Liberty " is at last an uncrowned , dethroned king , with no one to do him reverence .
The social consciousness is so far developed .
and is becoming so autocratic , that institutions and governments must give heed to its mandate and share their life accordingly .
We are no longer frightened by that ancient bogy — " paternalism in government . "
We affirm boldly , it is the business of government to be just that — Paternal .
Nothing human can be foreign to a true government . [ 15 ]
As true crusaders , the pietists were not content to stop with the stamping out of sin in the United States alone .
If American pietism was convinced that Americans were God 's chosen people , destined to establish a Kingdom of God within the United States , surely the pietists ' religious and moral duty could not stop there .
In a sense , the world was America 's oyster .
As Professor Timberlake put it , once the Kingdom of God was in the course of being established in the United States , " it was therefore America 's mission to spread these ideals and institutions abroad so that the Kingdom could be established throughout the world .
American Protestants were accordingly not content merely to work for the kingdom of God in America , but felt compelled to assist in the reformation of the rest of the world also . " [ 16 ]
American entry into World War I provided the fulfillment of prohibitionist dreams .
In the first place , all food production was placed under the control of Herbert Hoover , Food Administration czar .
But if the US government was to control and allocate food resources , shall it permit the precious scarce supply of grain to be siphoned off into the " waste , " if not the sin , of the manufacture of liquor ?
Even though less than two percent of American cereal production went into the manufacture of alcohol , think of the starving children of the world who might otherwise be fed .
As the progressive weekly The Independent demagogically phrased it .
" Shall the many have food , or the few have drink ? "
For the ostensible purpose of " conserving " grain , Congress wrote an amendment into the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act of August 10 , 1917 , that absolutely prohibited the use of foodstuffs , hence grain , in the production of alcohol .
Congress would have added a prohibition on the manufacture of wine or beer , but President Wilson persuaded the Anti-Saloon League that he could accomplish the same goal more slowly and thereby avoid a delaying filibuster by the wets in Congress .
However , Herbert Hoover , a progressive and a prohibitionist , persuaded Wilson to issue an order , on December 8 , both greatly reducing the alcoholic content of beer and limiting the amount of foodstuffs that could be used in its manufacture . [ 17 ]
The prohibitionists were able to use the Lever Act and war patriotism to good effect .
Thus , Mrs. W. E. Lindsey , wife of the governor of New Mexico , delivered a speech in November 1917 that noted the Lever Act , and declared :
Aside from the long list of awful tragedies following in the wake of the liquor traffic , the economic waste is too great to be tolerated at this time .
With so many people of the allied nations near to the door of starvation , it would be criminal ingratitude for us to continue the manufacture of whiskey . [ 18 ]
Another rationale for prohibition during the war was the alleged necessity to protect American soldiers from the dangers of alcohol to their health , their morals , and their immortal souls .
As a result , in the Selective Service Act of May 18 , 1917 , Congress provided that dry zones must be established around every army base , and it was made illegal to sell or even to give liquor to any member of the military establishment within those zones , even in one 's private home .
Any inebriated servicemen were subject to courts - martial .
But the most severe thrust toward national prohibition was the Anti-Saloon League 's proposed eighteenth constitutional amendment , outlawing the manufacture , sale , transportation , import or export of all intoxicating liquors .
It was passed by Congress and submitted to the states at the end of December 1917 .
Wet arguments that prohibition would prove unenforceable were met with the usual dry appeal to high principle :
Should laws against murder and robbery he repealed simply because they cannot be completely enforced ?
And arguments that private property would be unjustly confiscated were also brushed aside with the contention that property injurious to the health , morals , and safety of the people had always been subject to confiscation without compensation .
When the Lever Act made a distinction between hard liquor ( forbidden ) and beer and wine ( limited ) , the brewing industry tried to save their skins by cutting themselves loose from the taint of distilled spirits .
" The true relationship with beer , " insisted the United States Brewers Association , " is with light wines and soft drinks - not with hard liquors . "
The brewers affirmed their desire to " sever , once for all , the shackles that bound our wholesome productions to ardent spirits . "
But this craven attitude would do the brewers no good .
After all , one of the major objectives of the drys was to smash the brewers , once and for all , they whose product was the very embodiment of the drinking habits of the hated German - American masses , both Catholic and Lutheran , liturgicals and beer drinkers all .
German - Americans were now fair game .
Were they not all agents of the satanic Kaiser , bent on conquering the world ?
Were they not conscious agents of the dreaded Hun Kultur , out to destroy American civilization ?
And were not most brewers German ?
And so the Anti-Saloon League thundered that " German brewers in this country have rendered thousands of men inefficient and are thus crippling the Republic in its war on Prussian militarism . "
Apparently , the Anti-Saloon League took no heed of the work of German brewers in Germany , who were presumably performing the estimable service of rendering " Prussian militarism " helpless .
The brewers were accused of being pro-German , and of subsidizing the press ( apparently it was all right to be pro-English or to subsidize the press if one were not a brewer ) .
The acme of the accusations came from one prohibitionist : " We have German enemies , " he warned , " in this country too .
And the worst of all our German enemies , the most treacherous , the most menacing are Pabst , Schlitz , Blatz , and Miller . " [ 19 ]
In this sort of atmosphere , the brewers did n't have a chance , and the Eighteenth Amendment went to the states , outlawing all forms of liquor .
Since twenty - seven states had already outlawed liquor , this meant that only nine more were needed to ratify this remarkable amendment , which directly involved the federal constitution in what had always been , at most , a matter of police power of the states .
The thirty - sixth state ratified the Eighteenth Amendment on January 16 , 1919 , and by the end of February all but three states ( New Jersey , Rhode Island , and Connecticut ) had made liquor unconstitutional as well as illegal .
Technically , the amendment went into force the following January , but Congress speeded matters up by passing the War Prohibition Act of November 11 , 1918 , which banned the manufacture of beer and wine after the following May and outlawed the sale of all intoxicating beverages after June 30 , 1919 , a ban to continue in effect until the end of demobilization .
Thus total national prohibition really began on July 1 , 1919 , with the Eighteenth Amendment taking over six months later .
The constitutional amendment needed a congressional enforcing act , which Congress supplied with the Volstead ( or National Prohibition ) Act , passed over Wilson 's veto at the end of October 1919 .
With the battle against Demon Rum won at home , the restless advocates of pietist prohibitionism looked for new lands to conquer .
Today America , tomorrow the world .
In June 1919 the triumphant Anti-Saloon League called an international prohibition conference in Washington and created a World League Against Alcoholism .
World prohibition , after all , was needed to finish the job of making the world safe for democracy .
The prohibitionists ' goals were fervently expressed by Rev. A.C. Bane at the Anti-Saloon League 's 1917 convention , when victory in America was already in sight .
To a wildly cheering throng , Bane thundered :
America will " go over the top " in humanity 's greatest battle [ against liquor ] and plant the victorious white standard of Prohibition upon the nation 's loftiest eminence .
Then catching sight of the beckoning hand of our sister nations across the sea , struggling with the same age - long foe , we will go forth with the spirit of the missionary and the crusader to help drive the demon of drink from all civilization .
With America leading the way , with faith in Omnipotent God , and bearing with patriotic hands our stainless flag , the emblem of civic purity , we will soon bestow upon mankind the priceless gift of World Prohibition . [ 20 ]
Fortunately , the prohibitionists found the reluctant world a tougher nut to crack .
III .
Women at War and at the Polls
Another direct outgrowth of World War I , coming in tandem with prohibition but lasting more permanently , was the Nineteenth Amendment , submitted by Congress in 1919 and ratified by the following year , which allowed women to vote .
Women 's suffrage had long been a movement directly allied with prohibition .
Desperate to combat a demographic trend that seemed to be going against them , the evangelical pietists called for women 's suffrage ( and enacted it in many Western states ) .
They did so because they knew that while pietist women were socially and politically active , ethnic or liturgical women tended to be culturally bound to hearth and home and therefore far less likely to vote .
Hence , women 's suffrage would greatly increase pietist voting power .
In 1869 the Prohibitionist Party became the first party to endorse women 's suffrage , which it continued to do .
The Progressive Party was equally enthusiastic about female suffrage ; it was the first major national party to permit women delegates at its conventions .
A leading women 's suffrage organization was the Women 's Christian Temperance Union , which reached an enormous membership of 300,000 by 1900 .
And three successive presidents of the major women 's suffrage group , the National American Woman Suffrage Association — Susan B. Anthony , Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt , and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw — all began their activist careers as prohibitionists .
Susan B . Anthony put the issue clearly :
There is an enemy of the homes of this nation and that enemy is drunkenness .
Everyone connected with the gambling house , the brothel and the saloon works and votes solidly against the enfranchisement of women , and , I say , if you believe in chastity , if you believe in honesty and integrity , then take the necessary steps to put the ballot in the hands of women . [ 21 ]
For its part , the German - American Alliance of Nebraska sent out an appeal during the unsuccessful referendum in November 1914 on women suffrage .
Written in German , the appeal declared , " Our German women do not want the right to vote , and since our opponents desire the right of suffrage mainly for the purpose of saddling the yoke of prohibition on our necks , we should oppose it with all our might … . " [ 22 ]
America 's entry into World War I provided the impetus for overcoming the substantial opposition to woman suffrage , as a corollary to the success of prohibition and as a reward for the vigorous activity by organized women in behalf of the war effort .
To close the loop , much of that activity consisted in stamping out vice and alcohol as well as instilling " patriotic " education into the minds of often suspect immigrant groups .
Shortly after the US declaration of war , the Council of National Defense created an Advisory Committee on Women 's Defense Work , known as the Woman 's Committee .
The purpose of the committee , writes a celebratory contemporary account , was " to coordinate the activities and the resources of the organized and unorganized women of the country , that their power may be immediately utilized in time of need , and to supply a new and direct channel of cooperation between women and governmental department . " [ 23 ]
Chairman of the Woman 's Committee , working energetically and full time , was the former president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association , Dr. Anna Howard Shaw , and another leading member was the suffrage group 's current chairman and an equally prominent suffragette , Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt .
The Woman 's Committee promptly set up organizations in cities and states across the country , and on June 19 , 1917 convened a conference of over fifty national women 's organizations to coordinate their efforts .
It was at this conference that " the first definite task was imposed upon American women " by the indefatigable Food Czar , Herbert Hoover . [ 24 ]
Hoover enlisted the cooperation of the nation 's women in his ambitious campaign for controlling , restricting , and cartelizing the food industry in the name of " conservation " and elimination of " waste . "
Celebrating this coming together of women was one of the Woman 's Committee members , the Progressive writer and muckraker Mrs. Ida M. Tarbell .
Mrs. Tarbell lauded the " growing consciousness everywhere that this great enterprise for democracy which we are launching [ the US entry into the war ] is a national affair , and if an individual or a society is going to do its bit it must act with and under the government at Washington . "
" Nothing else , " Mrs. Tarbell gushed , " can explain the action of the women of the country in coming together as they are doing today under one centralized direction . " [ 25 ]
Mrs. Tarbell 's enthusiasm might have been heightened by the fact that she was one of the directing rather than the directed .
Herbert Hoover came to the women 's conference with the proposal that each of the women sign and distribute a " food pledge card " on behalf of food conservation .
While support for the food pledge among the public was narrower than anticipated , educational efforts to promote the pledge became the basis of the remainder of the women 's conservation campaign .
The Woman 's Committee appointed Mrs. Tarbell as chairman of its committee on Food Administration , and she not only tirelessly organized the campaign but also wrote many letters and newspaper and magazine articles on its behalf .
In addition to food control , another important and immediate function of the Woman 's Committee was to attempt to register every woman in the country for possible volunteer or paid work in support of the war effort .
Every woman aged sixteen or over was asked to sign and submit a registration card with all pertinent information , including training , experience , and the sort of work desired .
In that way the government would know the whereabouts and training of every woman , and government and women could then serve each other best .
In many states , especially Ohio and Illinois , state governments set up schools to train the registrars .
And even though the Woman 's Committee kept insisting that the registration was completely voluntary , the state of Louisiana , as Ida Clarke puts it , developed a " novel and clever " idea to facilitate the program : women 's registration was made compulsory .
Louisiana 's Governor Ruftin G. Pleasant decreed October 17 , 1917 compulsory registration day , and a host of state officials collaborated in its operation .
The State Food Commission made sure that food pledges were also signed by all , and the State School Board granted a holiday on October 17 so that teachers could assist in the compulsory registration , especially in the rural districts .
Six thousand women were officially commissioned by the state of Louisiana to conduct the registration , and they worked in tandem with state Food Conservation officials and parish Demonstration Agents .
In the French areas of the state , the Catholic priests rendered valuable aid in personally appealing to all their female parishioners to perform their registration duties .
Handbills were circulated in French , house - to - house canvasses were made , and speeches urging registration were made by women activists in movie theaters , schools , churches , and courthouses .
We are informed that all responses were eager and cordial ; there is no mention of any resistance .
We are also advised that " even the negroes were quite alive to the situation , meeting sometimes with the white people and sometimes at the call of their own pastors . " [ 26 ]
Also helping out in women 's registration and food control was another , smaller , but slightly more sinister women 's organization that had been launched by Congress as a sort of prewar wartime group at a large Congress for Constructive Patriotism , held in Washington , D.C. in late January 1917 .
This was the National League for Woman 's Service ( NLWS ) , which established a nationwide organization later overshadowed and overlapped by the larger Woman 's Committee .
The difference was that the NLWS was set up on quite frankly military lines .
Each local working unit was called a " detachment " under a " detachment commander , " district - wide and state - wide detachments met in annual " encampments , " and every woman member was to wear a uniform with an organization badge and insignia .
In particular , " the basis of training for all detachments is standardized , physical drill . " [ 27 ]
A vital part of the Woman 's Committee work was engaging in " patriotic education . "
The government and the Woman 's Committee recognized that immigrant ethnic women were most in need of such vital instruction , and so it set up a committee on education , headed by the energetic Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt .
Mrs. Catt stated the problem well to the Woman 's Committee : Millions of people in the United States were unclear on why we were at war , and why , as Ida Clarke paraphrases Mrs. Can , there is " the imperative necessity of winning the war if future generations were to be protected from the menace of an unscrupulous militarism . " [ 28 ]
Presumably US militarism , being " scrupulous , " posed no problem .
Apathy and ignorance abounded , Mrs. Catt went on , and she proposed to mobilize twenty million American women , the " greatest sentiment makers of any community , " to begin a " vast educational movement " to get the women " fervently enlisted to push the war to victory as rapidly as possible . "
As Mrs. Catt continued , however , the clarity of war aims she called for really amounted to pointing out that we were in the war " whether the nation likes it or does not like it , " and that therefore the " sacrifices " needed to win the war " willingly or unwillingly must be made . "
These statements are reminiscent of arguments supporting recent military actions by Ronald Reagan ( " He had to do what he had to do " ) .
In the end , Mrs. Catt could come up with only one reasoned argument for the war , apart from this alleged necessity , that it must be won to make it " the war to end war . " [ 29 ]
The " patriotic education " campaign of the organized women was largely to " Americanize " immigrant women by energetically persuading them ( a ) to become naturalized American citizens and ( b ) to learn " Mother English . "
In the campaign , dubbed " America First , " national unity was promoted through getting immigrants to learn English and trying to get female immigrants into afternoon or evening English classes .
The organized patriot women were also worried about preserving the family structure of the immigrants .
If the children learn English and their parents remain ignorant , children will scorn their elders , " parental discipline and control are dissipated , and the whole family fabric becomes weakened .
Thus one of the great conservative forces in the community becomes inoperative . "
To preserve " maternal control of the young , " then , " Americanization of the foreign women through language becomes imperative . "
In Erie , Pennsylvania , women 's clubs appointed " Block Matrons , " whose job it was to get to know the foreign families of the neighborhood and to back up school authorities in urging the immigrants to learn English , and who , in the rather naive words of Ida Clarke , " become neighbors , friends , and veritable mother confessors to the foreign women of the block . "
One would like to have heard some comments from recipients of the attentions of the Block Matrons .
All in all , as a result of the Americanization campaign , Ida Clarke concludes , " the organized women of this country can play an important part in making ours a country with a common language , a common purpose , a common set of ideals — a unified America . " [ 30 ]
Neither did the government and its organized women neglect progressive economic reforms .
At the organizing June 1917 conference of the Woman 's Committee , Mrs. Carrie Catt emphasized that the greatest problem of the war was to assure that women receive " equal pay for equal work . "
The conference suggested that vigilance committees be established to guard against the violation of " ethical laws " governing labor and also that all laws restricting ( " protecting " ) the labor of women and children be rigorously enforced .
Apparently , there were some values to which maximizing production for the war effort had to take second place .
Mrs. Margaret Dreier Robins , president of the National Women 's Trade Union 's League , hailed the fact that the Woman 's Committee was organizing committees in every state to protect minimum standards for women and children 's labor in industry and demanded minimum wages and shorter hours for women .
Mrs. Robins particularly warned that " not only are unorganized women workers in vast numbers used as underbidders in the labor market for lowering industrial standards , but they are related to those groups in industrial centers of our country that are least Americanized and most alien to our institutions and ideals . "
And so " Americanization " and cartelization of female labor went hand in hand . [ 31 ] [ 32 ]
IV .
Saving Our Boys from Alcohol and Vice
One of organized womanhood 's major contributions to the war effort was to collaborate in an attempt to save American soldiers from vice and Demon Rum .
In addition to establishing rigorous dry zones around every military camp in the United States , the Selective Service Act of May 1917 also outlawed prostitution in wide zones around the military camps .
To enforce these provisions , the War Department had ready at hand a Commission on Training Camp Activities , an agency soon imitated by the Department of the Navy .
Both commissions were headed by a man tailor - made for the job , the progressive New York settlement - house worker , municipal political reformer , and former student and disciple of Woodrow Wilson , Raymond Blaine Fosdick .
Fosdick 's background , life , and career were paradigmatic for progressive intellectuals and activists of that era .
Fosdick 's ancestors were Yankees from Massachusetts and Connecticut , and his great - grandfather pioneered westward in a covered wagon to become a frontier farmer in the heart of the Burned - Over District of transplanted Yankees , Buffalo , New York .
Fosdick 's grandfather , a pietist lay preacher born again in a Baptist revival , was a prohibitionist who married a preacher 's daughter and became a lifelong public school teacher in Buffalo .
Grandfather Fosdick rose to become Superintendent of Education in Buffalo and a battler for an expanded and strengthened public school system .
Fosdick 's immediate ancestry continued in the same vein .
His father was a public school teacher in Buffalo who rose to become principal of a high school .
His mother was deeply pietist and a staunch advocate of prohibition and women 's suffrage .
Fosdick 's father was a devout pietist Protestant and a " fanatical " Republican who gave his son Raymond the middle name of his hero , the veteran Maine Republican James G. Blaine .
The three Fosdick children , elder brother Harry Emerson , Raymond , and Raymond 's twin sister , Edith , on emerging from this atmosphere , all forged lifetime careers of pietism and social service .
While active in New York reform administration , Fosdick made a fateful friendship .
In 1910 , John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , like his father a pietist Baptist , was chairman of a special grand jury to investigate and to try to stamp out prostitution in New York City .
For Rockefeller , the elimination of prostitution was to become an ardent and lifelong crusade .
He believed that sin , such as prostitution , must be criminated , quarantined , and driven underground through rigorous suppression .
In 1911 , Rockefeller began his crusade by setting up the Bureau of Social Hygiene , into which he poured $ 5 million in the next quarter century .
Two years later he enlisted Fosdick , already a speaker at the annual dinner of Rockefeller 's Baptist Bible class , to study police systems in Europe in conjunction with activities to end the great " social vice . "
Surveying American police after his stint in Europe at Rockefeller 's behest , Fosdick was appalled that police work in the United States was not considered a " science " and that it was subject to " sordid " political influences . [ 33 ]
At that point , the new Secretary of War , the progressive former mayor of Cleveland Newton D. Baker , became disturbed at reports that areas near the army camps in Texas on the Mexican border , where troops were mobilized to combat the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa , were honeycombed with saloons and prostitution .
Sent by Baker on a fact - finding tour in the summer of 1916 , scoffed at by tough army officers as the " Reverend , " Fosdick was horrified to find saloons and brothels seemingly everywhere in the vicinity of the military camps .
He reported his consternation to Baker , and , at Fosdick 's suggestion , Baker cracked down on the army commanders and their lax attitude toward alcohol and vice .
But Fosdick was beginning to get the glimmer of another idea .
Could n't the suppression of the bad be accompanied by a positive encouragement of the good , of wholesome recreational alternatives to sin and liquor that our boys could enjoy ?
When war was declared , Baker quickly appointed Fosdick to be chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities .
Armed with the coercive resources of the federal government and rapidly building his bureaucratic empire from merely one secretary to a staff of thousands , Raymond Fosdick set out with determination on his twofold task : stamping out alcohol and sin in and around every military camp , and filling the void for American soldiers and sailors by providing them with wholesome recreation .
As head of the Law Enforcement Division of the Training Camp Commission , Fosdick selected Bascom Johnson , attorney for the American Social Hygiene Association . [ 34 ]
Johnson was commissioned a major , and his staff of forty aggressive attorneys became second lieutenants .
Employing the argument of health and military necessity , Fosdick set up a Social Hygiene Division of his commission , which promulgated the slogan " Fit to Fight . "
Using a mixture of force and threats to remove federal troops from the bases if recalcitrant cities did not comply , Fosdick managed to bludgeon his way into suppressing , if not prostitution in general , then at least every major red light district in the country .
In doing so , Fosdick and Baker , employing local police and the federal Military Police , far exceeded their legal authority .
The law authorized the president to shut down every red light district in a five - mile zone around each military camp or base .
Of the 110 red light districts shut down by military force , however , only 35 were included in the prohibited zone .
Suppression of the other 75 was an illegal extension of the law .
Nevertheless , Fosdick was triumphant : " Through the efforts of this Commission [ on Training Camp Activities ] the red light district has practically ceased to be a feature of American city life . " [ 35 ]
The result of this permanent destruction of the red light district , of course , was to drive prostitution onto the streets , where consumers would be deprived of the protection of either an open market or of regulation .
In some cases , the federal anti-vice crusade met considerable resistance .
Secretary of Navy Josephus Daniels , a progressive from North Carolina , had to call out the marines to patrol the streets of resistant Philadelphia , and naval troops , over the strenuous objections of the mayor , were used to crush the fabled red light district of Storyville , in New Orleans , in November 1917 . [ 36 ]
In its hubris , the US Army decided to extend its anti-vice crusade to foreign shores .
General John J. Pershing issued an official bulletin to members of the American Expeditionary Force in France urging that " sexual continence is the plain duty of members of the A.E.F. , both for the vigorous conduct of the war , and for the clean health of the American people after the war . "
Pershing and the American military tried to close all the French brothels in areas where American troops were located , but the move was unsuccessful because the French objected bitterly .
Premier Georges Clemenceau pointed out that the result of the " total prohibition of regulated prostitution in the vicinity of American troops " was only to increase " venereal diseases among the civilian population of the neighborhood . "
Finally , the United States had to rest content with declaring French civilian areas off limits to the troops . [ 37 ]
The more positive part of Raymond Fosdick 's task during the war was supplying the soldiers and sailors with a constructive substitute for sin and alcohol , " healthful amusements and wholesome company . "
As might be expected , the Woman 's Committee and organized womanhood collaborated enthusiastically .
They followed the injunction of Secretary of War Baker that the government " cannot allow these young men to be surrounded by a vicious and demoralizing environment , nor can we leave anything undone which will protect them from unhealthy influences and crude forms of temptation . "
The Woman 's Committee found , however , that in the great undertaking of safeguarding the health and morals of our boys , their most challenging problem proved to be guarding the morals of their mobilized young girls .
For unfortunately , " where soldiers are stationed the problem of preventing girls from being misled by the glamour and romance of war and beguiling uniforms looms large . ''
Fortunately , perhaps , the Maryland Committee proposed the establishment of a " Patriotic League of Honor which will inspire girls to adopt the highest standards of womanliness and loyalty to their country . " [ 38 ]
No group was more delighted with the achievements of Fosdick and his Military Training Camp Commission than the burgeoning profession of social work .
Surrounded by handpicked aides from the Playground and Recreation Association and the Russell Sage Foundation , Fosdick and the others " in effect tried to create a massive settlement house around each camp .
No army had ever seen anything like it before , but it was an outgrowth of the recreation and community organization movement , and a victory for those who had been arguing for the creative use of leisure time . " [ 39 ]
The social work profession pronounced the program an enormous success .
The influential Survey magazine summed up the result as " the most stupendous piece of social work in modern times . " [ 40 ]
Social workers were also exultant about prohibition .
In 1917 , the National Conference of Charities and Corrections ( which changed its name around the same time to the National Conference of Social Work ) was emboldened to drop whatever value - free pose it might have had and come out squarely for prohibition .
On returning from Russia in 1917 , Edward T. Devine of the Charity Organization Society of New York exclaimed that " the social revolution which followed the prohibition of vodka was more profoundly important than the political revolution which abolished autocracy . "
And Robert A. Woods of Boston , the Grand Old Man of the settlement house movement and a veteran advocate of prohibition , predicted in 1919 that the Eighteenth Amendment , " one of the greatest and best events in history , " would reduce poverty , wipe out prostitution and crime , and liberate " vast suppressed human potentialities . " [ 41 ]
Woods , president of the National Conference of Social Work during 1917 – 18 , had long denounced alcohol as " an abominable evil . "
A postmillennial pietist , he believed in " Christian statesmanship " that would , in a " propaganda of the deed , " Christianize the social order in a corporate , communal route to the glorification of God .
Like many pietists ,
Woods cared not for creeds or dogmas but only for advancing Christianity in a communal way ; though an active Episcopalian , his " parish " was the community at large .
In his settlement work , Woods had long favored the isolation or segregation of the " unfit , " in particular " the tramp , the drunkard , the pauper , the imbecile , " with the settlement house as the nucleus of this reform .
Woods was particularly eager to isolate and punish the drunkard and the tramp .
" Inveterate drunkards " were to receive increasing levels of " punishment , " with ever - lengthier jail terms .
The " tramp evil " was to be gotten rid of by rounding up and jailing vagrants , who would be placed in tramp workhouses and put to forced labor .
For Woods the world war was a momentous event .
It had advanced the process of " Americanization , " a " great humanizing process through which all loyalties , all beliefs must be wrought together in a better order . " [ 42 ]
The war had wonderfully released the energies of the American people .
Now , however , it was important to carry the wartime momentum into the postwar world .
Lauding the war collectivist society during the spring of 1918 , Robert Woods asked the crucial question , " Why should it not always be so ?
Why not continue in the years of peace this close , vast , wholesome organism of service , of fellowship , of constructive creative power ? " [ 43 ]
V. The New Republic Collectivists
The New Republic magazine , founded in 1914 as the leading intellectual organ of progressivism , was a living embodiment of the burgeoning alliance between big - business interests , in particular the House of Morgan , and the growing legion of collectivist intellectuals .
Founder and publisher of the New Republic was Willard W. Straight , partner of J.P. Morgan & Co. , and its financier was Straight 's wife , the heiress Dorothy Whitney .
Major editor of the influential new weekly was the veteran collectivist and theoretician of Teddy Roosevelt 's New Nationalism , Herbert David Croly .
Croly 's two coeditors were Walter Edward Weyl , another theoretician of the New Nationalism , and the young , ambitious former official of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society , the future pundit Walter Lippmann .
As Woodrow Wilson began to take America into World War I , the New Republic , though originally Rooseveltian , became an enthusiastic supporter of the war , and a virtual spokesman for the Wilson war effort , the wartime collectivist economy , and the new society molded by the war .
On the higher levels of ratiocination , unquestionably the leading progressive intellectual , before , during , and after World War I , was the champion of pragmatism , Professor John Dewey of Columbia University .
Dewey wrote frequently for the New Republic in this period and was clearly its leading theoretician .
A Yankee born in 1859 , Dewey was , as Mencken put it , " of indestructible Vermont stock and a man of the highest bearable sobriety . "
John Dewey was the son of a small town Vermont grocer . [ 44 ]
Although he was a pragmatist and a secular humanist most of his life , it is not as well known that Dewey , in the years before 1900 , was a postmillennial pietist , seeking the gradual development of a Christianized social order and Kingdom of God on earth via the expansion of science , community , and the State .
During the 1890s , Dewey , as professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan , expounded his vision of postmillennial pietism in a series of lectures before the Students ' Christian Association .
Dewey argued that the growth of modem science now makes it possible for man to establish the biblical idea of the Kingdom of God on earth .
Once humans had broken free of the restraints of orthodox Christianity , a truly religious Kingdom of God could be realized in " the common incarnate Life , the purpose animating all men and binding them together into one harmonious whole of sympathy . " [ 45 ]
Religion would thus work in tandem with science and democracy , all of which would break down the barriers between men and establish the Kingdom .
After 1900 it was easy for John Dewey , along with most other postmillennial intellectuals of the period , to shift gradually but decisively from postmillennial progressive Christian statism to progressive secular statism .
The path , the expansion of statism and " social control " and planning , remained the same .
And even though the Christian creed dropped out of the picture , the intellectuals and activists continued to possess the same evangelical zeal for the salvation of the world that their parents and they themselves had once possessed .
The world would and must still be saved through progress and statism . [ 46 ]
A pacifist while in the midst of peace , John Dewey prepared himself to lead the parade for war as America drew nearer to armed intervention in the European struggle .
First , in January 1916 in the New Republic , Dewey attacked the " professional pacifist 's " outright condemnation of war as a " sentimental phantasy , " a confusion of means and ends .
Force , he declared , was simply " a means of getting results , " and therefore would neither be lauded or condemned per se .
Next , in April Dewey signed a pro-Allied manifesto , not only cheering for an Allied victory but also proclaiming that the Allies were " struggling to preserve the liberties of the world and the highest ideals of civilization . "
And though Dewey supported US entry into the war so that Germany could be defeated , " a hard job , but one which had to be done , " he was far more interested in the wonderful changes that the war would surely bring about in the domestic American polity .
In particular , war offered a golden opportunity to bring about collectivist social control in the interest of social justice .
As one historian put it ,
because war demanded paramount commitment to the national interest and necessitated an unprecedented degree of government planning and economic regulation in that interest , Dewey saw the prospect of permanent socialization , permanent replacement of private and possessive interest by public and social interest , both within and among nations . [ 47 ]
In an interview with the New York World a few months after US entry into the war , Dewey exulted that " this war may easily be the beginning of the end of business . "
For out of the needs of the war , " we are beginning to produce for use , not for sale , and the capitalist is not a capitalist [ in the face of ] the war . "
Capitalist conditions of production and sale are now under government control , and " there is no reason to believe that the old principle will ever be resumed … .
Private property had already lost its sanctity … industrial democracy is on the way . " [ 48 ]
In short , intelligence is at last being used to tackle social problems , and this practice is destroying the old order and creating a new social order of " democratic integrated control . "
Labor is acquiring more power , science is at last being socially mobilized , and massive government controls are socializing industry .
These developments ,
Dewey proclaimed , were precisely what we are fighting for . [ 49 ]
Furthermore , John Dewey saw great possibilities opened by the war for the advent of worldwide collectivism .
To Dewey , America 's entrance into the war created a " plastic juncture " in the world , a world marked by a " world organization and the beginnings of a public control which crosses nationalistic boundaries and interests , " and which would also " outlaw war . " [ 50 ]
The editors of the New Republic took a position similar to Dewey's , except that they arrived at it even earlier .
In his editorial in the magazine 's first issue in November 1914 , Herbert Croly cheerily prophesied that the war would stimulate America 's spirit of nationalism and therefore bring it closer to democracy .
At first hesitant about the collectivist war economies in Europe , the New Republic soon began to cheer and urged the United States to follow the lead of the warring European nations and socialize its economy and expand the powers of the State .
As America prepared to enter the war , the New Republic , examining war collectivism in Europe , rejoiced that " on its administrative side socialism [ had ] won a victory that [ was ] superb and compelling . "
True , European war collectivism was a bit grim and autocratic , but never fear , America could use the selfsame means for " democratic " goals .
The New Republic intellectuals also delighted in the " war spirit " in America , for that spirit meant " the substitution of national and social and organic forces for the more or less mechanical private forces operative in peace . "
The purposes of war and social reform might be a bit different , but , after all , " they are both purposes , and luckily for mankind a social organization which is efficient is as useful for the one as for the other . " [ 51 ]
Lucky indeed .
As America prepared to enter the war , the New Republic eagerly looked forward to imminent collectivization , sure that it would bring " immense gains in national efficiency and happiness . "
After war was declared , the magazine urged that the war be used as " an aggressive tool of democracy . "
" Why should not the war serve , " the magazine asked , " as a pretext to be used to foist innovations upon the country ? "
In that way , progressive intellectuals could lead the way in abolishing " the typical evils of the sprawling half - educated competitive capitalism . "
Convinced that the United States would attain socialism through war , Walter Lippmann , in a public address shortly after American entry , trumpeted his apocalyptic vision of the future :
We who have gone to war to insure democracy in the world will have raised an aspiration here that will not end with the overthrow of the Prussian autocracy .
We shall turn with fresh interests to our own tyrannies — to our Colorado mines , our autocratic steel industries , sweatshops , and our slums .
A force is loose in America .
Our own reactionaries will not assuage it .
We shall know how to deal with them . [ 52 ]
Walter Lippmann , indeed , had been the foremost hawk among the New Republic intellectuals .
He had pushed Croly into backing Wilson and into supporting intervention , and then had collaborated with Colonel House in pushing Wilson into entering the war .
Soon Lippmann , an enthusiast for conscription , had to confront the fact that he himself , only twenty - seven years old and in fine health , was eminently eligible for the draft .
Somehow , however , Lippmann failed to unite theory and praxis .
Young Felix Frankfurter , progressive Harvard Law Professor and a close associate of the New Republic editorial staff , had just been selected as a special assistant to Secretary of War Baker .
Lippmann somehow felt that his own inestimable services could be better used planning the postwar world than battling in the trenches .
And so he wrote to Frankfurter asking for a job in Baker 's office .
" What I want to do , " he pleaded , " is to devote all my time to studying and speculating on the approaches to peace and the reaction from the peace .
Do you think you can get me an exemption on such highfalutin grounds ? "
He then rushed to reassure Frankfurter that there was nothing " personal " in this request .
After all , he explained , " the things that need to be thought out , are so big that there must be no personal element mixed up with this . "
Frankfurter having paved the way , Lippmann wrote to Secretary Baker .
He assured Baker that he was only applying for a job and draft exemption on the pleading of others and in stern submission to the national interest .
As Lippmann put it in a remarkable demonstration of cant :
I have consulted all the people whose advice I value and they urge me to apply for exemption .
You can well understand that this is not a pleasant thing to do , and yet , after searching my soul as candidly as I know how , I am convinced that I can serve my bit much more effectively than as a private in the new armies .
No doubt .
As icing on the cake , Lippmann added an important bit of " disinformation . "
For , he piteously wrote to Baker , the fact is " that my father is dying and my mother is absolutely alone in the world .
She does not know what his condition is , and I cannot tell anyone for fear it would become known . "
Apparently , no one else " knew " his father 's condition either , including his father and the medical profession , for the elder Lippmann managed to peg along successfully for the next ten years . [ 53 ]
Secure in his draft exemption , Walter Lippmann hied off in high excitement to Washington , there to help run the war and , a few months later , to help direct Colonel House 's secret conclave of historians and social scientists setting out to plan the shape of the future peace treaty and the postwar world .
Let others fight and die in the trenches ; Walter Lippmann had the satisfaction of knowing that his talents , at least , would be put to their best use by the newly emerging collectivist State .
As the war went on , Croly and the other editors , having lost Lippmann to the great world beyond , cheered every new development of the massively controlled war economy .
The nationalization of railroads and shipping , the priorities and allocation system , the total domination of all parts of the food industry achieved by Herbert Hoover and the Food Administration , the pro-union policy , the high taxes , and the draft were all hailed by the New Republic as an expansion of democracy 's power to plan for the general good .
As the Armistice ushered in the postwar world , the New Republic looked back on the handiwork of the war and found it good : " We revolutionized our society . "
All that remained was to organize a new constitutional convention to complete the job of reconstructing America . [ 54 ]
But the revolution had not been fully completed .
Despite the objections of Bernard Baruch and other wartime planners , the government decided not to make most of the war collectivist machinery permanent .
From then on , the fondest ambition of Baruch and the others was to make the World War I system a permanent institution of American life .
The most trenchant epitaph on the World War I polity was delivered by Rexford Guy Tugwell , the most frankly collectivist of the Brain Trusters of Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal .
Looking back on " America 's wartime socialism " in 1927 , Tugwell lamented that if only the war had lasted longer , that great " experiment " could have been completed : " We were on the verge of having an international industrial machine when peace broke , " Tugwell mourned .
" Only the Armistice prevented a great experiment in control of production , control of prices , and control of consumption . " [ 55 ]
Tugwell need not have been troubled ; there would soon be other emergencies , other wars .
At the end of the war , Lippmann was to go on to become America 's foremost journalistic pundit .
Croly , having broken with the Wilson Administration on the harshness of the Versailles Treaty , was bereft to find the New Republic no longer the spokesman for some great political leader .
During the late 1920s he was to discover an exemplary national collectivist leader abroad — in Benito Mussolini . [ 56 ]
That Croly ended his years as an admirer of Mussolini comes as no surprise when we realize that from early childhood he had been steeped by a doting father in the authoritarian socialist doctrines of Auguste Comte 's Positivism .
These views were to mark Croly throughout his life .
Thus , Herbert 's father , David , the founder of Positivism in the United States , advocated the establishment of vast powers of government over everyone 's life .
David Croly favored the growth of trusts and monopolies as a means both to that end and also to eliminate the evils of individual competition and " selfishness . "
Like his son , David Croly railed at the Jeffersonian " fear of government " in America , and looked to Hamilton as an example to counter that trend . [ 57 ]
And what of Professor Dewey , the doyen of the pacifist intellectuals — turned drumbeaters for war ?
In a little known period of his life , John Dewey spent the immediate postwar years , 1919 – 21 , teaching at Peking University and traveling in the Far East .
China was then in a period of turmoil over the clauses of the Versailles Treaty that transferred the rights of dominance in Shantung from Germany to Japan .
Japan had been promised this reward by the British and French in secret treaties in return for entering the war against Germany .
The Wilson Administration was torn between the two camps .
On the one hand were those who wished to stand by the Allies ' decision and who envisioned using Japan as a club against Bolshevik Russia in Asia .
On the other were those who had already begun to sound the alarm about a Japanese menace and who were committed to China , often because of connections with the American Protestant missionaries who wished to defend and expand their extraterritorial powers of governance in China .
The Wilson Administration , which had originally taken a pro-Chinese stand , reversed itself in the spring of 1919 and endorsed the Versailles provisions .
Into this complex situation John Dewey plunged , seeing no complexity and of course considering it unthinkable for either him or the United States to stay out of the entire fray .
Dewey leaped into total support of the Chinese nationalist position , hailing the aggressive Young China movement and even endorsing the pro-missionary YMCA in China as " social workers . "
Dewey thundered that while " I did n't expect to be a jingo , " that Japan must be called to account and that Japan is the great menace in Asia .
Thus , scarcely had Dewey ceased being a champion of one terrible world war than he began to pave the way for an even greater one . [ 58 ]
VI . Economics in Service of the State : The Empiricism of Richard T. Ely
World War I was the apotheosis of the growing notion of intellectuals as servants of the State and junior partners in State rule .
In the new fusion of intellectuals and State , each was of powerful aid to the other .
Intellectuals could serve the State by apologizing for and supplying rationales for its deeds .
Intellectuals were also needed to staff important positions as planners and controllers of the society and economy .
The State could also serve intellectuals by restricting entry into , and thereby raising the income and the prestige of , the various occupations and professions .
During World War I , historians were of particular importance in supplying the government with war propaganda , convincing the public of the unique evil of Germans throughout history and of the satanic designs of the Kaiser .
Economists , particularly empirical economists and statisticians , were of great importance in the planning and control of the nation 's wartime economy .
Historians playing preeminent roles in the war propaganda machine have been studied fairly extensively ; economists and statisticians , playing a less blatant and allegedly " value - free " role , have received far less attention . [ 59 ]
Although it is an outworn generalization to say that nineteenth century economists were stalwart champions of laissez faire , it is still true that deductive economic theory proved to be a mighty bulwark against government intervention .
For , basically , economic theory showed the harmony and order inherent in the free market , as well as the counterproductive distortions and economic shackles imposed by state intervention .
In order for statism to dominate the economics profession , then , it was important to discredit deductive theory .
One of the most important ways of doing so was to advance the notion that , to be " genuinely scientific , " economics had to eschew generalization and deductive laws and simply engage in empirical inquiry into the facts of history and historical institutions , hoping that somehow laws would eventually arise from these detailed investigations .
Thus the German Historical School , which managed to seize control of the economics discipline in Germany , fiercely proclaimed not only its devotion to statism and government control , but also its opposition to the " abstract " deductive laws of political economy .
This was the first major group within the economics profession to champion what Ludwig von Mises was later to call " anti-economics . "
Gustav Schmoller , the leader of the Historical School , proudly declared that his and his colleagues ' major task at the University of Berlin was to form " the intellectual bodyguard of the House of Hohenzollern . "
During the 1880s and 1890s bright young graduate students in history and the social sciences went to Germany , the home of the PhD degree , to obtain their doctorates .
Almost to a man , they returned to the United States to teach in colleges and in the newly created graduate schools , imbued with the excitement of the " new " economics and political science .
It was a " new " social science that lauded the German and Bismarckian development of a powerful welfare - warfare State , a State seemingly above all social classes , that fused the nation into an integrated and allegedly harmonious whole .
The new society and polity was to be run by a powerful central government , cartelizing , dictating , arbitrating , and controlling , thereby eliminating competitive laissez - faire capitalism on the one hand and the threat of proletarian socialism on the other .
And at or near the head of the new dispensation was to be the new breed of intellectuals , technocrats , and planners , directing , staffing , propagandizing , and " selflessly " promoting the common good while ruling and lording over the rest of society .
In short , doing well by doing good .
To the new breed of progressive and statist intellectuals in America , this was a heady vision indeed .
Richard T. Ely , virtually the founder of this new breed , was the leading progressive economist and also the teacher of most of the others .
As an ardent postmillennialist pietist , Ely was convinced that he was serving God and Christ as well .
Like so many pietists , Ely was born ( in 1854 ) of solid Yankee and old Puritan stock , again in the midst of the fanatical Burned - Over District of western New York .
Ely 's father , Ezra , was an extreme Sabbatarian , preventing his family from playing games or reading books on Sunday , and so ardent a prohibitionist that , even though an impoverished , marginal farmer , he refused to grow barley , a crop uniquely suitable to his soil , because it would have been used to make that monstrously sinful product , beer . [ 60 ]
Having been graduated from Columbia College in 1876 , Ely went to Germany and received his PhD from Heidelberg in 1879 .
In several decades of teaching at Johns Hopkins and then at Wisconsin , the energetic and empire - building Ely became enormously influential in American thought and politics .
At Johns Hopkins he turned out a gallery of influential students and statist disciples in all fields of the social sciences as well as economics .
These disciples were headed by the pro-union institutionalist economist John R. Commons , and included the social - control sociologists Edward Alsworth Ross and Albion W. Small ; John H. Finlay , President of City College of New York ; Dr. Albert Shaw , editor of the Review of Reviews and influential adviser and theoretician to Theodore Roosevelt ; the municipal reformer Frederick C. Howe ; and the historians Frederick Jackson Turner and J. Franklin Jameson .
Newton D. Baker was trained by Ely at Hopkins , and Woodrow Wilson was also his student there , although there is no direct evidence of intellectual influence .
In the mid-1880s Richard Ely founded the American Economic Association in a conscious attempt to commit the economics profession to statism as against the older laissez - faire economists grouped in the Political Economy Club .
Ely continued as secretary - treasurer of the AEA for seven years , until his reformer allies decided to weaken the association 's commitment to statism in order to induce the laissez - faire economists to join the organization .
At that point , Ely , in high dudgeon , left the AEA .
At Wisconsin in 1892 , Ely formed a new School of Economics , Political Science , and History , surrounded himself with former students , and gave birth to the Wisconsin Idea which , with the help of John Commons , succeeded in passing a host of progressive measures for government regulation in Wisconsin .
Ely and the others formed an unofficial but powerful brain trust for the progressive regime of Wisconsin Governor Robert M. La Follette , who got his start in Wisconsin politics as an advocate of prohibition .
Though never a classroom student of Ely's , La Follette always referred to Ely as his teacher and as the molder of the Wisconsin Idea .
And Theodore Roosevelt once declared that Ely " first introduced me to radicalism in economics and then made me sane in my radicalism . " [ 61 ]
Ely was also one of the most prominent postmillennialist intellectuals of the era .
He fervently believed that the State is God 's chosen instrument for reforming and Christianizing the social order so that eventually Jesus would arrive and put an end to history .
The State , declared Ely , " is religious in its essence , " and , furthermore , " God works through the State in carrying out His purposes more universally than through any other institution . "
The task of the church is to guide the State and utilize it in these needed reforms . [ 62 ]
An inveterate activist and organizer , Ely was prominent in the evangelical Chautauqua movement , and he founded there the " Christian Sociology " summer school , which infused the influential Chautauqua operation with the concepts and the personnel of the Social Gospel movement .
Ely was a friend and close associate of Social Gospel leaders Revs. Washington Gladden , Walter Rauschenbusch , and Josiah Strong .
With Strong and Commons , Ely organized the Institute of Christian Sociology . [ 63 ]
Ely also founded and became the secretary of the Christian Social Union of the Episcopal Church , along with Christian Socialist W.D.P.
Bliss .
All of these activities were infused with postmillennial statism .
Thus , the Institute of Christian Sociology was pledged to present God's " kingdom as the complete ideal of human society to be realized on earth . "
Moreover ,
Ely viewed the state as the greatest redemptive force in society .
In Ely 's eyes , government was the God - given instrument through which we had to work .
Its preeminence as a divine instrument was based on the post -Reformation abolition of the division between the sacred and the secular and on the State 's power to implement ethical solutions to public problems .
The same identification of sacred and secular which took place among liberal clergy enabled Ely to both divinize the state and socialize Christianity : he thought of government as God 's main instrument of redemption … . [ 64 ]
When war came , Richard Ely was for some reason ( perhaps because he was in his sixties ) left out of the excitement of war work and economic planning in Washington .
He bitterly regretted that " I have not had a more active part then I have had in this greatest war in the world 's history . " [ 65 ]
But Ely made up for his lack as best he could ; virtually from the start of the European war , he whooped it up for militarism , war , the " discipline " of conscription , and the suppression of dissent and " disloyalty " at home .
A lifelong militarist , Ely had tried to volunteer for war service in the Spanish - American War , had called for the suppression of the Philippine insurrection , and was particularly eager for conscription and for forced labor for " loafers " during World War I .
By 1915 Ely was agitating for immediate compulsory military service , and the following year he joined the ardently pro-war and heavily big business –influenced National Security League , where he called for the liberation of the German people from " autocracy . " [
66
In advocating conscription , Ely was neatly able to combine moral , economic , and prohibitionist arguments for the draft : " The moral effect of taking boys off street corners and out of saloons and drilling them is excellent , and the economic effects are likewise beneficial . " [ 67 ]
Indeed , conscription for Ely served almost as a panacea for all ills .
So enthusiastic was he about the World War I experience that Ely again prescribed his favorite cure - all to alleviate the 1929 depression .
He proposed a permanent peacetime " industrial army " engaged in public works and manned by conscripting youth for strenuous physical labor .
This conscription would instill into America 's youth the essential " military ideals of hardihood and discipline , " a discipline once provided by life on the farm but unavailable to the bulk of the populace now growing up in the effete cities .
This small , standing conscript army could then speedily absorb the unemployed during depressions .
Under the command of " an economic general staff , " the industrial army would " go to work to relieve distress with all the vigor and resources of brain and brawn that we employed in the World War . " [ 68 ]
Deprived of a position in Washington , Ely made the stamping out of " disloyalty " at home his major contribution to the war effort .
He called for the total suspension of academic freedom for the duration .
Any professor , he declared , who stated " opinions which hinder us in this awful struggle " should be " fired " if not indeed " shot . "
The particular focus of Ely 's formidable energy was a zealous campaign to try to get his old ally in Wisconsin politics , Robert M. La Follette , expelled from the US Senate for continuing to oppose America 's participation in the war .
Ely declared that his " blood boils " at La Follette 's " treason " and attacks on war profiteering .
Throwing himself into the battle , Ely founded and became president of the Madison chapter of the Wisconsin Loyalty Legion and mounted a campaign to expel La Follette . [ 69 ]
The campaign was meant to mobilize the Wisconsin faculty and to support the ultrapatriotic and ultrahawkish activities of Theodore Roosevelt .
Ely wrote to TR that " we must crush La Follettism . "
In his unremitting campaign against the Wisconsin Senator , Ely thundered that La Follette " has been of more help to the Kaiser than a quarter of a million troops . " [ 70 ] " Empiricism " rampant .
The faculty of the University of Wisconsin was stung by charges throughout the state and the country that its failure to denounce La Follette was proof that the university — long affiliated with La Follette in state politics — supported his disloyal antiwar policies .
Prodded by Ely , Commons , and others , the university 's War Committee drew up and circulated a petition , signed by the university president , all the deans , and over 90 percent of the faculty , that provided one of the more striking examples in United States history of academic truckling to the State apparatus .
None too subtly using the constitutional verbiage for treason , the petition protested " against those utterances and actions of Senator La Follette which have given aid and comfort to Germany and her allies in the present war ; we deplore his failure loyally to support the government in the prosecution of the war . " [ 70 ]
Behind the scenes , Ely tried his best to mobilize America 's historians against La Follette , to demonstrate that he had given aid and comfort to the enemy .
Ely was able to enlist the services of the National Board of Historical Service , the propaganda agency established by professional historians for the duration of the war , and of the government 's own propaganda arm , the Committee on Public Information .
Warning that the effort must remain secret , Ely mobilized historians under the aegis of these organizations to research German and Austrian newspapers and journals to try to build a record of La Follette 's alleged influence , " indicating the encouragement he has given Germany . "
The historian E. Merton Coulter revealed the objective spirit animating these researches : " I understand it is to be an unbiased and candid account of the Senator 's [ La Follette 's ] course and its effect — but we all know it can lead but to one conclusion — something little short of treason . " [ 71 ]
Professor Gruber well notes that this campaign to get La Follette was " a remarkable example of the uses of scholarship for espionage .
It was a far cry from the disinterested search for truth for a group of professors to mobilize a secret research campaign to find ammunition to destroy the political career of a United States senator who did not share their view of the war . " [ 72 ]
In any event , no evidence was turned up , the movement failed , and the Wisconsin professoriat began to move away in distrust from the Loyalty Legion . [ 73 ]
After the menace of the Kaiser had been extirpated , the Armistice found Professor Ely , along with his compatriots in the National Security League , ready to segue into the next round of patriotic repression .
During Ely 's anti–La Follette research campaign he had urged investigation of " the kind of influence which he [ La Follette ] has exerted against our country in Russia . "
Ely pointed out that modem " democracy " requires a " high degree of conformity " and that therefore the " most serious menace " of Bolshevism , which Ely depicted as " social disease germs , " must be fought " with repressive measures . "
By 1924 , however , Richard T. Ely 's career of repression was over , and what is more , in a rare instance of the workings of poetic justice , he was hoisted with his own petard .
In 1922 the much - traduced Robert La Follette was reelected to the Senate and also swept the Progressives back into power in the state of Wisconsin .
By 1924 the Progressives had gained control of the Board of Regents , and they moved to cut off the water of their former academic ally and empire - builder .
Ely then felt it prudent to move out of Wisconsin together with his Institute , and while he lingered for some years at Northwestern , the heyday of Ely 's fame and fortune was over .
VII .
Economics in Service of the State : Government and Statistics
Statistics is a vital , though much underplayed , requisite of modern government .
Government could not even presume to control , regulate , or plan any portion of the economy without the service of its statistical bureaus and agencies .
Deprive government of its statistics and it would be a blind and helpless giant , with no idea whatever of what to do or where to do it .
It might be replied that business firms , too , need statistics in order to function .
But business needs for statistics are far less in quantity and also different in quality .
Business may need statistics in its own micro area of the economy , but only on its prices and costs ; it has little need for broad collections of data or for sweeping , holistic aggregates .
Business could perhaps rely on its own privately collected and unshared data .
Furthermore , much entrepreneurial knowledge is qualitative , not enshrined in quantitative data , and of a particular time , area , and location .
But government bureaucracy could do nothing if forced to be confined to qualitative data .
Deprived of profit and loss tests for efficiency , or of the need to serve consumers efficiently , conscripting both capital and operating costs from taxpayers , and forced to abide by fixed , bureaucratic rules , modern government shorn of masses of statistics could do virtually nothing . [ 74 ]
Hence the enormous importance of World War I , not only in providing the power and the precedent for a collectivized economy , but also in greatly accelerating the advent of statisticians and statistical agencies of government , many of which ( and who ) remained in government , ready for the next leap forward of power .
Richard T. Ely , of course , championed the new empirical " look and see " approach , with the aim of fact - gathering to " mold the forces at work in society and to improve existing conditions . " [ 75 ]
More importantly , one of the leading authorities on the growth of government expenditure has linked it with statistics and empirical data : " Advance in economic science and statistics strengthened belief in the possibilities of dealing with social problems by collective action .
It made for increase in the statistical and other fact - finding activities of government . " [ 76 ]
As early as 1863 , Samuel B. Ruggles , American delegate to the International Statistical Congress in Berlin , proclaimed that " statistics are the very eyes of the statesman , enabling him to survey and scan with clear and comprehensive vision the whole structure and economy of the body politic . " [ 77 ]
Conversely , this means that stripped of these means of vision , the statesman would no longer be able to meddle , control and plan .
Moreover , government statistics are clearly needed for specific types of intervention .
Government could not intervene to alleviate unemployment unless statistics of unemployment were collected — and so the impetus for such collection .
Carroll D. Wright , one of the first Commissioners of Labor in the United States , was greatly influenced by the famous statistician and German Historical School member , Ernst Engel , head of the Royal Statistical Bureau of Prussia .
Wright sought the collection of unemployment statistics for that reason , and in general , for " the amelioration of unfortunate industrial and social relations . "
Henry Carter Adams , a former student of Engel's , and , like Ely , a statist and progressive " new economist , " established the Statistical Bureau of the Interstate Commerce Commission , believing that " ever increasing statistical activity by the government was essential — for the sake of controlling naturally monopolistic industries . "
And Professor Irving Fisher of Yale , eager for government to stabilize the price level , conceded that he wrote The Making of Index Numbers to solve the problem of the unreliability of index numbers .
" Until this difficulty could be met , stabilization could scarcely be expected to become a reality . "
Carroll Wright was a Bostonian and a progressive reformer .
Henry Carter Adams , the son of a New England pietist Congregationalist preacher on missionary duty in Iowa , studied for the ministry at his father 's alma mater , Andover Theological Seminary , but soon abandoned this path .
Adams devised the accounting system of the Statistical Bureau of the ICC .
This system " served as a model for the regulation of public utilities here and throughout the world . " [ 78 ]
Irving Fisher was the son of a Rhode Island Congregationalist pietist preacher , and his parents were both of old Yankee stock , his mother a strict Sabbatarian .
As befitted what his son and biographer called his " crusading spirit , " Fisher was an inveterate reformer , urging the imposition of numerous progressive measures including Esperanto , simplified spelling , and calendar reform .
He was particularly enthusiastic about purging the world of " such iniquities of civilization as alcohol , tea , coffee , tobacco , refined sugar , and bleached white flour . " [ 79 ]
During the 1920s Fisher was the leading prophet of that so - called New Era in economics and in society .
He wrote three books during the 1920s praising the noble experiment of prohibition , and he lauded Governor Benjamin Strong and the Federal Reserve System for following his advice and expanding money and credit so as to keep the wholesale price level virtually constant .
Because of the Fed 's success in imposing Fisherine price stabilization , Fisher was so sure that there could be no depression that as late as 1930 he wrote a book claiming that there was and could be no stock crash and that stock prices would quickly rebound .
Throughout the 1920s Fisher insisted that since wholesale prices remained constant , there was nothing amiss about the wild boom in stocks .
Meanwhile he put his theories into practice by heavily investing his heiress wife 's considerable fortune in the stock market .
After the crash he frittered away his sister - in - law 's money when his wife 's fortune was depleted , at the same time calling frantically on the federal government to inflate money and credit and to re-inflate stock prices to their 1929 levels .
Despite his dissipation of two family fortunes , Fisher managed to blame almost everyone except himself for the debacle . [ 80 ]
As we shall see , in view of the importance of Wesley Clair Mitchell in the burgeoning of government statistics in World War I , Mitchell 's view on statistics are of particular importance . [ 81 ]
Mitchell , an institutionalist and student of Thorstein Veblen , was one of the prime founders of modern statistical inquiry in economics and clearly aspired to lay the basis for " scientific " government planning .
As Professor Dorfman , friend and student of Mitchell 's , put it :
" clearly the type of social invention most needed today is one that offers definite techniques through which the social system can be controlled and operated to the optimum advantage of its members . " ( Quote from Mitchell . )
To this end he constantly sought to extend , improve and refine the gathering and compilation of data … .
Mitchell believed that business - cycle analysis … might indicate the means to the achievement of orderly social control of business activity . [ 82 ]
Or , as Mitchell 's wife and collaborator stated in her memoirs :
he [ Mitchell ] envisioned the great contribution that government could make to the understanding of economic and social problems if the statistical data gathered independently by various Federal agencies were systematized and planned so that the interrelationships among them could be studied .
The idea of developing social statistics , not merely as a record but as a basis for planning , emerged early in his own work . [ 83 ]
Particularly important in the expansion of statistics in World War I was the growing insistence , by progressive intellectuals and corporate liberal businessmen alike , that democratic decision - making must be increasingly replaced by the administrative and technocratic .
Democratic or legislative decisions were messy , " inefficient , " and might lead to a significant curbing of statism , as had happened in the heyday of the Democratic party during the nineteenth century .
But if decisions were largely administrative and technocratic , the burgeoning of state power could continue unchecked .
The collapse of the laissez - faire creed of the Democrats in 1896 left a power vacuum in government that administrative and corporatist types were eager to fill .
Increasingly , then , such powerful corporatist big business groups as the National Civic Federation disseminated the idea that governmental decisions should be in the hands of the efficient technician , the allegedly value - free expert .
In short , government , in virtually all of its aspects , should be " taken out of politics . "
And statistical research with its aura of empiricism , quantitative precision , and nonpolitical value - freedom , was in the forefront of such emphasis .
In the municipalities , an increasingly powerful progressive reform movement shifted decisions from elections in neighborhood wards to citywide professional managers and school superintendents .
As a corollary , political power was increasingly shifted from working class and ethnic German Lutheran and Catholic wards to upper - class pietist business groups . [ 84 ]
By the time World War I arrived in Europe , a coalition of progressive intellectuals and corporatist businessmen was ready to go national in sponsoring allegedly objective statistical research institutes and think tanks .
Their views have been aptly summed up by David Eakins :
The conclusion being drawn by these people by 1915 was that fact - finding and policymaking had to be isolated from class struggle and freed from political pressure groups .
The reforms that would lead to industrial peace and social order , these experts were coming to believe , could only be derived from data determined by objective fact - finders ( such as themselves ) and under the auspices of sober and respectable organizations ( such as only they could construct ) .
The capitalist system could be improved only by a single - minded reliance upon experts detached from the hurly - burly of democratic policy - making .
The emphasis was upon efficiency — and democratic policymaking was inefficient .
An approach to the making of national economic and social policy outside traditional democratic political processes was thus emerging before the United States formally entered World War I . [ 85 ]
Several corporatist businessmen and intellectuals moved at about the same time toward founding such statistical research institutes .
In 1906 – 07 , Jerome D. Greene , secretary of the Harvard University Corporation , helped found an elite Tuesday Evening Club at Harvard to explore important issues in economics and the social sciences .
In 1910 Greene rose to an even more powerful post as general manager of the new Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , and three years later Greene became secretary and CEO of the powerful philanthropic organization , the Rockefeller Foundation .
Greene immediately began to move toward establishing a Rockefeller - funded institute for economic research , and in March 1914 he called an exploratory group together in New York , chaired by his friend and mentor in economics , the first Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Business , Edwin F. Gay .
The developing idea was that Gay would become head of a new , " scientific " and " impartial " organization , The Institute of Economic Research , which would gather statistical facts , and that Wesley Mitchell would be its director . [ 86 ]
Opposing advisers to John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , won out over Greene , however , and the institute plan was scuttled . [ 87 ]
Mitchell and Gay pressed on , with the lead now taken by Mitchell 's longtime friend , chief statistician and vice president of AT&T , Malcolm C. Rorty .
Rorty lined up support for the idea from a number of progressive statisticians and businessmen , including Chicago publisher of business books and magazines , Arch W. Shaw ; E.H. Goodwin of the US Chamber of Commerce ; Magnus Alexander , statistician and assistant to the president of General Electric , like AT&T , a Morgan - oriented concern ; John R. Commons , economist and aide - de- camp to Richard T. Ely at Wisconsin ; and Nahum I. Stone , statistician , former Marxist , a leader in the " scientific management " movement , and labor manager for the Hickey Freeman clothing company .
This group was in the process of forming a " Committee on National Income " when the United States entered the war , and they were forced to shelve their plans temporarily . [ 88 ]
After the war , however , the group set up the National Bureau of Economic Research , in 1920 . [ 89 ]
While the National Bureau was not to take final shape until after the war , another organization , created on similar lines , successfully won Greene 's and Rockefeller 's support .
In 1916 they were persuaded by Raymond B. Fosdick to found the Institute for Government Research ( IGR ) . [ 90 ]
The IGR was slightly different in focus from the National Bureau group , as it grew directly out of municipal progressive reform and the political science profession .
One of the important devices used by the municipal reformers was the private bureau of municipal research , which tried to seize decision - making from allegedly " corrupt " democratic bodies on behalf of efficient , nonpartisan organizations headed by progressive technocrats and social scientists .
In 1910 President William Howard Taft , intrigued with the potential for centralizing power in a chief executive inherent in the idea of the executive budget , appointed the " father of the budget idea , " the political scientist Frederick D. Cleveland , as head of a Commission on Economy and Efficiency .
Cleveland was the director of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research .
The Cleveland Commission also included political scientist and municipal reformer Frank Goodnow , professor of public law at Columbia University , first president of the American Political Science Association and president of Johns Hopkins ; and William Franklin Willoughby , former student of Ely , Assistant Director of the Bureau of Census , and later President of the American Association for Labor Legislation . [ 91 ]
The Cleveland Commission was delighted to tell President Taft precisely what he wanted to hear .
The Commission recommended sweeping administrative changes that would provide a Bureau of Central Administrative Control to form a " consolidated information and statistical arm of the entire national government . "
And at the heart of the new Bureau would be the Budget Division , which was to develop , at the behest of the president , and then present " an annual program of business for the Federal Government to be financed by Congress . " [
92 ]
When Congress balked at the Cleveland Commission 's recommendations , the disgruntled technocrats decided to establish an Institute for Government Research in Washington to battle for these and similar reforms .
With funding secured from the Rockefeller Foundation , the IGR was chaired by Goodnow , with Willoughby as its director . [ 93 ]
Scan Robert S. Brookings assumed responsibility for the financing .
When America entered the war , present and future NBER and IGR leaders were all over Washington , key figures and statisticians in the collectivized war economy .
By far the most powerful of the growing number of economists and statisticians involved in World War I was Edwin F. Gay .
Arch W. Shaw , an enthusiast for rigid wartime planning of economic resources , was made head of the new Commercial Economy Board by the Council for National Defense as soon as America entered the war . [ 94 ]
Shaw , who had taught at and served on the administrative board of Harvard Business School , staffed the board with Harvard Business people ; the secretary was Harvard economist Melvin T. Copeland , and other members included Dean Gay .
The board , which later became the powerful Conservation Division of the War Industries Board , focused on restricting competition in industry by eliminating the number and variety of products and by imposing compulsory uniformity , all in the name of " conservation " of resources to aid the war effort .
For example , garment firms had complained loudly of severe competition because of the number and variety of styles , and so Gay urged the garment firms to form a trade association to work with the government in curbing the surfeit of competition .
Gay also tried to organize the bakers so that they would not follow the usual custom of taking back stale and unsold bread from retail outlets .
By the end of 1917 , Gay was tired of using voluntary persuasion and was urging the government to use compulsory measures .
Gay 's major power came in early 1918 when the Shipping Board , which had officially nationalized all ocean shipping , determined to restrict drastically the use of ships for civilian trade and to use the bulk of shipping for transport of American troops to France .
Appointed in early January 1918 as merely a " special expert " by the Shipping Board , Gay in a brief time became the key figure in redirecting shipping from civilian to military use .
Soon Edwin Gay had become a member of the War Trade Board and head of its statistical department , which issued restrictive licenses for permitted imports ; head of the statistical department of the Shipping Board ; representative of the Shipping Board on the War Trade Board ; head of the statistical committee of the Department of Labor ; head of the Division of Planning and Statistics of the War Industries Board ( WIB ) ; and , above all , head of the new Central Bureau of Planning and Statistics .
The Central Bureau was organized in the fall of 1918 , when President Wilson asked WIB chairman Bernard Baruch to produce a monthly survey of all the government 's war activities .
This " conspectus " evolved into the Central Bureau , responsible directly to the president .
The importance of the bureau is noted by a recent historian :
The new Bureau represented the " peak " statistical division of the mobilization , becoming its " seer and prophet " for the duration , coordinating over a thousand employees engaged in research and , as the agency responsible for giving the president a concise picture of the entire economy , becoming the closest approximation to a " central statistical commission . "
During the latter stages of the war it set up a clearinghouse of statistical work , organized liaisons with the statistical staff of all the war boards , and centralized the data production process for the entire war bureaucracy .
By the war 's end , Wesley Mitchell recalled , " we were in a fair way to develop for the first time a systematic organization of federal statistics . " [ 95 ]
Within a year , Edwin Gay had risen from a special expert to the unquestioned czar of a giant network of federal statistical agencies , with over a thousand researchers and statisticians working under his direct control .
It is no wonder then that Gay , instead of being enthusiastic about the American victory he had worked so hard to secure , saw the Armistice as " almost a personal blow " that plunged him " into the slough of despond . "
All of his empire of statistics and control had just been coming together and developing into a mighty machine when suddenly " came that wretched Armistice . " [ 96 ]
Truly a tragedy of peace .
Gay tried valiantly to keep the war machinery going , continually complaining because many of his aides were leaving and bitterly denouncing the " hungry pack " who , for some odd reason , were clamoring for an immediate end to all wartime controls , including those closest to his heart , foreign trade and shipping .
But one by one , despite the best efforts of Baruch and many of the wartime planners , the WIB and other war agencies disappeared . [ 97 ]
For a while , Gay pinned his hopes on his Central Bureau of Planning and Statistics ( CBPS ) , which , in a fierce bout of bureaucratic infighting , he attempted to make the key economic and statistical group advising the American negotiators at the Versailles peace conference , thereby displacing the team of historians and social scientists assembled by Colonel House in the Inquiry .
Despite an official victory , and an eight volume report of the CBPS delivered to Versailles by the head of CBPS European team , John Foster Dulles of the War Trade Board , the bureau had little influence over the final treaty . [ 98 ]
Peace having finally and irrevocably arrived , Edwin Gay , backed by Mitchell , tried his best to have the CBPS kept as a permanent , peacetime organization .
Gay argued that the agency , with himself of course remaining as its head , could provide continuing data to the League of Nations , and above all could serve as the president 's own eyes and ears and mold the sort of executive budget envisioned by the old Taft Commission .
CBPS staff member and Harvard economist Edmund E. Day contributed a memorandum outlining specific tasks for the bureau to aid in demobilization and reconstruction , as well as rationale for the bureau becoming a permanent part of government .
One thing it could do was to make a " continuing canvass " of business conditions in the United States .
As Gay put it to President Wilson , using a favorite organicist analogy , a permanent board would serve " as a nervous system to the vast and complex organization of the government , furnishing to the controlling brain [ the president ] the information necessary for directing the efficient operation of the various members . " [ 99 ]
Although the President was " very cordial " to Gay 's plan , Congress refused to agree , and on June 30 , 1919 the Central Bureau of Planning and Statistics was finally terminated , along with the War Trade Board .
Edwin Gay would now have to seek employment in , if not the private , at least the quasi - independent , sector .
But Gay and Mitchell were not to be denied .
Nor would the Brookings - Willoughby group .
Their objective would be met more gradually and by slightly different means .
Gay became editor of the New York Evening Post under the aegis of its new owner and Gay 's friend , J.P. Morg
Ticketmaster 's parent company IAC ( blue ) vs. SP500 ( red ) :
Internet technology is loosening Ticketmaster 's tight grip on the lucrative live concert and sporting event scene .
The Net is shaking up the ticketing market by giving artists and venues a way to sell tickets directly to fans .
And it is fueling the rise of a resale market by giving buyers and sellers a safe place to connect with one another more easily and cheaply .
As the rules of the game change , talent and event managers sense a chance to seize back some control .
Sports teams are trying to assert more say over the way tickets are sold .
And venues and concert promoters are rethinking their relationships with ticket sellers .
" Consumers do n't like Ticketmaster 's fat service charge , and they are pissed off . "

Whether small or large , pert or pendulous , they all have their admirers .
But there is one type of breast that most approaches perfection , a cosmetic surgeon claims .
The model mammary apparently has a nipple that points slightly skywards , and an upper half just a bit smaller than the bottom half .
Scroll down for more ...
Patrick Mallucci spent many hours poring over photos of topless models in lads magazines and tabloid newspapers to formulate his theory .
In his opinion , the celebrity with the best pair is Caprice - and the woman with the worst is Posh Spice .
Mr Mallucci will prevent his findings at the first international conference on breast enlargement , to be held in London this week .
In his lecture , titled Concepts in Design for Breast Augmentation , he will express the hope that his insights are used by surgeons providing breast enlargements .
The operation is Britain 's most popular cosmetic surgery procedure , with 6,156 performed last year .
Mr Mallucci said : " I studied a wide variety of photographs of the most popular topless models to work out the various proportions they had in common and what made those particular features attractive .
" These findings allowed me to form a template around which to plan a breast augmentation , and set a standard of aesthetics .
" Obviously personal interpretation and expression has to be accounted for , but this has allowed me to develop a template that I have been using successfully for some time . "
The key aesthetic elements are nipple position and the proportion between the upper and lower halves of the breast , he said .
" The ideal is a 45 to 55 per cent proportion - that is the nipple sits not at the half - way mark down the breast , but at about 45 per cent from the top . "
He added : " All of the models I looked at conformed to these parameters .
None of them were augmentedand yet they were clearly considered to have beautiful breasts , so I wanted to examine how that could be achieved in someone not so well - endowed by using an implant .
" It 's about wanting to create something as close to perfection as possible . "
Mr Mallucci said the best breasts belong to the model Caprice Bourret - a view shared by many of his clients .
He added that said patients frequently begged him not to make their breasts the same shape as Victoria Beckham 's " unnaturally round " globes .
Mr Mallucci is one of the founding surgeons of Mybreast.org , which shares best practice on breast enlargement .
He will be one of more than 200 top cosmetic surgeons gathering in London to discuss topics such as new types of implant , surgical techniques , breast lifts during augmentation and minimising scarring .
AS the election of 2008 approaches with its cast of contenders who bring unprecedented diversity to the quest for the White House , the voting public has been called on to ponder several questions :
Is America ready for a woman to be president ?
What about a black man ?
A Mormon ?
Now , with the possible candidacy of Fred D. Thompson , the grandfatherly actor and former Republican senator from Tennessee , whose second wife is almost a quarter - century his junior , comes a less palatable inquiry that is spurring debate in Internet chat rooms , on cable television and on talk radio :
Is America ready for a president with a trophy wife ?
The question may seem sexist , even crass , but serious people — as well as Mr. Thompson ’s supporters — have been wrestling with the public reaction to Jeri Kehn Thompson , whose youthfulness , permanent tan and bleached blond hair present a contrast to the 64 - year - old man who hopes to win the hearts of the conservative core of the Republican party .
Will the so - called values voters accept this union ?
Mr. Thompson , who needs the support of early primary voters , is expected to formally announce his candidacy any day now .
Meanwhile , much of the brouhaha around Mrs. Thompson , 40 , is being stirred by photos of her in form - fitting gowns circulating on the Internet .

desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desu desuI remember seeing this about a year ago , so I 'm not sure just how new it is or how near to production .
Does anyone have any reliable information on this ?
How much are these new tires and where can I get them ?
My grandfather had a book about the automobile industry dating back from the late twenties .
Back then , the tire was still competing with the " elastic wheel " ; actually tires were using a much higher pressure ( 10 x more ! ) than today and used to blow up frequently ( that 's why these old 1920 's cars had 2 spare tires , on both sides ) so the elastic wheel was quite competitive though less comfortable .
Basically , this " new radical design " looks exactly like the 1920 " elastic wheel " .
All changes , nothing changes :) Looks like a similar tire used on the moon rover .
AUSTIN , Texas -- A state assistant attorney general received a report a year ago that graphically detailed the sexual abuse of inmates at a youth prison but declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns , according to e-mails obtained Friday by The Associated Press .
Attorney general spokesman Jerry Strickland said the lawyer , Will Tatum , should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the February 2006 e-mail , but he did n't follow agency procedures .
The abuse allegations at the West Texas State School in Pyote are at the center of a widening scandal at the Texas Youth Commission .
State leaders dispatched law enforcement officials this week to the commission 's headquarters and all 22 of its youth facilities , including the school , after learning that TYC officials knew about abuse claims for months but did nothing .
Texas Ranger Brian Burzynski , who sent the e-mail , told lawmakers this week that he had pursued the case since 2005 but could not get federal , state or local officials to prosecute .
State Attorney General Greg Abbott has since opened an investigation .
Two days after Burzynski sent the e-mail , Tatum correctly told him that the Ward County district attorney would have to ask Abbott 's office for help on the case , Strickland said .
" However , knowing the seriousness of the allegations contained in that e-mail , action would have been taken by the attorney general 's office , and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible , " he added .
Tatum declined to comment Friday evening .
Before Burzynski's e-mail was released , attorneys from Abbott 's office said Friday that they would appear the week of March 19 before a Ward County grand jury that will investigate the case .
Burzynski's report included several statements from students who said they were molested by two former officials at the Pyote school .
Neither man has been charged .
Ward County District Attorney Randall Reynolds has said the cases stalled because of a " breakdown in communications . "
Burzynski described a different scenario in his e-mail to Tatum , which Abbott 's office released to the AP under the Texas Public Information Act .
He said he filed the case with federal prosecutors because his local prosecutor was " very weak . "
But Department of Justice officials did n't approve the indictment they prepared because the suspects could be charged only with misdemeanors under federal law .
" In short , I had to file it with the local DA that I did n't want to in the beginning , " Burzynski 's e-mail said .
" He has n't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will before the statute of limitations expires . "
At a Thursday legislative hearing , Republican state Sen. Chris Harris of Arlington criticized Abbott 's office for not getting involved sooner .
When questioned by Harris on Thursday , Deputy Attorney General Don Clemmer said he did not know if anyone from his office talked to the district attorney .
Strickland said Friday that the attorney general 's office began an aggressive investigation once Reynolds asked for help this January .
Reynolds did not return a telephone call seeking comment .
Also Friday , the TYC official responsible for investigating abuse claims was suspended with pay amid allegations that he redacted information related to reports of sexual abuse by the Pyote facility 's employees .
Ray Worsham , director of the TYC 's office of youth care investigations , had participated in an internal investigation into the abuse claims .
" There were allegations that he had done some unauthorized redacting of documents , " said TYC spokesman Jim Hurley .
" I can't comment on the legality of what was done , but ethically it 's wrong .
No state employee should ever do that .
It will not be tolerated . "
Worsham is being suspended while the allegations are investigated , Hurley said .
There was no telephone listing for Worsham .

US companies that lay off large numbers of workers should n't be allowed to hire workers with H1B visas if they 're planning a large layoff that will reduce their total number of US workers , according to two senators .
Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) and Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) have introduced an amendment to the Senate 's immigration reform bill that would not only restrict H - 1B hires from companies that have had " mass layoffs " within the last year but would also require companies that are planning to announce mass layoffs to cut their foreign workers as well .
If the company has already received approval to hire new H - 1B workers but plans to make layoffs soon , it must inform the foreign workers that their visas will expire within 60 days .
The purpose of the bill is to ensure that US companies are not exploiting the H - 1B system by essentially replacing US workers with cheaper foreign talent .
The amendment currently defines " mass layoffs " as a company with more than 100 employees letting go of 50 or more workers , but it offers an exemption for companies that provide written certification that the company 's total number of employees in the US wo n't be reduced as a result of the layoff .
Under that definition of mass layoffs , a number of prominent US companies — ones that have applied for thousands of H - 1B visas between them — could be under scrutiny .
IBM , Motorola , and Dell are all companies that have either recently cut or plan to cut thousands of workers in the US .
" If there is truly a shortage of workers in the US why would some of the largest high - tech companies layoff thousands of American workers ? " asked Sanders and Grassley in a statement seen by Computerworld .
" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , over the next decade , 2 million jobs will be created in mathematics , engineering , computer science , and physical science .
That equates to about 200,000 jobs a year times 10 equals 2 million jobs , " said Sanders on the Senate floor in May .
" Under this legislation , the number of H - 1B visas would increase to as many as 180,000 a year .
That means virtually every job , about 90 percent that will be created in the high - tech sector over the next 10 years , could conceivably be taken by a H - 1B visa holder . "
Those companies as well as others continue to push for more foreign workers , however .
The H - 1B cap for 2007 — 65,000 workers — was filled almost instantly before the fiscal year even started , and prominent companies like Microsoft and now Google claim that without the allowance of more foreign workers , they are left unable to fill gaps in talent .
California Gov. Schwarzenegger also wrote a letter to the Senate majority and minority leaders voicing his support for the increase .
The amendment joins the crowd of 100 - some others proposed for the immigration reform bill , so there will be some stiff competition for attention among the Senate .
Both sides are lobbying hard for their position , and so the fate of Grassley 's and Sanders ' bill could go either way .
People call me a lot of things .
Nobody would ever call me a CIO , but after reading CIO magazine a little bit , I guess that ’s basically what I am .
Maybe I ’m a little younger than you .
A little more techy .
I know my routers and code .
Most of the guys I work with , they do n’t like computers .
They get frustrated .
Lots of times they want to shoot their computers , like that guy in Colorado did .
I printed out that story and gave it to one of my guys .
He loved it , especially the part where the guy hung the dead computer on the wall of his bar .
“ I love this Colorado guy , ” he said .
And he passed it around to all the guys .
“ You have to read this story MIT gave me . ”
Yeah , they call me MIT , like , “ Let ’s ask MIT if we can set up an online account ” or “ Maybe MIT can make a website for that . ”
A website for what ?
For making money , what else ?
Is n’t that why anyone sets up a website ?

How You Can Fight Cybercrime
How the Mob uses IT
What Adult and Gaming Sites Can Teach You About Innovation
A Brief History of Cybercrime
Yeah , I deal with the same stuff you do .
Same headaches .
I ’m constantly fixing stuff and trying to do whatever helps the bosses grow the business , as you call it .
Bosses .
I mean , bosses are the worst , right ?
The Penny Stock Scam
We ’re in a real boom right now .
Credit cards .
Gambling .
You heard about that stock deal ?
The one that uses that new kind of spam ?
Image spam ?
This is an old - fashioned pump - and - dump scam but with a cool techno twist .
This was n’t mine , but I know a guy who knows the guy who set it up .
Here ’s how he worked it .
First , he rented a botnet .
That was for e-mail distribution .
He pays , I do n’t know , say $ 50 Gs for a month , turns around and promises the bot - herder a taste in exchange for that month ’s usage and some guaranteed uptime .
You know , he says , deliver me 10 million e-mail messages and I ’ll guarantee you some back - end cash .
So the bot - herder knows a kid who wrote this absolutely killer image spam application that creates the e-mail messages .
Pays him a flat fee .
I mean , the kid could ’ve asked for a lot more , but a lot of these programmers are pretty young and dumb .
You wave some cash and they think , “ Flat - screen TV ! ” Anyway , he tells the kid to make the program create advertisements for pink - slip stocks , those unlisted ones that trade for pennies .
It all gets done in like 15 minutes after they get some of the basic wording down .
So then this guy sets up offshore accounts online ( in Brazil , I think ) to collect the investments .
His guys all buy something like 10,000 shares at 30 cents per .
Then the botnet goes to work .
Starts mass mailing the ads for the stocks .
And the beauty part is those little messages get by all the spam filters because the filters are looking for text , but with the image spam all the filters see is a million different images , each one unique , even though they all say the same thing :
Buy this stock .
( For more about this technique , read The Scourge of Image Spam . )
Genius .
Finally , enough people invest to drive up the price .
Eighty cents a share .
A buck .
Two .
Eventually , our guys sell , make a nice chunk of change , the stock tanks and the suckers who got in on the e-mail tip lose their shirts .
Like I said , a classic pump - and - dump , but back in the day it was a lot harder to do .
It required a lot of legwork , relationships with reporters and brokers .
Compared to that , this is , like , nothing .
I know what you ’re thinking :
Who believes an anonymous e-mail that says such - and - such company you ’ve never heard of is at a quarter a share now but is heading to five bucks ?
Hey , I do n’t know , but you send out 10 million messages , you get 1,000 to invest , that ’s only , what ?
A hundredth of a percent ?
I ’d say the sucker population is a lot bigger than that .
It was a great little business .
One of those stocks hit six bucks !
But then the feds sniffed it out and suspended trading on those penny stocks in March .
Maybe when things cool off , it ’ll pick up again .
By that time , the spam filters will probably have adjusted and we ’ll have to go back to the programmers for their latest bots .
Everyone Wants IDs , Just Not Their Own
The big money is in credentials .
Look , the world runs on credit , and what you need to get credit are personal credentials .
That ’s what everyone is after right now .
And that ’s where a lot of our investments are : credentials for lines of credit .
That TJX thing last January ?
No , not me .
But let ’s say I had beers with someone who might have worked on that job .
It sounds like the heist of the century , right ?
What , 40 million personal records ?
But really it ’s pretty basic stuff .
If you want to get into the credentials market , you do three things :
One , get inside access to someone who stores lots of personal data .
Retail is great for that .
Think about how many cards are swiped every second at those places .
Two , invest in antiforensics , because once you ’re in , you want to stay invisible until you ’re done .
( For more on antiforensics , see How Online Criminals Make Themselves Tough to Find , Near Impossible to Nab . )
Three , after you got the credentials , behave .
I ’ll explain that one in a minute .
The papers say the wiseguys got into TJX , they got employee IDs , by intercepting wireless data flowing between cash registers , handheld price - checking devices and such .
Maybe .
But this is how I ’d do it .
Inside access .
That ’s easy .
You spread some USB keys around .
People see them and go , Cool , free dongle !
Only when they plug them in , a little program installs some bots or keyloggers onto their machine .
From there , you root around until you get deeper into the network .
( There are other ways too .
Dumpster diving for paper records and credit card statements .
Paying off the custodial staff .
This stuff is as old as time ; computers just make it easier . )
After gaining access , it ’s time to invest in antiforensics .
Look , I do n’t care if they can see what I did as long as they ca n’t see it was me that done it .
We have this saying here about antiforensics :
Make it hard for them to find you and impossible for them to prove they found you .
We ’ve got a whole bunch of software that allows us to cover our tracks and keep us basically invisible while we ’re inside someone ’s system .
What ’s great is a lot of antiforensic tools are free .
They ’re all over the Internet .
We buy others , like encryption programs and data wipers like Evidence Eliminator .
This guy I had beers with says a few guys are even experimenting with ways to make other guys look guilty .
You know , set someone up , send the cops down the wrong path .
At that point , you install a little program that collects the credentials .
Sometimes we use ’em ; most of the time we sell ’em .
We ’ve been working on a subscription service .
You pay for access to credentials for a certain period of time .
We can get $ 1,000 a month or more for a subscription pretty easy .
That adds up .
But what we ’ve run into — a big problem — is that lots of guys get their hands on this information and just start buying stupid stuff .
They have no discipline .
Look at TJX .
Those guys got busted for using the credentials they lifted to buy gift cards for , what , like $ 20 Gs or something ?
I mean , you buy a $ 20,000 gift card , someone ’s going to notice .
So do n’t do Visa ’s job for them .
All it takes is one jerk who gets some credit and buys a Bentley to take down an entire business .
Find guys who can wait to use the credentials and then , when they do , use them in a way that looks normal .
Other People Gamble ; We Don’t
Right now , we ’re setting up a service out of Costa Rica .
It ’s a —how do I put it ?— it ’s a high - risk , high - return investment service for sports fans .
So how do I set up something like that ?
Like any project , with a lot of legwork .
I ’ve got to get my guy in Costa Rica to set up the back - end servers .
Costa Rica ’s great because everything ’s available right in one building .
I call my guy and say , “ It ’s MIT .
I need some stuff . ”
He just walks down the hall to the ISP , gets servers and backups , and then goes upstairs to the Web developers .
It ’s out - of - the - box , like calling up IBM Global Services or something .
There ’s even a little online payment service outfit down there .
We like it better than the big ones up here because those guys , they ’re better with international currency and security .
After we get all that going , we ’ve got to do all the testing .
I ’m telling you , it ’s really not much different than those e-commerce projects I read about in CIO .
We do the same due diligence .
Same troubleshooting .
Same thing with bosses yelling , “ MIT , you got that site up yet ?
Super Bowl ’s in a few weeks .
Site ’s gotta be up for that ! ”
They ask for some ROI up front , by the way .
It ’s a little more informal than the way most of your readers do it .
They ’ll ask , “ Ballpark , what do we gotta spend ? ” I give them a number .
They say , “ What can we clear in an average month ? ” I give them another number .
I ’m not making these up either .
I ask around .
I mean , that ’s cost - benefit analysis right there , right ?
Anyway , once that site ’s up and running it ’ll be a nice little business … for the overseas market , of course .
Even Crooks Need Security
I invest in top - notch security because , believe me , gaming sites are constantly dealing with extortion .
Criminals .
Not a day goes by when a site does n’t have some Russian hacker launching a DDoS attack , asking for cash to call it off .
We encrypt everything , and we ’ve got pretty severe authentication for access .
We do n’t outsource or contract the security .
We keep it in - house .
I pay my security guy well .
I ’d say about 25 to 30 percent above what you ’d pay .
Met him at the Black Hat conference in Vegas a couple of years ago .
I liked him right away because he was n’t presenting or bragging about what a hotshot he was .
He was in the back , taking notes , trying to learn .
Quiet .
I knew right away he ’d fit in .
I ’ve also tasked him ( that ’s how you say it , right ? ) with internal security .
Basically , his job is chief privacy officer for a bunch of guys who really value privacy .
All this technology — phones , the Internet — it ’s all great for making money , but the problem is , everything gets logged .
My security guy has written and used lots of antiforensic tools to erase those logs , and I ’m comfortable telling my boss we have better privacy than the big banks .
My security guy knows how to disable the GPS in our cell phones .
He ’s building some routing programs , sort of like that Onion Router project that , like it says on their website , “ prevents the transport medium from knowing who is communicating with whom ” so that anything we send over the Internet is scrambled through different routes and hops all over the world , completely anonymous and untraceable .
And everything , I mean everything , is encrypted .
Say someone stole the servers we keep here at the home office .
My guy designed it so that really only two people can access the data : me and him .
We have the private keys and no one else does .
Not even the boss .
My Kind of Guys
The guys I keep , or keep on a kind of retainer , are the ones that show me something extra .
We had one guy who came to us selling a great new way to set up temporary international cell phone accounts , using credentials bought in the identity market .
Guys will pay a lot for a disposable international cell phone .
We bought some and were so impressed we decided to get into business with him .
He set up the phones ; we handled distribution .
I asked the guy what else he was working on .
He flips his laptop around and shows me his own website where he ’s auctioning off credit credentials to the highest bidder .
Slick .
I said to him , “ You could be our R&D . ”
He said , “ Cool . ”
And that was that .
Compared to you guys , I ’m pretty lucky with talent .
My guys are way ahead on the technology .
They work hard .
They ’re innovative and entrepreneurial .
I think they ’re some of the most talented IT staff around .
Business - Technology Alignment Among Thieves
Actually , there is one way you and I are different .
I read all those stories in CIO about how hard you have to work to align technology with the business ’s goals .
That ’s one problem I do n’t have .
My bosses do n’t let me spend a dime on anything that ’s not going to make them money .
Why should they ?
And I would n’t even think about investing in a huge project that might fail to live up to expectations .
I do n’t get play money to buy technology that does n’t work .
I do n’t have vendors paying the freight to conferences at swank resorts to convince me to invest in something that ’s half - developed and overhyped .
I never use jargon .
I spend zero time doing PowerPoints .
Speculation ?
That ’s not part of our business model .
So maybe I do n’t get the newest gadgets all the time but , man , I am aligned .
With the business .
With the bosses .
There ’s really no other choice , you know ?
CSO Executive Editor Scott Berinato can be reached at sberinato@cxo.com .
Via Alexander Cockburn , here are Noam Chomsky 's thoughts ( acute and deeply informed , as always ) on the probability that the Bush administration will attack Iran :
They 're desperate .
Everything they touch is in ruins .
They 're even in danger of losing control over Middle Eastern oil -- to China , the topic that 's rarely discussed but is on every planner or corporation exec 's mind , if they 're sane .
Iran already has observer status at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization -- from which the US was pointedly excluded .
Chinese trade with Saudi Arabia , even military sales , is growing fast .
With the Bush administration in danger of losing Shiite Iraq , where most of the oil is ( and most Saudi oil in regions with a harshly oppressed Shiite population ) , they may be in real trouble .
Under these circumstances , they 're unpredictable .
They might go for broke , and hope they can salvage something from the wreckage .
If they do bomb , I suspect it will be accompanied by a ground assault in Khuzestan , near the Gulf , where the oil is ( and an Arab population -- there already is an Ahwazi liberation front , probably organized by the CIA , which the US can " defend " from the evil Persians ) , and then they can bomb the rest of the country to rubble .
And show who 's boss .
Actually I disagree with him about the likelihood of a ground assault .
As insane as the Bush administration may be , they know that the global response to an unprovoked attack on Iran would likely be nothing short of ferocious , and so I 'd guess they would attack with little or no warning and try to limit the attack to as short a time period as possible ( e.g. the three days mentioned in this analysis , or even fewer ) in order to nullify organized resistance in the US and throughout the world .
A ground assault would be too uncertain and would take too long .
I 'm sickened more than I can say by the thought that these bloodthirsty fools are plotting in every way they can to add yet more bodies to their mountains of innocent dead .
As useless as it is , I offer my apologies to the people of Iran for the crimes my country has committed against you in the past , and for the more direct and terrible crimes it is contemplating now .
I only hope we can stop it .
Tins of …anything .
The contents may be appreciated , but chances are the tins themselves are not .
Save some metal from the recycling ( or dump ) this year and package your goodies in something else .
( Maybe a paper bag ? )
Coffee mugs .
Unless you know the person is a coffee drinker that ’s always running short on mugs , there is a limit to the number of mugs someone can use .
( I suspect this is especially true for teachers . )
Scented anything ( bath oils , perfumes , lotions ) if you do n’t know exactly which specific brands and scents the recipient loves — or even whether they enjoy those types of things at all .
Otherwise , nothing screams “ last minute gift ” or “ I had no idea what to get you ” like a random bottle of perfume .
Gifts that are bought just for the sake of having something physical to give .
Remember , the idea behind gift giving is to find something that the receiver would like , enjoy , and / or use — not to show up with a random gift .
If you want them to have something to unwrap , but think they would enjoy a gift certificate or tickets to an event , wrap up the paper item instead .
Google has hired a bunch of my friends and professional acquaintances , and I ’ve met a few more from the growing Chicago office , and a number of them are zombies .
Conversations run like this :
Me : Hey , did you hear about [ random technical development ] ?
Googler : Yeah , it ’s real cool .
Especially for [ slightly offbeat application ] .
Me : That ’s an interesting idea .
Hmm , especially if you wanted to use it for [ related research topic ] .
Googler : …
Me : I mean , that would work out great .
It would have an [ interesting performance characteristic ] , especially for large datasets .
Googler : …
Me : Hmm , do you think it might fix [ persnickety sub- problem ] if you also use [ other technique or product ] ?
I think it ’s likely …
Googler : [ deafening silence and refusal of eye contact ]
Me : Hello ?
Googler : … braaaaaains …
OK , the last line is whimsy , but the rest is the verbatim compilation of a dozen conversations .
Google employees get distracted by mentally rereading their NDA and figuring out what they can say , ca n’t say , and ca n’t say that they ca n’t say .
It just gets worse if you keep talking and extrapolating ( that is to say , holding a conversation ) because you ’re giving them O ( n2 interrelations + m potential suggestions from them ) more topics to analyze .
I ’ve never quite managed to crash them , but I imagine it ’s entirely possible given the NP nature of conversations .
The fellow coder who inspired this post by pointing out the blank stares to me must remain anonymous due to their recent zombification .
It 's enough to make Henry David Thoreau weep .
New England – the home of Vermont maple trees bursting with sweet syrup , and balsam fir and red spruce spread across New Hampshire 's White Mountains – is losing its forests .
Of all America 's forests under pressure from development , New England 's are shrinking the fastest .
The problem is severe enough that some conservation groups say they have limited time to act .
" The window for conserving forests is closing , " says Andy Swinton , director of field science with The Nature Conservancy , a nonprofit habitat conservation organization .
But " there 's really an opportunity here , because the next 20 years will determine the character of New England forests .
This is a race against time , and the time to act is now . "
The region 's forests had made quite a comeback in the past two centuries :
As agriculture declined , fields went back to wooded land .
Now , however , those forests are under threat – from homeowners , this time .
In their push to create more housing in an area where home prices are already through the roof , developers are moving into wooded land .
The numbers are stark , particularly in southern New England .
By 2050 , 70 percent of Rhode Island and 61 percent of Connecticut will be urbanized , according to a recent report in the Journal of Forestry by two researchers with the US Agriculture Department 's Forest Service .
Massachusetts is already losing 40 acres a day to development , estimates Mass Audubon .
These three states will lose the highest percentage of forest of any state by mid-century , the Forest Service researchers say .
Part of the reason for the region 's forest loss is its population density .
Its urban areas are already so developed that they 're pushing out , often into surrounding forests .
The other factor is New England 's development pattern and lifestyle .
Take long - distance commuting .
The Southwest may be famous for its vast metropolises , but the trend is actually more pronounced in New England , says Kathy Sferra , a land protection expert at Mass Audubon .
For example :
To be able to afford the cost of living , many workers live in less expensive housing far from the urban centers where they work .
That leads to more crowded highways .
In addition to the 40 acres the state loses every day to sprawling development , it loses an additional 38 acres to the " hidden " cost of development , such as road construction .
And , as in the rest of New England , most of Massachusetts ' residential developments are low density , meaning few people living in large houses on big lots .
Residential lot sizes have increased 47 percent since 1970 in Massachusetts , according to Mass Audubon .
New England 's average lot size for new residential construction is the largest in the country at 1.3 acres , and its median lot size is three times the national average , says the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Center for Real Estate and the Massachusetts Housing Partnership .
Meanwhile , the state 's household size has shrunk 20 percent since 1970 to 2.5 people per household .
Small wonder then that while New England 's population increased 6.6 percent between 1990 and 2000 , its total housing units grew 7.4 percent , according to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training .
Houses are also getting bigger .
The National Association of Home Builders found that 40 percent of new homes in the Northeast have four or more bedrooms , making the region the national leader in terms of the size of homes .
These trends have spurred conservation groups to work more strategically , buying and protecting large plots of land in key areas rather than small , isolated locations .
" We 've learned that doing conservation willy - nilly does n't help because we end up with fragmented forests , " says Mr. Swinton .
" Since development is going to happen , we now know we need systematic , collaborative planning with the government , land trusts , and nonprofits to make sure that development and conserved forest area are intelligently designed . "
For example : The Nature Conservancy worked with West Greenwich , R.I. , and other conservation groups to purchase 1,700 acres of forest surrounding its town in an effort to protect the land .
The conservancy 's Borderlands Project is looking to accomplish a similar feat in another town in Rhode Island or Connecticut .
Conservation groups are also helping local governments improve their planning for infrastructure that leads to development , such as roads and Interstates , while minimizing sprawl and forest destruction .
State governments are also getting involved .
Last month , Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell ( R ) created a state office to " plot a new , antisprawl course . "
Rhode Island is now developing a land - use plan to encourage urban - center development .
Massachusetts announced Aug. 4 that it would spend $ 50 million on conservation over the next five years , an increase of $ 20 million over its conservation spending during the past four years .
Forest - conservation groups next want to convince New England state governments to allocate some of the revenue generated through their greenhouse - gas reduction initiative to forest protection , according to Swinton .
Conservationists say that they 'll need to bring all their tools to bear on the challenge of deforestation .
" Forests in this area made a comeback in the last century , but it looks like the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction , " he says .
Absolutely despicable :
Brian D. Kelly did n’t think he was doing anything illegal when he used his videocamera to record a Carlisle police officer during a traffic stop .
Making movies is one of his hobbies , he said , and the stop was just another interesting event to film .
Now he ’s worried about going to prison or being burdened with a criminal record .
Kelly , 18 , of Carlisle , was arrested on a felony wiretapping charge , with a penalty of up to 7 years in state prison .
His camera and film were seized by police during the May 24 stop , he said , and he spent 26 hours in Cumberland County Prison until his mother posted her house as security for his $ 2,500 bail .
Kelly is charged under a state law that bars the intentional interception or recording of anyone ’s oral conversation without their consent .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - One in three Americans expects a U.S. recession in the next year , and less than a quarter think home prices will rise , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
Construction work continues on new homes in Carlsbad , California September 18 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
Hispanics and African - Americans were more likely than whites to predict a recession , reflecting a deeper sense of job and economic anxiety among minorities , who represent a disproportionately large share of lower - income groups .
“ There has been much , much , much more talk about a recession in the last 30 days than there had been before , ” pollster John Zogby said , noting that the key factors behind the latest downturn worries were issues that literally hit home for the general public -- housing and jobs .
The survey of 1,011 likely voters was conducted September 13 - 16 , about a week after a government report showed an unexpected drop in jobs in August , the first such decline in four years .
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
Nearly 31 percent said they expected home prices in their area to stay about the same in the next year , while 35.5 percent expected them to drop a little , and 8.5 percent thought they would drop a lot .
Only 4.2 percent expected home prices to rise a lot , while 18.7 percent thought they would go up a little .
The rest were not sure .
“ That ’s massive , ” Zogby said .
“ Homes are seen not only as part of living the American dream , but they ’re also seen as an investment .
This sort of anticipation is very unhealthy because it drives behavior .
This is like consumer confidence .
When you add it all together , it is ( the makings of ) an economic slowdown . ”
SPENDING SLOWDOWN
Many economists worry that consumer spending will suffer along with the slumping housing market .
Millions of homeowners took out home equity loans during the five - year housing boom that ended about 18 months ago , and some of that money helped fuel a consumer spending spree .
Consumer spending accounts for two - thirds of the U.S. economy , so if tightening credit terms restrict spending , the economic damage could be serious .
The poll found that banks and other lenders received most of the blame for the mortgage crisis , which began with rising defaults among borrowers with poor credit histories but has since spread to more credit - worthy homeowners .
Almost 43 percent of those polled said banks and other lenders were to blame , followed by 12.6 percent who pointed the finger at the U.S. government , and 11.8 percent who said borrowers had only themselves to blame .
“ Banks are the new oil companies , ” Zogby said .
“ They ’re the ones who are on the front lines . ”
Wall Street has come under criticism for profiting from a lucrative business in reselling mortgages with little regard for risk , while the Federal Reserve has incurred the wrath of some investors and lawmakers who say the central bank ’s low interest rates inflated the housing market bubble .
But less than 10 percent of Americans blamed either group .
Zogby said the average American was unaware of the role Wall Street played in securitizing and reselling mortgage - backed assets .
And while consumers were well aware of which mortgage broker or lender turned them down for a loan , they were less knowledgeable about how the Federal Reserve ’s actions affected their day - to - day lives .
Overall , about 56 percent described their personal financial situation as “ good ” or “ excellent , ” down from the prior month ’s reading of just over 59 percent .
Some 64 percent said they felt “ very ” or “ fairly ” secure in their current job , down slightly from August ’s 65 percent .
All 51 Indonesian airlines will be banned from the EU
An updated blacklist of unsafe airlines also includes operators from Bulgaria , Moldova , Angola and Ukraine .
Indonesian carriers do not currently fly to Europe , but the ban serves as a warning to consumers not to use these airlines elsewhere in the world .
" European citizens should avoid flying with these carriers , " an EU official said .
" They are really unsafe . "
The last version of the blacklist , published in March , featured 91 airlines , 74 of them from Africa , and most of the rest from Kyrgyzstan .
The new list includes all 51 carriers from Indonesia , eight from Moldova , six from Bulgaria , Angolan carrier TAAG Angola Airlines and Volare Aviation from Ukraine .
It will be formally approved on 4 July and published the next day .
Russian restrictions
The EU also notes that Russia is currently blocking all flights to the EU by four passenger airlines and has placed restrictions on six other companies .
We hope that the European Union can also give us the opportunity to improve
Indonesian ambassador to the EU , Nadjib Riphat Kesoema
Indonesia airlines ' safe to fly '
The new list , decided upon following advice from an EU air safety committee , is expected to be formalised within a week .
Garuda flew to Rome and Amsterdam until 2005 , and is planning to resume services to Amsterdam in 2008 .
Indonesia 's ambassador to the EU , Nadjib Riphat Kesoema , said Indonesian airlines were safe and he hoped the EU would review its decision at a meeting of air safety experts in October .
Series of accidents
" It is our commitment and our determination to have safety in our civil aviation , " he told the Reuters news agency .
" We hope that the European Union can also give us the opportunity to improve . "
Indonesian airlines have suffered a series of accidents this year .
On Monday , a government safety review promoted Garuda to the country 's top safety category , the only airline to achieve that level .
Adam Air was boosted to the second grade , having previously been ranked at the third level .
On New Year 's Day an Adam Air jet fell into the sea , killing all 102 people on board .
Some weeks later , another plane broke in half as it landed .
And in March , a Garuda Boeing 737 veered off a runway and burst into flames , leaving 21 dead .

These same essays appear in the “ Schneier on Security ” blog : < http://www.schneier.com/>.
An RSS feed is available .
In this issue :
Over the past several months , the state of California conducted the most comprehensive security review yet of electronic voting machines .
People I consider to be security experts analyzed machines from three different manufacturers , performing both a red - team attack analysis and a detailed source code review .
Serious flaws were discovered in all machines and , as a result , the machines were all decertified for use in California elections .
The reports are worth reading , as is much of the commentary on the topic .
The reviewers were given an unrealistic timetable and had trouble getting needed documentation .
The fact that major security vulnerabilities were found in all machines is a testament to how poorly they were designed , not to the thoroughness of the analysis .
Yet California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has conditionally recertified the machines for use , as long as the makers fix the discovered vulnerabilities and adhere to a lengthy list of security requirements designed to limit future security breaches and failures .
While this is a good effort , it has security completely backward .
It begins with a presumption of security :
If there are no known vulnerabilities , the system must be secure .
If there is a vulnerability , then once it ’s fixed , the system is again secure .
How anyone comes to this presumption is a mystery to me .
Is there any version of any operating system anywhere where the last security bug was found and fixed ?
Is there a major piece of software anywhere that has been , and continues to be , vulnerability - free ?
Yet again and again we react with surprise when a system has a vulnerability .
Last weekend at the hacker convention DefCon , I saw new attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) systems — those are embedded control systems found in infrastructure systems like fuel pipelines and power transmission facilities — electronic badge - entry systems , MySpace , and the high - security locks used in places like the White House .
I will guarantee you that the manufacturers of these systems all claimed they were secure , and that their customers believed them .
Earlier this month , the government disclosed that the computer system of the US - Visit border control system is full of security holes .
Weaknesses existed in all control areas and computing device types reviewed , the report said .
How exactly is this different from any large government database ?
I ’m not surprised that the system is so insecure ; I ’m surprised that anyone is surprised .
We ’ve been assured again and again that RFID passports are secure .
When researcher Lukas Grunwald successfully cloned one last year at DefCon , industry experts told us there was little risk .
This year , Grunwald revealed that he could use a cloned passport chip to sabotage passport readers .
Government officials are again downplaying the significance of this result , although Grunwald speculates that this or another similar vulnerability could be used to take over passport readers and force them to accept fraudulent passports .
Anyone care to guess who ’s more likely to be right ?
It ’s all backward .
Insecurity is the norm .
If any system — whether a voting machine , operating system , database , badge - entry system , RFID passport system , etc. — is ever built completely vulnerability - free , it ’ll be the first time in the history of mankind .
It ’s not a good bet .
Once you stop thinking about security backward , you immediately understand why the current software security paradigm of patching does n’t make us any more secure .
If vulnerabilities are so common , finding a few does n’t materially reduce the quantity remaining .
A system with 100 patched vulnerabilities is n’t more secure than a system with 10 , nor is it less secure .
A patched buffer overflow does n’t mean that there ’s one less way attackers can get into your system ; it means that your design process was so lousy that it permitted buffer overflows , and there are probably thousands more lurking in your code .
Diebold Election Systems has patched a certain vulnerability in its voting - machine software twice , and each patch contained another vulnerability .
Do n’t tell me it ’s my job to find another vulnerability in the third patch ; it ’s Diebold ’s job to convince me it has finally learned how to patch vulnerabilities properly .
Several years ago , former National Security Agency technical director Brian Snow began talking about the concept of “ assurance ” in security .
Snow , who spent 35 years at the NSA building systems at security levels far higher than anything the commercial world deals with , told audiences that the agency could n’t use modern commercial systems with their backward security thinking .
Assurance was his antidote :
“ Assurances are confidence - building activities demonstrating that :
“ 1 . The system ’s security policy is internally consistent and reflects the requirements of the organization ,
“ 2 . There are sufficient security functions to support the security policy ,
“ 3 . The system functions to meet a desired set of properties and * only * those properties ,
“ 4 . The functions are implemented correctly , and
“ 5 . The assurances * hold up * through the manufacturing , delivery and life cycle of the system . ”
Basically , demonstrate that your system is secure , because I ’m just not going to believe you otherwise .
Assurance is less about developing new security techniques than about using the ones we have .
It ’s all the things described in books like “ Building Secure Software , ” “ Software Security , ” and “ Writing Secure Code . ”
It ’s some of what Microsoft is trying to do with its Security Development Lifecycle ( SDL ) .
It ’s the Department of Homeland Security ’s Build Security In program .
It ’s what every aircraft manufacturer goes through before it puts a piece of software in a critical role on an aircraft .
It ’s what the NSA demands before it purchases a piece of security equipment .
As an industry , we know how to provide security assurance in software and systems ; we just tend not to bother .
And most of the time , we do n’t care .
Commercial software , as insecure as it is , is good enough for most purposes .
And while backward security is more expensive over the life cycle of the software , it ’s cheaper where it counts : at the beginning .
Most software companies are short - term smart to ignore the cost of never - ending patching , even though it ’s long - term dumb .
Assurance is expensive , in terms of money and time for both the process and the documentation .
But the NSA needs assurance for critical military systems ;
Boeing needs it for its avionics .
And the government needs it more and more : for voting machines , for databases entrusted with our personal information , for electronic passports , for communications systems , for the computers and systems controlling our critical infrastructure .
Assurance requirements should be common in IT contracts , not rare .
It ’s time we stopped thinking backward and pretending that computers are secure until proven otherwise .

California Secretary of State Bowen ’s certification decisions are online .
She has totally decertified the ES&S Inkavote Plus system , used in L.A. County , because of ES&S noncompliance with the Top to Bottom Review .
The Diebold and Sequoia systems have been decertified and conditionally recertified .
The same was done with one Hart Intercivic system ( system 6.2.1 ) .
( Certification of the Hart system 6.1 was voluntarily withdrawn . )
To those who thought she was staging this review as security theater , this seems like evidence to the contrary .
She wants to do the right thing , but has no idea how to conduct a security review .

A week before publication , digital photographs of every page were available on BitTorrent .
I fielded a lot of press calls on this , mostly from reporters asking me what the publisher could have done differently .
Honestly , I do n’t think it was possible to keep the book under wraps .
Millions of copies of the book were headed to all four corners of the globe .
There were simply too many people who must be trusted in order for the security to hold .
And all it took was one untrustworthy person — one truck driver , one bookstore owner , one warehouse worker — to leak the book .
But conversely , I do n’t think the publishers should care .
Anyone fan - crazed enough to read digital photographs of the pages a few days before the real copy comes out is also someone who is going to buy a real copy .
And anyone who will read the digital photographs * instead * of the real book would have borrowed a copy from a friend .
My guess is that the publishers lost zero sales , and that the pre-release simply increased the press frenzy .
I ’m kind of amazed the book had n’t leaked sooner .
And that was just the first leak .
Shortly thereafter , versions in Word , plain text , and formatted PDF were likewise available via BitTorrent .

A TSA screener does n’t like the look of a homemade battery charger , and refuses to let it on an airplane .
Interesting story , both for the escalation procedure the TSA screener followed , and the author ’s observation .
Basically , people with no expertise in what ’s normal are being asked to determine what ’s normal .
Something that ’s allowed one time might not be allowed the next .
And that ’s the problem : the TSA is both arbitrary and capricious , and it ’s impossible to follow the rules because no one knows how they will be applied .

A recent article talked about a security hole at the Phoenix Airport : an hours - long window when any airport employee can bring anything into the airport , without any screening at all .
I ’m not impressed .
On the one hand , it ’s a big security hole that not everyone knew was there .
On the other hand , airport employees are allowed to bring stuff in and out of airports without screening all the time .
So yes , the airports are n’t secure — but they never have been , so what ’s the big deal ?
The real issue here is that people do n’t understand that an airport is a complex system and that securing it means more than passenger screening .

For a few months , German police tested a face recognition system .
Two hundred frequent travelers volunteered to have their faces recorded and three different systems tried to recognize the faces in the crowds of a train station .
Results : 60 % recognition at best , 30 % on average ( depending on light and other factors ) .
I ’m not impressed .

Steven D. Levitt , a blogger for The New York Times , is having a movie - plot threat contest .
Far more interesting than the suggested attacks are the commenters who accuse him of helping the terrorists .
Not that I ’m surprised ; there were people who accused me of helping the terrorists .

If an avian flu pandemic broke out tomorrow , would your company be ready for it ?
“ Computerworld ” published a series of articles on that question last year , prompted by a presentation analyst firm Gartner gave at a conference last November .
Among Gartner ’s recommendations : “ Store 42 gallons of water per data center employee — enough for a six - week quarantine — and do n’t forget about food , medical care , cooking facilities , sanitation and electricity . ”
And Gartner ’s conclusion , over half a year later : Pretty much no organizations are ready .
This does n’t surprise me at all .
It ’s not that organizations do n’t spend enough effort on disaster planning , although that ’s true ; it ’s that this really is n’t the sort of disaster worth planning for .
Disaster planning is critically important for individuals , families , organizations large and small , and governments .
For the individual , it can be as simple as spending a few minutes thinking about how he or she would respond to a disaster .
For example , I ’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what I would do if I lost the use of my computer , whether by equipment failure , theft or government seizure .
As a result , I have a pretty complex backup and encryption system , ensuring that 1 ) I ’d still have access to my data , and 2 ) no one else would .
On the other hand , I have n’t given any serious thought to family disaster planning , although others have .
For an organization , disaster planning can be much more complex .
What would it do in the case of fire , flood , earthquake , and so on ?
How would its business survive ?
The resultant disaster plan might include backup data centers , temporary staffing contracts , planned degradation of services , and a host of other products and service — and consultants to tell you how to use it all .
And anyone who does this kind of thing knows that planning is n’t enough : Testing your disaster plan is critical .
Far too often the backup software fails when it has to do an actual restore , or the diesel - powered emergency generator fails to kick in .
That ’s also the flaw with emergency kit links given below ; if you do n’t know how to use a compass or first - aid kit , having one in your car wo n’t do you much good .
But testing is n’t just valuable because it reveals practical problems with a plan .
It also has enormous ancillary benefits for your organization in terms of communication and team building .
There ’s nothing like a good crisis to get people to rely on each other .
Sometimes I think companies should forget about those team - building exercises that involve climbing trees and building fires , and instead pretend that a flood has taken out the primary data center .
It really does n’t matter what disaster scenario you ’re testing .
The real disaster wo n’t be like the test , regardless of what you do , so just pick one and go .
Whether you ’re an individual trying to recover from a simulated virus attack , or an organization testing its response to a hypothetical shooter in the building , you ’ll learn a lot about yourselves and your organization , as well as your plan .
There is a sweet spot , though , in disaster preparedness .
Some disasters are too small or too common to worry about .
( “ We ’re out of paper clips !?
Call the Crisis Response Team together .
I ’ll get the Paper Clip Shortage Readiness Program Directive Manual Plan . ” )
And others are too large or too rare .
It makes no sense to plan for total annihilation of the continent , whether by nuclear or meteor strike : that ’s obvious .
But depending on the size of the planner , many other disasters are also too large to plan for .
People can stockpile food and water to prepare for a hurricane that knocks out services for a few days , but not for a Katrina - like flood that knocks out services for months .
Organizations can prepare for losing a data center due to a flood , fire , or hurricane , but not for a Black - Death - scale epidemic that would wipe out a third of the population .
No one can fault bond trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald , which lost two thirds of its employees in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center , for not having a plan in place to deal with that possibility .
Another consideration is scope .
If your corporate headquarters burns down , it ’s actually a bigger problem for you than a citywide disaster that does much more damage .
If the whole San Francisco Bay Area were taken out by an earthquake , customers of affected companies would be far more likely to forgive lapses in service , or would go the extra mile to help out .
Think of the nationwide response to 9/11 ; the human “ just deal with it ” social structures kicked in , and we all muddled through .
In general , you can only reasonably prepare for disasters that leave your world largely intact .
If a third of the country ’s population dies , it ’s a different world .
The economy is different , the laws are different — the world is different .
You simply can’t plan for it ; there ’s no way you can know enough about what the new world will look like .
Disaster planning only makes sense within the context of existing society .
What all of this means is that any bird flu pandemic will very likely fall outside the corporate disaster - planning sweet spot .
We ’re just guessing on its infectiousness , of course , but ( despite the alarmism from two and three years ago ) , likely scenarios are either moderate to severe absenteeism because people are staying home for a few weeks — any organization ought to be able to deal with that — or a major disaster of proportions that dwarf the concerns of any organization .
There ’s not much in between .
Honestly , if you think you ’re heading toward a world where you need to stash six weeks ’ worth of food and water in your company ’s closets , do you really believe that it will be enough to see you through to the other side ?
A blogger commented on what I said in one article : “ Schneier is using what I would call the nuclear war argument for doing nothing .
If there ’s a nuclear war nothing will be left anyway , so why waste your time stockpiling food or building fallout shelters ?
It ’s entirely out of your control .
It ’s someone else ’s responsibility .
Do n’t worry about it . ”
Almost .
Bird flu , pandemics , and disasters in general — whether man-made like 9/11 , natural like bird flu , or a combination like Katrina — are definitely things we should worry about .
The proper place for bird flu planning is at the government level .
( These are also the people who should worry about nuclear and meteor strikes . )
But real disasters do n’t exactly match our plans , and we are best served by a bunch of generic disaster plans and a smart , flexible organization that can deal with anything .
The key is preparedness .
Much more important than planning , preparedness is about setting up social structures so that people fall into doing something sensible when things go wrong .
Think of all the wasted effort — and even more wasted * desire * — to do something after Katrina because there was no way for most people to help .
Preparedness is about getting people to react when there ’s a crisis .
It ’s something the military trains its soldiers for .
This advice holds true for organizations , families , and individuals as well .
And remember , despite what you read about nuclear accidents , suicide terrorism , genetically engineered viruses , and mutant man-eating badgers , you live in the safest society in the history of mankind .

A good rebuttal to this essay :
http://www.computerweekly.com/s/david_lacey/…
This essay originally appeared on Wired.com :
http://www.wired.com/print/politics/security/…
A leaked TSA memo warns screeners to be on the lookout for terrorists staging dry runs through airport security .
( The TSA issued a short statement following the leak . )
Honestly , the four incidents described , with photos , sure sound suspicious to me :
“ San Diego , July 7 . A U.S. person — either a citizen or a foreigner legally here — checked baggage containing two ice packs covered in duct tape .
The ice packs had clay inside them rather than the normal blue gel .
“ Milwaukee , June 4 .
A U.S. person ’s carryon baggage contained wire coil wrapped around a possible initiator , an electrical switch , batteries , three tubes and two blocks of cheese .
The bulletin said block cheese has a consistency similar to some explosives .
“ Houston , Nov. 8 , 2006 .
A U.S. person ’s checked baggage contained a plastic bag with a 9 - volt battery , wires , a block of brown clay - like minerals and pipes .
“ Baltimore , Sept. 16 , 2006 .
A couple ’s checked baggage contained a plastic bag with a block of processed cheese taped to another plastic bag holding a cellular phone charger .
The cheese and clay are stand - ins for plastic explosive .
And honestly , I do n’t care if someone is carrying a water bottle , wearing a head scarf , or buying a one - way ticket , but if someone has a block of cheese with wires and a detonator — I want the FBI to be called in .
Note that profiling did n’t seem to help here .
Three of the incidents involved U.S. persons , and one is unspecified .
Also , according to the report : “ Individuals involved in these incidents were of varying gender , and initial investigations do not link them with criminal or terrorist organizations .
However , most passengers ’ explanations for carrying the suspicious items were questionable , and some investigations are still ongoing . ”
I wish I had more information on what the “ questionable ” explanations were ; either these people are innocent or they should be investigated pretty heavily .
Later news reports said that the San Diego incident was bogus , and maybe all four were .
I ’m skeptical .
I ca n’t think of a valid explanation for “ wire coil wrapped around a possible initiator , an electrical switch , batteries , three tubes and two blocks of cheese . ”
I ’d like to know what it was .
Flagging suspicious items is what the TSA is supposed to do .
Unfortunately , “ suspicious ” is a subjective term , and problems arise when screeners are n’t competent enough to distinguish between “ potentially dangerous ” and “ just plain strange . ”
If bulletins like these are accompanied with real training , then we ’re getting some actual security out of the TSA .

In this otherwise lopsided article about security cameras , this one quote stands out :
“ But Steve Swain , who served for years with the London Metropolitan Police and its counter - terror operations , doubts the power of cameras to deter crime .
“ ‘ I do n’t know of a single incident where CCTV has actually been used to spot , apprehend or detain offenders in the act , ’ he said , referring to the London system .
Swain now works for Control Risk , an international security firm .
“ Asked about their role in possibly stopping acts of terror , he said pointedly : ‘ The presence of CCTV is irrelevant for those who want to sacrifice their lives to carry out a terrorist act . ’ “
And :
“ Swain does believe the cameras have great value in investigation work .
He also said they are necessary to reassure the public that law enforcement is being aggressive .
“ ‘ You need to do this piece of theater so that if the terrorists are looking at you , they can see that you ’ve got some measures in place , ’ he said . “
Did you get that ?
Swain does n’t believe that cameras deter crime , but he wants cities to spend millions on them so that the terrorists “ can see that you ’ve got some measures in place . ”
Anyone have any idea why we ’re better off doing this than other things that may actually deter crime and terrorism ?

One of the problems with airport security checkpoints is that the system is a single point of failure .
If someone slips through , the only way to regain security is for the entire airport to be emptied and everyone searched again .
This happens rarely , but when it does , it can close an airport for hours .
It happened last week at the Charlotte airport .
One sentence in the news report struck me : “ Passengers on another 15 planes that took off after the breach will have to go through screening again when they reach their destinations , the TSA said . ”
It ’s understandable why the TSA would want to screen everybody once someone evades security : that person could give his contraband to someone else .
And since the entire airport system is a single secure area — once you go through security at one airport , you are considered to be inside security at all airports — it makes sense for those passengers to be screened if they ’re changing planes .
But it must feel weird to have to go through screening after flying , before being able to leave the airport .
http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/08/10/charlotte.airport/
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is releasing details about last summer ’s liquid - bomb plot :
“ The components of that explosives mixture can be bought at any drugstore or supermarket ; however , there is some question whether the potential terrorists would have had the skill to properly mix and detonate their explosive cocktails in - flight .
“ But they can work — scientists at Sandia National Laboratory conducted a test using the formula , and when a small amount of liquid in a container was hit with a tiny burst of electrical current , a large explosion followed .
( Click on the video player on the right side of this page to view the video . )
“ The test results were reviewed today by ABC terrorism consultant Richard Clarke , who said that while frequent travelers are upset by the current limits on liquids in carry - on baggage , ‘ when they see this film , they ought to know it ’s worth going through those problems . ' ”
There has been a lot of speculation since last year about the plausibility of the plot , with most chemists falling on the “ unrealistic ” side .
I ’m still skeptical , especially because the liquid ban does n’t actually ban liquids .
If they ’re so dangerous , why can anyone take 12 ounces of any liquid on any plane at any time ?
That ’s the real question , which TSA Administrator Kip Hawley deftly did n’t answer in my conversation with him — see below .
( I brought it on a plane again yesterday : an opaque 12 - ounce bottle labeled “ saline , ” emptied and filled with another liquid , and then resealed .
I held it up to the TSA official and made sure it was okay .
It was . )
Another quote from the same article :
“ One official who briefed ABC News said explosives and security experts who examined the plot were ‘ stunned at the extent that the suspects had gamed the system to exploit its weaknesses . ’
“ ‘ There ’s no question that they had given a lot of thought to how they might smuggle containers with liquid explosives onto airplanes , ’ Chertoff said .
‘ Without getting into things that are still classified , they obviously paid attention to the ways in which they thought they might be able to disguise these explosives as very innocent types of everyday articles . ' ”
Well , yeah .
That ’s the game you ’re stuck playing .
From my conversation with Hawley ( that ’s me talking ) :
“ But you ’re playing a game you ca n’t win .
You ban guns and bombs , so the terrorists use box cutters .
You ban small blades and knitting needles , and they hide explosives in their shoes .
You screen shoes , so they invent a liquid explosive .
You restrict liquids , and they ’re going to do something else .
The terrorists are going to look at what you ’re confiscating , and they ’re going to design a plot to bypass your security . ”
Stop focusing on the tactics ; focus on the broad threats .

The Science and Technology Committee of the UK House of Lords has issued a report on “ Personal Internet Security . ”
It ’s 121 pages long .
Richard Clayton , who helped the committee , has a good summary of the report on his blog .
Among other things , the Lords recommend various consumer notification standards , a data - breach disclosure law , and a liability regime for software .
The Register writes that the report recommends the UK government :
“ Increase the resources and skills available to the police and criminal justice system to catch and prosecute e-criminals .
“ Establish a centralised and automated system , administered by law enforcement , for the reporting of e-crime .
“ Provide incentives to banks and other companies trading online to improve the data security by establishing a data security breach notification law .
“ Improve standards of new software and hardware by moving towards legal liability for damage resulting from security flaws .
“ Encourage Internet Service Providers to improve customer security offered by establishing a “ kite mark ” for internet services . ”
If that sounds like a lot of the things I ’ve been saying for years , there ’s a reason for that .
Earlier this year , I testified before the committee , where I recommended some of these things .

I do n’t recommend reading it ; it ’s absolutely huge , and a lot of it is corporate drivel .
In April , Kip Hawley , the head of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , invited me to Washington for a meeting .
Despite some serious trepidation , I accepted .
And it was a good meeting .
Most of it was off the record , but he asked me how the TSA could overcome its negative image .
I told him to be more transparent , and stop ducking the hard questions .
He said that he wanted to do that .
He did enjoy writing a guest blog post for “ Aviation Daily , ” but having a blog himself did n’t work within the bureaucracy .
What else could he do ?
This interview , conducted in May and June via e-mail , was one of my suggestions .
Bruce Schneier :
By today ’s rules , I can carry on liquids in quantities of three ounces or less , unless they ’re in larger bottles .
But I can carry on multiple three - ounce bottles .
Or a single larger bottle with a non-prescription medicine label , like contact lens fluid .
It all has to fit inside a one - quart plastic bag , except for that large bottle of contact lens fluid .
And if you confiscate my liquids , you ’re going to toss them into a large pile right next to the screening station — which you would never do if anyone thought they were actually dangerous .
Can you please convince me there ’s not an Office for Annoying Air Travelers making this sort of stuff up ?
Kip Hawley : Screening ideas are indeed thought up by the Office for Annoying Air Travelers and vetted through the Directorate for Confusion and Complexity , and then we review them to insure that there are sufficient unintended irritating consequences so that the blogosphere is constantly fueled .
Imagine for a moment that TSA people are somewhat bright , and motivated to protect the public with the least intrusion into their lives , not to mention travel themselves .
How might you engineer backwards from that premise to get to three ounces and a baggie ?
We faced a different kind of liquid explosive , one that was engineered to evade then - existing technology and process .
Not the old Bojinka formula or other well - understood ones — TSA already trains and tests on those .
After August 10 , we began testing different variants with the national labs , among others , and engaged with other countries that have sophisticated explosives capabilities to find out what is necessary to reliably bring down a plane .
We started with the premise that we should prohibit only what ’s needed from a security perspective .
Otherwise , we would have stuck with a total liquid ban .
But we learned through testing that that no matter what someone brought on , if it was in a small enough container , it was n’t a serious threat .
So what would the justification be for prohibiting lip gloss , nasal spray , etc ?
There was none , other than for our own convenience and the sake of a simple explanation .
Based on the scientific findings and a do n’t - intrude - unless - needed - for - security philosophy , we came up with a container size that eliminates an assembled bomb ( without having to determine what exactly is inside the bottle labeled “ shampoo ” ) , limits the total liquid any one person can bring ( without requiring Transportation Security Officers ( TSOs ) to count individual bottles ) , and allows for additional security measures relating to multiple people mixing a bomb post - checkpoint .
Three ounces and a baggie in the bin gives us a way for people to safely bring on limited quantities of liquids , aerosols and gels .
BS : How will this foil a plot , given that there are no consequences to trying ?
Airplane contraband falls into two broad categories : stuff you get in trouble for trying to smuggle onboard , and stuff that just gets taken away from you .
If I ’m caught at a security checkpoint with a gun or a bomb , you ’re going to call the police and really ruin my day .
But if I have a large bottle of that liquid explosive , you confiscate it with a smile and let me though .
So unless you ’re 100 % perfect in catching this stuff — which you ’re not — I can just try again and again until I get it through .
This is n’t like contaminants in food , where if you remove 90 % of the particles , you ’re 90 % safer .
None of those false alarms — none of those innocuous liquids taken away from innocent travelers — improve security .
We ’re only safer if you catch the one explosive liquid amongst the millions of containers of water , shampoo , and toothpaste .
I have described two ways to get large amounts of liquids onto airplanes — large bottles labeled “ saline solution ” and trying until the screeners miss the liquid — not to mention combining multiple little bottles of liquid into one big bottle after the security checkpoint .
I want to assume the TSA is both intelligent and motivated to protect us .
I ’m taking your word for it that there is an actual threat — lots of chemists disagree — but your liquid ban is n’t mitigating it .
Instead , I have the sinking feeling that you ’re defending us against a terrorist smart enough to develop his own liquid explosive , yet too stupid to read the rules on TSA ’s own website .
KH : I think your premise is wrong .
There are consequences to coming to an airport with a bomb and having some of the materials taken away at the checkpoint .
Putting aside our layers of security for the moment , there are things you can do to get a TSO ’s attention at the checkpoint .
If a TSO finds you or the contents of your bag suspicious , you might get interviewed and / or have your bags more closely examined .
If the TSO throws your liquids in the trash , they do n’t find you a threat .
I often read blog posts about how someone could just take all their three - ounce bottles — or take bottles from others on the plane — and combine them into a larger container to make a bomb .
I ca n’t get into the specifics , but our explosives research shows this is not a viable option .
The current system is not the best we ’ll ever come up with .
In the near future , we ’ll come up with an automated system to take care of liquids , and everyone will be happier .
In the meantime , we have begun using hand - held devices that can recognize threat liquids through factory - sealed containers ( we will increase their number through the rest of the year ) and we have different test strips that are effective when a bottle is opened .
Right now , we ’re using them on exempt items like medicines , as well as undeclared liquids TSOs find in bags .
This will help close the vulnerability and strengthen the deterrent .
BS : People regularly point to security checkpoints missing a knife in their handbag as evidence that security screening is n’t working .
But that ’s wrong .
Complete effectiveness is not the goal ; the checkpoints just have to be effective enough so that the terrorists are worried their plan will be uncovered .
But in Denver earlier this year , testers sneaked 90 % of weapons through .
And other tests are n’t much better .
Why are these numbers so poor , and why did n’t they get better when the TSA took over airport security ?
KH : Your first point is dead on and is the key to how we look at security .
The stories about 90 % failures are wrong or extremely misleading .
We do many kinds of effectiveness tests at checkpoints daily .
We use them to guide training and decisions on technology and operating procedures .
We also do extensive and very sophisticated Red Team testing , and one of their jobs is to observe checkpoints and go back and figure out — based on inside knowledge of what we do — ways to beat the system .
They isolate one particular thing : for example , a particular explosive , made and placed in a way that exploits a particular weakness in technology ; our procedures ; or the way TSOs do things in practice .
Then they will test that particular thing over and over until they identify what corrective action is needed .
We then change technology or procedure , or plain old focus on execution .
And we repeat the process — forever .
So without getting into specifics on the test results , of course there are times that our evaluations can generate high failure rate numbers on specific scenarios .
Overall , though , our ability to detect bomb components is vastly improved and it will keep getting better .
( Older scores you may have seen may be “ feel good ” numbers based on old , easy tests .
Do n’t go for the sound - bite ; today ’s TSOs are light - years ahead of even where they were two years ago . )
BS : I hope you ’re telling the truth ; screening is a difficult problem , and it ’s hard to discount all of those published tests and reports .
But a lot of the security around these checkpoints is about perception — we want potential terrorists to think there ’s a significant chance they wo n’t get through the checkpoints — so you ’re better off maintaining that the screeners are better than reports indicate , even if they ’re not .
Backscatter X -ray is another technology that is causing privacy concerns , since it basically allows you to see people naked .
Can you explain the benefits of the technology , and what you are doing to protect privacy ?
Although the machines can distort the images , we know that they can store raw , unfiltered images ; the manufacturer Rapiscan is quite proud of the fact .
Are the machines you ’re using routinely storing images ?
Can they store images at the screener ’s discretion , or is that capability turned off at installation ?
KH :
We ’re still evaluating backscatter and are in the process of running millimeter wave portals right alongside backscatter to compare their effectiveness and the privacy issues .
We do not now store images for the test phase ( function disabled ) , and although we have n’t officially resolved the issue , I fully understand the privacy argument and do n’t assume that we will store them if and when they ’re widely deployed .
BS : When can we keep our shoes on ?
KH : Any time after you clear security .
Sorry , Bruce , I do n’t like it either , but this is not just something leftover from 2002 .
It is a real , current concern .
We ’re looking at shoe scanners and ways of using millimeter wave and / or backscatter to get there , but until the technology catches up to the risk , the shoes have to go in the bin .
BS : This feels so much like “ cover your ass ” security : you ’re screening our shoes because everyone knows Richard Reid hid explosives in them , and you ’ll be raked over the coals if that particular plot ever happens again .
But there are literally thousands of possible plots .
So when does it end ?
The terrorists invented a particular tactic , and you ’re defending against it .
But you ’re playing a game you ca n’t win .
You ban guns and bombs , so the terrorists use box cutters .
You ban small blades and knitting needles , and they hide explosives in their shoes .
You screen shoes , so they invent a liquid explosive .
You restrict liquids , and they ’re going to do something else .
The terrorists are going to look at what you ’re confiscating , and they ’re going to design a plot to bypass your security .
That ’s the real lesson of the liquid bombers .
Assuming you ’re right and the explosive was real , it was an explosive that none of the security measures at the time would have detected .
So why play this slow game of whittling down what people can bring onto airplanes ?
When do you say : “ Enough .
It ’s not about the details of the tactic ; it ’s about the broad threat ” ?
KH : In late 2005 , I made a big deal about focusing on Improvised Explosives Devices ( IEDs ) and not chasing all the things that could be used as weapons .
Until the liquids plot this summer , we were defending our decision to let scissors and small tools back on planes and trying to add layers like behavior detection and document checking , so it is ironic that you ask this question –I am in vehement agreement with your premise .
We ’d rather focus on things that can do catastrophic harm ( bombs ! ) and add layers to get people with hostile intent to highlight themselves .
We have a responsibility , though , to address known continued active attack methods like shoes and liquids and , unfortunately , have to use our somewhat clunky process for now .
BS : You do n’t have a responsibility to screen shoes ; you have one to protect air travel from terrorism to the best of your ability .
You ’re picking and choosing .
We know the Chechnyan terrorists who downed two Russian planes in 2004 got through security partly because different people carried the explosive and the detonator .
Why does n’t this count as a continued , active attack method ?
I do n’t want to even think about how much C4 I can strap to my legs and walk through your magnetometers .
Or search the Internet for “ BeerBelly . ”
It ’s a device you can strap to your chest to smuggle beer into stadiums , but you can also use it smuggle 40 ounces of dangerous liquid explosive onto planes .
The magnetometer wo n’t detect it .
Your secondary screening wandings wo n’t detect it .
Why are n’t you making us all take our shirts off ?
Will you have to find a printout of the webpage in some terrorist safe house ?
Or will someone actually have to try it ?
If that does n’t bother you , search the Internet for “ cell phone gun . ”
It ’s “ cover your ass ” security .
If someone tries to blow up a plane with a shoe or a liquid , you ’ll take a lot of blame for not catching it .
But if someone uses any of these other , equally known , attack methods , you ’ll be blamed less because they ’re less public .
KH : Dead wrong !
Our security strategy assumes an adaptive terrorist , and that looking backwards is not a reliable predictor of the next type of attack .
Yes , we screen for shoe bombs and liquids , because it would be stupid not to directly address attack methods that we believe to be active .
Overall , we are getting away from trying to predict what the object looks like and looking more for the other markers of a terrorist .
( Do n’t forget , we see two million people a day , so we know what normal looks like . )
What he / she does ; the way they behave .
That way we do n’t put all our eggs in the basket of catching them in the act .
We ca n’t give them free rein to surveil or do dry - runs ; we need to put up obstacles for them at every turn .
Working backwards , what do you need to do to be successful in an attack ?
Find the decision points that show the difference between normal action and action needed for an attack .
Our odds are better with this approach than by trying to take away methods , annoying object by annoying object .
Bruce , as for blame , that ’s nothing compared to what all of us would carry inside if we failed to prevent an attack .
BS : Let ’s talk about ID checks .
I ’ve called the no-fly list a list of people so dangerous they cannot be allowed to fly under any circumstance , yet so innocent we ca n’t arrest them even under the Patriot Act .
Except that ’s not even true ; anyone , no matter how dangerous they are , can fly without an ID — or by using someone else ’s boarding pass .
And the list itself is filled with people who should n’t be on it — dead people , people in jail , and so on — and primarily catches innocents with similar names .
Why are you bothering ?
KH : Because it works .
We just completed a scrub of every name on the no-fly list and cut it in half — essentially cleaning out people who were no longer an active terror threat .
We do not publicize how often the no-fly system stops people you would not want on your flight .
Several times a week would low - ball it .
Your point about the no-ID and false boarding pass people is a great one .
We are moving people who have tools and training to get at that problem .
The bigger issue is that TSA is moving in the direction of security that picks up on behavior versus just keying on what we see in your bag .
It really would be security theater if all we did was try to find possible weapons in that crunched fifteen seconds and fifteen feet after you anonymously walk through the magnetometer .
We do a better job , with less aggravation of ordinary passengers , if we put people - based layers further ahead in the process — behavior observation based on involuntary , observable muscle behavior , canine teams , document verification , etc .
BS : We ’ll talk about behavioral profiling later ; no fair defending one security measure by pointing to another , completely separate , one .
How can you claim ID cards work ?
Like the liquid ban , all it does is annoy innocent travelers without doing more than inconveniencing any future terrorists .
Is it really good enough for you to defend me from terrorists too dumb to Google “ print your own boarding pass ” ?
KH :
We are getting at the fake boarding pass and ID issues with our proposal to Congress that would allow us to replace existing document checkers with more highly trained people with tools that would close those gaps .
Without effective identity verification , watch lists do n’t do much , so this is a top priority .
Having highly trained TSOs performing the document checking function closes a security gap , adds another security layer , and pushes TSA ’s security program out in front of the checkpoint .
BS : Let ’s move on .
Air travelers think you ’re capricious .
Remember in April when the story went around about the Princeton professor being on a no- fly list because he spoke out against President Bush ?
His claims were easily debunked , but the real story is that so many people believed it .
People believe political activity puts them on the list .
People are afraid to complain about being mistreated at checkpoints because they ’re afraid it puts them on a list .
Is there anything you can do to make this process more transparent ?
KH : We need some help on this one .
This is the biggest public pain point , dwarfing shoes and baggies .
First off , TSA does not add people to the watch - lists , no matter how cranky you are at a checkpoint .
Second , political views have nothing to do with no - flys or selectees .
These myths have taken on urban legend status .
There are very strict criteria and they are reviewed by lots of separate people in separate agencies : it is for live terror concerns only .
The problem comes from random selectees ( literally mathematically random ) or people who have the same name and birth date as real no - flys .
If you can get a boarding pass , you are not on the no-fly list .
This problem will go away when Secure Flight starts in 2008 , but we ca n’t seem to shake the false impression that ordinary Americans get put on a “ list . ”
I am open for suggestions on how to make the public “ get it . ”
BS : It ’s hard to believe that there could be hundreds of thousands of people meeting those very strict criteria , and that ’s after the list was cut in half !
I know the TSA does not control the no-fly and watch lists , but you ’re the public face of those lists .
You ’re the aspect of homeland security that people come into direct contact with .
Some people might find out they ’re on the list by being arrested , or being shipped off to Syria for torture , but most people find out they ’re on the list by being repeatedly searched and questioned for hours at airports .
The main problem with the list is that it ’s secret .
Who is on the list is secret .
Why someone ’s on is secret .
How someone can get off is secret .
There ’s no accountability and there ’s no transparency .
Of course this kind of thing induces paranoia .
It ’s the sort of thing you read about in history books about East Germany and other police states .
The best thing you can do to improve the problem is redress .
People need the ability to see the evidence against them , challenge their accuser , and have a hearing in a neutral court .
If they ’re guilty of something , arrest them .
And if they ’re innocent , stop harassing them .
It ’s basic liberty .
I do n’t actually expect you to fix this ; the problem is larger than the TSA .
But can you tell us something about redress ?
It ’s been promised to us for years now .
KH : Redress issues are divided into two categories : people on the no-fly list and people who have names similar to them .
In our experience , the first group is not a heavy user of the redress process .
They typically do n’t want anything to do with the U.S. government .
Still , if someone is either wrongly put on or kept on , the Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) removes him or her immediately .
In fact , TSA worked with the TSC to review every name , and that review cut the no-fly list in half .
Having said that , once someone is really on the no-fly list , I totally agree with what you said about appeal rights .
This is true across the board , not just with no - flys .
DHS has recently consolidated redress for all DHS activities into one process called DHS TRIP .
If you are mistaken for a real no -fly , you can let TSA know and we provide your information to the airlines , who right now are responsible for identifying no - flys trying to fly .
Each airline uses its own system , so some can get you cleared to use kiosks , while others still require a visit to the ticket agent .
When Secure Flight is operating , we ’ll take that in - house at TSA and the problem should go away .
BS : I still do n’t see how that will work , as long as the TSA does n’t have control over who gets on or off the list .
What about Registered Traveler ?
When TSA first started talking about the program , the plan was to divide people into two categories : more trusted people who get less screening , and less trusted people who get more screening .
This opened an enormous security hole ; whenever you create an easy way and a hard way through security , you invite the bad guys to take the easier way .
Since then , it ’s transformed into a way for people to pay for better screening equipment and faster processing –a great idea with no security downsides .
Given that , why bother with the background checks at all ?
What else is it besides a way for a potential terrorist to spend $ 60 and find out if the government is on to them ?
KH : Registered Traveler ( RT ) is a promising program but suffers from unrealistic expectations .
The idea — that you and I are n’t really risks and we should be screened less so that TSA can apply scarce resources on the more likely terrorist — makes sense and got branded as RT .
The problem is that with two million people a day , how can we tell them apart in an effective way ?
We know terrorists use people who are not on watch lists and who do n’t have criminal convictions , so we ca n’t use those criteria alone .
Right now , I ’ve said that RT is behind Secure Flight in priority and that TSA is open to working with private sector entities to facilitate RT , but we will not fund it , reduce overall security , or inconvenience regular travelers .
As private companies deploy extra security above what TSA does , we can change the screening process accordingly .
It has to be more than a front - of - the - line pass , and I think there are some innovations coming out in the year ahead that will better de
fine what RT can become .
BS : Let ’s talk about behavioral profiling .
I ’ve long thought that most of airline security could be ditched in favor of well - trained guards , both in and out of uniform , wandering the crowds looking for suspicious behavior .
Can you talk about some of the things you ’re doing along those lines , and especially ways to prevent this from turning into just another form of racial profiling ?
KH : Moving security out from behind the checkpoint is a big priority for us .
First , it gives us the opportunity to pick up a threat a lot earlier .
Taking away weapons or explosives at the checkpoint is stopping the plot at nearly the last possible moment .
Obviously , a good security system aims at stopping attacks well before that .
That ’s why we have many layers of security ( intel , law enforcement , behavior detection , etc. ) to get to that person well before the security checkpoint .
When a threat gets to the checkpoint , we ’re operating on his / her terms — they pick when , where , and how they present themselves to us .
We want to pick up the cues on our terms , before they ’re ready , even if they ’re just at the surveillance stage .
We use a system of behavior observation that is based on the science that demonstrates that there are certain involuntary , subconscious actions that can betray a person ’s hostile intent .
For instance , there are tiny — but noticeable to the trained person — movements in a person ’s facial muscles when they have certain emotions .
It is very different from the stress we all show when we ’re anxious about missing the flight due to , say , a long security line .
This is true across race , gender , age , ethnicity , etc .
It is our way of not falling into the trap where we predict what a terrorist is going to look like .
We know they use people who “ look like ” terrorists , but they also use people who do not , perhaps thinking that we cue only off of what the 9/11 hijackers looked like .
Our Behavior Detection teams routinely — and quietly — identify problem people just through observable behavior cues .
More than 150 people have been identified by our teams , turned over to law enforcement , and subsequently arrested .
This layer is invisible to the public , but do n’t discount it , because it may be the most effective .
We publicize non-terrorist - related successes like a murder suspect caught in Minneapolis and a bank robber caught in Philadelphia .
Most common are people showing phony documents , but we have even picked out undercover operatives –including our own .
One individual , identified by a TSO in late May and not allowed to fly , was killed in a police shoot - out five days later .
Additionally , several individuals have been of interest from the counter - terrorism perspective .
With just this limited deployment of Behavior Detection Officers ( BDOs ) , we have identified more people of counterterrorism interest than all the people combined caught with prohibited items .
Look for us to continue to look at ways that highlight problem people rather than just problem objects .
BS : That ’s really good news , and I think it ’s the most promising new security measure you ’ve got .
Although , honestly , bragging about capturing a guy for wearing a fake military uniform just makes you look silly .
So far , we ’ve only talked about passengers .
What about airport workers ?
Nearly one million workers move in and out of airports every day without ever being screened .
The JFK plot , as laughably unrealistic as it was , highlighted the security risks of airport workers .
As with any security problem , we need to secure the weak links , rather than make already strong links stronger .
What about airport employees , delivery vehicles , and so on ?
KH : I totally agree with your point about a strong base level of security everywhere and not creating large gaps by over - focusing on one area .
This is especially true with airport employees .
We do background checks on all airport employees who have access to the sterile area .
These employees are in the same places doing the same jobs day after day , so when someone does something out of the ordinary , it immediately stands out .
They serve as an additional set of eyes and ears throughout the airport .
Even so , we should do more on airport employees and my House testimony of April 19 gives details of where we ’re heading .
The main point is that everything you need for an attack is already inside the perimeter of an airport .
For example , why take lighters from people who work with blowtorches in facilities with millions of gallons of jet fuel ?
You could perhaps feel better by setting up employee checkpoints at entry points , but you ’d hassle a lot of people at great cost with minimal additional benefit , and a smart , patient terrorist could find a way to beat you .
Today ’s random , unpredictable screenings that can and do occur everywhere , all the time ( including delivery vehicles , etc. ) are harder to defeat .
With the latter , you make it impossible to engineer an attack ; with the former , you give the blueprint for exactly that .
BS : There ’s another reason to screen pilots and flight attendants : they go through the same security lines as passengers .
People have to remember that it ’s not pilots being screened , it ’s people dressed as pilots .
You either have to implement a system to verify that people dressed as pilots are actual pilots , or just screen everybody .
The latter choice is far easier .
I want to ask you about general philosophy .
Basically , there are three broad ways of defending airplanes : preventing bad people from getting on them ( ID checks ) , preventing bad objects from getting on them ( passenger screening , baggage screening ) , and preventing bad things from happening on them ( reinforcing the cockpit door , sky marshals ) .
The first one seems to be a complete failure , the second one is spotty at best .
I ’ve always been a fan of the third .
Any future developments in that area ?
KH :
You are too eager to discount the first –stopping bad people from getting on planes .
That is the most effective !
Do n’t forget about all the intel work done partnering with other countries to stop plots before they get here ( UK liquids , NY subway ) , all the work done to keep them out either through no - flys ( at least several times a month ) or by Customs & Border Protection on their way in , and law enforcement once they are here ( Ft. Dix ) .
Then , you add the behavior observation ( both uniformed and not ) and identity validation ( as we take that on ) and that ’s all before they get to the checkpoint .
The screening - for - things part , we ’ve discussed , so I ’ll jump to in - air measures .
Reinforced , locked cockpit doors and air marshals are indeed huge upgrades since 9/11 .
Along the same lines , you have to consider the role of the engaged flight crew and passengers — they are quick to give a heads - up about suspicious behavior and they can , and do , take decisive action when threatened .
Also , there are thousands of flights covered by pilots who are qualified as law enforcement and are armed , as well as the agents from other government entities like the Secret Service and FBI who provide coverage as well .
There is also a fair amount of communications with the flight deck during flights if anything comes up en route–either in the aircraft or if we get information that would be of interest to them .
That allows “ quiet ” diversions or other preventive measures .
Training is , of course , important too .
Pilots need to know what to do in the event of a missile sighting or other event , and need to know what we are going to do in different situations .
Other things coming : better air - to - ground communications for air marshals and flight information , including , possibly , video .
So , when you boil it down , keeping the bomb off the plane is the number one priority .
A terrorist has to know that once that door closes , he or she is locked into a confined space with dozens , if not hundreds , of zero - tolerance people , some of whom may be armed with firearms , not to mention the memory of United Flight 93 .
BS : I ’ve read repeated calls to privatize airport security : to return it to the way it was pre-9/11 .
Personally , I think it ’s a bad idea , but I ’d like your opinion on the question .
And regardless of what you think should happen , do you think it will happen ?
KH : From an operational security point of view , I think it works both ways .
So it is not a strategic issue for me .
SFO , our largest private airport , has excellent security and is on a par with its federalized counterparts ( in fact , I am on a flight from there as I write this ) .
One current federalized advantage is that we can surge resources around the system with no notice ; essentially , the ability to move from anywhere to anywhere and mix TSOs with federal air marshals in different force packages .
We would need to be sure we do n’t lose that interchangeability if we were to expand privatized screening .
I do n’t see a major security or economic driver that would push us to large - scale privatization .
Economically , the current cost - plus model makes it a better deal for the government in smaller airports than in bigger .
So , maybe more small airports will privatize .
If Congress requires collective bargaining for our TSOs , that will impose an additional overhead cost of about $ 500 million , which would shift the economic balance significantly toward privatized screening .
But unless that happens , I do n’t see major change in this area .
BS : Last question .
I regularly criticize overly specific security measures , because forcing the terrorists to make minor modifications in their tactics does n’t make us any safer .
We ’ve talked about specific airline threats , but what about airplanes as a specific threat ?
On the one hand , if we secure our airlines and the terrorists all decide instead to bomb shopping malls , we have n’t improved our security very much .
On the other hand , airplanes make particularly attractive targets for several reasons .
One , they ’re considered national symbols .
Two , they ’re a common and important travel vehicle , and are deeply embedded throughout our economy .
Three , they travel to distant places where the terrorists are .
And four , the failure mode is severe : a small bomb drops the plane out of the sky and kills everyone .
I do n’t expect you to give back any of your budget , but when do we have “ enough ” airplane security as compared with the rest of our nation ’s infrastructure ?
KH : Airplanes are a high - profile target for terrorists for all the reasons you cited .
The reason we have the focus we do on aviation is because of the effect the airline system has on our country , both economically and psychologically .
We do considerable work ( through grants and voluntary agreements ) to ensure the safety of surface transportation , but it ’s less visible to the public because people other than ones in TSA uniforms are taking care of that responsibility .
We look at the aviation system as one component in a much larger network that also includes freight rail , mass transit , highways , etc .
And that ’s just in the U.S .
Then you add the world ’s transportation sectors — it ’s all about the network .
The only components that require specific security measures are the critical points of failure — and they have to be protected at virtually any cost .
It does n’t matter which individual part of the network is attacked — what matters is that the network as a whole is resilient enough to operate even with losing one or more components .
The network approach allows various transportation modes to benefit from our layers of security .
Take our first layer : intel .
It is fundamental to our security program to catch terrorists long before they get to their target , and even better if we catch them before they get into our country .
Our intel operation works closely with other international and domestic agencies , and that information and analysis benefits all transportation modes .
Dogs have proven very successful at detecting explosives .
They work in airports and they work in mass transit venues as well .
As we test and pilot technologies like millimeter wave in airports , we assess their viability in other transportation modes , and vice versa .
To get back to your question , we ’re not at the point where we can say “ enough ” for aviation security .
But we ’re also aware of the attractiveness of other modes and continue to use the network to share resources and lessons learned .
BS : Thank you very much for your time .
I appreciate both your time and your candor .
KH : I enjoyed the exchange and appreciated your insights .
Thanks for the opportunity .

Every so often a quote comes out of the Bush administration that leaves you asking :
Am I crazy or are they ?
I had one of those moments last week when Dana Perino , the White House press secretary , was asked about a proposal by some Congressional Democrats to levy a surtax to pay for the Iraq war , and she responded , “ We ’ve always known that Democrats seem to revert to type , and they are willing to raise taxes on just about anything . ”
Yes , those silly Democrats .
They ’ll raise taxes for anything , even — get this — to pay for a war !
And if we did raise taxes to pay for our war to bring a measure of democracy to the Arab world , “ does anyone seriously believe that the Democrats are going to end these new taxes that they ’re asking the American people to pay at a time when it ’s not necessary to pay them ? ” added Ms. Perino .
“ I just think it ’s completely fiscally irresponsible . ”
Friends , we are through the looking glass .
It is now “ fiscally irresponsible ” to want to pay for a war with a tax .
These democrats just do n’t understand : the tooth fairy pays for wars .
Of course she does — the tooth fairy leaves the money at the end of every month under Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ’s pillow .
And what a big pillow it is !
My God , what will the Democrats come up with next ?
Taxes to rebuild bridges or schools or high - speed rail or our lagging broadband networks ?
No , no , the tooth fairy covers all that .
She borrows the money from China and leaves it under Paulson ’s pillow .
Of course , we can pay for the Iraq war without a tax increase .
The question is , can we pay for it and be making the investments in infrastructure , science and education needed to propel our country into the 21st century ?
Visit Singapore , Japan , Korea , China or parts of Europe today and you ’ll discover that the infrastructure in our country is not keeping pace with our peers ’ .
Editor 's note :
This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming , six - hour television event , " God 's Warriors , " hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour .
Gehad al - Khalek of Egypt says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty .
( CNN ) -- Last year at Christmastime , Rehan Seyam , a Muslim living in New Jersey , went to pick up some things at a local Wal - Mart .
Seeing her distinctive traditional Muslim head covering called a " hijab , " a man in the store , addressing her directly , sang " The 12 Days of Christmas " using insulting lyrics about terrorism and Osama bin Laden .
She was stunned .
" Do I look like a terrorist to you ? "
Seyam said she asked the man .
According to Seyam , the man replied , " What else does a terrorist look like ? "
Such stories are not altogether uncommon for Muslim Americans .
According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center , 53 percent of Muslims living in America said it has become more difficult to be a Muslim in the United States since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Fifty - one percent said they are " very worried " or " somewhat worried " that women wearing the hijab are treated poorly , according to the poll .
A simple headscarf generally used by women to hide the hair from view , the hijab has become so controversial among some that several countries have banned or considered banning Muslim women from wearing them in public places .
In light of this contentiousness , why do Muslim women choose to wear the hijab ?
Watch the making of CNN's TV special " God 's Warriors " »
Gehad al - Khalek lives in Egypt and says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty .
" I want to shift the attention from my outer self to my inner self when I deal with someone , I do n't want them to look at me in a way that would n't suit me , " she told CNN in an upcoming documentary called " God 's Warriors . "
Al - Khalek is fluent in English and German ; studied in Europe ; plays Western music on her guitar ; and spent time working for a women 's rights organization .
She wears the hijab -- and says it 's not just for religious reasons .
" My own conclusion was it is debatable whether it is a religious obligation or not , but I chose to keep it on because I do believe in modesty and you should n't be showing off yourself , " al - Khalek said .
The Quran calls for women to be modest in their dress but interpretation of the edict varies widely , according to religious experts who spoke with CNN .
An author who has written widely on Islam told CNN the Quran does not require women to wear the hijab .
" There 's nothing in the Quran about all women having to be veiled or secluded in a certain part of the house .
That came in later [ after Prophet Mohammed 's time ] , " said religious historian and author Karen Armstrong .
For Seyam , the hijab is a religious duty .
" It 's God 's wish , " she said .
" It 's a requirement by God .
He wants us to cover .
He wants us to be modest , " Seyam said .
But as important as the hijab is to her , Seyam 's decision to cover her hair was n't one she made easily .
" It was very dramatic for me .
And I remember , even now thinking about it , it really does make my heart beat a little bit faster , " she said , " I was making a decision I knew was permanent .
You put on hijab , you do n't take it off . "
Through her childhood growing up in Long Island , New York , Seyam prayed with her devout Muslim parents , but says she was just " going through the motions . "
It was n't until college that she decided to wear a hijab consistently .
Influenced by her more devout friends , Seyam decided being a good Muslim meant covering her head .
" My sole purpose is to be here for the sake of Allah , and I 'm doing something that he specifically says that you should be doing . "
Seyam said there were practical factors in her decision as well .
" I 'm sick of guys catcalling .
It was just driving me crazy .
I felt like a piece of meat . "
But Seyam says she traded in catcalling for a different kind of negative attention .
People " look at me as if I am threatening and I do not feel like I am threatening looking .
I do n't feel I should instill fear in anybody 's heart , but I do feel like I get dirty looks , " she said .
Still , Seyam says her faith sustains her and that wearing the hijab is an important part of that faith .
" I 'm not here to live my life and do whatever I want .
I 'm here to worship God , " Seyam said .
" I do n't think that everybody has that , and I think that I 'm lucky for it . "

Devastation .
Via : Wall Street Journal / Moneyweb :
For nearly two decades , Lai Mandai regularly ate and sold beans , cabbage and watermelons grown on a plot of land a short walk from a lead smelting plant in her village .
Like dozens of other villagers who ate locally grown food , Ms. Lai , 39 years old , developed health problems .
“ When I did work , planting vegetables or cleaning the floor , I felt so tired , and my fingers felt numb , ” Ms. Lai says .
“ I talked with other villagers .
They had the same problems . ”
Ms. Lai , along with 57 other villagers , was eventually diagnosed with high levels of cadmium , a heavy metal that can cause kidney disease and softening of the bones .
Runoff from the factory — which the government tore down in 2004 — had contaminated the farmland and entered the food supply .
A Chinese government report found that rice grown in the village contained 20 times the permitted level of cadmium .
China ’s tainted food supply has fallen under heightened scrutiny after a shipment of wheat flour contaminated with a chemical used in fire retardants found its way into pet food and was linked to the deaths of U.S. animals in late March .
Concerns have since soared over the safety of the country ’s exports .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently told consumers to stop buying toothpaste made in China because it might contain poisonous diethylene glycol .
Last week , the FDA sounded an alarm on farm - raised seafood from China , citing excessive levels of antibiotics and additives .
Yet after decades of industrial pollution , some of the worst contaminants making their way into the country ’s food come from the soil in which it is grown .
So far it has n’t been determined the extent to which tainted crops such as rice , fruits and vegetables have been exported to the U.S.
What is clear is that in contaminated areas dotting the country , residents have been eating such food for years or decades .
Pingyang , where Ms. Lai lives , is among the so - called hot spots in China where farmland lying in the shadow of factory smokestacks or mining operations has been contaminated by heavy metals .
These elements can cause a sweeping range of health problems , from brain damage to cancer .
Chinese academics have written about such sites in more than a dozen studies over the past two years in Chinese and international scientific journals .
In a study published earlier this year , researchers at the Guangdong Institute of Ecology found excessive levels of cadmium and mercury in Chinese cabbage grown in Foshan , a major manufacturing center in southern China .
Last year , researchers at Lanzhou University published research showing that vegetables at four sites near the mining and smelting city of Baiyin in the Northwestern Gansu province contained hazardous levels of cadmium , lead and copper .
A study of crops grown in the central city of Chongqing found excessive lead and cadmium levels in vegetables at 20 sites .

Americans are wired as never before .
Almost all households own at least one television and one DVD player .
One - third to one - half of young children have a television in their bedroom , as do two - thirds of teens and pre-teens .
Nearly 80 percent of households have cable or satellite television , as well as a computer .
More families have internet access than have newspaper subscriptions .
More than 50 percent of households have a video game player , and video game sales now total $ 10 billion annually !
Consuming media now far surpasses creative , active , and social pursuits as the average American child 's favorite pastime .
Children spend more time sitting in front of screen - based media than any other activity besides sleeping .
Between television , video games and computers , the average child logs in 40 hours of screen time every week ; this is especially disheartening when you consider that the average child spends only 45 minutes reading each day , including while at school .
Screen media have replaced parents as the mainstream culture in our children 's lives .
As American parents are increasingly overworked and overstressed , it has come to be less that we are letting our children watch television , and more that we are asking television to watch our kids .
It is not a matter of being a ' good ' parent or a ' bad ' parent ; it is simply one result of our societal failure to value and protect the rights of parents to enjoy quality time with their children .
The bottom line is that we 're raising a generation of children wired but disconnected .
Screen time is time usually spent alone .
As the aloneness of screen time replaces the togetherness of family or friend time , detachment replaces attachment .
Even if other children are present , watching television together is no more than shared aloneness .
Trust in others comes from a childhood of shared life experiences .
Endless hours of mindless screen time amounts only to a childhood filled with empty experiences .
Given that the primary purpose of childhood is to develop competencies for life , children who are raised detached from humanity are less likely as adults to be capable of empathy and consideration , and less willing or able to contribute in meaningful ways to their communities .
Our children 's window on the world is now largely through the eyes of advertisers and media corporations .
Through television , they see a world of crime and violence and hatred .
They also see a world of fast - paced entertaining commercials with glamorous people or cartoon characters convincing them that happiness comes from having things they do n't really need .
They see a dizzying array of foods they should n't really have for good health .
In fact , it is startling to realize that the average child sees almost 20,000 commericals each year !
Of course , advertisers are not evil people with evil designs to corrupt our youth .
They just want to make money , by making children loyal to their brand for life .
McDonald 's Corporation has perhaps been the most successful at doing just that .
The character of Ronald McDonald is now second only to Santa Claus in name recognition among American children .
Parents and children alike are baited and hooked by the inexpensive Happy Meal , which includes some promotional toy or figurine - often a character devised by another media giant , Disney Corporation .
Untold billions of dollars are spent annually by the food and drink industries on marketing aimed at children .
Kids are daily bombarded by virtually irresistible messages that say , in effect , ' Eat / Drink this now ! '
Combined with all those hours of sedentary screen time , it 's not surprising that the number of obese American children has doubled during just the past twenty years .
Studies have even confirmed that the incidence of obesity is highest among children who watch four or more hours of screen - based media daily , and lowest among children watching an hour or less each day .
It 's past time for parents to take actions that will tell advertisers and corporations to stay away from our children .
As Elizabeth Thoman , founder and president of the Center for Media Literacy , so eloquently once stated : ' Parents should treat the media no differently than they would a stranger who knocks on their door and asks to play with their children . '
Limit children 's exposure to television commericals by encouraging them to watch public broadcasting .
Teach critical media skills by explaining to kids that commercials are simply actors trying to persuade people to buy things they may not really need .
Take the television out of the bedroom .
Limit the child 's total screen time , including television , computers , and video games , to less than two hours daily .
Limit everyone 's total television time to less than two hours daily - there 's nothing worse than the dreaded ' do as I say , not as I do ' style of parenting !
Television and video games are little more than mental fast food .
Give your child 's brain something better to grow on by exposing them to alternative forms of entertainment media uninfluenced by advertising : art exhibits , dance and music performances , stage productions and poetry readings , for example .
Encourage creative play , dressing up make - believe , and competitive and non-competitive exercise .
Encourage children to create and perform their own live television shows for a family audience .
Develop a craft and hobby center in the home .
Foster children as doers and creators rather than as shoppers and buyers .
Get a library card .
Reward children weekly for averaging at least one hour of reading each day while at home .
Subscribe to kid magazines .
They 're cheaper than cable subscriptions , they encourage reading , and what child does n't love getting mail !
Resist the emphasis on brands and icons by limiting the purchase of clothing and other items emblazoned with company logos .
Unless children are paid to do so , they should not be advertising for corporations .
In our increasingly commerical culture , childhood innocence has become overmatched by corporate omni-presence .
Unless parents take a stand against the repetitious bombardment of ads targeting children , our kids do n't stand a chance .
From four years ago :
What ’s worth more : a pile of gold or a pile of salt ?
Throughout history , many people have chosen the salt .
Gold is pretty , but you ca n’t live without salt , and when it was more scarce than gold , it became valuable enough to use as a currency itself .
( The word " salary " is even related to the Latin for " salt . " )
Today , of course , salt is close to worthless .
Given the choice between a pile of salt and a pile of gold , you ’d go for the gold every time , because there ’s less of it around .
Scarcity , it seems , has a lot to do with value .
… we ’re running out of a lot of important things–clean water , free time , breathable air , the ozone layer , and honest leadership , just to name a few .
At the same time , we have to worry about something that is about to affect just about every business I can think of .
We ’re running out of scarcity .
Scarcity , after all , is the cornerstone of our economy .
The best way to make a profit is by trading in something that ’s scarce .
This is why the music and movie industries are so terrified by the millions of people who download entertainment from the Internet every day .
Downloading threatens to make supply virtually unlimited , and that could make their offerings about as valuable as those of some kids down my street who recently tried to run a stand selling freshly made mud .
It seems as though once a category becomes successful , the headlong rush to knock it off is stronger ( and quicker ) than it ever was before .
Last week , a woman who came to a seminar in my office was desperately searching for a way to improve her mortgage - brokerage business .
I ruined her day when I suggested that she shut her company down and try something else .
Twenty years ago , most mortgages were written by the local bank .
Those banks planted the seeds of their obsolescence when they eliminated judgment from the writing of mortgages .
Once they could automate a mortgage application , so could everyone else .
So mortgage brokers used their low overhead and quick wits as an advantage and stole the business .
Today , there are an infinite number of brokers to choose from , all offering essentially the same service .
The result is that there is no scarcity , and no profit .
It ’s not just about product knockoffs , of course .
While there are almost half a million lawyers practicing in the United States today , there are ( gasp ! ) more than 125,000 in school right now .
No matter what you believe about lawyers creating ever more work for ever more lawyers , there ’s no question that with so many of them , they ’re hardly scarce .
The same thing is true for doctors , Web sites , T - shirt shops , sushi restaurants , thumbtack manufacturers , and brands of blank CD - ROM disks .
There are 100 major brands of bottled water .
Someone opened a fancy ice - cream parlor in Manhattan , and then there were six .
If it ’s remotely digital ( like music ) , then it ’s easy to mimic .
And if it ’s easy to mimic , someone wins if they can knock off the original –the sooner the better .
When someone starts to sell exactly what you sell but for half the price , how long does your good - service , first - mover , nice - person advantage last ?
Zara , the fast - growing European clothing store , can knock off a new fashion before the original designer even gets it to the upscale department stores .
Suddenly , the original appears to be the copy .
So how do you deal with the shortage of scarcity ?
Well , the worst strategy is whining –about copyright laws and fair trade and how hard you ’ve worked to get to where you are .
Whining is rarely a successful response to anything .
Instead , start by acknowledging that most of the profit from your business is going to disappear soon .
Unless you have a significant cost advantage ( like Amazon ’s or Wal - Mart ’s ) , someone with nothing to lose is going to be able to offer a similar product for less money .
So what ’s scarce now ?
Respect .
Honesty .
Good judgment .
Long - term relationships that lead to trust .
None of these things guarantee loyalty in the face of cut -rate competition , though .
So to that list I ’ll add this : an insanely low - cost structure based on outsourcing everything except your company ’s insight into what your customers really want to buy .
If the work is boring , let someone else do it , faster and cheaper than you ever could .
If your products are boring , kill them before your competition does .
Ultimately , what ’s scarce is that kind of courage – which is exactly what you can bring to the market .
Maybe everyone already knows this .
But I 've been hearing about Ruby on Rails for over a year now , and I know people working on it , an ...
Landlord Bob Beech ( L ) and Edward Elder have visited Redonda
Bob Beech wants to turn The Wellington Arms in Freemantle , Southampton , into the UK base of the uninhabited Redonda .
It follows the pub already being granted status as a consulate of Redonda by the island 's king and Mr Beech receiving a Redondan knighthood .
But his plans are likely to be thwarted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office .
The landlord said : " We came up with the idea that this pub could become the British consulate for the Kingdom of Redonda - and the king thought it was a good idea .
" We had a ceremony for that and I was made a knight .
The Wellington Arms carries a plaque boasting of its status
" Subsequent to that it was decided that we wanted to become an embassy .
Our legal team are waiting to hear if that 's possible .
" We intend to go ahead with the full benefits of an embassy . "
Those benefits could include not having to enforce the smoking ban when it comes into force on Sunday 1 July .
The ruler of the tiny Atlantic island , King Robert the Bald , sent the island 's official cardinal to grant consulate status on the pub .
REDONDA
A remnant of an extinct volcano
One mile ( 1.6 km ) long by a third of a mile ( 0.5 km ) wide 1493 - Discovered by Christopher Columbus 1967 - Became a dependency of Antigua and Barbuda
Cardinal Elder , also a regular drinker at the pub , said : " If it works we wo n't have to enforce the smoking ban - I think it will good for the pub and the Kingdom of Redonda . "
But a Foreign Office spokeswoman said that Redonda was a territory of Antigua and Barbuda and therefore was not entitled to an embassy or high commission in the UK .
Councillor Gavin Dick , of Southampton City Council , said environmental health officers would be advising Sir Bob of the legal position when the smoke free legislation is implemented .
He added : " If they are not granted embassy status , which requires formal accreditation by the Foreign Office , then they will be covered by the new law , which we will be enforcing . "

This week the 64th British soldier to die in Afghanistan , Corporal Mike Gilyeat , was buried .
All the right things were said about this brave soldier , just as , on current trends , they will be said about one or more of his colleagues who follow him next week .
The alarming escalation of the casualty rate among British soldiers in Afghanistan � up to ten per cent � led to discussion this week on whether it could be fairly compared to casualty rates in the Second World War .

Killing fields : Farmers in Afghanistan gather an opium crop which will be made into heroin
But the key question is this : what are our servicemen dying for ?
There are glib answers to that : bringing democracy and development to Afghanistan , supporting the government of President Hamid Karzai in its attempt to establish order in the country , fighting the Taliban and preventing the further spread of radical Islam into Pakistan .
But do these answers stand up to close analysis ?
There has been too easy an acceptance of the lazy notion that the war in Afghanistan is the ' good ' war , while the war in Iraq is the ' bad ' war , the blunder .
The origins of this view are not irrational .
There was a logic to attacking Afghanistan after 9/11 .
Afghanistan was indeed the headquarters of Osama Bin Laden and his organisation , who had been installed and financed there by the CIA to fight the Soviets from 1979 until 1989 .
By comparison , the attack on Iraq � which was an enemy of Al Qaeda and no threat to us � was plainly irrational in terms of the official justification .
So the attack on Afghanistan has enjoyed a much greater sense of public legitimacy .
But the operation to remove Bin Laden was one thing .
Six years of occupation are clearly another .
Head of the Afghan armed forces : General Abdul Rashid Dostrum
Few seem to turn a hair at the officially expressed view that our occupation of Iraq may last for decades .
Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell has declared , fatuously , that the Afghan war is ' winnable ' .
Afghanistan was not militarily winnable by the British Empire at the height of its supremacy .
It was not winnable by Darius or Alexander , by Shah , Tsar or Great Moghul .
It could not be subdued by 240,000 Soviet troops .
But what , precisely , are we trying to win ?
In six years , the occupation has wrought one massive transformation in Afghanistan , a development so huge that it has increased Afghan GDP by 66 per cent and constitutes 40 per cent of the entire economy .
That is a startling achievement , by any standards .
Yet we are not trumpeting it .
Why not ?
The answer is this .
The achievement is the highest harvests of opium the world has ever seen .
The Taliban had reduced the opium crop to precisely nil .
I would not advocate their methods for doing this , which involved lopping bits , often vital bits , off people .
The Taliban were a bunch of mad and deeply unpleasant religious fanatics .
But one of the things they were vehemently against was opium .
That is an inconvenient truth that our spin has managed to obscure .
Nobody has denied the sincerity of the Taliban 's crazy religious zeal , and they were as unlikely to sell you heroin as a bottle of Johnnie Walker .
They stamped out the opium trade , and impoverished and drove out the drug warlords whose warring and rapacity had ruined what was left of the country after the Soviet war .
That is about the only good thing you can say about the Taliban ; there are plenty of very bad things to say about them .
But their suppression of the opium trade and the drug barons is undeniable fact .
Now we are occupying the country , that has changed .
According to the United Nations , 2006 was the biggest opium harvest in history , smashing the previous record by 60 per cent .
This year will be even bigger .
Our economic achievement in Afghanistan goes well beyond the simple production of raw opium .
In fact Afghanistan no longer exports much raw opium at all .
It has succeeded in what our international aid efforts urge every developing country to do .
Afghanistan has gone into manufacturing and ' value - added ' operations .
It now exports not opium , but heroin .
Opium is converted into heroin on an industrial scale , not in kitchens but in factories .
Millions of gallons of the chemicals needed for this process are shipped into Afghanistan by tanker .
The tankers and bulk opium lorries on the way to the factories share the roads , improved by American aid , with Nato troops .
How can this have happened , and on this scale ?
The answer is simple .
The four largest players in the heroin business are all senior members of the Afghan government � the government that our soldiers are fighting and dying to protect .
When we attacked Afghanistan , America bombed from the air while the CIA paid , armed and equipped the dispirited warlord drug barons � especially those grouped in the Northern Alliance � to do the ground occupation .
We bombed the Taliban and their allies into submission , while the warlords moved in to claim the spoils .
Then we made them ministers .
President Karzai is a good man .
He has never had an opponent killed , which may not sound like much but is highly unusual in this region and possibly unique in an Afghan leader .
But nobody really believes he is running the country .
He asked America to stop its recent bombing campaign in the south because it was leading to an increase in support for the Taliban .
The United States simply ignored him .
Above all , he has no control at all over the warlords among his ministers and governors , each of whom runs his own kingdom and whose primary concern is self - enrichment through heroin .
My knowledge of all this comes from my time as British Ambassador in neighbouring Uzbekistan from 2002 until 2004 .
I stood at the Friendship Bridge at Termez in 2003 and watched the Jeeps with blacked - out windows bringing the heroin through from Afghanistan , en route to Europe .
I watched the tankers of chemicals roaring into Afghanistan .
Yet I could not persuade my country to do anything about it .
Alexander Litvinenko � the former agent of the KGB , now the FSB , who died in London last November after being poisoned with polonium 210 � had suffered the same frustration over the same topic .
There are a number of theories as to why Litvinenko had to flee Russia .
The most popular blames his support for the theory that FSB agents planted bombs in Russian apartment blocks to stir up anti-Chechen feeling .
But the truth is that his discoveries about the heroin trade were what put his life in danger .
Litvinenko was working for the KGB in St Petersburg in 2001 and 2002 .
He became concerned at the vast amounts of heroin coming from Afghanistan , in particular from the fiefdom of the ( now ) Head of the Afghan armed forces , General Abdul Rashid Dostum , in north and east Afghanistan .
Dostum is an Uzbek , and the heroin passes over the Friendship Bridge from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan , where it is taken over by President Islam Karimov 's people .
It is then shipped up the railway line , in bales of cotton , to St Petersburg and Riga .
The heroin Jeeps run from General Dostum to President Karimov .
The UK , United States and Germany have all invested large sums in donating the most sophisticated detection and screening equipment to the Uzbek customs centre at Termez to stop the heroin coming through .
But the convoys of Jeeps running between Dostum and Karimov are simply waved around the side of the facility .
Litvinenko uncovered the St Petersburg end and was stunned by the involvement of the city authorities , local police and security services at the most senior levels .
He reported in detail to President Vladimir Putin .
Putin is , of course , from St Petersburg , and the people Litvinenko named were among Putin 's closest political allies .
That is why Litvinenko , having miscalculated badly , had to flee Russia .
I had as little luck as Litvinenko in trying to get official action against this heroin trade .
At the St Petersburg end he found those involved had the top protection .
In Afghanistan , General Dostum is vital to Karzai 's coalition , and to the West 's pretence of a stable , democratic government .
Opium is produced all over Afghanistan , but especially in the north and north - east � Dostum 's territory .
Again , our Government 's spin doctors have tried hard to obscure this fact and make out that the bulk of the heroin is produced in the tiny areas of the south under Taliban control .
But these are the most desolate , infertile rocky areas .
It is a physical impossibility to produce the bulk of the vast opium harvest there .
That General Dostum is head of the Afghan armed forces and Deputy Minister of Defence is in itself a symbol of the bankruptcy of our policy .
Dostum is known for tying opponents to tank tracks and running them over .
He crammed prisoners into metal containers in the searing sun , causing scores to die of heat and thirst .
Since we brought ' democracy ' to Afghanistan , Dostum ordered an MP who annoyed him to be pinned down while he attacked him .
The sad thing is that Dostum is probably not the worst of those comprising the Karzai government , or the biggest drug smuggler among them .
Our Afghan policy is still victim to Tony Blair 's simplistic world view and his childish division of all conflicts into ' good guys ' and ' bad guys ' .
The truth is that there are seldom any good guys among those vying for power in a country such as Afghanistan .
To characterise the Karzai government as good guys is sheer nonsense .
Why then do we continue to send our soldiers to die in Afghanistan ?
Our presence in Afghanistan and Iraq is the greatest recruiting sergeant for Islamic militants .
As the great diplomat , soldier and adventurer Lieutenant - Colonel Sir Alexander Burnes pointed out before his death in the First Afghan War in 1841 , there is no point in a military campaign in Afghanistan as every time you beat them , you just swell their numbers .
Our only real achievement to date is falling street prices for heroin in London .
Remember this article next time you hear a politician calling for more troops to go into Afghanistan .
And when you hear of another brave British life wasted there , remember you can add to the casualty figures all the young lives ruined , made miserable or ended by heroin in the UK .
They , too , are casualties of our Afghan policy .

Это серия снимков , отснятых более чем за 10 дней в 4 городах через Украины .
Она была бы невозможна без помощи украинцев , избавившихся от наркозависимости , а также больных СПИДом - без них у меня не было бы доступа к тому , что я снимал .
Было бы недобросовестно с моей стороны не поблагодарить этих необычных людей , которые каждый день нашей совместной работы перемещали меня по их часто ужасающему миру .

Серию фотографий начинает снимок 29 - летней Татьяны , ВИЧ - инфицированной хронической наркоманки и проститутки .
Когда Татьяна потеряла работу на хлебзаводе , она подалась в проституцию , где и приобрела наркозависимость . ?
У неё хроническая инфекция ног от постоянных уколов и её слабеющая имунная система убивает её .
Немотря на это её завивимость заставляет её многократно ежедневно колоться в израненные ноги .
У Татьяны есть одиннадцатилетний сын , знающий , что мать - наркоманка , но " не желающий об этом говорить " .
Татьяна живёт в двухкомнатной квартире с шестью другими проститутками , - все они ВИЧ - инфицированы и наркоманки .
Ни у кого из них нет возможности получать антиретровирусное лечение .
2 . Следующая - мать , содержащая более 12 лет двух своих наркозависимых сыновей .
Оба сына ВИЧ - инфицированы и хронические наркоманы .
Она была вынуждена бросить работу , чтобы смотрть за сыновьями - она говорит , что это её крест .
Они приторговывают наркотой , чтобы выживать и удовлетворять зависимость .
Она беспомощна в сложившейся ситуации , и младший сын часто ругает её " плохо й матерью , из - за которой всё так вышл о " для того , чтобы не терять власти над ней .
Она сказала мне , что хочет умереть .
3 . Затем - бывший солдат - афганец советской армии .
Он говорит , что ширяется потому , что ничего лучшего в его жизни не было .
Он , как многие военнослужащие советской армии , подсел на наркотики в Афганистане .4 . Татуированный мужчина - Виталий , наркоман с тридцатилетним стажем , они с сыном ширяются оба , оба и ВИЧ - инфицированы .
Он говорит , что единственное , о чём он заботится , - это его сын , и что наркотики поддерживают его жизнь для этой заботы .
Сын же говорит , что всё , что его заботит , - это наркотики .
Он хотел бы завязать , но не может остановиться .
Он говорит , что без наркотиков жизнь бесцельна и депрессивна.
5 . Мужчина перед фотообоями - ВИЧ - инфицированный пациент , проходящий принудительное лечение в психиатрической больнице Полтавы .
В этой больнице нет отдельного бокса для ВИЧ - инфицированных , и они содержатся на общих условиях с другими больными .
Условия содержания и медицинской помощи - предельно примитивны .
Этот мужчина сказал мне , что его лучший друг - кошка .
В больнице он содержится уже три года .
6 . Следующее фото - мать , протащившая тайно наркоту своей дочери , находящейся в тубдиспансере .
Дочь - ВИЧ - инфицирована .
Мать говорит , что таскает наркотики дочери потому , что не хочет , чтобы та страдала .
Дочь была проституткой .
У матери есть и вторая дочь - тоже проститутка , и тоже ВИЧ - инфицированная .
7 .
Затем - молодой человек , проходящий рентгеноскопию в тубдиспансере , затем - он же , ожидающий врача .
Он - ВИЧ - инфицированный самый сложный пациент больницы .
Он был пойман с наркотиками и осуждён на 5 лет .
По слухам , его родители дали $ 300 , чтобы перевести его из тюрьмы в больницу .
8 . Теперь - Татьяна , ей 45 лет , она ВИЧ - инфицирована .
Она в том болезненном состоянии , которое вызвано агрессивным действием коктейля наркотиков .
Она не моежт усидеть на месте и всё время ходит .
Она говорила мне , что " что - то внутри меня и постоянно меня толкает " .

Before the Democratic - controlled Congress caved in on George W. Bush ’s warrantless - wiretapping powers , White House lawyers slipped in two provisions to give the President even more authority – and less accountability – than he claimed on his own .
And the U.S. press corps largely missed that part of the story .
U.S. news reports mostly parroted the White House claim that the law “ modernizes ” the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance of 1978 and “ narrowly ” targets overseas terror suspects who call or e-mail their contacts in the United States .
But the “ Protect America Act of 2007 ” actually casts the wiretapping net much wider .
The law applies not just to terror suspects abroad who might communicate with Americans at home , but to anyone who is “ reasonably believed to be outside the United States ” and who might possess “ foreign intelligence information , ” defined as anything that could be useful to U.S. foreign policy .
That means that almost any American engaged in international commerce or dealing with foreign issues – say , a businessman in touch with a foreign subsidiary or a U.S. reporter sending an overseas story back to his newspaper – is vulnerable to warrantless intercepts approved on the say - so of two Bush subordinates , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell .
Beyond the breathtaking scope of this new authority , the Bush administration also snuck in a clause that grants immunity from lawsuits to communications service providers that comply with spying directives from Gonzales and McConnell .
Before the “ Protect America Act ” won final approval from Congress on Aug. 4 and was signed into law by Bush on Aug. 5 , one of the few safeguards against Bush ’s warrantless wiretaps was the concern among service providers that they might be sued by customers for handing over constitutionally protected information without a warrant .
Compromise Talks
In earlier Capitol Hill discussions of a compromise bill , the administration reportedly had agreed to delete this immunity provision for service providers .
However , when negotiations broke down – and Bush made clear he would accuse the Democrats of endangering the nation ’s safety – Republicans put an immunity clause back into the final bill .
Then , in the chaotic hours before Congress left for its August recess , Democratic leaders allowed the Republican - authored bill to be rushed through the Senate and the House with centrist Democratic votes ensuring passage .
Though getting almost no attention in the U.S. press coverage , the immunity paragraph reads : “ Notwithstanding any other law , no cause of action shall lie in any court against any person for providing any information , facilities , or assistance in accordance with a directive under this section . ”
In other words , U.S. citizens , who believe that warrantless surveillance has violated their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure , will have no legal recourse against the service provider that collaborated with the government .
This immunity provision is important , too , because the only meaningful safeguard against abuse of the new spying power was that service providers could challenge a wiretap directive through a secret court proceeding .
That process already was weighted heavily in the Bush administration ’s favor since the service provider would not know the classified basis for the wiretap directive .
That evidence only would be shared ex parte in a secret conference between administration lawyers and the judge .
So , the service provider would have to file a costly lawsuit on behalf of an unknowing customer who might or might not be a legitimate target of government surveillance .
In filing the suit , the service provider also risked angering the U.S. government , which often is a major customer with the same service provider .
Now , the new law tilts the scales even further , making the warrantless surveillance legally cost free for a collaborating service provider .
These two features – the expansive wiretap coverage and the immunity provision for service providers – were cited in our Aug. 5 article at Consortiumnews.com .

Claim : Bank of America ran a pilot program in 2007 offering credit cards to customers lacking Social Security numbers .
TRUE
Examples : [ Collected via e-mail , February 2007 ]
Bank of America is now giving credit cards to Illegal Aliens without any identification !
They say that they want to get more of the Hispanic population to bank with them !
What the hell is happening to this country ?
The next thing you know Illegal Aliens will be allowed to run for President !
What part of ‘ ILLEGAL aliens ’ do n’t they understand ?
And why do we have to cater to them , especially when we have ‘ AMERICAN CITIZENS ’ who are in much more need of help then they do ?
This is an outrage !!

This is an outrage !!
Today , Bank of America announced they will be opening accounts for illegal immigrants to boost their revenue .
Get this !
The illegals do n’t have to have a social security number , etc .
Although , the rates will be higher than those who have a social security number , I believe it sends a message of it ’s alright to be an illegal in this United States .
I object and will be closing my checking account today .
Enough is enough .
They need to do the right thing and become legal .
My grandparents came to this country legally in 1914 and honored the United States by becoming citizens .
If you have an account at the Bank of America and believe as I do close your account then pass this e-mail on .
Hopefully our voices will be heard .
We need to make a stand .
Origins : The 13 February 2007 disclosure that Bank of America ( BofA ) , the largest retail banking chain in the U.S. , had been testing a pilot program to provide credit cards to customers who may not have had Social Security numbers made it the target of criticism .
While Bank of America asserted that the pilot program ( originally tested at five Southern California branches in 2006 , then expanded to 51 branches in Los Angeles County ) was about meeting the needs of potential customers rather than politics , its critics regarded the financial institution ’s act as a tacit endorsement of illegal immigration .
As the Associated Press noted of Bank of America ’s pilot program :
Outspoken critics of illegal immigration called for a boycott and said the bank could be supporting terrorists and drug traffickers .
Some outraged customers closed accounts and sent back their cards , cut up .
The bank ’s chief executive , Ken Lewis , admitted that “ finding oneself in the middle of a heated national debate is never pleasant . ”
( Although this item was recirculated as current in mid-2010 , as far as we can ascertain Bank of America had by then dropped the credit card pilot program and opted not to expand it . )
The program was open to Bank of America customers who may have lacked both Social Security numbers and credit histories but who had maintained overdraft - free checking accounts with the financial giant for three months .
While it is not strictly true that Bank of America was offering to establish credit for “ illegal aliens , ” critics said the difference amounted to hair - splitting because most U.S. adults who do n’t have Social Security numbers are illegal immigrants .
Bank of America asserted that its program complied with U.S. banking and anti-terrorism laws .
Critics said such services would enable illegal immigrants to put down roots more
easily in the U.S. and could provide them tax benefits to which they are not entitled .
( Contrary to common belief , the Patriot Act requires that credit card issuers ensure their customers provide adequate documentation of identity ; it does not mandate that credit card holders must have Social Security numbers . )
The Bank of America pilot credit cards carried a 21.24 % interest rate and required payment of an upfront fee .
The Wall Street Journal reported on one immigrant who had sneaked into the U.S. a decade ago , had been a customer of Bank of America for nine years , and had no credit history or Social Security number .
He paid a $ 99 fee to obtain a $ 500 - limit Visa card , and provided he stayed within his $ 500 credit limit and paid his balances in a timely fashion , he would receive his $ 99 security payment back in three to six months and would possibly see his credit limit increased as well .
Among the banking community , BofA was not alone in pursuing this segment of the potential customer base .
Citigroup had been offering similar credit cards for years , and in 2006 , Wells Fargo began offering home mortgages in Los Angeles and Orange counties to immigrants who had lived in the U.S. for at least two years .
These customers were allowed to identify themselves using their individual taxpayer identification numbers ( ITIN ) issued by the Internal Revenue Service instead of Social Security numbers .
ITINs are the same type of identification number immigrants could use to obtain credit cards under Bank of America ’s pilot program .
Critics said that it ’s too easy for undocumented immigrants to receive ITINs : “ At face value the program seems to be problematic , ” Russ Knocke , a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security .
“ It seems to be lending itself to possibilities of perpetrating identity theft or creating more risk for money laundering . ”

Earlier this month , Ron Paul , an internet superstar as far as presidential candidates are concerned was interviewed on Kudlow & Company regarding the housing bubble .
So far we ’ve seen President Bush say “ No ” to a federal bailout , while some democrats like Hillary Clinton are proposing otherwise .
With a complete turnaround in mortgage rates , it ’s tough to find who is backing who .
An interesting conversation indeed :
Larry Kudlow :
If there was a President Paul , how would you be handling this ?
Ron Paul :
Mortgage rates were artificially low . …
The fed was inflating like crazy . …
There was a lot of malinvestment .
First it was in the NASDAQ bubble , now it ’s in the housing bubble , so it was very predictable so nobody should be surprised .
Larry Kudlow :
Ron Paul :
I do n’t see how it could be anything else , where did the fed get this 120 - 130 billion dollars to buy bills and buy securities ?
They did n’t get it out of thin air – this bails the banks out !
The president is saying the right things , and he does n’t want to bail out but the fed is bailing out !
Politicians will never allow the correction to come .
And that ’s the fallacy , by bailing out and propping up , you just delay the inevitable .
The correction will come until you liquidate all the bad debt .

They say that opposites attract .
And perhaps that 's why Roslyn Grady and Faith McGowan are such good friends .
For although the pair are the same age and go to the same school , a height difference of 17in means they do n't quite see things from the same perspective .
But the 12 - year - olds , who attend St Kentigern 's Academy , in Blackburn , West Lothian , do n't let this worry them .
Rosyln , who is 6ft 2in , said : " I 've been friends with Faith for a year and a half - she 's the smallest in the class and I 'm the tallest .
" The difference in our heights has never been a problem for us .
Being tall is good most of the time .
I can see over everyone 's head when there 's a crowd and I 'm good at basketball . "
Buying clothes can be hard , however .
She wears a size 14 and size nine shoes .
Faith , also 12 , said : " Sometimes people at school do think it 's a bit weird that we 're friends because Roslyn is so tall and I 'm small .
But we do n't mind .
" Roslyn does grow quite quickly .
I really notice it if I 've not seen her for a while in the holidays . "
It is not hard to see where Roslyn , of East Whitburn , gets her stature .
Her mother , Pauline O'Connor , is the same height .
Miss O'Connor , 32 , who is divorced from Roslyn's father , said : " If she gets any bigger , we 're going to have to get her a new bed . "
“ All the bits of evidence we have tend to say that this trend is continuing , ” Professor Lemieux said .
In 2003 , the authors note , 44.5 percent of workers at Fortune 1000 companies received some form of performance - based pay , up from 34.7 percent in 1996 .
And think of the growing legions of self - employed — people selling items on eBay , mortgage brokers and real estate brokers , freelance journalists and consultants of all types — for whom all pay is performance - based .
Among these growing cadres , the dispersion of incomes is rather large .
“ When you look at the self - employed and contractors , ” Professor Lemieux said , “ inequality is much higher . ”
Aside from corporate compensation policies , public policies have played a significant role in contributing to the growth of income inequality .
That ’s the argument made in a recent , brilliant National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Professor Levy and Peter Temin , the Elisha Gray II professor of economics at M.I.T .
The paper , which is more narrative than quantitative — Professor Temin is a distinguished economic historian — argues that the rise of income is n’t simply a byproduct of the free market working its wonders .
Professor Levy and Professor Temin divide the second half of the 20th century into two periods .
In the first , 1955 to 1980 , a grand bargain between labor and corporate America involving New Deal - era protections for workers and high marginal tax rates ( the top rate was 90 percent in the 1950s ) led to what economists have called the Great Moderation .
The middle class grew dramatically , income inequality decreased , and corporations generally enjoyed labor peace .
Since 1980 , they argue , it ’s been a different story , thanks in part to a shifting political environment .
Unions have weakened , the minimum wage has n’t come close to keeping up with inflation , and marginal income tax rates have been cut — the top marginal rate is now 35 percent , down from 70 percent in 1980 .
A result has been declining bargaining power for workers and the rise of a winner - take - all environment .
“ The last six years of federal tax history have involved an inhospitable politics in which winners have used their political power to expand their winnings , ” the authors say .
In other words , if capital has lately been prevailing in the centuries - long battle with labor , it is doing so with a substantial assist from the government .
Professor Saez agrees with the broad argument , but says that the impact of tax policy in recent years has been minor .
When the top income tax rate was 5o percent in the 1970s , he says , “ the force to pay according to talent was much weaker ” because most of the excess pay would be eaten up by taxes .
“ Once the very high tax rates for big fortunes were removed in the 1980s , ” Professor Saez says “ then the market could drive up the compensation at the top . ”

The federal agencies that are supposed to regulate the banking and credit card industries have failed utterly to keep pace with deceptive and unfair practices that have become shamefully standard in the business .
As a consequence many hard - working Americans who pay their bills are mired in debt — and in danger of losing whatever savings they have , and perhaps their homes .
Congress , which sat on its hands while the problem got worse and worse , needs to rein in this sometimes predatory industry .
The scope of the problem was laid out in Congressional hearings this spring held by Senator Carl Levin , the Democrat from Michigan .
According to testimony , one witness exceeded his charge card ’s $ 3,000 limit by $ 200 — triggering what eventually amounted to $ 7,500 in penalties and interest .
After paying an average of $ 1,000 a year for six years , the man still owed $ 4,400 .
That experience has become all too common as the credit card industry has stealthily adopted methods designed to maximize burdensome penalties and fees , while ratcheting up interest rates as high as 30 percent .
Companies bombard unwary consumers with teaser packages that promise very low interest rates to start , while reserving for themselves the right to raise rates whenever they choose .
The details are buried in deliberately arcane contracts that run 30 pages long and that even lawyers have trouble understanding .
Congressional investigations and studies by consumer advocates have exposed other unsavory practices .
Some card companies apply penalty rates retroactively — to purchases that were made before the penalty was incurred or in some cases to debts that were even paid off .
As one Congressional witness pointed out , the credit card industry is the only one allowed to increase the price of a product after it has been sold .
Throughout early July , the company planned to display the device to the public for the first time .
Professor Sir Eric
Ash , electrical engineer and former rector of Imperial College London , visited the demonstration for the BBC News website .
Sean MacCarthy does not know where the energy comes from
As an engineer , whenever I look at a new baby I say categorically that there can be no such thing - it 's far too complicated to work .
Yet we know this lack of faith in the marvellous is misplaced .
So , the fact that a device or an invention looks too marvellous to be true is not conclusive evidence that it is n't .
I believe that it is thinking on such lines that encourages inventors - and there have been many since the 12th Century - to pursue what would be a true marvel : a perpetual motion machine .
The most recent attempt is from Mr Sean McCarthy , the Chief Executive Officer of an Irish company called Steorn .
His invention , known as the " Orbo " , is a mechanical device which uses powerful magnets on the rim of a rotor and further magnets on an outer shell .
Mr McCarthy is convinced that it is working .
He took a full page advertisement in the Economist last year to say so , and to attract volunteer scientists to check the authenticity of his claims .
They are still in the process of doing so .
Constant universe
In the meantime Mr McCarthy was hoping to demonstrate the machine to the public at the London Kinetica Museum , which is devoted to displaying dynamic art , particularly of artefacts at the interface of science and art .
The demonstration was to run over 10 days starting on 6 July .
Unfortunately , there was a technical defect , attributed by Mr McCarthy to the excessive heat produced by lights used to illuminate the device so that cameras could stream pictures of it in action across the web .
He hopes to be able to demonstrate the machine at a later date .
Mr McCarthy appreciates that if the device really works it is in contradiction of the law of conservation of energy , which he sees as a dogma of science .
I believe that Mr McCarthy is truly convinced of the validity of his invention .
It is , in my view , a case of prolonged self deception .
Eric Ash
There is an implied reference to religious dogmas , and it is just here that one can see the source of the misunderstanding .
Most religions feature a multiplicity of dogmas .
A person who is an adherent of that religion may not necessarily believe each and every one of the dogmas .
Beliefs cannot of course be chosen a la carte - but there is a degree of flexibility which can accommodate quite significant differences .
The law of conservation of energy is not like this .
It states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant , although it may change forms , into heat or kinetic energy for example .
In short , law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed .
Denying its validity would undermine not just little bits of science - the whole edifice would be no more .
All of the technology on which we built the modern world would lie in ruins .
There is no flexibility in the acceptance of the law as true - at all times , and in all circumstances .
It is the failure to appreciate the difference between this scientific law and a law of religion or of society which is why we know - without having to examine details of a particular device - that Orbo cannot work .
Sole focus
So , last Friday a number of people turned up at the museum and were told that the demonstration would have to be postponed , indefinitely .
The public demonstration has been postponed indefinitely
I was fortunate , however , in that Mr McCarthy kindly agreed to see me .
He is a very friendly person aged just over 40 , trained originally as a mechanical engineer .
He has also worked in software engineering and on control systems for the oil industry .
He came across his invention by chance whilst developing an independent power system for CCTV cameras .
The company , founded in 2000 and supported privately , is now wholly devoted to developing Orbo .
When asked about the conservation of energy Mr McCarthy says quite frankly that he does not know where the energy that provides perpetual motion comes from .
He wonders whether he is somehow harnessing so - called " zero point " energy , a type of residual energy found in a system and first proposed by Einstein .
Zero point energy is the lowest possible energy a system can have and therefore cannot be removed .
He also points out that cosmologists believe in the presence of dark matter and dark energy .
Might they somehow help his cause ?
I believe that Mr McCarthy is truly convinced of the validity of his invention .
It is , in my view , a case of prolonged self deception .
I ended our conversation by giving totally unsolicited advice : to drop Orbo and get back to software engineering .
It would not have been unreasonable had he then grabbed me by the collar and thrown me out of the window .
He did none of these things and was totally genial .
Might I have convinced him ?
I do hope so .
XiTi Monitor has released its latest report ( FR ) on web browsers utilization in Europe and the rest of the world according to a survey during the first week of July .
All European countries saw an increase in Firefox participation with Hungary showing the most dramatic increase from 27.2 % , in the latest March 2007 survey , to 39.7 % .
Overall , Europe grew from 24.1 % to 27.8 % .
I ’ve been tracking XiTi results for a long while now and the chart below shows the market share evolution for the top 8 European countries .
At the global level , all continents show a notable increase with South America taking the largest growth to reach 15.5 % from 11.9 % in the latest report .
Oceania keeps the lead at 28.9 % .
This , Mr. Calder argues , made the message of the movie “ more wrong than right . ”
Mr. Ham himself came to realize as much in the years that followed .
By 1916 , he had teamed up with the better elements of the lending business to pass laws that set a standard rate of 42 percent — an eye - popping rate by today ’s standard but , at the time , still progress .
“ It was the birth of the modern personal finance business , ” Mr. Calder says .
It ’s easy to see everything since then as a step in the wrong direction , to romanticize a time when debt was less common .
But think about what life was like before easy money .
Think about how hard it would be to buy a house or pay for college if a 42 percent interest rate still seemed normal .
Some of the changes are surprisingly recent .
Just a generation ago , a temporary setback , like illness , divorce or job loss , was much more likely to force a family to take drastic measures than it is today .
That ’s in large measure because of debt , which allows families to smooth out the rough edges of their financial lives .
You can see this change in the national statistics on consumer spending .
Since the early 1990s , the peaks in spending growth rates have n’t been as high as they were in the 1960s , ’70s and ’ 80s , but the valleys have n’t been as low , either .
Not coincidentally , recessions have come less often over the last two decades and they have been fairly mild .
Mortgages are a big part of this story .
Thanks to the enormous amount of foreign capital that has flowed into the market over the last decade — the same influx of capital , yes , that helped cause the boom to get out of hand — the mortgage business has become bigger , more competitive and more innovative .
If you take out a mortgage today , you ’ll pay thousands of dollars less in upfront fees than you would have in the mid-80s .
( Those fees have fallen by 80 percent in just two decades . )
Home buyers who know they ’re going to live in their house for only a few years now also have the ability to get an interest rate that reflects their situation .
The 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage is n’t the only game in town .
Of course , people in the mortgage business — the brokers , lenders and Wall Street executives who brought you the meltdown — like to argue that the current problems are mere footnotes compared with all the progress .
They are wrong about that .
The excesses were real , and they were big .
We ’re still figuring out just how big .
The solution will have to involve new guidelines , voluntary or government - imposed , that force lenders to be clearer about the terms they ’re offering borrowers .
But as long as we take tough measures to clean up the mess , we ’ll end up with a healthier mortgage market than we had beforehand .
And then we can go looking for the next form of debt to captivate and torment us .

Aaron Walden , 20 , from Gloucester , also won for the third time - beating a man dressed in a nappy to the bottom of the hill .
About 25 volunteers from the St John Ambulance were on hand to treat the inevitable injuries , while a team from Search and Rescue Assistance in Disasters was also on hand to treat any medical emergencies .
Psychologist Jemima Bullock , 33 , from Wellington , New Zealand , was the winner of the ladies ' race .
" It 's pretty well known back home and it's always on the news , " she said .
" It was a bit slippy out there but I think that actually helped .
I guess you 've got to be a bit mad to do this . "
Paul Jones , from the St John Ambulance , said 20 people had been treated for minor injuries .
" It 's the lowest figure for some time .
Last year it was about 34 .
No -one was knocked out and most of the injuries we treated were for cuts and bruises and sprains . "
Competitors from all over the world take part in the competition .
The competition , which is thought to date back hundreds of years , consists of a series of downhill races , with the winner of each receiving a cheese .
Kucinich : DLC agenda ' indistinguishable ' from Neoconservative agenda David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday August 13 , 2007
Print This Email This Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich , a consistent opponent of the war in Iraq , appeared Sunday on ABC's This Week , telling host George Stephanopoulos , " I think that the support is building in my direction . "
Stephanopoulos suggested instead that the response to Kucinich merely represents the Democratic Party 's " liberal base " and that the " centrists " of the Democratic Leadership Council under Howard Ford believe that Kucinich 's ideas " could hurt the party . "
Stephanopoulos quoted Ford as saying , " ' George W. Bush is handing us Democrats our Hoover moment ' " and told Kucinich , " They believe that if the party follows your path , they 're going to blow this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity . "
" You have to keep in mind that the center has shifted in our politics , " Kucinich responded , smiling .
" I 'm really at the center , and all the other candidates are to the right of me .
And they 're to the right of the American people . "
" The Democratic Leadership Council 's agenda is indistinguishable from the Republican Neoconservative agenda , " he went on .
" They want to continue to stay in Iraq .
They reject the idea of a not - for - profit health care system .
...
These analysts are ... trying to keep a politics that really helps support a privileged few at the expense of the many .
So I 'm the candidate of the people . "
Stephanopoulos then switched to the topic of Iraq , asking , " What is the plan after you bring the troops home ? "
" We must engage Syria and Iran and other nations in the region to put together this international security and peacekeeping force that would move in as our troops leave , " said Kucinich .
" The occupation is fueling the insurgency .
...
That 's why we must leave .
And the incentive [ for other nations to cooperate ] is stability in the region .
...
Every country 's concerned about the instability which our occupation of Iraq continues to bring . "
" In your view , what role do nuclear weapons play in our defense arsenal and under what circumstances would you use them ? "
Stephanopoulos asked .
" I think that the United States must lead the way for nuclear abolition , " Kucinich replied , calling any talk of keeping all options on the table , even with reservations , " not acceptable . "
" We need to rebuild our relationship with Russia , " Kucinich stated , " and we also need to tamp down the violence on the Asian subcontinent .
For anyone to talk about attacking Pakistan with any kind of weapons just begs the question as to whether they have the fitness to be president because that could set of a nuclear exchange of Pakistan with India .
...
The idea that somehow by having nuclear weapons you make the world a safer place is essentially insane . "
The following video is from ABC's This Week , broadcast on August 12 .
University of Michigan astronomers combined light from four widely separated telescopes to produce the first picture showing surface details on a sun- like star beyond our solar system .
The image of the rapidly rotating , hot star Altair is the most detailed stellar picture ever made using an innovative light - combining technique called optical interferometry , said U - M astronomer John Monnier .
Beyond this technical milestone , the Altair observations provide surprising new insights that will force theorists to revise ideas about the behavior of rapid rotators like Altair .
" This powerful new tool allows us to zoom in on a star that 's a million times farther away than the sun , " said Monnier , lead author of a paper to be published online Thursday by the journal Science .
" We 're testing the theories of how stars work in much more detail than ever before . "
Monnier and U - M graduate student Ming Zhao led an international team that made the Altair observations using four of the six telescopes at Georgia State University 's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy ( CHARA ) interferometric array on Mount Wilson , Calif .
The four telescopes were separated by nearly 300 yards .
Vacuum tubes carried starlight from the four scopes to a U - M built device called the Michigan Infrared Combiner , known as MIRC .

The combiner allowed researchers to merge infrared light from four of CHARA 's telescopes for the first time , simulating a single giant instrument three football fields across .
The result was an image of unprecedented detail --- roughly 100 times sharper than pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope .
While solar astronomers can view sunspots and storms on our home star 's roiling surface in exquisite detail , most other stars have --- until very recently --- appeared as simple points of light through even the most powerful telescopes .
But in the past decade , advances in the emerging field of optical interferometry have launched a new era of stellar imaging .
Other research teams have used the technique to acquire surface images of giant stars hundreds of times bigger than Altair .
But the U - M - led study provides the first picture of a so - called main sequence star , one that generates energy mainly from hydrogen - to - helium nuclear fusion reactions in its core .
Main sequence stars include the sun and most of the stars we see in the night sky .
" This is just a monumental stepping stone for us , " said Harold McAlister , director of CHARA and a regent 's professor of astronomy at Georgia State University in Atlanta .
" Main sequence stars are far and away the largest population of stars out there , and being able to make a picture of one creates tremendous opportunities for future research . "
One likely target for future studies : Imaging planets around stars beyond our solar system , said U - M's Zhao .
" Imaging stars is just the start , " he said .

Altair is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila , The Eagle , and is clearly visible with the naked eye in Northern Hemisphere skies .
The nearby star is hotter and younger than the sun and nearly twice its size .
Altair rotates at 638,000 mph at its equator , roughly 60 times faster than our home star .
" It 's really whipping around and that 's why , of course , it 's spread out like a twirling ball of pizza dough , " said Monnier , an assistant professor of astronomy .
Previous studies revealed that Altair , unlike most stars , is not a perfect sphere .
Instead , its rapid spin rate creates centrifugal forces that flatten it into an oval :
Its radius is significantly larger at the equator than at the poles .
In 1924 , astronomer Hugo von Zeipel predicted that rapid rotators would display just this type of equatorial bulge .
He also surmised that these stars would sport a dark band along the equator called gravity darkening .
The bloated equator would appear dark because it is farther from the star 's fiery nuclear core , and therefore cooler than the poles .
The CHARA picture of Altair , the result of observations made on two nights last summer , is " the first image of a star that allows us to visually confirm that basic idea " of gravity darkening , Monnier said .
But the Altair image displays even more equatorial darkening than standard models predict , pointing to flaws in current models , he said .
U - M astronomer David Berger was a co-author of the Science paper .
The team also included researchers from St. Andrews University , Cambridge University , Georgia State University , California Institute of Technology , Cornell University , the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Grenoble in France , the Michelson Science Center , and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory .
Funding for the Altair project was provided by the National Science Foundation and NASA .

Chauncey Bailey , editor of the Oakland Post and a former reporter for the Oakland Tribune , was slain by a masked gunman on a downtown Oakland street Thursday , police said .
Bailey , 57 , was shot shortly before 7:30 a.m. on 14th Street near Alice Street while walking to work , police said .
Paramedics were unable to revive Bailey , an outspoken advocate for the black community and an unabashed critic of corruption .
" With these types of things , we look at all possible motives - financial , family , work - related , " said Assistant Police Chief Howard Jordan .
" We believe he was targeted . "
Police spokesman Officer Roland Holmgren described the crime as " madness . "
Witnesses told police a lone , masked gunman dressed in dark clothing approached Bailey , shot him once in the back and once in the head and ran away .
One news account said the assailant got into a van that drove away , but Jordan said police have not been able to confirm that a van was used or that anyone else participated in the killing .
The spot where Bailey was killed is across the street from a preschool , across a parking lot from a post office and around the corner from a community arts center .
No one at Starlight Child Development Center saw anything , although a couple of teachers heard gunshots , said the school 's director , John Wong .
Bailey , who lived in Oakland and has a teenage son , was known for his assertive style of questioning city officials , Holmgren said .
" He was very controversial , " said Derrick Nesbitt , who worked with Bailey on a cable access channel called " Soul Beat " from 1997 to 2004 .
" He was tenacious and would not let people off the hook , whether he was reporting on corruption in city government , the entertainment business or among rappers .
He ruffled a lot of feathers because of it . "
Most of his spats were intellectual , Nesbitt said .
He said he asked Bailey several years ago if he had ever feared for his safety because of his probing into corruption or gang violence .
Bailey said he had received threats but had shrugged them off .
Bailey was fired from the Tribune in 2005 for ethics violations , according to several former colleagues .
He went on to work for the Post as a freelance foreign correspondent , covering stories in Vietnam and Haiti , and was named editor of the publication in June .
Bailey had recently written stories about foreclosure rates disproportionately affecting African Americans and Latinos .
Joseph Debro , a biochemical engineer who also wrote stories for the Post , said Bailey had also been working on a story about a bankruptcy filing by Your Black Muslim Bakery , a series of stores on San Pablo Avenue .
" We 're grief - stricken , " said Post Publisher Paul Cobb .
" We 've lost a family member . "
" Why is the missing link , " said Gene Hazzard , a photographer and contributing writer at the Post .
Relatives were at a similar loss .
" Whatever happened is too much for us , " said the mother of Bailey 's 13 - year - old son , who asked not to be identified out of concern for her son 's safety .
" We 're in shock .
Chauncey was involved in big things in Oakland , but ... he kept both his lives separate .
What he was to us was a dad . "
The Post , a weekly with a circulation of 49,500 , is geared toward the African American community and is distributed in Oakland , Berkeley , Richmond and San Francisco .
Gwendolyn Carter , the paper 's advertising manager , said news of Bailey 's killing reached the office a little before 9 a.m .
She said the staff of about 10 people was in shock .
" He was a good man , " Carter said .
" He always took care of me .
He would say I was his little sister and he was my big brother . "
Members of the Post staff , including Cobb , as well as local NAACP representatives gathered at the scene of Thursday 's shooting , expressing disbelief at Bailey 's death and consoling one another .
" I 'm shocked , as all of us are in the city .
This is a daylight shooting ; it 's frightening , " said Chris Jackson , executive director of the NAACP 's Oakland chapter .
John Bowens , the paper 's director of advertising , said he and others had no idea what the motive could be .
" He talked to me about what he could do to make Oakland better for people , about how the city could improve , " Bowens said .
" He spoke his mind . "
Mayor Ron Dellums said in a prepared statement , " Chauncey will be missed .
He was at every media event , and he always asked the first question .
His questions were thoughtful , and you knew that he sought to truly inform the public . "
City Councilman Larry Reid called Bailey 's killing " a loss to the entire African American community . "
" Chauncey is someone who was very well respected , even though he and I sometimes disagreed , " Reid said .
" It 's just really sad .
Somehow we as a city , we as human beings have to get a handle on all these guns on the streets and these crazy people who have no sense of the value of a human life . "
In a statement , Tribune Managing Editor Martin Reynolds called Bailey " a friend , a valued colleague and a loving father . "
" His death has left all of us at the Oakland Tribune shocked and deeply saddened , " Reynolds said .
" Chauncey 's coverage of Oakland 's African American community was a tremendous asset to the Tribune .
...
We will miss Chauncey and send our sincerest condolences to his friends and family .
We now look to the authorities to bring his killer to justice . "
Police ask that anyone with information about the killing call investigators at ( 510 ) 238-3821 .
Crime Stoppers is offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of a suspect .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The number of soldiers who committed suicide increased 15 percent from 2005 to 2006 , according to an Army report .
The Army plans to release the data publicly on Thursday , CNN learned from Army officials .
The numbers have not previously been released , despite repeated CNN requests for data covering the past seven months .
In 2006 , 101 soldiers committed suicide , up from 88 in 2005 , according to Army statistics .
That amounts to 17.3 per 100,000 soldiers in 2006 and 12.8 per 100,000 the previous year .
The Army uses the statistical analysis to account for shifts in its overall size from year to year .
The 2006 figure of 101 includes two deaths in which there has not been a final ruling , but officials said they are likely to be ruled suicides .
The Army has concluded the " main indicators " for the 2006 suicides were failed relationships , legal and financial problems and " occupational / operational " issues .
The " typical profile " of a soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who kills himself with a firearm .
As of June 30 , 2007 , 44 soldiers had committed suicide , statistics showed .
Of those , 17 were deployed away from their home base .
In other years , the report showed :
-- 2006 : 101 suicides , 30 deployed ( 17.3 per 100,000 )
-- 2005 : 88 suicides , 25 deployed ( 12.8 per 100,000 )
-- 2004 : 67 suicides , 13 deployed ( 10.8 per 100,000 )
-- 2003 : 79 suicides , 26 deployed ( 12.4 per 100,000 )
It is difficult to compare the military suicide rate to that of the private sector because of demographic differences and overall human stress factors , officials say .
In 2006 , the overall suicide rate for the United States was 13.4 per 100,000 people .
It was 21.1 per 100,000 people for all men aged 17 to 45 , compared to a rate of 17.8 for men in the Army .
And it was 5.46 per 100,000 for all women , compared to an Army rate of 11.3 women soldiers per 100,000 .

Dave and Declan , I am taking the liberty of sending to you both a brief summary of Al Gore 's Internet involvement , prepared by Bob Kahn and me .
As you know , there have been a seemingly unending series of jokes chiding the vice president for his assertion that he " took the initiative in creating the Internet . "
Bob and I believe that the vice president deserves significant credit for his early recognition of the importance of what has become the Internet .
I thought you might find this short summary of sufficient interest to share it with Politech and the IP lists , respectively .
==============================================================
Al Gore and the Internet By Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf Al Gore was the first political leader to recognize the importance of the Internet and to promote and support its development .
No one person or even small group of persons exclusively " invented " the Internet .
It is the result of many years of ongoing collaboration among people in government and the university community .
But as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the Internet work , we would like to acknowledge VP Gore 's contributions as a Congressman , Senator and as Vice President .
No other elected official , to our knowledge , has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time .
Last year the Vice President made a straightforward statement on his role .
He said : " During my service in the United States Congress I took the initiative in creating the Internet . "
We do n't think , as some people have argued , that Gore intended to claim he " invented " the Internet .
Moreover , there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator , Gore 's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still - evolving Internet .
The fact of the matter is that Gore was talking about and promoting the Internet long before most people were listening .
We feel it is timely to offer our perspective .
As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of high speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and the improvement of our educational system .
He was the first elected official to grasp the potential of computer communications to have a broader impact than just improving the conduct of science and scholarship .
Though easily forgotten , now , at the time this was an unproven and controversial concept .
Our work on the Internet started in 1973 and was based on even earlier work that took place in the mid-late 1960s .
But the Internet , as we know it today , was not deployed until 1983 .
When the Internet was still in the early stages of its deployment , Congressman Gore provided intellectual leadership by helping create the vision of the potential benefits of high speed computing and communication .
As an example , he sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of government agencies to natural disasters and other crises .
As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and unconnected networks into an " Interagency Network . "
Working in a bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George Bush 's administrations , Gore secured the passage of the High Performance Computing and Communications Act in 1991 .
This " Gore Act " supported the National Research and Education Network ( NREN ) initiative that became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the Internet beyond the field of computer science .
As Vice President Gore promoted building the Internet both up and out , as well as releasing the Internet from the control of the government agencies that spawned it .
He served as the major administration proponent for continued investment in advanced computing and networking and private sector initiatives such as Net Day .
He was and is a strong proponent of extending access to the network to schools and libraries .
Today , approximately 95 % of our nation 's schools are on the Internet .
Gore provided much - needed political support for the speedy privatization of the Internet when the time arrived for it to become a commercially - driven operation .
There are many factors that have contributed to the Internet 's rapid growth since the later 1980s , not the least of which has been political support for its privatization and continued support for research in advanced networking technology .
No one in public life has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President .
Gore has been a clear champion of this effort , both in the councils of government and with the public at large .
The Vice President deserves credit for his early recognition of the value of high speed computing and communication and for his long - term and consistent articulation of the potential value of the Internet to American citizens and industry and , indeed , to the rest of the world .

Sept. 5 , 2007 – In an online editorial yesterday , Joel S. Hirschhorn , PhD , former Senior Staff Member of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) , called for a new investigation of 9/11 .
“ First , let the technical truth emerge .
Then , if necessary , cope with the inevitable political , conspiracy and other questions .
But let us not allow a possible painful truth block the primary task of determining once and for all what caused the collapse of the WTC towers and building no .
7 . ”
Dr. Hirschhorn is a nationally recognized engineer who has testified before Congress more than 50 times on technology , science , and environmental issues .
In addition to his work for the OTA , Dr. Hirschhorn also served as Director of Environment , Energy and Natural Resources for the National Governors Association .
Dr. Hirschhorn admitted to his own personal “ growing skepticism about the official WTC story ” .
He wrote “ analyses by many experts reveal the collapse of the three WTC buildings was not caused by the two airplanes exploding into the twin towers . ”
He noted “ the general view is that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition . ”
Dr. Hirschhorn endorsed the efforts of a new group , Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth , to launch a new , honest and comprehensive investigation that considers all the evidence and which examines the possibility of controlled demolition .
Dr. Hirschhorn issued a challenge to supporters of the official account of 9/11 , “ If those that believe the official 9/11 story - especially elected officials - trust their views , then let them support a serious effort to test the validity of the controlled demolition hypothesis .
If they fear and reject doing so , then let us see that as suspicious and unacceptable . ”
He concluded , “ Horrific possible answers can cause us to shun a question .
But clearing our minds of the fear of painful truths is essential to clearing our nation of destructive lies .
Otherwise , we stay stuck in a delusional democracy . "
The full text of Dr. Hirschhorn ’s statement can be found at http://blogcritics.org
Prior to his 13 years of service at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment , Dr. Hirschhorn was Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin , Madison from 1965 - 1978 .
He has a Bachelors and Masters degree in Metallurgical Engineering and a PhD in Materials Engineering .
He has been a consultant to industrial and chemical companies , DOE laboratories , state governments , and public interest organizations .
He currently is a Member of the Board of Directors of the National Foundation for Environmental Education and a Member of the Board of Directors of Sustainability Now !
He is the author of more than 150 papers , articles , guest editorials , and book chapters on environmental science and technology .
Dr. Hirschhorn is one of 200 engineers and architects who have publicly criticized the official account of 9/11 .

One of the things TheGardenLady enjoys is visiting places with plants or plant related material .
These include gardens , parks , arboretums , nurseries , farms , flower shows , farmers markets , etc .
These places can be private or public .
If TheGardenLady is in the vicinity and the places are open to the public , TheGarden Lady will try to visit .
There are so many different types of gardens and each is a work of art .
The artist Monet knew this when he created his garden in Giverny , France .
So how does one find good places to visit ?
There are numerous ways .
If you are looking for a botanic garden or arboretum , Wikipedia has a list .
The GardenLady likes to visit private gardens as well .
How does TheGardenLady get into private gardens ?
Some garden associations have Visit Private Garden Days where you buy a ticket that is really a donation to the association and they give you a list of a number of gardens that you can visit .
Recently the Swarthmore , PA Horticultural Society had such a day , taking people by bus to visit gardens in Princeton and environs .
So check out your local Horticultural Society or garden club .
Have you ever heard of the Garden Conservancy ?
“ The Garden Conservancy is a national , nonprofit organization founded in 1989 to preserve exceptional American gardens for public education and enjoyment . ”
They have open days programs where one can visit private gardens .
These days are listed on the website .
They also sell books called Open Day Directory - The Guide to visiting America ’s Best Private Gardens .
This year they seem to have a National book and a book for visiting gardens of the East and of the West .
They list places where this book can be bought .
I bought my books at the Phila .
Flower Show and the NJ Flower Show .
They are great presents .
With the cost of the book they had given a free admission offer and they also tell you what the costs of each garden is to be on the day it is open .
The money helps save wonderful gardens .
In the last 5 years , TheGardenLady has visited about 50 gardens a year .
In the US I have visited gardens from Quail Botanical Gardens in Encinitas , CA on the west coast to Leaming ’s Run Gardens in Cape May County , NJ on the east coast .
From the Garfield Park Conservatory in Chicago , Illinois in the north to the Disney World Gardens in Orlando in Florida in the south .
Throughout a lifetime I have visited gardens and seen flowers in much of Europe and the Middle East .
Yet it is never enough – I wish I could visit more .
I am not a photographer in that my eyes are on the plant not the camera .
But I hope to share a few of my photos of some of those gardens that I have visited both in the US and abroad with my readers .
But more importantly , I wish my readers would share photos of their favorite gardens with TheGardenLady site .
These can be photos of your personal gardens , special plants , indoor gardens , deck or patio gardens , container gardens , window sill gardens or you can send your photos of your friends ’ gardens or your favorite public grounds or gardens .
The photos can be vegetables or trees that you love , they do n’t all have to be flowers .
The photos can be from botanical gardens , arboretums , parks , wildflowers , islands of plants on streets , etc .
Send your garden photos to TheGardenLady site to share with all the readers .
You only have to write your first name and the town or city and state when you send the photo .
Do n’t write anything personal .
The GardenLady loves to admire .
And I feel certain that TheGardenLady readers would love to admire your photos .
If you live in Canada , Mexico or anywhere abroad , TheGardenLady would also appreciate your sending photos with your first name and the location of the garden .
The GardenLady will be showing some of her Italian Garden photos on the site .
Brief comments are always appreciated .
So let us know why you found a place special .
And let the world know if the garden is open to the public .
So maybe we , too , can visit a favorite garden of yours .

WASHINGTON , May 3 — The House of Representatives voted today to extend “ hate crime ” protection to people who are victimized because of their sexuality .
But the most immediate effect of the bill may be to set up another veto showdown between Democrats and President Bush .
By 237 to 180 , the House voted to include crimes spurred by a victim ’s “ gender , sexual orientation or gender identity ” under the hate - crime designation , which now applies to crimes spurred by the victim ’s race , religion , color or national origin .
“ The bill is passed , ” Representative Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat who is gay , announced to applause , most of it from Democrats .
Similar legislation is moving through the Senate .
But even assuming that a bill emerges from the full Congress , it will face a veto by President Bush on grounds that it is “ unnecessary and constitutionally questionable , ” the White House said before the House vote .
The media polls that are driving this election may contain hidden flaws , veteran pollster Angus Reid warns .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Reid says that a combination of factors - including reduced media budgets for polling and the increasing reluctance of Canadians to talk to pollsters - could be harming the reliability of election polls .
He 's particularly worried about the growing tendency of many Canadians to screen their phone calls and refuse to talk to pollsters - which can mean that a pollster has to make 10,000 phone calls to complete 1,000 interviews .
Such high refusal rates not only increase the cost of polling , but they may mean that pollsters end up interviewing people who are not representative of the general public .
" It 's the big dirty secret of the industry , " Reid said .
Cheaper to publish others ' polls
Reid 's concerns come in the midst of the most poll - driven election in recent history , as the apparent Liberal collapse and Conservative surge have set the agenda for media coverage across the country .
Reid , who founded the company now known as Ipsos - Reid , said the media " really do n't have any money for polling . "
Twenty years ago , the Southam chain of newspapers would spend $ 250,000 on election polling , said Reid , who has been polling for three decades .
" I 'll bet that CanWest - slash - National Post is not spending $ 50,000 in this campaign . "
The result is that " no one 's paying for really good high - quality polling , yet there 's a lot of polls being conducted . "
That creates " a tension there that I think is bound to come up and bite someone where it hurts . "
What they do n't say about ' refusal rates '
Media polls should state their refusal rates , said Reid , who is now works as an independent consultant but is not polling during this election .
Refusal rates have been an issue of concern in the polling community for several years .
The Professional Marketing Research Society has found that refusal rates - defined as the number of people who refuse to talk to a pollster as a proportion of all people spoken to by the pollster - have been climbing steadily for the last decade .
The refusal rate for all telephone polls in Canada now stands at about 80 per cent , the society recently reported .
That means that for every interview a pollster conducts , four respondents have refused to participate .
In addition , thanks in large part to answering machines and call blockers , almost half of all numbers dialled by pollsters never reach a live human being .
Pollsters worry that this could mean that the people who do agree to be interviewed are different from the people the pollsters are n't talking to .
The margin - of - error statements in news reports of polls are based on an assumption that the people interviewed make up a random sample ; that is , everyone has an equal chance of being interviewed .
That may not be as true today as it once was .
" Maybe Conservatives , being perhaps older or more cantankerous or whatever , are more likely to refuse than Liberals , " said Reid .
" In which case , the industry is going to be somewhat confused on election day . "
Good polling key to good journalism
Reid said it is unfortunate that the CBC is not polling during this election .
The network has stated that , as a matter of principle , it will not conduct " horse race " polls during this campaign .
" The CBC used to spend more on their polling program than any of the private operators , " Reid said .
" For them to assume that good journalism does n't involve polling is , I think , a little naive ..
I think responsible polling is a very , very , very central part of an election campaign and responsible media should be paying some money to get it done right . "
Reid was also critical of how the media report poll results .
Reporters often highlight small shifts in poll results , he said - changes that could be due to nothing more than the fact that numbers will always tend to bounce up and down from poll to poll within the margin of error .
" You 've got the Globe and Mail looking at a drop of four points or three points and saying this is a major drop , " he said .
" For all we know , within the normal margin of error , there was no change ..
" I think the consumers of polls should be skeptical about that . "
New techniques aim for better results
Steve Mossop , Ipsos - Reid 's managing director for Western Canada , conceded that refusal rates are rising at the same time that pollsters are under pressure to do more with less .
But he denied that this hurts the quality of the media 's election polls .
" It 's not as dramatic as maybe Angus has proposed , " Mossop said .
Ipsos - Reid , which is polling for the Globe and CTV during this election , is examining new techniques to offset the effect of rising refusal rates , he said .
As for media outlets cutting back on what they spend on polling , Mossop said , " Yes , we 're getting a squeeze to produce more .
It 's not a challenge that 's going to have a negative impact on the predictability of the election results . "
Mossop added that Ipsos Reid and its predecessor , the Angus Reid Group , have successfully predicted every election outcome for the past 25 years .
Current sampling methods are more sophisticated and accurate than in the days when Reid headed the company , he said .
Conrad Winn , whose Compas Inc. conducts polls for CanWest - Global , said there are techniques that pollsters can use to reduce refusal rates .
" Response rates are always something to be concerned about and clients get what they pay for , " Winn said .
" You can greatly increase response rates , as we know , by a combination of technical skill and training of interviewers . "
Is this a telemarketing call ?
Part of the problem is that people confuse pollsters with telemarketers , he said .
" It 's also driven partly by cost - sensitive clients who make it difficult for the research suppliers to do what 's necessary to boost response rates . "
" It could well be " that media outlets are n't spending as much on polls as they once did , he said .
" On the other hand , what is the reality ?
People are not reading newspapers the way they used to . "
Still , readers and viewers should n't be concerned with the quality of the polling they 're given , he said .
" The proof is in the pudding ..
The media do n't do any worse job than they used to .
They probably do a better job than they used to . "
John Willis , senior consultant with Strategic Communications , which is polling for the NDP during this election , said he is not too concerned about the dangers posed by high refusal rates .
Pollsters employ sophisticated statistical techniques to counteract the negative effects of high refusals , he said .
Willis did agree with Reid that the media often make too much of small shifts between polls .
" As an insider to a campaign , I wish there was n't quite so much of that going on out in the media because it heightens our sense of ' Oh my God , the Conservatives are up two points . '
It has a feedback for the political parties as well as a feedback for the public that I do n't think is necessarily all that helpful .
It tends to obscure deeper issues . "
Smaller samples can mean 20 - point swings
Willis and Vancouver pollster Evi Mustel agreed that readers and viewers can get the wrong impression from news accounts of regional support for parties .
A standard national poll will usually be based on about 1,000 interviews from coast to coast , which means that between 100 and 150 interviews will be conducted in a province the size of B.C.
What the media often do n't explain , however , is that the results for B.C. will therefore be much less reliable than the national results .
Smaller samples mean larger margins of error and a sample of 100 carries a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percentage points , 19 times out of twenty .
That means that if the " true " support for the Conservatives in B.C. is , say , 45 per cent , you can expect a well - conducted poll based on 100 interviews to give you a result for the Conservatives anywhere between 35 per cent and 55 per cent .
Not quite as precise as the national results .
Mustel says that all this means that if a national poll says the spread between two parties in B.C. is as large as 10 percentage points , it still does n't mean anything .
( Some local media outlets will pay extra to get a larger regional sample as part of a national poll .
If the poll you 're reading or hearing about has done that , it should say so . )
But should the media be reporting " horse race " poll results at all ?
" If you look at campaign coverage from the ' 50s , " Reid said , " before the advent of the kind of polling we see now , election campaigns were all about parties trying to trick the journalists into who was on first and who had more support . "
Or consider these words from American journalism professor Philip Meyer , the former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research :
" The most interesting fact about an election is who wins .
The most interesting thing about a campaign at any given moment is who is ahead ..
If
you can find out , ahead of time , who is going to win , that is news by definition . "
Tom Barrett is a veteran political reporter and a contributing editor to The Tyee .
After six years of America 's mainstream media bowing to its corporate mandate to ignore all opposition to George W. Bush , a media miracle has happened .
Thanks to the great camera work of AP photographer , Charles Dharapak , the American anti-war movement has been revealed to the world .
In one flash of a magical millisecond , photographer Dharapak captured CODEPINK peacemaker Desiree Fairooz confronting George Bush warmaker Condoleeza Rice .
It was the shot SEEN 'round the world .
A huge thank you to photographer Charles Dharapak and to the Associated Press for letting the truth be told - for passing the message to the world that within the boundaries of imperial America thrives a valiant peace movement that opposes George W. Bush , and works hard to overthrow him .
Every American who opposes the immoral wars on Afghanistan and Iraq , and fears an encore on Iran , owes a heart - felt thanks to Desiree Fairooz for placing herself in the cross hairs for peace .
The responses to Fairooz ' patriotism , and to the brazen women of CODEPINK , have been astounding .
Across the nation , on blogs , on television , and on radio , there has been a steady stream of support .
Fairooz has shown that the opposition to Bush from inside America equals the opposition of the outside world .
Until now , because mainstream media has abdicated its truth - teller role , the peace movement has largely been hidden .
Independent media has been an honest herald , but media corporations , with their own blood soaked hands , have whited the peace movement out .
There is no Myanmar - like coverage of anti-government protests filling the network news .
There are no corporate broadcasters sympathetic to protesters on the air .
How can they be - if they are ONE with the government ?!
How can they be - if consolidating media means dismantling any challenge to power ?
It 's fine to broadcast from outside in - but not from inside out .
Thus , orange - clad Burmese monks are boffo for the camera , but orange clad Americans are not .
After all - in the American peace movement , orange signifies Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo , and the impeachment of George W. Bush .
If the media offered an extensive view of pro-peace / pro-impeachment America , there would be hours of passionate viewing .
CODEPINK , for one , the women initiated grassroots peace and justice movement with which Desiree Fairooz is aligned , labors unceasingly for peace - devising creative methods to stop the war .
It 's members are routinely harassed for challenging the government .
Although CODEPINK has chapters around the world , it concentrates much of its efforts in Washington , DC .
Its members are famous - some say infamous - for their well considered acts of peaceful disobedience .
Though only five years old , the women and men of CODEPINK are recognized leaders in the global peace and justice movement .
( View CNN 's Jeannie Moos ' perspective on Desiree Fairooz and CODEPINK : )
In a June 2005 essay for Palgrave MacMillan , I wrote the following of CODEPINK :
" As women in the U.S. move forward with their activism , they must appreciate the great advances brought about by the women pioneers who came before .
Because of the noble and heroic work of their predecessors , the women of today are able to venture beyond issues of women 's rights and gender inequality .
Although there is still much to be accomplished on these fronts , the current injustices wrought by corporate globalization , U.S. imperialism , unjustifiable wars , and religious fanaticism , have redirected women activists from the national stage into the global arena .
CODEPINK , as a key women 's organization , collaborates closely with social justice organizations throughout the world .
It has put a new face on women 's activism with a fierceness and creativity that would make Susan B . Anthony grin , and blush , all at the same time . "
That statement is even more accurate today .
On September 15th , 100,000 peace activists marched through the streets of Washington , DC to demand an end to war .
The corporate media grossly under - reported their numbers .
Because of the dereliction of Time Warner , News Corp , Fox , Disney and the rest of America 's corporate media , the world believes there is minor opposition in America to George Bush and his immoral wars .
Because of the media 's failing as an agency of truth , and its betrayal of those who uphold it , America strays ever further from democracy .
On October 27th , another 100,000 peacemakers ( cumulatively ) marched in several locations across the nation .
Mainstream media again distorted the facts .
In Los Angeles , photos and videos of the event verify that thousands of patriots marched .
Yet , on KNBC , the NBC affiliate , anchor Furnell Chapman reported that " hundreds " marched in L.A .
Even with visual proof , he lied .
They have no shame .
If only it were illegal to use the people 's airwaves to purposely LIE TO THE PEOPLE !!
For the nation 's peacemakers - the silenced heroes who defend the Constitution - there are no delusions of an honorable mainstream media .
The lessons of deceit and deception have long been taught .
Corporate media serves the President - not the people .
Correspondents value face - time and air - time - not the truth - which is sad because when that rare moment of truth does finally get told , it carries incredible power .
In a split second , thanks to Charles Dharapak and the Associated Press , the entire world bore witness to the depth of anger and disdain millions of Americans feel for the architects of Bush 's war .
Desiree Fairooz ' expression was the expression of millions .
Her actions were the actions of millions .
Her words were the words of millions - and they 've been shouted again and again on the streets of America - unseen , unheard and unreported to the rest of the world .
And her hands ...
Desiree 's bloody hands are the bloody hands of millions of Americans who bear the pain of knowing , like the " good Germans " before them , that they , too , are held accountable for the deeds their leaders do .
On October 27th , a day for America to protest the war , patriots marched with RED stained hands in solidarity with the truth .
Thank you , Desiree Fairooz for shouting truth to power .
Thank you for telling our story .
Thank you for giving the media a rare moment to shine - and an incentive to shine even brighter .

All the ancestors of contemporary Europeans apparently did not migrate out of Africa as previously believed .
According to a new analysis of more than 5,000 teeth from long - perished members of the genusand the closely relatedmany early settlers hailed from Asia .
Erik Trinkaus , a physical anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis ( who was not involved in the study ) , says most evolutionary biologists and anthropologists believe there were three major waves of migration from Africa to Europe : the first occurring about two million to 1.5 million years ago during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs ; a second during the mid Pleistocene , roughly one million to 500,000 years ago ; and ending with the spread of modern humans , 50,000 to 30,000 years in the past .
The new findings , published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA , casts doubt on the second migration out of Africa .
" [ The researchers ] are not denying that it happened , " Trinkaus says , " just that it was less important than movement across Eurasia . "
The study was led by Maria Martinón - Torres , a paleobiologist at the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos , Spain .
The research team analyzed the choppers of human ancestors from the Pleistocene and late Pliocene epochs .
" Teeth are the best genetic marker that we have in the fossil record itself , " Trinkaus says , because " they are as close as we can get to a reflection of the individual 's genetic makeup . "
The reason : Tooth crowns are genetically determined — and thus reflect an individual 's genotype — and are not affected by environmental stress during development .
Scientists found that teeth from African specimens were a different shape or morphology than those from Eurasian samples .
The researchers wrote that teeth toward the front of the mouth from Eurasians had more " morphological robusticity , " such as a triangular , shovel shape .
Their back teeth were smaller and had smoother chewing surfaces ; the rear teeth from African samples were larger and the chewing surfaces on them more pointy and jagged .
" The continuity of the ' Eurasian dental pattern ' from the early Pleistocene until the appearance of upper Pleistocene Neandertals suggests that the evolutionary courses of the Eurasian and the African continents were relatively independent for a long period and that the impact of Asia in the colonization of Europe was stronger than that of Africa , " the researchers wrote in the new report .
" This finding does not necessarily imply that there was no genetic flow between continents , but emphasizes that this interchange could have been both ways . "
Thousands of bomblets have been found across Lebanon
The state department looked into Israel 's use of cluster bombs in civilian areas of southern Lebanon during its conflict with Hezbollah .
US - made weapons are sold to the Israeli military with restriction on their use .
Cluster bombs can scatter hundreds of small bomblets over a wide area , and their use has been widely criticised .
The International Committee of the Red Cross called for a ban on the use of cluster bombs in populated areas , because of the indiscriminate civilian deaths they caused .
And Amnesty International has criticised Israel for its use of cluster bombs in the final days of the conflict .
Military aid
The US government has now sent a preliminary report on its investigation into the matter to the US Congress .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the report delivered to Congress was not a " final judgement " .
Israel takes the concerns raised by the US very seriously
Mark Regev
Israeli spokesman
" This is a preliminary finding and because it also involves the agreements about use ( of munitions ) , which are classified , I can not get into the details , " he added .
Congress will now consider the report before deciding whether to take any further action against Israel .
Israel has consistently maintained it uses cluster bombs in line with international law , although in November the military said it would investigate how the bombs were used during the conflict .
Israel denies breaking any agreement with the US and says it is co-operating with investigators .
" Israel takes the concerns raised by the US very seriously .
In our response , we have been as detailed , as forthcoming and transparent as possible , " said government spokesman Mark Regev .
The US is Israel 's biggest military donor , offering about $ 2bn of aid and assistance each year .
This is the “ goomah ” issue .
Rudy has expressed his belief to at least one prospective groom of my acquaintance that marriage is improved by a goomah ( as rendered in The Sopranos ) — the Italian - American dialect word for a significant other woman .
His grandfather had had a goomah , Rudy said , with some sensitivity and depth of feeling , and his father had one , and what worked worked .
Rudy , arguably , is the most anti-family - values candidate in the race ( this or any other ) .
And yet , in some sense — which could be playing well with the right wing — what he may be doing is going to the deeper meaning of family values , which is about male prerogative , an older , stubborn , my - way - or - the - highway , when - men - were - men , do n’t - tread - on - me kind of thing .
And then there are Rudy ’s people .
Rudy has always been surrounded by concentric and sometimes intersecting circles of reasonable and professional people and greater and lesser inappropriate types .
It is , however , in a way that has limited many local politicians trying to go national , the inappropriate ones that dominate his mind share , staffers who have tended him so long and enabled him so well — “ Rudy does n’t really get along with outsiders ” is how it ’s gently put — that they are , in their fashion , crazy , too .
“ I know , ” says an aide in one of the outside circles , “ how meshugge they are or worse .
Meshugge is a friendly , loving word — some of them are way beyond meshugge . ”
There ’s a game that ’s played by staffers from the more or less reasonable and professional circles , about who might or might not get White House jobs .
The game breaks everybody up .
Rudy ’s closest adviser , Peter Powers , whom handicappers mark as White House chief of staff , is a grade - school friend .
Then there ’s Denny Young , often called the consigliere in the Rudy camp in a partly ironic and partly proud identification with Mafia lore .
( Powers ’s and Young ’s marriages both broke up shortly after Rudy ended his . )
Next in line is Tony Carbonetti , the son of one of Rudy ’s schoolhood chums , who has spent his entire career with Rudy , as aide and operative .
“ He ’ll be Karl Rove , which he is n’t , but that ’s how Rudy will treat him , ” says a longtime Rudy adviser .
Then Sunny Mindel , his famously intemperate spokeswoman : she ’s been relieved of that job in his campaign — she still holds it for the Giuliani business — but is expected to get it back in the White House .
No one in any circle has ever quite been able to explain Sunny — except to say that her hysteria matches Rudy ’s own , that together they do the things that make for rare , and peculiar , political media , which is Rudy ’s sweet spot .
( She ’s credited with getting Rudy to go to war with the Brooklyn Museum of Art. )
The punch line ( this is where everybody breaks up ) to the Giuliani White House organization chart is that the intern will be Cristyne Lategano .
Except that now there is an even better East Wing joke .
Rudy people tend , when they speak of the prospective First Lady , to use an exclamation point : Judi ! ( as they often use the exclamation point for Rudy ! ) .
Other than to hope that her unlikeliness somehow reinforces the idea of Rudy ’s Everyman authenticity , there is no real way that anybody can seem to rationalize Judi , the nurse whom he may or may not have met in a cigar bar ( they did often , as the New York Post says , “ rendezvous ” at Cigars & Bar on West 58th Street in Manhattan ) .
Even among Rudy ’s staunchest people , she ’s seen as the most likely implosion point .
It is not just her hidden first marriage ( “ Rudy and Judi ’s wedding was n’t a small wedding , ” one aide notes .
“ This was , in New York terms , a royal wedding .
There were thousands of stories written about it — and she did n’t think she ought to correct her marital statistics ? ” ) , the dead dogs ( in the late 1970s she worked for a surgical company that demonstrated its medical staplers on live dogs , which were cut open and stapled shut , pretty much killing them ) , her voluble discussion of how much money she ’s spending on her clothes and on the redecoration of their new house ( “ She ’s spending him dry , ” says an aide ) , the open war with his children ( she is said to control access to Rudy ) , and now her hope to join in on Cabinet discussions ( and his apparent hope to have her ) , but , most problematically , the fact that her interest in publicity is as great as his .
“ Definitely she ’d be up there with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton as a First Lady who redefined the job — major redefinition ” is the punch line .
Most mass - market beers — like those made by Anheuser - Busch , Coors , and Miller — have twist - off caps you can open with your hands , but craft brews tend to have pry-offs that require a bottle opener .
Pry - off capping equipment is slightly less expensive than twist - off equipment , which is a factor for some small breweries .
But many craft brewers choose pry-off caps not for the savings but because they believe those caps provide a better seal against oxygen .
“ Oxygen is one of beer ’s greatest enemies ; it causes beer to become stale , ” says Garrett Oliver , brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery , which uses pry-offs .
It ’s difficult to say , however , how much of a safeguard pry-off caps provide .
Steve Harrison , vice president of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company , says that his R&D department has studied the oxygen barriers on twist - off and pry -off caps for 12 years .
In those tests , they found a slight difference , but not enough to have a significant effect on the beer .
( Sierra did , however , recently switch from twist - offs to pry -offs .
The reason was that the brewery began using a new bottle - cap lining material that provides a much better oxygen barrier but is too stiff to work with twist - offs . )
Maybe people just think pry -offs are more legit .
The Brewers Association , a trade organization for craft brewers , estimates that 80 to 85 percent of its members use pry-off caps on their beer bottles .
This reinforces the idea among craft - beer drinkers that only good beers use pry-offs .
Admits Oliver , “ Twist - offs have a cheaper image . ”
In the name of God , the Merciful , the Mercy - giving .
" And among the Believers are men who are true to that which they pledged to God .
Some of them have fulfilled their pledge by death and some of them still are waiting and they have not altered in the least .
That God may reward the true men for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He will , or relent towards them , for God is forgiving , merciful .
And God repulsed the infidels for their wrath .
They gained no good .
God averted their attack from the Believers .
God is strong , mighty . " [ Qur�an 33:23 - 25 ] .
To the American people :
Peace upon those who believe in peace and desire it , and the mercy of God and His blessings .
I address you in this letter from the place of my confinement , as my attempt on the basis of my moral , human , and constitutional responsibility so that no one among you might say that no one came to us with a message of peace after the war began , refuting the arguments for it and desiring peace for you and for our upright , loyal , heroic people .
And as I say this , I do no know whether my brothers and comrades who are leading the Resistance outside the prison have come to you with a letter before or not .
That is because the " democracy " of your leaders has prevented me since my arrest and until now from getting newspapers and magazines or hearing radio and television and has isolated me from the world and has isolated the world from me so that I might not hear or see anything from outside my place of confinement .
Is this the true face of democracy and human rights that they advocate outside America !?
Or have your rulers lied about it ?
This includes the killing of people in prisons and jails , some of them by means of the pistols of the American investigators .
Or has all of this along with other details that would turn an attentive person�s hair white been concealed from you by your officials such that you do not know the truth !?
Anyway , I address you with this letter of mine in the hope that it will reach you and that you will hear it or read it .
And on the basis of my responsibility to bring the facts before people , whatever their color or nationality , for that is our duty to them , just as they have a duty to us not to accept evil .
I address you today as my attorney the eminent lawyer and Professor Ramsey Clark has asked that I write this letter of mine to you .
Professor Ramsey has presented an excellent example of a humanitarian in his person and in his colleague Professor Curtis Dobler , both of whom left a positive personal impression on me .
On this occasion I wish to salute their courage as they have volunteered for the task although they know the dangers that surround them in carrying out their duty , in particular after criminals have killed four of the defense attorneys .
People of America , it still seems to me that the officials in your government are still lying to you and are not giving you true explanations of the reasons that led them to embark on their aggression against Iraq .
In what they have said about the reasons they have deceived , from the starting point , not only the international community , and in particular the European Community but also the peoples of America themselves , knowing beforehand that the facts were contrary to what they were declaring .
Untrue is what they said , after their lies were exposed , about having been deceived by their intelligence agencies and by the stooges that they brought along to serve as their puppets in Iraq , just as old imperialism and the old empires of the 19th and 20th centuries used to do .
What we are saying is based on many facts , the major ones being as follows :
1 . The inspection teams � that came to Iraq in the name of the United Nations and carried out searches even of some private houses as well as government departments , presidential palaces and government documents � those teams knew that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction because most of the leading members in those teams were Americans and British and in addition they had spies and volunteers of other nationalities .
Those teams searched Iraq piece by piece from one end to the other and never found any information contrary to what they and others were told by Iraqi government representatives .
The inspections lasted for more than seven years .
And in addition to the teams that traveled by car and on foot , they used spy planes , helicopters , and satellites in space .
The American and English officials thought that this was their historic chance to strike Iraq and destroy its legitimate aspirations and the lofty cultural and scientific achievements made in the course of 35 years , making use of the information gathered by their spies in the inspection teams and making use of the so - called war on terror after the 11 September incident that struck America .
They shuffled the cards to bring up the goals that they had already decided upon earlier , and these were not the goals that they publicly announced at the starting line .
It was their assessment that the unjust embargo had not destroyed Iraq�s will nor halted its legitimate aspirations to develop economically , culturally , scientifically , and as a civilization in the conditions of a new independence .
They believed that Iraq had come close at that time to breaking the economic embargo as the result of the cooperation of those who cooperated with Iraq on the basis of mutual benefit and fraternal national feelings as far as the Arabs were concerned .
The officials in your country thought that this was their chance to impose their will on the world by means of their control of the Middle East�s oil and its production and marketing in new ways and for new goals � those about which we spoke in and before the year 2003 � in addition to attaining one of their Zionist goals and winning support in the election .
Iran and its lackeys played a dirty role in making aggression appear attractive and in facilitating its implementation .
2 . The American officials did not withdraw from Iraq after they became hard pressed , but declared that the facts were contrary to what they had claimed before the invasion that took place in March and April of the year 2003 .
If they had been truthful when they claimed that they had been deceived as a result of the information they had been given and which they used as the cover for their invasion , and which they declared at the time was sufficient justification for the invasion � declaring at the time that it involved things that they said affected the security of the United States � then they would have withdrawn from Iraq after discovering that that information had been false .
They would have apologized to the heroic Iraqi people , to the American people and to the people of the world for what they had done .
None of the Americans asked their government before the war how Iraq , a country that had still not emerged from backwardness , could threaten the security of a country like America across the Atlantic .
And for that matter why would Iraq want to threaten America , which at that time had not violated the territory of Iraq .
If the American officials wanted to promote the claim that Iraq�s threat was precisely involved in the opposing stances taken by Iraq and America over the Zionist occupation of the land of Palestine and other Arab land , it could be said that Iraq is not the only state that takes an opposing stance to that of America in regards to the issue , whether that be Arab states or other states in the world .
Furthermore , who has authorized America to make the countries of the world tailor their policies to America�s measurements , and if they don�t oblige , then war should be waged against them ?
How can one understand America�s call for democracy if it does not permit a difference of opinion even in issues of a regional character , to say nothing of international ones ?
Another lie was the claim of American officials that Iraq had links to what they called terrorism , although British Prime Minister Blair declared that Iraq does not have any ties to so - called terrorism and had no internationally prohibited weapons , forcing Bush to declare the same thing .
Despite that , none of the important American personalities asked President Bush on what sort of rational analysis or what sort of realistic information this claim rested .
Do you know , esteemed ladies and gentlemen , why they didn�t ask ?
Because some of your prominent personalities are directed in what they do by hidden forces that distorted the image you received of Iraq�s positions .
They had been laying the groundwork for years to facilitate aggression from the start .
Therefore no one asked the American officials , for example , why no Iraqi took part in the events of 11 September !?
And if the participation of individuals in the attack on American targets is n�t to be taken as proof of the involvement of any country in those events , then how do you accuse a state like Iraq , the features of whose political system are known , of so - called relations with terror ?
How can you consider this charge to be one of only two on the basis of which aggression was launched against the people of Iraq , destroying their property and achievements and bringing their lives under daily and direct threat ?
Do you know , esteemed ladies and gentlemen , that I asked one of the American officials who talked with me perhaps two weeks after my arrest , just what was it that you based those false charges on ?
He said that as far as the weapons of mass destruction were concerned , " we didn�t have anything to confirm what you were saying . "
And as for the links to terrorism , he said , because you , Saddam Hussein , did not send a letter of condolence to President Bush after the incident [ of 11 September ] .
I smiled bitterly and told him : as regards your claim that you didn�t have confirmation of our statements , it seems that your officials lie and imagine that officials in countries around the world do not tell the truth , or that many of those who have relations with you in fact do not tell you the truth , neither when they oppose your policies nor when they agree with them .
This is a dangerous matter , not only for the countries of the world but because they then pose a danger for America as well , if nobody in the world will tell America : ' this is a mistake� and ' this is unacceptable � !
And at that time when American planes were striking targets in Iraq and destroying public and private property , killing Iraqi citizens including women and children for no reason and imposing on Iraq their unjust embargo , prohibiting Iraq from importing even pencils for children to use in primary schools , what exactly is it that should obligate Saddam Hussein to send a telegram of condolences to the president of the state whose officials have committed all those crimes , unless it be out of hypocrisy and weakness ?
But because I am neither a hypocrite nor a weakling I didn�t send Bush a telegram of condolence .
But I did agree on the telegram sent containing condolences in the name of the government of Iraq and sent by Comrade Tariq Aziz , the Deputy Prime Minister , to our friend Ramsey Clark and through him to the stricken families .
Are the great states so deluded as to imagine that whoever does not send a letter of condolence deserves that war should be waged against him , his country , and his people !?
Here you see how the American officials used even your own blood to promote their reckless , aggressive policy .
Is this the kind of morality that people should have ?
Or men ?
Or officials ?
There is nothing graver than for disasters to ravage people who have been stricken by delusions , committed wrongs , and wantonly despised the roles of others .
The worst disease of the American officials who involved the Americans in war against Iraq is this .
3 . After I was arrested they made vain attempts to use intimidation and threats against me .
One of their generals conveyed that intimidation and host threats and tried to bargain with me , promising to let me live if I agreed to read in my own voice and sign a prepared announcement that was shown to me .
That stupid announcement called on the people of Iraq and the courageous Resistance to lay down arms .
They said that if I refused , my fate would be that I would be shot just like Mussolini , as my interlocutor put it .
But , as you know me and would expect of me , I disdainfully refused , not even touching that dirty document with my hand and sullying myself with it .
I told them if I were given the chance to address my people , I would call them to more resistance .
Seven days later , to reinforce themselves , they sent a group to talk with me .
They said they were from an American University and that they wanted to engage me in a broad discussion .
I agreed and I confirmed to them that Iraq didn�t have any of the things the American officials claimed and I advised them [ the US ] to leave Iraq quickly and apologize to the people , warning them that they were going to get what they now are facing and what they are now embroiled in � in fact , the fate I expect for them is worse than what they are facing now � and they will never have an adequate chance to pull their arms and equipment out of Iraq if the two halves of Iraq engulf them , and they will engulf them , God willing , because our people are deeply rooted and conscious .
They know that our liberation can be clean and complete only with their unity , and that tolerance must be the basis for the orientations of our people within their ranks , and that wounds must be bound up , not ripped open .
I say , I told them all that at that time but they didn�t change their methods ; they didn�t replace the keys of falsehood , and they are still knocking on the doors of wrong , failing to try the door of legitimacy , even though they now know .
In this connection , attached to this letter are some verses from a long ode ; a selection of 56 verses .
[ Not translated here . ]
4 . It is neither reasonable nor convincing that a country like America to which the doors of the intelligence agencies in the east and most of the countries of the west have been opened did not know the truth and could not know the truth .
Although I am convinced and believe that many countries in the world have an interest in war or wars , she [ the United States ] does not have an interest in war even though she might believe she does .
The contrary , in fact , is the case .
America is a big country on the other side of the Atlantic .
It has developed a unique unparalleled power such that I think some people there imagine that it is on its way to attaining the crown of the world all for itself as a world empire .
Have they not learned a lesson from their war in Viet Nam ?
The west used to promote the idea that world Communism and the Soviet bloc threatened their interests and also the security of the entire west .
But despite that promotion , this was nothing but a flimsy cover .
Nevertheless , America used it and wrapped itself in it until the heroic Vietnamese people expelled them by force .
As to their invasion of Iraq , it came in a situation that made the first step easy from the standpoint of the reaction of the international community because of the international balance of forces .
But it came in a situation that might make it more costly that its war in Viet Nam .
That is because when America was expelled from Viet Nam it did not lose its standing , or we might say it only lost a small part of its standing .
But when it is expelled and routed from Iraq , which has no great power to support it directly , it will lose the fundamental basis of its standing .
In fact it has now already lost the foundation for that standing and its reputation has begun to decay .
It is no longer able to wield the big stick that it formerly threatened to use .
It used to accomplish more by threatening to use force than by really using force .
I will go further and say that after its war in Iraq , that stick no longer frightens many people and America has come to need the silence of the smallest and simplest countries and tries to please them in order to get them to stay quiet about America�s crimes and reckless , deviant policies .
Before , many of the world�s countries used to court the United States and most countries in the world , all except a few , used to fear her threats or parried them with defensive arguments .
But now Mao Zedong of fond memory is laughing in his grave because his prediction has been fulfilled and America is a paper tiger .
This is by the will of the Living Eternal God , and by His agents on earth , the heroic Mujahideen in glorious , virtuous , militant , jihadist Iraq .
So God bless the heroic people of Iraq and God bless the jihad and the mujahideen .
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen of the peoples of America , the time has come to an end in which greatest and best - equipped armies could scatter the organized formations of the opposing army and thereby bring a war to a close .
Now you see our courageous army , our heroic people , and our Mujahideen replacing the system of organized formations with a new kind of warfare .
And when the Americans on the ground become targets in the vicinity of the guns of the revolutionaries , who attack them as deadly human bombs with nothing more than their bodies filled with faith in God , American superiority is worn down over time .
In fact in the near future that superiority will become a burden whose equipment will be difficult to withdraw .
So , will America trust the voice of rationality and logic that calls for the preservation of what still remains , or will Satan the deceiver and the hate - filled supporters of Zionism keep pushing the Americans until the waves swallow them and they sink to the depths of the raging sea ?
Who , after all , appointed the American government to be the world policeman , to form the world in the mold that it likes , giving national orders to the countries of the world ?
Saddam Hussein , ladies and gentlemen , is an honorable patriot and an honest man .
He is a statesman resolute in implementing the law , just , but benevolent .
He loves his people and his nation .
He is straightforward , doesn�t double - cross or deceive .
He speaks the truth even against himself .
Do tyrants like Bush like such characteristics ?
If he were a person like De Gaulle or even like Reagan , perhaps he would understand them , or at least would not abhor them .
But I must say to you that your country will discover more , esteemed ladies and gentlemen .
It has lost his reputation and his standing .
Indeed the American who used to travel around the world respected and safe and welcomed wherever he went , is now no longer able to step outside America without a mine detector .
And the State Department issues warnings for you constantly about what world regions are dangerous to American lives
It was American officials and their polices themselves that have created an atmosphere of anti-American hatred in the world by means of their arrogant behavior , their haughty aggressive attitude , their lack of respect for international law and the security of the world � including the security of my Arab Nation through their support for the Zionist entity in Palestine � and other world and human issues .
Today you are in a bad predicament with the world and nobody can rescue you but yourselves .
If you reform , you will open for the world and for yourselves a new opportunity .
But if you are heedless , that is your decision .
What you need is free and fair competition and peace in order to have security .
The years that followed the 18th century had long gone when they came as invaders to the Middle East to bring back memories of things that awaken and arouse .
The Middle East , and the Arab homeland in particular , was the cradle of prophets and messengers from God .
Is the cradle of the prophets , where the prophets are buried in their tombs , also the home of devils and their mirror images � the malicious invaders ?
We have believed , and our faith was suited to us ,
Then came the Zionists with a devil for a guide .
They stormed in on us as invaders , unjust .
The did not stop their advance nor sit still ,
Their diabolical patron has prepared their dilemma .
But as for us , we have the Merciful God as Patron .
People of America , despite the crimes your government inflicted on our people , our Arab Nation and humanity , the people of Iraq � and I mean by that the Iraqis , not those with split loyalties who prefer to serve foreigners rather than their own people �
I say the free people of Iraq even in their present circumstances are not thinking about their destiny alone but about the destiny of others wherever it�s possible to create a solution that treats a painful problem .
On this basis I said to some Americans when I was in my prison , why don�t you come to an agreement with the Resistance to designate a country with a charter and power to which the Resistance can hand over those American soldiers whom they capture , rather than executing them as currently is said to be taking place .
In fact the extent to which the Resistance is responsible for this is unknown , but people who are equitable know that America has not abided by international law in any of its activities in Iraq , including the Geneva Conventions regarding prisoners and detainees .
The Resistance has no secure place in Iraq where prisoners can be kept .
So whether the Resistance is at all responsible , or whether the responsibility lies with some other parties that have no connection to the Resistance , the justification for it is that there is no secure place for prisoners to be kept .
Therefore in order to fulfill humanitarian needs and to eliminate the justification [ for killing prisoners ]
I make this proposal to you and to the national Resistance and to anyone concerned , and I make this with the best of intentions .
If you accept it and respect the Geneva Conventions then the argument of those who kill rather than detain prisoners will have vanished .
But if your government does not accept it , then it will bear the responsibility for refusing and for whatever befalls our people and the heroic Resistance as a result of your government�s violation of international law .
This will be particularly true if the number of American prisoners increases in the future , and we think that it will increase .
Or is it that your government can�t see anything until it feels it ?
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen , the time has come for your government to look at all people as equals before international law regardless of the size of the countries to which they belong .
Whoever violates international law in his policies and the behavior of his army , he alone must bear the consequences for that policy .
And if his policies are not in accordance with the letter of international law , he has no right to call others to protect his rights in accordance with that law .
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen , whoever missed his or her chance to take action to try to prevent the war still has a chance to act to end it and bring back peace and freedom to Iraq in accordance with the choice of its people without foreign interference by anyone whoever that may be .
People of America , I address you not from weakness nor as a supplicant .
I , my people , my brothers , comrades , and my nation � we address you on the basis of our moral and human responsibility .
I tell you that officials whom you know , and first among them your President , lied to you and deceived you and tricked you using the media that portrayed Iraq to you as incorrigible , and Saddam Hussein as a hateful dictator , and that his people hate him and that his people are just waiting for their chance to get at him .
Some of them just wallowed in lying falsehood to the point that they openly declared that the Iraqis would meet the invading armies with roses and celebration .
I know that lots of people don�t do a lot of analysis ; they don�t have the time or the ability or the desire to do careful assessments when presented with falsified news so as to uncover the truth .
The American peoples had no chance to inquire , for example : why , if the people of Iraq hate Saddam Hussein , how he managed to defeat the Iran of Khomeini after eight years in the aggressive war that Iran sought to impose on us under the slogan of exporting the revolution beginning with Iraq ?
People of America , the victory over Khomeini�s Iran was not due to the short length of the war , but came only after eight years of grinding warfare in which tens of thousands fell and hundreds of thousands on the Iranian side .
Then if Saddam Hussein were a dictator , why did he establish a parliament with elections for the first time in the year 1980 during wartime , when there had been no parliament in Iraq since 1958 ?
If he and his government were dictators , how could he visit schools , universities , towns , and villages and spend the night with the people wherever the sun went down ?
How could he travel around and lead at the battle front at night and during the day even in the trenches in the front lines on the battlefield among the Muslim soldiers !?
Yes , esteemed ladies and gentlemen , your government deceived you , and you , or rather most of you , had no chance to inquire of themselves or of others in order to discover the truth because the Zionists in the lobby who advocated the war together with some of the centers of power were deceiving you and tricking you , hiding from your eyes the real truth , exchanging the facts for falsified and slanted information .
Last but not least in this regard , if Saddam Hussein were a dictator hated and despised by his people , how is it that his people endured him and why was he chosen President by referendum ?
People of America , the misfortunes that have afflicted you and afflicted our Arab Nation and within it our heroic Iraqi people � including the breakdown of America�s standing and reputation � were only caused by the reckless behavior of your government and by pressure from Zionism and power centers that influenced the government to commit those crimes and scandalous actions for specific ends that have nothing to do with the interest of the American peoples .
The massacres and blood that now flows in the streets and countryside of Iraq in torrents � the responsibility for that falls on America before all others .
You know , or rather you have now come to learn , that neither the stooges whom the American forces brought in on board their aircraft or as shamefaced presents aboard their tanks , nor Iran , which pushed and still pushes forward those who support it and whom they support , would be able to cause the bloodshed , or the destruction of the honor , and property of our people and our state had not America undertaken the aggression and invasion and issued the orders .
It is still issuing orders in the Green Zone .
Therefore America bears the burden of all those crimes and outrages .
So , will you put an end to what is going on by using the methods of direct truth without evasion and digression ?
Or will you invite the machine of death to continue to eat away at the flesh of Iraqis and the flesh of Americans without doing anything to resolve this ?
It is your historical responsibility , esteemed ladies and gentlemen .
If you reform , you could save what remains of the standing and reputation of America and its legitimate interests .
If you do nothing , you will be keeping silent over something evil .
" God grant us patient perseverance and let us die as Muslims . "
[ Qur�an , 7:126 ]
People of America , the wars that your government promotes in the world � one of them being the war in Iraq � with input from certain centers of power � which you know better than we � are not in the interests of the American people .
You know better than many how you paid in blood so that you might liberate yourselves from British colonialism and after that how the United States of America was unified and what rivers of blood were shed in order for that to come about .
So , esteemed ladies and gentlemen , how do you accept this interference that abases America before it abases Iraq ?
How can you accept not only the invasion but becoming mired in the internal affairs of Iraq ?
You know that Iraq is a land of prophets , messengers , and righteous figures .
You know that Baghdad is the fourth holiest city in the Arab homeland � after Mecca , al - Madinah , and Jerusalem � in the sight of all of the Islamic world and all of our Arab Nation .
How can one imagine that Iraq could reconcile itself to colonial rule , even if it comes , this time , under another name and with other slogans ?
Save your country , esteemed ladies and gentlemen , and leave Iraq .
Peace .
God is greatest .
God is greatest .

Abstract Crocodilians have a wide distribution , often in remote areas , are cryptic , secretive and are easily disturbed by human presence .
Their capacity for large scale movements is poorly known .
Here , we report the first study of post - release movement patterns in translocated adult crocodiles , and the first application of satellite telemetry to a crocodilian .
Three large male Crocodylus porosus ( 3.1 –4.5 m ) were captured in northern Australia and translocated by helicopter for 56 , 99 and 411 km of coastline , the last across Cape York Peninsula from the west coast to the east coast .
All crocodiles spent time around their release site before returning rapidly and apparently purposefully to their capture locations .
The animal that circumnavigated Cape York Peninsula to return to its capture site , travelled more than 400 km in 20 days , which is the longest homeward travel yet reported for a crocodilian .
Such impressive homing ability is significant because translocation has sometimes been used to manage potentially dangerous C. porosus close to human settlement .
It is clear that large male estuarine crocodiles can exhibit strong site fidelity , have remarkable navigational skills , and may move long distances following a coastline .
These long journeys included impressive daily movements of 10 –30 km , often consecutively .

Introduction Crocodylus porosus is the world 's largest crocodilian and has the widest geographical range of any , occurring from the Solomon Islands to Papua New Guinea and across northern Australia to Indonesia , south - east Asia and the eastern coast of India [ 1 ] .
It is also the most dangerous [ 2 ] .
Managing problem C. porosus by translocation to a remote location is of dubious value because many of them return [ 3 ] , but translocation is still suggested in the public domain as a way to ameliorate the threat posed by large crocodiles in areas close to human habitation .
Data on homing by translocated crocodilians has been gathered mostly by surveillance at the original capture site for the return of tagged individuals [ 3 ] – [ 7 ] .
These studies indicate that crocodilians are likely to show site fidelity .
However , the drawback of mark - translocate - recapture studies is that they provide no information about the tracks taken by returning individuals , or the time profile of the journey .
For this , telemetry is necessary .
There have been several attempts at following translocated crocodilians by radiotelemetry , over short distances and short time frames [ 7 ] .
Rodda ( 1984 ) reported radiotelemetry data from hatchling and juvenile Alligator missippiensis that implied a capacity for navigation because they homed after translocation short distances ( 1 –7 km ) to an unfamiliar area [ 8 ] .
However , studying movement patterns in crocodilians by conventional radiotelemetry has proven difficult because they are mostly very cryptic , live in remote locations , have wide geographic ranges and are easily disturbed by human presence .
Satellite tracking , on the other hand , allows data to be collected essentially continuously from animals in remote locations that are difficult to access , such as along the coastline and in the open ocean , and without the human interference which is hard to avoid during manual tracking .
Satellite telemetry has been very successful for studying movements of various birds , mammals , fish , and marine turtles [ 9 ] – [ 12 ] .
Surprisingly , there have so far been no published studies in which satellite telemetry has been used to study the movements of crocodilians .
In reporting the results of his study of the movement of C. porosus in the Cambridge Gulf , northern Australia , Kay ( 2004 ) referred to the limitations of conventional VHF telemetry and recommended the use of satellite tracking in future studies in order to gather data over larger spatial and temporal scales .
The aims of our study were to record and interpret the movements of translocated large male estuarine crocodiles after their release and to investigate their homing behaviour , if any , using satellite telemetry .
Discussion Satellite tracking proved very effective for studying the movements of these large crocodiles , enabling them to be monitored essentially continuously across a wide geographic range and for several months .
The animals all moved extensively within river systems , undertook substantial coastal voyages , and displayed remarkable navigational abilities .
All of the crocodiles returned to their sites of capture , even Crocodile C which was translocated a long distance and across a major geographic feature .
These observations add to previous data showing the ability and , apparently , an inclination by translocated crocodilians to return ‘ home ’ .
Walsh and Whitehead ( 1993 ) found that 50 % of 48 problem C. porosus translocated distances between 20 and 100 km from Nhulunbuy harbour in the Northern Territory , Australia , returned to their original capture locations .
The fate of the remainder is unknown .
Kay ( 2004 ) reported that a juvenile male C. porosus , translocated 118 km from Port Wyndham to the Ord River , also in northern Australia , returned after 12 days .
On the other hand , hatchling and juvenile C. porosus translocated in the Liverpool River system in northern Australia returned equivocal results [ 5 ] .
Webb et al. ( 1983 ) translocated 17 adult and sub-adult C. johnstoni within the McKinlay River ( northern Australia ) for 39 river km ( 30 km direct ) and a year later recaptured eight of them , all but one at the original capture site even though there was suitable habitat between the capture and release sites .
Homing tendency has also been reported over much shorter distances in Alligator mississipiensis [ 8 ] , [ 17 ] and Caiman crocodilus [ 4 ] .
What is different about the present study is that , for the first time in any adult crocodilian , we can report detail of the track taken and the time profile of the homeward journey .
The results pose interesting questions .
It is noteworthy that all three individuals spent some time at the release point before embarking on an apparently purposeful and direct travel homewards .
Could the animals be making an appreciation of local cues and the direction of travel required ?
Also , all returned to the same place at which they were captured , and none travelled any distance in an inappropriate direction , except for a brief excursion southwards by Crocodile C , the most disrupted individual .
Was this movement associated with an assessment of the correct direction home ?
Our observations clearly imply that crocodilians are skilful at interpreting a suite of complex cues for orientation and navigation , and this aspect of their behaviour demands additional investigation .
This study confirms that the practice of translocating ‘ problem ’ C.porosus to a remote site is very likely to be ineffective .
If a problem crocodile animal is living in an area where conflict with humans is likely , then other options need to be employed .
Of particular interest were the large distances travelled in a comparatively short time .
On their voyages back to their capture sites Crocodile A had an average speed of nearly 7 km day −1 , Crocodile B more than 11 km day −1 and Crocodile C accomplished an average speed of more than 20 km day −1 over a period of 20 days ( Figures 2 , 3 ) .
No comparable journeys have been reported previously for any crocodilian .
The prevailing view is that substantial energy demands in crocodilians are met anaerobically [ 18 ] but in making these journeys , C. porosus revealed a high capacity for sustaining prolonged exercise .
Combined with the lingual salt glands [ 19 ] , this attribute imbues this crocodilian with a great capacity for dispersal over vast distances , easily explaining its extensive geographic distribution from India to the Solomon Islands .

The propaganda that is hitting our airwaves over the Iraq war with creatures like Ari is sickening .
This warmonger brought up WWII and the tired and wrong " we should n't have gone into Germany " routine ( Barbara mentioned this mind set in her C&L post ) in his defense of this .
Ari is so 2007 --- and we 're all just Dirty F*&king Hippies stuck in a 2001 - 2002 mind frame .

Barnicle : Ari , the ad is so powerful .
The visual aspect of the ad is so powerful with that wonderful noble young man with the sight of that plane flying into the Word Trade Center filled with Saudi terrorists , not Iraqi 's could lead several Americans I would suspect to think that Oh ! , Iraq was in on 9/11 .
Do n't you think so ?
Fleischer : Mike you 're stuck in the 2001 - 2002 time table and debate .
It is so far beyond that debate .
That 's like saying we never should have gone into Germany cause after all it's just the Japanese who attacked at Pearl Harbor .
This link to Germany and Japan is despicable , but neocons have no shame .
Iraq was not part of the World Trade Center attacks and Ari knows it , but they need a propaganda link , so --- there you go .
Ari does n't even know the wounded soldier 's name in his own ad .
There is no hole deep enough for these people and not even
Hell should welcome them ...

The Incredible Shrinking New York Times
Like some robber baron capitalist of yore , the New York Times is telling the remaining full price readers of its print product that they will pay more and get less , the same message it has been sending advertisers for years .
But far from a sign of strength , this move is an indicator that the slow motion business collapse of the New York Times Company may be picking up its pace .
Pinch Sulzberger 's Strategies
Faced with rapidly waning print media revenue and internet revenues which are growing , but not even close to offsetting the decline of print , the strategic plan of Pinch Sulzberger is failing .
He had hoped to replace print profits with skyrocketing electronic publishing revenues , but evidently lacked any concrete notion of how to get from here to there , and overpaid for a niche website in a business increasing ruled by ruthless giant players like Microsoft and Google .
Having last year sold off the highly profitable television broadcast properties that were a legacy of the previous generation of company management and the last of the crown jewels , there is no more cushion of ready profits to mitigate the failure of the print business to arrest its death spiral .
The earnings reported last week demonstrated that financially , the company is composed of a large newspaper business decaying faster and faster , slightly offset by a medium - sized , nicely - but - not - spectacularly - growing internet publishing business , and a half interest in a Manhattan skyscraper under construction .
Yesterday , New York Times Company Chief Executive Janet Robinson told investors at a Newspaper Association of America conference in New York that the company would be raising the price of single copy newspapers and home delivery subscriptions .
At the same time , the company has suddenly accelerated and apparently made more drastic a previously - announced plan to shrink the physical size of the paper and cut the amount of news provided to readers .
It is also speeding the closing of a mammoth Edison , NJ printing plant that was one of Pinch Sulzberger 's first strategic moves , opening in 1992 , but which , after the decline of metropolitan circulation during the Pinch years , is now surplus capacity , its presses and skilled workers unnecessary burdens .
Milking the Cash Cow
In the jargon of strategic consulting , this sort of price increase , asset liquidation and quality cut is known as " milking a cash cow " and indicates that a company is " harvesting " a business - realizing that it has no growth prospects , and that its role is to provide cash to invest in other more promising ventures .
How long the business will limp along is anyone 's guess .
People still buy The Farmer 's Almanac today .
This price increase to readers complements the strategy the company has taken toward advertisers in its metropolitan editions : charging them ever - higher rates to reach a declining number of readers .
The two price strategies assume that substantial numbers of readers and advertisers are price - insensitive because they perceive no realistic competitive alternatives .
While there are indeed readers who cannot imagine the breakfast table or rail commute without an inky newspaper to clutch , these habits of a lifetime are not being reproduced in the younger generation , and those who stop reading with age or death are not replaced .
At the same time , thanks to electronic media , alternative sources of news and advertising are proliferating and gaining acceptance .
Color me suspicious , but I doubt very much that the company will halt its steeply discounted / free subscription policies for college students and their instructors .
An unknown percentage of the NYT 's national circulation comes from college students who are required to subscribe to the paper for a course they take .
Their professor ( who establishes the requirement ) usually gets a free subscription .
The " retail value " of that subscription / bribe has just leaped , thanks to the latest price increase .
If such marketing - driven forced circulation programs are expanded , we many never see the true effects of the price increase on full - fare readership , but I will be paying close attention to circulation revenues when I pore over the next financial disclosures filed by the company .
The News Hole
The change in size and decline of the " news hole " , however , will be much more obvious to the public .
Gawker reports :
Yesterday , a Times internal memo went around outlining the paper 's upcoming width shrinkage .
( It 's happening August 6 . ) ....
Of course , the move to narrower pages is happening in August 2007 , not April 2008 .
That move was , in fact , announced last year .
Suddenly , the change has been made imminent .
What 's up ?
Gawker does some reasoning that appears sound :
It also seems as though either the size changes have turned out to be more significant than Keller originally thought , or else he has deliberately downplayed their significance to his staff .
In last year 's memo , he wrote :
The smaller format will affect the newsroom in big ways , but not in dire ways ...
The narrower format will mean some reduction in our news hole , and it will require an extensive redesign .
Since this will not happen for nearly two years , we 'll have plenty of time to adapt .
So , the newsroom did n't have the " nearly two years " to adapt that Keller originally thought .
He also tried to put a brave face on the reduction in the " news hole " of the paper :
If we just cut the page size and did nothing else , we would lose 11 percent of the news hole .
That would be a serious loss .
But the plan is to add more pages to the paper so that the net loss of news space is approximately 5 percent , which I believe we can absorb without significant damage to the report .
We will look for ways to report incremental news developments in digests or other abbreviated forms , and to police flabby or redundant prose in longer pieces .
I 'm convinced that , with good editors and a little time , I could take 5 percent out of any day 's paper and actually make it better .
But are the stories actually going to be even shorter ?
Yesterday 's memo said :
A dress page column now with headline and blurb might be 720 words ; without a jump , the equivalent column will be about 50 - 60 words shorter .
An average 55 word decline in the length of an average 720 word story is over a 7.5 % reduction in length .
Hello , USA Today !
The Advertising Collapse
But I think the true reason for the acceleration of the change is on the advertising end .
Gawker continues :
... note that there 's no mention here of adding pages to the paper , as Keller had promised in last year 's memo .
Last year when the downsizing was announced , I noted that the company would be selling more " full page ads " that would actually be fewer square inches in size , but which would still be priced " full page ads " - a way to raise prices and cut quality for advertisers , as well as readers .
Given that the company apparently wo n't be printing more pages that are smaller size , I can only conclude that the collapse in advertising revenues is so bad that they have concluded there is no chance of selling more advertising pages without drastic price cuts , that , once started , will be hard to arrest .
Advertising , of course , is the dominant business of the Times in terms of revenue .
At the Incredible Shrinking New York Times , everything is shrinking except the arrogance of the publisher and liberal editorial staff .
Unfortunately , that is the one area of the company where less truly would be more .
Graffiti is a reclamation of urban space , an affirmation of humanity and assertion of individuality in the face of bleak , dehumanizing architectures and environments .
But , let 's face it , the whole spraypaint thing is kinda played out .
For every Chernobyl Project or Banksy there 's a million overly derivative tags that do little more than slap a layer of paint over reality .
Why not change the substance of reality itself ?
That 's what guerilla gardening is all about .
From Guerilla Gardening : A Manualfesto ...
The term " guerrilla " may bring to mind a small band of armed soldiers , moving in the dead of night on a stealth mission .
In the case of guerrilla gardening , the soldiers are planters , the weapons are shovels , and the mission is to transform an abandoned lot into a thing of beauty .
Once an environmentalist 's nonviolent direct action for inner-city renewal , this movement is spreading to all types of people in cities around the world .
These modern - day Johnny Appleseeds perform random acts of gardening , often without permission .
Typical targets are vacant lots , railway land , underused public squares , and back alleys .

Urban Ecological Subversion : The Art of Guerilla Gardening in Public Spaces [ Web Urbanist ]
Because We Trust Kyle and Monica More than We Trust the Deputy Attorney General
Marty Lederman
In the May 18 , 2007 edition of Science ( available only to subscribers online ) , Paul Bloom and Deena Skolnick Weisberg consider why so many adults resist science .
They cite a 2005 Pew Trust poll finding that 42 % of people believe that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning of time .
Most people who do accept evolution misunderstand it .
They think that evolution causes animals to have offspring that are “ better adapted to their environments . ”
Silly beliefs are rampant in our society .
People believe in out - of - body experiences , ghosts , astrology , ESP and other things far too numerous to mention ( for an exhaustive review of many of these claims , see Skeptical Inquirer Magazine ) .
The authors reviewed developmental psychology and came to some conclusions as to why certain children grow into science - resistant adults .
First of all , it is important to consider the environments of children even before they are exposed to science .
The authors point out that babies possess “ a rich understanding of both the physical world ( a naïve physics ) and the social world ( a naïve psychology – see here for a bit more on this research ) . ” ( Citing Paul Bloom ’s 2004 book , Descartes ’s Baby ) .
For instance , babies know that objects are solid and that they persist over time .
They know that objects fall to the ground when they are dropped .
They know that people move “ autonomously . ”
Although these intuitions are often useful , they “ sometimes clash with scientific discoveries about the nature of the world , making certain scientific facts it difficult to learn . ”
The authors conclude that it is thus not a problem of what the student “ lacks , but what the student has . ”
The belief that objects fall “ down ” makes it hard to conceive of the world as a sphere .
Another problem is that common sense suggests that everything in the world has a purpose or a design .
This is sometimes referred to as “ promiscuous teleology . ”
This makes it difficult for people to accept the principles of evolution .
Children often believe in dualism , the belief that the mind is separate from the brain .
Although they might believe that brains solve math problems , children have a hard time believing that brains allow them to do such things as “ pretending to be a kangaroo , loving one ’s brother or brushing one ’s teeth . ”
This makes it difficult for them to accept what Francis crick called “ the astonishing hypothesis ” : the fact that mental life can emerge from a physical brain .
As the authors point out , these consequent false beliefs come into play in important debates such as the debate of whether stem cell research kills “ babies . ”
The authors point out that there are significant differences among cultures in resistance to science .
Americans resist evolutionary theory much more than the citizens of many other countries .
Although nobody goes around saying they “ believe in electricity , ” ( electricity is taken for granted as a useful concept ) people do need to go around explicitly elaborating on whether they “ believe in evolution . ”
When we hear claims that are often disputed , most of us are not able to conduct their own experiments to determine the truth of the claim .
Rather , we evaluate the claim ’s source .
If the source is deemed trustworthy , people will believe the claim , often without really understanding it .
Consider , for example , that many Americans who claim to believe in natural selection are unable to accurately describe how natural selection works .
This suggests that their belief is not necessarily rooted in an appreciation of the evidence and arguments .
Rather , this scientifically credulous subpopulation accepts this information because they trust the people who say it is true . . . the same process of deference holds for certain religious , moral and political beliefs as well .
The authors cite studies showing that people will adopt political positions based merely upon whether they understand that that position is supported by their favored political party .
The authors point out that many children rely on the trustworthiness of a source when deciding whether to believe a claim .
Developmental data from children suggest that children will resist science when scientific claims clash with the early emerging intuitive expectations :
This resistance will persist through adulthood if the scientific claims are contested within a society , and it will be especially strong if there is a nonscientific alternative that is rooted in common sense and championed by people who are thought of as reliable and trustworthy .
This is the current situation in the United States , with regard to the central tenets of neuroscience and evolutionary biology . . . hence , these fields are among the domains where Americans resistance to science is the strongest .
This article suggests the importance of having science literate people in positions of visibility and power .
In my mind , this article points out an often unappreciated way in which the presidency of George W. Bush has devastated the cause of free and vigorous scientific inquiry in the United States .
The article also suggests the importance of cultivating a guilt free sense of critical thinking among children .
It was n’t till 1987 that I experienced my first ( and worst ) case of technolust ever .
The object that inspired such raw feelings of lust , of course , was the Commodore Amiga .
As a lowly Commodore 128 owner , which was really just a glorified Commodore 64 in a beige case , I bought every issue of the Commodore magazines of the day .
These magazines started showing off these lush advertisements of the Commodore Amiga , boasting of its 4096 colors and 4 - channel stereo sound .
I had to have it .
Looking back , I am shocked at how much my lust for the Amiga held sway over me .
I purchased a copy of every Amiga magazine on the newstand , talked about it incessantly to anyone who would listen , and had vivid dreams of the Amiga ’s amazing graphics capabilities .
And when I finally got my hands on it , it was every bit as good as I had hoped .
For many Amiga users at the time , the Amiga was true to its name ( spanish for female friend ) in that it was the closest thing to a girlfriend we had .
Give me a break , I was only twelve at the time .
Like having a girlfriend , I spent countless hours with the computer , not to mention countless dollars on peripherals and upgrades .
I remember hustling for tips at the local commissary in order to upgrade the beast from 512 K to 1MB of ram ( cost : $ 99 ) .
The reason I bring this up is I came across a recent article on the Wired website entitled Top 10 Most Influential Amiga Games , which filled me with a rush of nostalgia .
I only had the pleasure to play two of the games listed , Defender of the Crown , in which catapulting castles was pure fun , and SpeedBall 2 , which probably was responsible for the pile of broken joysticks I accumulated .
Personally though , I thought Lords of the Rising Sun ( also made by Cinemaware ) was even better than Defender of the Crown .
The game sequence in which you could snipe advancing siegers using a first - person bow and arrow with a little red laser point dot was exhilarating ( sadly , I could not find a screenshot ) .
I also liked Speedball 1 ( shown here ) slightly better than 2 because the side scrolling in 2 always threw me off .
I still have my Amiga 500 gathering dust in a storage cabinet in the garage .
I ’ve been meaning to unpack it and see if it still works , but my home is small and there ’s really no room to set it up .
I figure there must be a better way to try out my old games .
Amiga Emulation !
Digging around , I discovered there ’s an active project to create an Amiga emulator for * nix called UAE .
There ’s a Windows port called , not surprisingly , WinUAE ( click for full size ) .
Unfortunately , these projects cannot distribute the Amiga ROM nor its operating system due to copyright issues .
However they do provide instructions on how to transfer the ROM and operating system over to your PC on their FAQ .
Amiga Forever
An even easier approach is to simply purchase Amiga Forever for around forty bucks .
This is an ISO image that contains a preconfigured WinUAE with the original ROM and operating system files .
Amiga Forever is sold by Cloanto who currently own certain intellectual property rights to the Amiga .
Amiga Forever comes with several games for the Amiga as well that vary with the edition purchased .
The site also has a games section in which they list places to download more games .
For example , the Cinemaware site has disk images for pretty much all of their games available for free , including Lords of the Rising Sun .
Play Defender of the Crown Immediately
All this talk of Amiga emulation sounds like fun and everything , but seriously , do I need yet another time sink ?
If you ’re jonesing for some Amiga gaming now and do n’t want to be bothered with emulation , head over to the Cinemaware website and satiate your Amiga gaming kick by playing the Flash version of Defender of the Crown .
Now about that time sink …
Though I owned a couple computers prior to the Amiga , the Amiga is truly the computer that fueled my fire for computing .
As I ’ve mentioned before ( click here for his “ Duke and Pawn ” game , or click here for a more game - theoretical type of game ) , my son Adam enjoys designing games .
Here ’s a game he designed , with very simple rules but complex play , on the theme of Rock - Paper - Scissors .
1 . The two players are White and Black , and they each have three pieces , a Rock , a Paper , and a Scissors , that they set up on a 6 by 6 board as shown below .
2 . White moves first , and then the players alternate .
3 . Normally , a player moves a single one of his pieces one square orthogonally ( up or down or right or left ) on each move .
You may not place a second piece on the same square except to capture .
( So for example , on the first move , White ’s legal moves are to move his Paper up or to the left , or his Scissors up or to the left . )
4. Rocks can capture Scissors , Scissors can capture Papers , and Papers can capture Rocks ( of the opposite color in each case ) but no other captures are possible .
A piece can be moved a second time on the same move if and only if it enables it to make a capture that move ( e.g. if a Paper is diagonally below and to the right from an opposing Rock , it could move up and then move left in order to capture the Rock . )
5 . The object of the game is to move one of your pieces to the square where the opposing Rock is placed at the beginning of the game .
If you do so , you instantly win the game .
6 . You may never repeat a position .
7 . You must move each turn .
If you have no moves , you lose .
The game has no draws .
One important and non-obvious point of strategy : if you exchange your Rock for your opponent ’s Scissors , you will have an important material advantage , because your Paper can safely rampage without worrying about any of his pieces , while his Rock still has to worry about your Paper , and his Paper still has to worry about your Scissors .
It might appear that the first player has a significant advantage , but our games have n’t worked out that way at all .
By the way , we use Chess pieces for the pieces ; rooks for rocks , pawns for papers , and bishops for scissors .
I like the irony that ordinary Rock - Paper - Scissors is a game of complete chance and Adam ’s version has no chance .
Have fun !
( EDIT : This game now has a name ; it ’s called “ Cyclotron . ” )

" Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one 's values . "
-- John Galt
ATLANTA —
The chimpanzees , after spotting the humans at the corner of their compound , came over to us with their arms outstretched and their palms turned upward .
This was the chimps ’ way of asking for a banana — and a lot more , as researchers here at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center have discovered .
That simple gesture , the upturned palm , is one of the oldest and most widely understood signals in the world .
It ’s activated by neural circuits inherited from ancient reptiles that abased themselves before larger animals .
Chimps and other apes , notably humans , adapted it to ask not just for food , but also for more abstract forms of help , creating a new kind of signal that some researchers believe was the origin of human language .
If that ’s true , if human eloquence can be traced from a primal message signifying “ Gimme , ” I ’m not sure what conclusion to draw about our species .
Maybe that we are inherently social creatures who survived and prevailed against mightier animals by learning to enlist the cooperation of others .
Or maybe just that , in our heart of hearts , we are all slackers .
The meaning of the gesture is clear whether it ’s with one upturned palm , the “ Brother , can you spare a dime ” stance of beggars around the world , or with the two - palm version favored by preachers who reach out to beseech divine assistance .
Or by exasperated Hollywood directors who rise from their chairs with upturned palms to implore their actors , “ Work with me , people ! ”
Senator Schumer , for his part , seemed today to take on the role of mediator between Mr. Leahy and the White House .
On Sunday , Mr. Schumer — who first floated Mr. Mukasey ’s name with the White House as a potential Supreme Court nominee four years ago — praised Mr. Mukasey as a potential “ consensus nominee . ”
Today , he said he had told Mr. Fielding that the White House would have to resolve Mr. Leahy ’s concerns .
“ Chairman Leahy ’s concern is genuine , ” Mr. Schumer said in an interview .
“ He strongly defends the prerogatives of the committee .
I stressed that to both Fielding and Mukasey .
It would be much better for everyone concerned if they could reach an agreement . ”
The White House is trying to cast the Mukasey confirmation as urgent and is calling on the Senate to put him in place at the Justice Department before lawmakers leave for their next recess on Oct .
8 . In private , top aides to Mr. Bush are calculating that Democrats will not want a messy confirmation fight .
And most Democrats reacted with caution today .
Several , like Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin , said Mr. Mukasey would have to prove that he is independent of Mr. Bush and can repair the damage they say was done to the department by Mr. Gonzales , who many Democrats regarded as a crony of the president .
Image Michael B. Mukasey , a United States District Court judge , swore Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani into office in January 1994 .

Others , like Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware , sounded surprised by what they regarded as an unusual White House overture .
Mr. Biden said he was “ pleased that President Bush put aside his old habits and picked an outside professional to nominate as attorney general , rather than a member of his own circle . ”
With just 16 months left in his administration , Mr. Bush can ill - afford a nasty confirmation fight , and the White House had been extremely concerned about finding a consensus nominee — so much so that it found itself trying to fend off criticism not only from the left , but also the right .
The Camera Lens Buying Guide
A big advantage of using a SLR ( Single Lens Reflex ) or DSLR ( Digital Single Lens Reflex ) camera is the ability to swap lenses to suit the job at hand .
If you need to take shots of your buddies at a football game , you can use a telephoto lens to capture their finest moments from afar .
And when you see a beautiful flower on the way back to your car , just replace the telephoto lens with a macro lens and you are set !
The flexibility of SLR and DSLR cameras can not be denied .
You can literally swap dozens of different lenses either from your camera 's manufacturer or third - party manufacturers like Tamron and Sigma .
Even if the lens is an old hand - me - down , it will work as long as the lens is compatible with your camera 's mount .
However , one problem of such flexibility is the high cost .
Lenses are not cheap and that 's a fact .
Good lenses can cost anywhere from a thousand dollars to a few thousand dollars .
Budding photographers will discover that the cost of the SLR or DSLR body is nothing compared to the cost of buying lenses for the camera .
Even cheap telephoto and wide - angle lenses can cost hundreds of dollars each .
So , is SLR or DSLR photography out of reach of all but the rich and professional photographers ?
Not exactly .
Canon and Nikon made DSLR photography affordable with their ground - breaking EOS 300D and D70 DSLR cameras .
Both cameras ( and their successors ) were sold with kit lens at less than a thousand dollars , with street prices even lower than that !
But what about lenses ?
Well , the good and bad news is both Canon and Nikon are now making cheaper lenses available .
This is good news because you can now buy these lens at a lower price .
The bad news is these cheaper lenses generally have a poorer build .
The use of polycarbonate and plastic optics , instead of metal and glass , make these lenses lighter and cheaper .
They are less rugged as a result and may produce softer pictures with less contrast .
While these cheap lenses are good for amateur photographers to play with , eventually you will probably want to move up to the professional - grade lenses .
Unfortunately , these lenses continue to command a significant price premium .
So , what can you do if you want professional - grade lenses at bargain prices ?
Nothing much , if you want them brand - new .
But if you do not mind used lenses , why ... you can get your hands on professional - grade lenses for about the same price consumer - grade lenses !
In this guide , we are going to take a look at the pros and cons of buying second - hand lenses and what you should look for when you buy second - hand lenses .
As these lenses are often no longer covered by the manufacturer 's warranty , it is very important for you to inspect them properly before parting with your money .
We hope this guide will help you make informed choices about second - hand lenses and allow you to have an enjoyable experience with them .
Pros
The primary advantage of buying second - hand lens is of course , LOWER COST !
You can save a lot when you buy second - hand lens .
Depending on the condition of the lens , you can actually buy it for less than half the price of a new one .
It also gives you the ability to try out lenses that you might never be able to afford new .
For example , you may not be able to afford a new Nikon AF 35 - 70 mm f/2.8D lens that will set you back about US $ 560 .
But if you keep an eye out , you can actually get it second - hand for less than US $ 250 .
That 's a saving of over US$ 300 !
Buying used lenses also has the advantage of reducing your loss when you decide to sell them .
You will lose less money selling off used lenses than you would new lenses .
This allows you to be a little more daring in experimenting with unknown lenses that you might otherwise not consider at all for monetary reasons .
Finally , sellers often throw in freebies like a filter or a hood or free shipping .
This adds value to the purchase and saves you not only money , but also the expense and hassle of getting your own filter or hood .
Cons
Of course , for there to be a silver lining , there must be a cloud as well !
Buying used lenses can be a rather risky endeavour .
When you buy a brand - new lens , you can be assured that it will be in perfect condition .
However , when it comes to used lenses , the mileage varies .
If you are lucky , you may find a well - maintained lens that works just like a new lens .
On the other hand , you could end up with a lens that has a sticky diaphragm or loose elements or worse , is infected with fungus !
There is also the issue of warranty .
Most used lenses are no longer covered by the manufacturer 's warranty , unless they are relatively new or come with long warranty periods like the 6 - year warranties offered by Sigma .
This is no small matter as repair work done out of warranty often cost a lot of money .
For example , a focusing problem on the Nikon AF - S 80 - 200 mm f/2.8
D required the replacement of the front ring element which cost me almost US $ 400 .
So , if your used lens is faulty , you will most likely have to pay a hefty price for its repair , unless it is still under warranty .
You should also be aware that certain warranties cover only a specific country or region .
If you buy used lenses from overseas , be aware that doing so may deprive you of coverage under that warranty .
In addition , buying used lenses from online auctions opens you up to the risk of fraud .
You will have to be really cautious about buying used lenses from people with limited or poor reputation .
Of course , using an escrow service helps prevent that but please note that escrow services are not cheap .
So , buying cheap , used lenses online will be a bit of a gamble even if you cover yourself using protection schemes from eBay , PayPal or your credit card company .
Tackling The Issues
This guide aims to be a comprehensive guide on how to buy used lenses at bargain prices .
To do this , we will have to work out different ways to counter the issues associated with buying such lenses .
If we take the necessary precautions , buying used lenses can actually be a low - risk and enjoyable experience .
This guide is here to help you with that .
Let 's start at looking at how to examine used lenses .
When you are looking to buy a used lens , you should first learn how to look for the various problems that may be a problem with such lenses .
Some may be minor points , others may be serious issues .
Let 's take a look .
Missing Parts
First thing you should do is check for missing parts of the package .
A full lens kit usually comes with the following items ( other than the actual lens ) :
Front lens cap
Rear lens cap
Hood
Manual / documentation
Warranty card
Box
Purchase receipt
In certain cases , the package will even include a hard or soft case .
Heavy telephoto lenses will also come with a tripod collar .
So , check and make sure everything is there .
While you can do without cases , you may not want to deal with a heavy telephoto lens that does not come with a tripod collar .
A replacement tripod collar is neither cheap nor easy to find .
The most common items to get lost are the manual / documentation , purchase receipt , warranty card as well as the box .
The loss of these items are not a real problem , except when it comes to selling off the lens .
They do somehow improve the lens ' value , at least in the resale market .
This is partly because the loss of such items may suggest that the lens ( especially if it 's relatively new ) was stolen .
The warranty card is important if the lens is still under warranty .
Without it , you will find it hard , if not impossible , to claim warranty if the lens develops problems after you purchase it .
If the warranty card is not produced at the time of purchase , you should consider the lens as out of warranty and bargain down the price .
The purchase receipt or any other proof of purchase is also important as it will help with warranty claims , particularly for parallel - imported ( gray market ) lens .
The receipt will also prove the age of the lens .
There have been many occasions where a seller has misrepresented the age of the lens , especially if the lens is still new .
By declaring that it is still covered by the manufacturer 's warranty , the seller can ask for a better price than he could have if the warranty actually lapsed .
The lens caps as well as the hood are also common items to go missing .
A missing front lens cap will be a problem since it protects the front lens element .
Replacing it will not be cheap as original front lens caps can set you back anywhere from US $ 10 to over US $ 100 , depending on the size and model .
You can buy generic lens caps but generally , they do not look quite as nice , or work as well as the original lens caps .
Nikon 67 mm front lens cap ( front ) Nikon 67 mm front lens cap ( rear ) Nikon rear lens cap
The rear lens cap is actually less of a problem than a front lens cap .
Yes , it is important to protect the rear lens element from scratches .
But because you will always have one lens attached to the body , you can use its lens cap as a replacement since all lenses ( for the same mount ) use the same lens caps .
It will only become a problem if you want to sell the lens and need to protect the rear element during delivery .
Including an original rear lens cap with the lens also improves its market value .
Compared to the front lens cap , rear lens caps are a lot cheaper .
You should have no problem finding one for about US$8 .
Depending on the lens , a missing hood may or may not be a problem .
For lenses that are prone to solar flares , the hood will be a necessity and you will need to buy one to replace the missing hood .
Otherwise , you can actually make do without one - by using your hand !
Just like the front lens cap , replacing the hood will not be cheap .
Original hoods can cost anywhere from just US $ 5 to over US$ 500 !
Generic hoods will , of course , cost much less .
But they wo n't look as nice , although they should work just as well .
This is why it 's better to buy lenses with their original hoods , even if you do n't need them .
You can do without them , but having them will definitely improve your lens ' resale value in the future .

Master archivist Rick Prelinger sez , " As has been rumored , the NY Times will shortly stop charging for its " Times Select " columns , which had been locked behind a pay firewall .
" But the Times has also upheld the principle of public access to the public domain , and is opening its archives from 1851 - 1922 , all of which are in the public domain .
Archives 1987 - present , though copyrighted , will also be freely accessible .
" This is a surprising and welcome development , and it 's smart — there 's nothing like free content to draw eyeballs by the millions .
" Take the time to look at a late 19th - early 20th century issue of the paper — every day is filled with dozens of little stories , each a potential plot for a movie , novel , or game . "
What changed , The Times said , was that many more readers started coming to the site from search engines and links on other sites instead of coming directly to NYTimes.com .
These indirect readers , unable to get access to articles behind the pay wall and less likely to pay subscription fees than the more loyal direct users , were seen as opportunities for more page views and increased advertising revenue .
" What was n't anticipated was the explosion in how much of our traffic would be generated by Google , by Yahoo and some others , " Ms. Schiller said .
The Times 's site has about 13 million unique visitors each month , according to Nielsen / NetRatings , far more than any other newspaper site .
Ms. Schiller would not say how much increased Web traffic the paper expects by eliminating the charges , or how much additional ad revenue the move was expected to generate .

( Thanks , Rick ! )
Google executives would not comment on the prototype , other than to say the company plans to experiment and see what people want .
“ We ’ll make mistakes and it will be a long - range march , ” said Adam Bosworth , a vice president of engineering and leader of the health team .
“ But it ’s also true that some of what we ’re doing is expensive , and for Google it ’s not . ”
At Microsoft , the long - term goal is similarly ambitious .
“ It will take grand scale to solve these problems like the data storage , software and networking needed to handle vast amounts of personal health and medical information , ” said Steve Shihadeh , general manager of Microsoft ’s health solutions group .
“ So there are not many companies that can do this . ”
This year , Microsoft bought a start - up , Medstory , whose search software is tailored for health information , and last year bought a company that makes software for retrieving and displaying patient information in hospitals .
Microsoft software is already used in hospitals , clinical laboratories and doctors ’ offices , and , Mr. Shihadeh noted , the three most popular health record systems in doctors ’ offices are built with Microsoft software and programming tools .
Microsoft will not disclose its product plans , but according to people working with the company the consumer effort will include online offerings as well as software to find , retrieve and store personal health information on personal computers , cellphones and other kinds of digital devices — perhaps even a wristwatch with wireless Internet links some day .
Mr. Shihadeh declined to discuss specifics , but said , “ We ’re building a broad consumer health platform , and we view this challenge as far bigger than a personal health record , which is just scratching the surface . ”
Yet personal health records promise to be a thorny challenge for practical and privacy reasons .
To be most useful , a consumer - controlled record would include medical and treatment records from doctors , hospitals , insurers and laboratories .
Under federal law , people can request and receive their personal health data within 90 days .
But the process is complicated , and the replies typically come on paper , as photocopies or faxes .
The efficient way would be for that data to be sent over the Internet into a person ’s digital health record .
But that would require partnerships and trust between health care providers and insurers and the digital record - keepers .
Nerikes Allehanda newspaper defended publishing the cartoon
The $ 100,000 ( £ 49,310 ) reward would be raised by 50 % if Lars Vilks was " slaughtered like a lamb " said the audio message aired on the internet .
The speaker , said to be Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , threatened a new offensive during the holy month of Ramadan .
Last month 's cartoon showed Prophet Muhammad 's head on a dog 's body .
Several Muslim countries protested .
It is fundamental for Western thinking to be able to express one 's artistry without making exceptions for holiness
Lars Vilks
Swedish cartoonist
Last year there were riots over Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad , first published in September 2005 by the newspaper Jyllands - Posten .
Muslims regard any visual representation of the Prophet as blasphemous .
Many Muslims also regard the dog as an impure animal .
In other developments :
at least 10 people were killed and 15 injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up near a market in the district of Amil in Baghdad
Iraq 's defence ministry said it shared a common vision with the US over when Iraqi forces may take over security responsibilities from US troops
Economic targets
The latest cartoon was published by the Nerikes Allehanda newspaper on 18 August .
Last week , Sweden 's Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt met ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries in an effort to defuse the row .
But Saturday 's taped message said the militants were announcing a " call to shed the blood of the Lars who dared to insult our Prophet " .
Last month some 200 Muslim protesters demanded an apology
" During this generous month we announce an award worth $ 100,000 to the person who kills this infidel criminal , " the speaker said .
He also announced a $ 50,000 reward for the killing of the editor of the newspaper .
And he said the Swedish government ought to apologise - otherwise al - Qaeda in Iraq would target " their economy and giant companies such as Ericsson , Volvo , Ikea , Scania " .
The cartoon 's creator , Lars Vilks , told Reuters news agency he was not worried by a threat from people representing " a very small branch of our Muslims " .
But he could not disregard it , either , and was in contact with the police .
" It is fundamental for Western thinking to be able to express one 's artistry without making exceptions for holiness , " he said .
Factional threats
The speaker in the 30 - minute tape also said he was " honoured to announce at the beginning of Ramadan an offensive in the name of ... the martyr of the Islamic nation Abu Musab al - Zarqawi " who was killed in a US air strike last year .
And days after saying they had killed a well - known Sunni cleric opposed to them , the speaker accused the main Sunni party , the Islamic Party in Iraq of co-operating with US - led forces .
Abdul Sattar Abu Risha was one of al - Qaeda 's top targets
He also vowed to keep targeting members of the minority Yazidi community over their leaders ' refusal to allow Yazidis to convert to Islam .
Meanwhile , in northern Iraq , a Sunni Arab tribal leader told the BBC that local groups had created a new alliance to fight al - Qaeda .
Fawwaz al - Jarba , who heads the Shammar tribe in the Mosul area , said local Sunni Arab tribes had joined Kurdish , Christian and Yazidi groups in a new front .
He said the new alliance would not work directly with the United States military , but only through the Iraqi government .
In July , the US announced that a top al - Qaeda militant arrested in Iraq had told interrogators that Iraq 's supposed al - Qaeda kingpin , Omar al - Baghdadi , was only a front .
MUNICH , Germany ( Reuters ) - Russian President Vladimir Putin , in one of his harshest attacks on the United States in seven years in power , accused Washington on Saturday of attempting to force its will on the world .

The White House said it was “ surprised and disappointed ” by Putin ’s accusations but added Washington expected to continue to work with Moscow in areas such as counter - terrorism and reducing the spread and threat of weapons of mass destruction .
In a speech in Germany , which one U.S. senator said smacked of Cold War rhetoric , Putin accused the United States of making the world a more dangerous place by pursuing policies aimed at making it “ one single master ” .
Attacking the concept of a “ unipolar ” world in which the United States was the sole superpower , he said : “ What is a unipolar world ?
No matter how we beautify this term it means one single center of power , one single center of force and one single master . ”
“ It has nothing in common with democracy because that is the opinion of the majority taking into account the minority opinion , ” he told the gathering of top security and defense officials .
“ People are always teaching us democracy but the people who teach us democracy do n’t want to learn it themselves . ”
Gordon Johndroe , press secretary for the White House National Security Council , rejected Putin ’s comments .
“ We are surprised and disappointed with President Putin ’s comments .
His accusations are wrong , ” Johndroe said .
“ We expect to continue cooperation with Russia in areas important to the international community such as counter - terrorism and reducing the spread and threat of weapons of mass destruction , ” he added .
INCREASING TENSIONS
The Kremlin has for several weeks been dropping hints that Putin , who steps down next year after two terms in power , was preparing a major foreign policy speech that would point the way for his successor .
Its delivery at the prestigious annual Munich meeting on security was clearly aimed at attracting maximum attention .
“ The message I got from his speech was that Putin wants Russia to have the same position in the world as the former Soviet Union , ” a senior European official told Reuters .
Putin spoke against a background of increasing Russian agitation over U.S. policy on Iraq , and on the Iran and North Korea nuclear issues , as well as growing self - confidence as an emerging energy superpower .
U.S. plans to deploy parts of an anti-missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic have become a fresh irritant in U.S. - Russian relations .
Washington says the system is needed for defense against rockets launched by Iran and North Korea -- an argument rejected by Moscow .
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , who has been extremely critical of the U.S. anti-missile system , will address the conference on Sunday .
Putin said the United States had repeatedly overstepped its national borders in questions of international security , a policy that he said had made the world less , not more , safe .
“ Unilateral actions have not resolved conflicts but have made them worse , ” Putin said , adding that force should only be used when backed by the UN Security Council .
“ This is very dangerous .
Nobody feels secure any more because nobody can hide behind international law , ” he said .
“ ARMS RACE ”
Putin also said the increased use of force was “ causing an arms race with the desire of countries to get nuclear weapons ” .
He did not name the countries .
Putin mentioned no specific conflicts .
But he has been very critical of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , where U.S. soldiers are still struggling to crush an insurgency .
New Defense Secretary Robert Gates , the top American official at the conference , said Putin ’s comments were “ interesting , very forthright ” .
U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman said the speech was provocative and marked by “ rhetoric that sounded more like the Cold War ” .
NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said he was disappointed by Putin ’s statement that alliance enlargement was “ a serious factor provoking reduced mutual trust ” .
“ I see a disconnection between NATO ’s partnership with Russia as it has developed and Putin ’s speech , ” he said .
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov , however , denied the Russian president was trying to provoke Washington .
“ This is not about confrontation .
It ’s an invitation to think , ” he told reporters .
In the midst of an ongoing policy debate over how much power the Bush administration should have to obtain surveillance powers , the White House has demonstrated once again that it simply ca n’t be trusted to handle national security information responsibly .
A small private intelligence company that monitors Islamic terrorist groups obtained a new Osama bin Laden video ahead of its official release last month , and around 10 a.m. on Sept. 7 , it notified the Bush administration of its secret acquisition .
It gave two senior officials access on the condition that the officials not reveal they had it until the al - Qaeda release .
Within 20 minutes , a range of intelligence agencies had begun downloading it from the company ’s Web site .
By midafternoon that day , the video and a transcript of its audio track had been leaked from within the Bush administration to cable television news and broadcast worldwide .
The founder of the company , the SITE Intelligence Group , says this premature disclosure tipped al - Qaeda to a security breach and destroyed a years - long surveillance operation that the company has used to intercept and pass along secret messages , videos and advance warnings of suicide bombings from the terrorist group ’s communications network .
In this case , SITE obtained the most recent Osama bin Laden video several days before it went public .
Though the company is a for - profit enterprise , SITE contacted White House counsel Fred Fielding and Michael Leiter , who holds the No. 2 job at the National Counterterrorism Center , with a link to a private SITE page containing the video and an English transcript .
“ Please understand the necessity for secrecy , ” SITE ’s founder Rita Katz wrote in her email .
“ We ask you not to distribute . . . [ as ] it could harm our investigations . ”
That was at 10 am on Sept.
7 . Within a few hours , it was on several television news outlets .
Katz told the WaPo , “ Techniques that took years to develop are now ineffective and worthless . ”
Remind me , who thinks the White House is trustworthy on national security issues ?

Flooded with offliners and emails to vote for the Taj Mahal as one of the New 7 wonders , I finally decided to check the n7w out .
Here are some interesting points to ponder …
Why would an organization like New Seven Wonders of the World have affiliate sales on their website ?
Any blogger who has done affiliate sales would know the % of commission earned per sale .
Imagine the commission for a Tour package half way around the globe .
Also , there is a Merchandise Section where we can buy overpriced Tees , Pins etc [ well they are LIMITED EDITION and OFFICIAL / :) ]
Now , here is what Wikipedia says about n7w ( I bet they made this page themselves )
“ The New Seven Wonders of the World is a proposed revision of the Seven Wonders of the World , organized by a Swiss - based , for - profit corporation called New Open World Corporation ( NOWC ) .
The selection is being made by free and paid votes , through telephone or online .
The first vote is free to registered members and additional votes may be purchased through a payment to NOWC .
In addition to the sale of votes , NOWC relies on private donations , the sale of merchandise such as shirts and cups , and revenue from selling broadcasting rights . ”
That ’s right !
You can BUY votes ..
Who cares of the monuments in developing countries ?
Just buy votes for your favorite monument !
( and make us richer )
Oh for crying out loud !
I mean , seriously ..
Is this how we ought to select the New Seven Wonders of the world ?
So , what is this whole thing anyway ?
The ‘ History ‘ section says “ Swiss businessman Bernard Weber launched the project in September 1999 .
By November 24 , 2005 , 177 monuments were up for consideration . ”
If you ask me , this man is great at his game ..
He did a world tour , made a huge hype , got media attention and now , The New 7 Wonders is one of the most talked about subject on the blogosphere .
He succeeded in making his little trip so famous that The New 7 Wonders of the World will be announced during the Official Declaration ceremony in Lisbon , Portugal on Saturday , July 7 , 2007 – 07.07.07 .
The international show , which will include award - presentation appearances by Hilary Swank , Ben Kingsley , Bipasha Basu , Cristiano Ronaldo , Neil Armstrong and Bertrand Piccard , and also will feature performances by Chaka Khan , Jennifer Lopez , Jose Carreras , Alessandro Safina , Joaquín Cortés , and Dulce Pontes , among others .
And there we have it ..
The Seven wonders of the WORLD is to be decided by him . [ I say ‘ him ’ since I have a feeling the voting isnt fair .
Come on !
I ’ve been getting messages to vote for the Taj for over a month now .
I dont think any Indian would just ignore that !
And inspite of all that AND considering the population of India , Taj isnt in the top seven !
Ironic , isnt it ? ]
Finally , lets say that The Statue of Liberty and the Taj Mahal did not make it to the n7w .
Does it change anything ?
How long would the ‘ new ’ 7 wonders stay as the Seven wonders of the world ?
Maybe till another news takes up frontpage ..
Does this mean Textbooks would be rewritten with the n7w instead of the Seven wonders of the world and would our children be studying the names of the n7w in place of the Seven wonders ?

A breast - screening smart bra developed by the Centre for Materials Research & Innovation ( University of Bolton , UK ) allows users to detect breast cancer at the earliest possible stage , making a cure much more likely .
The smart bra uses a microwave antennae device built into the structure of the bra .
Data about each breast is collected by embedded microchips which generate computer - generated images .
Professor Elias Siores , director of CRMI , said : " The breast screening smart bra is an invention that allows users to detect breast cancer at a curable stage .
It is a low - risk , non-invasive , simple - to - use and cost - effective device that can provide easily - interpreted data . "
The smart bra is merely the latest development in health - enhancing electronic clothing .
The MEMSwear fall - detecting smart shirt uses built - in motion - detection hardware to detect if the user has fallen ( and ca n't get up ) .
Philips Research in Germany has developed underwear that monitors your heart ; sensors are woven into the fabric to detect heart rate .
The electronic underwear from Philips Research takes monitoring a step further .
Not only can the prototype gather information about your health , it can even dial 911 if it detects a problem .
Hopefully , future iterations of the smart bra would be able to make an appointment with your oncologist .
Science fiction fans may recall the fictional heartshirt from Rudy Rucker 's 1988 novel " Wetware ; " it could monitor its wearer 's heart rate .
This device would also be much cheaper than providing every woman with a remote - controlled robotic hand that would perform a breast exam .

While it 's always bittersweet to report on the latest advancements in autonomous military killbots , the one upside to Foster - Miller 's most recent heavily - armed robotic platform is that it possesses enhanced safeguards to minimize incidences of friendly fire or civilian casualties .
That being said , QinetiQ's SWORDS - smith is still touting the improved " lethality " of its new MAARS chassis ( Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System ) , a 350 - pound PackBot - type unit that , unlike its predecessor , was built from the ground up with murder in its heart .
Its M240B Medium Machine
Gun is more powerful than SWORDS ' M249 , although redesigned software and a mechanical range fan are said to bolster safety by delineating live fire zones and keeping barrels pointed away from allied positions , respectively .
A final precaution precludes the bots from firing directly at their control units -- a feature that will provide little solace to the MAARS controller whose charge has just pulled a 180 after being hacked by enemy forces .

As part of the final Hollywood & Games Summit panel in Los Angeles , LucasArts ' Jim Ward has been discussing the oft - raised question of a lightsaber game for Nintendo 's Wii , saying that the company has internal prototypes running using the Wiimote .
In response to a question from session moderator N'Gai Croal of Newsweek asking : " What would it take to make a lightsaber game for the Wii ? " , Ward , who is President of LucasArts and a Senior VP at Lucasfilm , commented : " We 're all over that , and internally we have already played a lightsaber game on the Wii .
It 's a lot of fun , and we 'll get there .
" He added that the whole concept of a title using a lightsaber of Nintendo Wii was " ... in place !
There 'll be some stuff out this Fall - it 's going to be a lot of fun .
"
It 's unclear whether Ward could have been referring to the TT Games - developed Lego Star Wars : The Complete Saga , which will debut later this year on multiple formats including the Wii , or whether the company is planning further , as yet unannounced Wii-specific Star Wars games .
( The product page fornotes of the Wii SKU : " Motion - sensitive inputs give you exciting new ways to control yourcharacters . " )
The publisher is likely to reveal more information on its upcoming titles at the E3 Media Summit in Los Angeles early next month - Gamasutra will have the full write - up from the Jim Ward ( LucasArts ) and Neil Young ( Electronic Arts ) panel at Hollywood and Games in the near future .
The proposal has been widely described as primarily defensive , to blunt competition from News Corporation , but analysts say it has strategic value on its own  although perhaps not enough to justify anything like the $ 5 billion News Corporation has offered .
“ I think it ’s great strategically , with a lot of opportunities for consolidation , ” said Larry Grimes , president of W. B. Grimes & Company , media industry investment bankers .
“ Whether they can reach an agreement to make it work and justify a price that would make it happen , that ’s a very different question . ”
Justifying such a price is not the same issue for Mr. Murdoch , a shrewd businessman whose motivations sometimes go beyond profit to include prestige and political influence .
He often pours money into the businesses he buys , and he is willing to let some of them , like The New York Post , lose a lot of money , year after year .
In contrast , G.E. and Jeffrey R. Immelt , its chairman and chief executive , have a reputation for wielding the sharpest of pencils , aggressively hunting for savings , taking a hard , unsentimental look at any deal , and walking away if they are not confident it is a serious moneymaker .
Pearson and its chief executive , Marjorie Scardino , are often described as being more willing to pay premium prices for what they buy , though they have not made any major acquisitions recently .
The Journal is the leading finance - oriented newspaper in the United States and The Financial Times holds that distinction in Europe , and uniting them would offer obvious areas for consolidation , like merging or shrinking competing bureaus in many cities .
But analysts say the possible advantages go much further :
The Journal could largely retreat from Europe and The Financial Times could do the same in North America , they could consolidate printing operations and offer joint deals to advertisers .
Similar arrangements could be made between The Economist , half - owned by Pearson , and Barron ’s , owned by Dow Jones .

Web Trend Map 2007
As a Christmas and New Year ’s present to our clients and readers we have created a fun Internet overview :
The iA Trend Map shows all the big players , the current Internet trends and how they ’re connected , using the Tokyo Metro map .
It ’s totally unscientific and almost useless , but definitely fun to look at .
A couple of minutes ago , I was writing an article about blogging , and in the middle of it I decided to refer to Darren Rowse ’s highly popular ProBlogger .
net .
When I visited the link to confirm it was the correct one I was surprised , and then shocked , by the new design .
Although it is much more sophisticated than the previous one , in some aspects the design leaves a lot to be desired and , dare I say , makes a lot of mistakes in terms of usability .
It was n’t an easy decision to choose to write this article , but I decided to do it as an example that even great names can sometimes make mistakes .
One of the most basic rules about interface design , is that when a person is visiting a website , or a new program , there will always be four simple questions that cross our mind : Who ?
What ?
Why ?
and How ?.
When one of those questions is unanswered , we start to lose focus on what ’s in front of us , and when that happens , people tend to start getting loss in the interface .
If you are relatively tech - savvy , you ’ve certainly witnessed this sort of behavior a few times , like , for example , when you try to explain to someone who is n’t experienced with computers how to work with an application that is ( supposedly ) easy to work with , like an e-mail client .
I know how many times I ’ve had to try and explain my father how to check his inbox .
Although the old Problogger design had quite a few limitations , like for example :
it gave some key articles a lot of focus ;
it gave other articles very little focus ;
finding an article in the archives was n’t as easy ;
There were some other aspects that that designed achieved very well .
As soon as any person came to the webpage , not only did he instantly know where he was , but he was already answered to some of the most basic questions that someone might want to know about like , for example , “ What is a blog ? ” or “ How blogs make money online ” .
Which was all thanks to the “ Introduction ” square which was correctly placed underneath the banner and the tagline , as you can see in the screenshot below .
Despite sometimes having some very technical content , the site was very user - friendly , and it made even the most inexperienced Blogger want to learn more .
It did n’t feel like some Elitist website where only those who are very familiar with the subject are welcomed .
The new design fails in all of these previous aspects .
Top of the Page
On the new design you are greeted with non-intrusive links at the top , which say nothing about the content itself , a banner , the latest article , different ways to subscribe to the website followed by a huge amount of content .
If I were to change this top part of the website , I could include a similar , or identical , tag line to the previous one .
And then I would address another issue that hurts the whole site in general : the font size .
Font Size
One of the most stunning technological achievements that we ’ve been witnessing lately , in the computer industry , is the number of pixels we are able to fit in the smallest of screens .
A good example of a gadget with an amazing number of DPI ( dots per inch ) is the newly released iPhone which can display 160 pixels per square inch .
What I ’m trying to say with this is that the mediums that which use for internet browsing are changing .
Every year a new device comes out with a better resolution than the previous one but with almost , or exactly the same size .
In Japan , people already have cellphones with a resolution twice as big as the iPhone’s .
But this is n’t an essay on that , this is about ProBlogger .
And one of the things that is bad about the design is that the overall font size is too small by today ’s standards .
Left Column
Moving below from the top section , we are greeted with three columns .
The first one has a list with the title , and a small excerpt taken from the beginning of each article .
The equivalent of this , in the past design , was a big percentage of the article , which usually used an inverted pyramid scheme .
Darren Rowse starts with the conclusion , or explains what the article will talk about in the first phrase , and then develops from there .
It is an excellent way to motivate people to read the rest of your articles , and a technique that is becoming very common in the internet , due to how little time a visitor usually stays on a website .
So this left column actually works really well .
The biggest problem with it is really the lack of width and , once again , the size of the text .
Since the lines in this section are really short , the designer should have taken better care of the typography , and including a bigger space between the lines and between each character would do wonders for the legibility of the text .
Middle Column
The middle column is slightly wider than the left one , so one would assume that it ’s content is more important than the left one .
That may be partially true , since it does focus on Darren ’s video post , and on the most popular , or personal favorites , or introductory articles ( like the old design used to feature at the top ) .
I will comment on the organization of the information , and on this section once again , when I talk about the footer .
Right Column
There ’s not much to say about this column , but at the top there was a small mistake made , which some of you might have noticed , with the e-mail subscription button .
In most computer interfaces we use , confirmation buttons are usually placed at the right , or bottom right , of the field we ’re typing in .
In this case , they placed it at the bottom left and placed the link for the RSS feed on the bottom right instead .
Another thing that is noticeable , is the amount of whitespace that this section has , compared to the rest of the site ( with the exception of the banner and the footer ) .
This is the section with the least relevant information , but with the most whitespace .
Footer
Instead of simply being something that concludes the design , in this case , the footer holds more information about the site itself , and the who , the what and the why , than the rest of the design .
We can find out What the author writes about in the categories , How we can make money and become Professional Bloggers , and last , and certainly not least , Who the author really is .
So , basically , most of the things that were done correctly in the previous design , we ’re flipped around and sent to the bottom of the page , where they ’re less likely to be seen .
What I Would Change
There is no easy way to make the design better without compromising the current changes and the new features that were implemented , but my suggestions are these :
Improve the typography – Like Darren Rowse himself said on the video post of the 27th of July , we need to find ways to differentiate ourselves from the rest of the blogs out there .
Most of those blogs suffer from typography problems , and this new design is plagued with them .
But to improve typography do so in some sections , like in the left column , would mean that you ’d have to change the layout considerably …
Change the front page to a 2 column layout – the easiest way to improve the typography of the website would be to move the content of the center column to the right one and give the most recent content more relevance .
Doing this would also improve the site ’s whitespace considerably .
2.1 . A possible alternative :
If getting rid of a column is not an option , I would decrease the width of the right column considerably , and possibly move the left column to the middle , having it occupy the extra space .
Read this article again – most of the things I looked at , and criticized , can be done an infinite number of times .
There is no flawless or golden - ration equivalent for a perfect design , but it ’s important to question what kind of content you want to emphasize the most : the recent , or the most popular ?
And what kind of readers you want to satisfy the most , the new ones , or the returning ones ?
Right now the site is focused almost entirely on the later .
Conclusions
So what was achieved with this new layout , and the new design ?
Each section has a small title explaining what ’s in it , but has less focus than the section itself .
If this was the intention , it was well - achieved , but in terms of usability , it ’s better to know what you ’re looking at before you start reading it .
In three column designs , people instantly assume that the largest column is the most relevant one .
Since this is the case , then that means that this design emphasizes more on the past articles than on the recent ones .
If it were up to me , I would flip the left and middle column ’s content around .
By sending the categories , the small picture and story , and the resource links to the bottom , the site becomes less friendly to newcomers , but easier for returning visitors to access the latest information , rather than having to see the information they had already seen in their first visit once again .
This is both a positive , and negative , aspect of the new design .
In terms of whitespace , some sections are incredibly well divided in terms of space and content , like the right column and the footer .
Unfortunately , the areas with the most content suffer a lot from this problem .
The most important part of a blog is it ’s content , period .
And in terms of content , Problogger .
net is very well served , but , with this new design , the links to the most recent , or featured , content are the least attractive parts of the site to look at .
In conclusion , the site is a bit easier to navigate than the previous one .
Returning visitors will be able to quickly read the titles and catch up on unread articles , but newcomers will probably feel intimidated by the amount of information that is crammed up in the same place .
It ’s not a design that you ca n’t get used to , but it is a design that takes a while of getting used to , and for new visitors , and even returning ones , that is bad .
FRIDAY ’S LIQUIDITY EVENT ….
On Friday , as part of an effort to inject liquidity into the banking system , the Fed bought several billion dollars worth of mortgage - backed securities .
Brad DeLong called this “ unusual , ” but left hanging the question of just how unusual it was .
Stephen Spear , a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University , emails to say that he spoke with a friend of his at the Fed who confirmed that the Fed ’s action was unusual , “ but not tremendously so . ”
I thought it was an interesting email , so with his permission , here it is .
Here ’s what I ’ve been told by a colleague at the Fed :
First a minor point :
Most of the open market operations that the Fed does ( including Friday ’s ) are short - term collateralized loans and not outright purchases of securities .
Friday ’s loans were all overnight ( well , over the weekend , actually , maturing on Monday ) .
So the Fed is technically not buying anything ; it ’s been making short - term loans of cash against collateral .
The Fed accepts three categories of collateral for these loans .
One is Treasury securities , another is other government agency securities , and the third is mortgage - backed securities that are federally guaranteed .
Because they are federally guaranteed , the mortgage - backed securities the Fed accepts are ( obviously ) the very best .
Typically the interest rate on these short - term loans varies slightly depending on the type of collateral offered by the borrower .
Treasuries get the lowest rate ; mortgage - backed securities the highest .
( The details of the last 25 OMOs , including the rates for each type of security , are available here . )
What was unusual about Friday ( other than the size of the operation ) is that the Fed announced it would lend against all three types of collateral at the same rate .
To quote my Fed colleague on this : “ I ’m not sure why we did this .
I think the idea was that given the size of the operation we did not want to risk disrupting the Treasuries markets , but there may have been other motivations .
[ “ Other motivations ” ?
Hmmm. –ed ]
The expectation was that borrowers would primarily use mortgage - backed securities , since these have the lowest opportunity cost to the borrower . ”
On the web page above , you will see that for Friday ’s operations , under collateral type it just says “ mortgage - backed . ”
What this means is that mortgage - backed securities or any better securities were allowed as collateral — in other words , all three types were acceptable .
Apparently , the media misinterpreted this as saying that the Fed was only accepting mortgage - backed securities , which led to the headlines about the Fed buying these things up .
So , the bottom line is that the Fed ’s actions on Friday were unusual , but not tremendously so .
It did three OMOs instead of the usual one .
The quantity of reserves lent out was larger than normal , and the way collateral was handled was slightly unusual .
But the general operating procedure , including the type of collateral accepted , was completely standard .
It would seem that the media is trying to make the story a lot more sensational than it truly is .
The world ’s interest physical mobility has , to the surprise of many urban theorists , not decreased with the rise of global digital communication .
In fact , people are more mobile than ever , changing jobs , cities , or even countries with increased frequency .
This trend has played out in a variety of interesting ways when it comes to architecture and urbanism .
More and more designers are developing nomadic alternatives to traditional models of static urban living .
The GMC PAD was designed as an alternative to the financial problems of fixed living , particularly in areas with high land prices such as Southern California .
Others have proposed it would be useful as an alternative FEMA - type emergency residence .
Sustainability is , of course , of great concern in something that is in effect a souped - up kind of advanced mobile home .
This portable living unit was therefore designed a diesel - electric hybrid .
It also comes equipped with photovalic cells that charge onboard batteries , increasing the necessary time between refuels to weeks or even months .
As the global number of available shipping containers grows , more and more designers are considering creative ways to adapt underused or discarded containers to architectural purposes .
Such shipping container architecture has exists in a surprising variety of settings .
Cargo containers have been used for institutional , commercial and residential projects including museums , stores and single - or multi-family housing .
Their use as emergency medical units has also been advocated .
The world ’s first mobile hotel room , though still in a test phase , is designed to be placed virtually anywhere .
These portable rooms can be taken or delivered to remote or urban locations , from campgrounds and festivals to driveways and parking spaces .
They contain virtually all of the standard amenities – from the basics , such as running water , to air conditioning and television , though , of course , no forseeable room service !
The sustainability of these is , however , questionable .
Are they the next wave of urban mobility or a sign of decadent times ?
October 29 , 2007
BOSTON - South African Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu compared conditions in Palestine to those of South Africa under apartheid , and called on Israelis to try and change them , while speaking in Boston Saturday at historic Old South Church .
" We hope the occupation of the Palestinian territory by Israel will end , " Tutu said .
" There is a cry of anguish from the depth of my heart , to my spiritual relatives .
Please , please hear the call , the noble call of our scripture , " Tutu said of Israelis .
" Don�t be found fighting against this god , your god , our god , who hears the cry of the oppressed , " Tutu said .
Tutu spoke with political activist and lecturer Noam Chomsky and others to a largely religious audience about " The Apartheid Paradigm in Palestine - Israel , " a conference sponsored by Friends of Sabeel North America , a Christian Palestinian group .
Israeli policy toward Palestine is an inflammatory topic in the U.S. and is not commonly discussed in large , public forums .
In Boston , complaints were lodged with Old South Church in the weeks prior to the event , in an effort to halt the conference .
The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting complained that Sabeel is " an anti-Zionist organisation that traffics in anti-Judaic themes , " according to press reports .
Outside the church Saturday , Christians and Jews United for Israel demonstrated against Tutu and the conference .
" Sabeel is an organisation that seeks to demonise Israel .
Tutu several years ago made anti-Semitic comments , " May Long , president of the group , told IPS .
Long did not hear Tutu�s speech , she said .
Tutu was an inspirational leader in the South African fight against apartheid , which officially ended 13 years ago .
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 and today continues to speak around the globe for peace and justice , and to call for Palestinian rights .
The 76 - year - old Tutu also appears to have won a battle against prostate cancer , which he was last treated for in 2000 .
" Because of what I experienced in South Africa , I harbour hope for Israel and the Palestinian territories , " said Tutu , who invoked passages from the Christian bible throughout his talk .
Tutu drew parallels between the apartheid of South Africa and occupied Palestine of today , including demolitions of Palestinian homes by the Israeli government and the inability of Palestinians to travel freely within and out of Palestine .
" I experienced a d�j� vu when I encountered a security checkpoint that Palestinians must negotiate every day and be demeaned , all their lives , " Tutu said .
Tutu said that Palestinian homes are being bulldozed , and new , illegal homes for Israeli�s built in their place .
" When I hear , ' that used to be my home , � it is painfully similar to the treatment in South Africa when coloureds had no rights , " Tutu said .
Tutu is a pacifist and he said only non-violent means should be used to confront the oppression at play in Palestine .
" Palestinians ought to try themselves to restrain those who fire the rockets into Israeli territory , " Tutu said .
Tutu said that while fighting apartheid in South Africa he drew inspiration from the Jewish struggle as the bible describes it .
" Spiritually I am of Hebrew decent .
When apartheid oppression was at its most vicious , and all but knocked the stuffing out of those of us who opposed it , we turned to the Hebrew tradition of resistance , " and the belief that good will triumph over evil , and that a day of freedom from oppression will come , he said .
" The well - to - do and powerful complain that we are mixing religion with politics .
I�ve never heard the poor complain that ' Tutu , you are being too political , " ' he said .
" I am not playing politics when it involves children who suffer , " Tutu said .
" A human rights violation is a human rights violation is a human rights violation , wherever it occurs . "
Tutu recently bumped up against U.S. discomfort with discourse about Palestine , when a Minnesota university president yanked an invitation to Tutu that had been extended by a youth group .
Rev. Dennis Dease , president of the University of St. Thomas , in St. Paul Minnesota , said he did not want Tutu to speak because the Nobel Laureate�s position on Palestine was viewed by some as anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic .
Dease also fired Cris Toffolo as head of the university�s peace and justice programme , who had supported the invitation to Tutu .
Dease apologised to Tutu three weeks ago .
Tutu said Saturday that he accepted Dease�s " handsome apology " , but that he will not consider speaking at the school until Toffolo is reinstated and her record cleared .
At the conference , Chomsky said the U.S. provides heavy financial support to Israel and has a profound influence on Israeli policies , including those toward Palestine and foreign trade .
" If the U.S. doesn�t like what Israel is doing , it just kicks Israel in the face , " Chomsky said .
In 2005 , Israel wanted to sell improved missiles to China .
The Bush administration halted the sale , Chomsky said .
" It blocked them and refused to allow Israeli officials to come to the U.S. The U.S. demanded an apology from Israel .
It dragged Israel through the mud , " Chomsky said .
The U.S. began its close relationship with Israel after the Israeli victory in the 1967 " Six Day War " against Egypt , Syria and Jordan , Chomsky said .

The ongoing hand - wringing in Congress by the newly empowered Democrats over what to do about the war in Iraq speaks volumes about the level of concern ( or lack thereof ) these “ representatives of the people ” have toward the men and women who honor us all by serving in the armed forces of the United States of America .
The inability to reach consensus concerning the level of funding required or how to exercise effective oversight of the war , both constitutionally mandated responsibilities , is more a reflection of congressional cowardice and impotence than a byproduct of any heartfelt introspection over troop welfare and national security .
The issues that prompt the congressional collective to behave in such an egregious manner have more to do with a reflexive tendency to avoid any controversy that might disrupt the status quo ante regarding representative - constituent relations ( i.e. , re-election ) than with any intellectual debate about doing the right thing .
This sickening trend is bipartisan in nature , but of particular shame to the Democrats , who obtained their majority from an electorate that expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of the war in Iraq through their votes , demanding that something be done .
Sadly , Congress ’ smoke - and - mirrors approach to the Iraq war creates the impression of much activity while generating no result .
Even more sadly , the majority of Americans are falling for the act , either by continuing their past trend of political disengagement or by thinking that the gesticulation and pontification taking place in Washington , D.C. , actually translate into useful work .
The fact is , most Americans are ill - placed intellectually , either through genuine ignorance , a lack of curiosity or a combination of both , to judge for themselves the efficacy of congressional behavior when it comes to Iraq .
Congress claims to be searching for a solution to Iraq , and many Americans simply accept that this is this case .
The fact is one cannot begin to search for a solution to a problem that has yet to be accurately defined .
We speak of “ surges , ” “ stability ” and “ funding ” as if these terms come close to addressing the real problems faced in Iraq .
There is widespread recognition among members of Congress and the American people that there is civil unrest in Iraq today , with Iraqi - on - Iraqi violence tearing that country apart , but the depth of analysis rarely goes beyond that obvious statement of fact .
Americans might be able to nod their heads knowingly if one utters the words Sunni , Shiite and Kurd , but very few could take the conversation much further down the path of genuine comprehension regarding the interrelationships among these three groups .
And yet we , the people , are expected to be able to hold to account those whom we elected to represent us in higher office , those making the decisions regarding the war in Iraq .
How can the ignorant accomplish this task ?
And ignorance is not something uniquely attached to the American public .
Rep. Silvestre Reyes , the newly appointed chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , infamously failed a pop quiz in which journalist Jeff Stein asked him to differentiate between Sunni and Shiite .
Reyes has become the poster boy for congressional stupidity , but in truth he is not alone .
Very few of his colleagues could pass the test , truth be told .
The task of holding Congress to account is a daunting one , and can be accomplished only if the citizenry that forms the respective constituencies of our ignorant congressional representatives are themselves able to operate at an intellectual capacity above that of those they are holding to account .
So rather than issue “ pop quizzes ” to our elected representatives , I ’ve designed one for us , the people .
If the reader can fully answer the question raised , then he or she qualifies as one capable of pointing an accusatory finger at Congress as its members dither over what to do in Iraq .
If the reader fails the quiz , then there should be an honest appraisal of the reality that we are in way over our heads regarding this war , and that it is irresponsible for anyone to make sweeping judgments about the ramifications of policy courses of action yet to be agreed upon .
Claiming to be able to divine a solution to a problem improperly defined is not only ignorant but dangerously delusional .
So here is the quiz : Explain the relationship between the Iraqi cities of Karbala and Baghdad as they impact the coexistence of Iraq ’s Shiite and Sunni populations .

Facebook LOS ANGELES ( AP )  Bill Maher can add " security guard " to his job description alongside comedian and political commentator .
Maher helped security give the boot to a rowdy protester from the studio of his weekly HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night , and it was all captured on live television .
Maher was talking science during one of his weekly panel discussions when a protester in his audience stood , held up a smuggled - in sign reading " 9/11 is a cover up fraud " and shouted comments to the same effect .
The host tried to shout down the audience member , who only became more agitated .
" Do we have some ( expletive ) security in this building , " Maher yelled , " or do I have to come down there and kick his ( expletive ) ? "
When security reached the man 's aisle and he resisted leaving , Maher ran into the seats and helped them push him out the door , shouting " Out ! Out ! Out ! "
Several other protesters , sprinkled throughout the audience , then stood up and shouted .
" This is n't the Iowa Caucus , OK , we 're not here to debate , " Maher shouted with most of his audience cheering him on .
" This is the problem with live television . "
The incident was shown live on the East Coast , and the network appeared to show the entire affair unedited for the taped - delayed West Coast version .
After the instigators were ejected , Maher told his panelists — MSNBC's Chris Matthews , Los Angeles Times columnist Joel Stein and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson — that they often linger outside his studio to share 9/11 conspiracy theories with him and try to get into the show .
" It 's the only time I defend Bush , " he said .
" I 'm thinking about firing my audience department , " he added .
Regular audience members found the ruckus thrilling .
" We picked a very exciting night to be here , " Eliot Stein , a 54 - year - old high school teacher , said via cellphone .
" There 's few live TV shows anymore , and here you got to see , it was like a movie .
it was great . "
Stein 's friend John Lovell said " It was positively surreal . "
Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards and wife Elizabeth had been in the studio for an interview before the panel discussion and dustup .
Elizabeth Edwards was shown in the audience after her husband 's interview , but it was not clear whether she remained in the seats during the incident .
Phone and e-mail messages left with HBO officials late Friday were not immediately returned .

About
The Ur- Quan Masters
The project started in August 2002 , when Toys For Bob released the partially ported sources of Star Control 2 3DO version to the fan community .
Our goal is to port this wonderful game to current personal computers and operating systems .
It is and will remain 100 % free of charge , and anyone can contribute to the project and thus help make it even better .
For more information , look at our info page .
News
Compatibility Release for macOS 10.14 and onwards
If you are using macOS 10.13.4 , you may have noticed a warning that UQM needs to be updated to improve compatibility .
Apple has announced that macOS 10.13 High Sierra would be the last version of macOS to run 32 - bit apps " without compromise " .
We have now created and released a fresh build of UQM 0.7.0 that has rebuilt not only the main program but also all of its libraries for maximum compatibility backwards and forwards .
We have tested it on 10.7 Lion , 10.9 Mavericks , and 10.13 High Sierra — it is our belief that it should work even on 10.6 Snow Leopard .
We also expect that this edition will work without compromise on future Intel Macs for some time to come .
You can get it from our downloads page .
Compatibility Source Code Release for Modern Linux
Recent releases of GCC have trouble compiling UQM 0.7.0 from its source release .
We have created a new source update that has been tested on the current stable versions of Debian , Fedora , and OpenBSD .
You can get it from our downloads page .
Note that this is purely a change to build - time configuration and logic : nothing about this release has changed the the resulting program .
If you have a working build of UQM 0.7.0 , you do n't need to take this update .
Compatibility Release for macOS Sierra
The release of macOS Sierra has finally removed some of the old graphics and sound APIs that our releases of UQM depended on .
We have created a new macOS package for The Ur- Quan Masters that has been tested on 10.12 Sierra and should work at least as far back as 10.7 Lion .
You can get it from our downloads page .
Development migrated to Git
After a number of requests from modders , we 've converted the Ur - Quan Masters code repository over to use the Git revision control system .
This should make it easier for modders to collaborate with one another and to track changes made in the vanilla development track .
The code page is thus available here .
The Subversion repository will be kept available for the forseeable future , but it will not be taking additional updates .
If you are planning on creating your own personal mod of UQM , we encourage you to develop it in Git by creating a branch from one of the release tags of the vanilla UQM repository .
That way , it will be easier to update your mod with new releases from vanilla .

Announcing The Ur-Quan Masters 0.7.0
Hello everyone !
Guess what day it is today ?
It is the fourth of July , the day when we remember aliens taking over Earth , beings from another solar system mining planets for resources , and the destruction of historic buildings ( as well as tourism ) .
It is the day when we celebrate a brave few in a ship built with alien technology carrying a huge bomb into the alien mothership in a near suicide attack .
It is the day when the shields went down .
Today is the day of the greatest science fiction of all time : Star Control 2 - The Ur- Quan Masters !
The ` The Ur- Quan Masters ' development team is happy to announce : The Ur- Quan Masters 0.7.0 .
So what is new ?
Well , you can find the complete list here , but here are a few of the highlights :
some missing bits of content added , including two new lander reports directly from Toys for Bob
support for Windows CE , and experimental support for Symbian S60
many bug fixes , including some that have been long anticipated
various small improvements and polishing
lots of internal cleanups and restructuring , making the game more customisable and modable , and making the code a bit friendlier
So download the game from here and join us in the celebrations !
And do not forget to * enjoy the sauce *!
The ` The Ur- Quan Masters ' development team .
The petition to get a new Star Control made has generated quite a bit of response , but more can be done .
I would like to direct your attention to a cunning plan that Alex Ness from Toys for Bob has come up with .
In his own words ( from the Toys for Bob website ) :
First We Hit Them With Letters , Next Arts and Crafts .
After that , they wo n't know what hit 'em .
Activision , I mean .
As part of my multi-pronged strategy to convince Activision to insist that our next project be a Star Control one , I have come up with idea to harness the powers of arts and crafts as well as fans everywhere .
What I want to do is this :
Make a giant map of the Earth .
Maybe I should just buy one .
I 'm not map maker .
If I were , I 'd probably be instantly fired for my alternative spelling of the nation known as Uruguay as well as the fabrication of non-existent countries like Nutsack Kingdom and Nutsack Kingdom II .
As a matter of fact , I have already been fired from previous jobs for these exact same reasons , even though none of those jobs involved making a map .
So anyway , I 'm going to buy a map .
A real big one .
Then I 'm going to prominently display it somewhere in our office .
Phase one of my plan will then be complete .
Phase two is where I once again , ask you wonderful community of fans for support .
What I want is to put pictures of you guys up on this map .
Not everybody but at least one from every country .
This may be a problem for the magical isle of Greenland but who knows ?
There could n't be all that much to do in Greenland , especially if you 're unemployed like Andre the Giant 's character in the Princess Bride used to be , so maybe someone who lives there has played a little Star Control .
Anyway , what I 'll do then is post your picture up over the respective country you live in .
The idea being to show the fan base all over the globe .
Will this help convince Activision to let us do another Star Control ?
I can't predict the future but I can tell you that if it 's big and displayed prominently , it will help remind them every time they come to visit and be a real conversation piece .
Plus it will just generally brighten our spirits .
In Paul 's case , this could lead to a level of congeniality rarely exhibited by man or machine .
He 's quite a bubbly figure , in case you do n't know .
So if you 've got the notion and a camera , can you send me a picture of yourself either playing SCII or at least standing near something SCII - related ?
Just send it right to old alexness@toysforbob.com .
Or , if you really want the picture to get there extra fast , use my new other email address : nutsack@toysforbob.com .
Somehow just the word " nutsack " does make things faster and better .
Thanks ,
Alex
And in case you 're wondering , it 's not too late to show your support by signing the petition .
IRC Chat with Toys for Bob on 2007-06 - 13
Those of you who visit the UQM forum or the Ultronomicon may have seen the occasional reference to the Words of Wisdom uttered by the Creators of Star Control in past IRC chats .
It is time to add another chapter .
On Wednesday the 13th of June at 14.00 PT ( that 's 21.00 UTC ) , a delegation from Toys for Bob , including Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford themselves , will visit the IRC channel #uqm - tfb on Freenode , and you 're all invited .
A lucky few of you may even get the chance to play a game of SuperMelee against one of them .
( Be sure to test your setup in advance . )
So , bring your best questions , and see you then .
The ` The Ur- Quan Masters ' development team .
Edit : the chat is over ; you can find the log here .
The Ur- Quan Masters v0.6.2 release
You may have noticed the presence of an increasingly large number of bugs which move with great speed and attack relentlessly .
We are sorry to say that this is our catalog item UQM - 0.6.1 .
Yes , we 've moved beyond the bugfixing stage into the lucrative bug creation phase .
It seems that our bugfix release in fact introduced a new bug .
So now , we have 0.6.2 .
In 0.6.2 , you can save your game and supermelee fleets again , which is good .
And there are a few bonus small fixes , which should n't hurt anyone either .
The game data is still unchanged , so you wo n't have to redownload that , and you can just install 0.6.2 over 0.6.0 or 0.6.1 .
You can find it here .
Have fun again ,
The ` The Ur- Quan Masters ' development team .
The Ur- Quan Masters v0.6.1 release
The Ur- Quan Masters 0.6.0 has been so well received that we thought we'd do that again .
We call it 0.6.1 .
Now you may think , " There 's got to be something more if they raise the version number . " .
But nope , there is n't .
There 's actually something less .
Bugs .
We do n't like them , so we got rid of some .
So 0.6.1 is what you might call a " maintenance release " .
At least that 's how we call it .
Fortunately , the game data is unchanged , so you wo n't have to redownload all that .
You can just install 0.6.1 over 0.6.0 to enjoy all the benefits of having less .
You can find it here .
May the Ultron be with you ,
The ` The Ur- Quan Masters ' development team .
The Ur- Quan Masters v0.6.0 release
Happy days and jubilation !
It 's The Ur- Quan Masters 0.6.0 .
And The Ur- Quan Masters 0.6.0 means network SuperMelee !
And it means in - game key configuration .
And it means support for 64 bit systems .
And it means more bugfixes .
And it means more internal improvements which you wo n't care about .
Read all about it in our WhatsNew file .
To download it , we gladly direct you to our download page .
And if you have n't already , support a new Star Control created by Toys for Bob ( the creators of the original Star Control and Star Control II , but not Star Control 3 ) by signing the petition .
And if you 're in search of people to play network SuperMelee against , you 'll likely find someone ready to eat flaming plasma death in the IRC channel on irc.freenode.org .
Blow up an Ur - Quan for us , Captain ,
The ` The Ur- Quan Masters ' development team .
Toys for Bob want another Star Control and need your help !
A few days ago , Toys for Bob , the creators of Star Control 1 and 2 ( but not 3 ) made it known that they were in talks with the Powers That Be at Activision about what their next game should be .
They decided that the stars are finally right , and are trying to convince the Powers that their next game should be a Star Control game .
And they 're asking the fans for help .
If we could send them mails in support of a new Star Control , they could use those as a powerful argument in the discussion .
Read more about it on our petition page .

New Precursors Remixes Released
It 's been a looooong hiatus for The Precursors , but we 're finally back in business .
Despite not having completed the fourth remix pack ( yet ) , we decided that we 're close enough that we can start releasing the pack in smaller doses .
From today , we 'll strive to release at least one track from the new remix pack every friday .
To kick this party off , we 're giving you not only one , but two Utwig remixes , and to top it off they both play in the game during different circumstances .
Since we 're not releasing these remixes in packages yet , you 'll have to add them to the game yourself .
This can be done by creating a folder called " comm " under the content folder in the Ur - Quan Masters install folder .
Under the new comm folder , create another folder called " utwig " and place the two OGG - files there ( the game wo n't play the MP3 - files ) .
The first Utwig remix , Mask of Ultimate Embarrasment and Shame ( OGG , MP3 ) , was composed by Tore Aune Fjellstad and Espen Gätzschmann .
The other remix , The Ultron ( OGG , MP3 ) , was composed by guest composer Casey Monroe .
Keep an eye on this thread in the forum for updated information on new releases .
Enjoy !

Apple Inc. , along with its chief executive and exclusive U.S. iPhone wireless partner AT&T , have been hit with a new lawsuit from a disgruntled customer who charges the trio with a variety of offenses stemming from the recent iPhone price cut .
In the suit , filed Sept. 24 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York , Queens resident Dongmei Li accuses the parties of price discrimination , underselling , discrimination in rebates , deceptive actions , and other wrongdoings for their role in the Sept. 5th price drop on iPhone , which saw the handset 's price tag slashed an unprecedented $ 200 less than two months after its debut .
Li was among the thousands who waited hours in line on June 29 , 2007 for her chance to purchase one of the touch - screen devices , according to the suit .
When she reached the front of the line , her local Apple store only had 4GB models remaining , which she purchased anyway despite having intended to buy the larger - capacitied 8 GB model .
She , like thousands of others , the suit claims , is now the victim of price discrimination in that she cannot resell her iPhone for the same profit as customers who purchased the device after price drop .
Similarly , she cannot trade up to 8 GB model she had initially hoped to obtain and is now left with a product that has been discontinued .
Li also feels cheated by Apple 's rebate policy because she was only offered a $ 100 store credit towards a future Apple store purchase when those customers who bought the same iPhone within a two week window period immediately preceding the cut received the full $ 200 refund under the company 's price protection policy .
Li included in her 8 - page complaint historical stock graphs that show Apple 's share price to have risen in between the time it released iPhone in late June and when the company instated the price cut .
She argues that this is proof that there was no sound reason for the cut , which she equated to " underselling . "
" Market conditions did not require Apple to change its price , " Li's attorney , C. Jean Wang of Wang Law Offices , PLLC wrote in the filing .
" iPhone was selling very well because Apple 's stocks were increasing since August 16 , 2007 and rose as high as $ 144.16 on September 4 , 2007 , the day before Apple announced that it was cutting the price of iPhone . "
The lawsuit goes on to accuse Apple , Jobs and AT&T of forcing customers into 2 - year service agreements with AT&T and imposing hefty $ 175 termination fees .
These requirements are unfair , the suit continues , because customers who purchased the iPhone later in the year were able to utilize unlocking solutions that allowed them to forgo such terms and fees .
Given Apple 's since stated stance on this matter — and the recent consequences faced by users of unlocked iPhones in recent days — it would seem this portion of the suit is now of lesser merit .
Study finds morning people are “ logical ” , night owls are “ creative ”
I ’m really not a morning person .
But according to a new study , this tells you a lot about my personality : I ’m more likely to be “ creative ” , “ risk - taking ” , “ non-conformist ” and “ independent ” than early risers .
This work came from the psychologist Juan Francisco Diaz - Morales , who recently decided to see if there were any regularities in the personality traits of early risers versus evening people .
He took 360 undergraduates , ranked their relative sleep / wake habits , and then scaled them on the Millon Index of Personality Styles .
According to the blog of the British Psychological Society , here ’s what he found :
[ Morning people ] tend to be of a certain personality : they favour the tangible and concrete , they trust their experience and the observable over intuition and feelings ; they have an attention to detail and a preference for logic .
They are respectful of authority , care about social conventions and are rarely politically radical .
[ snip ]
In contrast to morning types , evening people preferred the symbolic over the concrete , were creative and risk - taking , and tended to be non-conformist and independent .
Assuming this finding holds water , it ’d have some pretty interesting implications for the workplace , eh ?
A smart company would organize its workday to optimize tasks based on which type of person is needed for the job — a logic - crunching task versus a blue - skying brainstorm — and when they ’re likely to be at their best .
Indeed , I ’ve long suspected that the 9 to 5 schedule is kind of suboptimal for productivity ; it ’s patently clear that different people shine at different times in the day .
And you could argue that — for white - collar work , at least — the time - delimited bounds of the workday are more up for grabs now than they ’ve ever been .
Historically , one big reason we settled on the 9 to 5 timeslot is for purposes of industrial efficiency :
We needed people to be at their desks for roughly the same time period so they could work together .
But email , mobile phones , and digital documents obviate a lot of those old - skool practical considerations .
A lot of the rationale for 9 to 5 worktimes is now practically a phantom - limb phenomenon in corporate culture .
( Alas , the full study is behind a paywall , so I could n’t read it , but here ’s the official link . )

Six years on , the devoted mother is daring to believe her hopes may be answered .
Daughter Amy , now 23 , has begun to show signs of life after being given an over - the - counter sleeping pill .
Last night Mrs Pickard said the ' old sparkle ' returned to her daughter 's eyes when she was given a pill and described the change as ' amazing ' .

Until last month she remained seemingly lifeless in bed in a nursing home .
But now , barely four weeks after taking her first Zolpidem pill as part of a worldwide trial , she is breathing by herself , instead of through a hole in her throat , reacting to food and showing signs of awareness .
Mrs Pickard , 54 , said : ' She is changing and it is amazing .
When she takes the pill , I see her face relax and the old sparkle return to her eyes .
It 's incredible .
When I look at her now I can see the old Amy coming through , fighting to get out . '

Two weeks ago Amy stood up - with support from two nurses - for the first time since she lost consciousness .
She is also focusing on objects and making voluntary noises rather than staring into space with no sign of life .
Amy was 17 and preparing for the birth of her first child when she slipped into a coma six years ago .
She collapsed and suffered severe brain damage after experimenting with heroin .
Shortly afterwards , former nurse Mrs Pickard , a mother of two from Hastings , East Sussex , allowed an image of the teenager in her hospital bed to be released as a poignant plea to persuade others not to use drugs .
Since then she has spent hours at her daughter 's bedside at the Raphael Medical Centre in Tonbridge , Kent , visiting every day .
Her decision to allow her daughter to be part of the drugs trial is the subject of a BBC1 documentary , to be shown tonight .
Amy is one of 360 people taking part in the trial .

The remarkable side - effects of Zolpidem were first noticed in South Africa after 24 - year - old Louis Viljoen suffered serious brain damage when he was hit by a truck in 1994 .
Doctors expected him to die and told his mother he would never regain consciousness .
He was prescribed Zolpidem - normally used as a quick fix for insomnia - five years later in an attempt to reduce involuntary spasms in his arm .
Doctors thought the drug would send him into a deep sleep and stop him moving around so much - but just 25 minutes after being given the first pill , he sat up and said : ' Hello , mummy . '
Medics were baffled , and British firm ReGen Therapeutics is now leading research into the astonishing side - effects .
Mrs Pickard , who flew to South Africa to meet other patients , said : ' I had read about this drug but I never dreamed Amy would get a chance to try it .
' When I came back from South Africa , I was exhausted but the hope in my heart was intense .
I realised Amy must try this new treatment . '

Doctors have warned it could take months for a major breakthrough - in her daughter 's condition - but Mrs Pickard says progress is already obvious .
' Her eyes are now focusing on things , she 's more aware of her surroundings and she 's making so much noise - almost forming actual words .
It 's remarkable . '
Amy is also reacting to food and drink - grimacing when given a lemon or something sour and smiling when given something sweet .
Mrs Pickard added : ' It 's a day - today waiting game to see what will happen next , but I just know she 's going to speak any day . '

Hurray !
Finally , you can get a report from Google of the top anchor text phrases used when people link to your site .
Google Webmaster Central has just announced the new feature .
But did n’t Google already report anchor text data ?
Yes , but only keywords , not phrases .
Keywords are mostly useless junk food data .
Phrases are datalicious , tasty and helpful .
Below , a detailed and illustrated look at what a difference a phrase makes and how to claim your own .
Getting The Anchor Text Data
To access the data , you have to be verified Google Webmaster Central user .
That ’s explained more here , and it ’s easy to do .
Note that if you ’re verifying for the first time , it may take up to a day for the anchor text and other data to start showing up for you .
Once logged in , select the site you want to view from the “ My Sites ” screen .
When that site loads , choose the “ Statistics ” tab , then select the “ Page analysis ” link you ’ll see in the left - hand navigation .
Look further down on the page under the “ Common Words ” section .
There are two tables .
The one on the right is called “ In external links to your site . ”
That ’s the table you want .
That table shows you the top 100 phrases people are using to link to your site .
So for Search Engine Land , using the top of that table , here are our top 10 phrases most used when people link to us :

What Is Anchor Text ?
How People Link To You
Let ’s look at the most popular phrase on the list — “ search engine land ” — to explain more about how all this anchor text phrase stuff works .
If you ’re a pro , you might want to skip this section .
For others , I thought a little anchor text basics might be helpful .
Lots of people link to Search Engine Land from across the web .
Anyone can see some of these links to us by doing this search on Google :
( As a reminder , site owners can see even more links than the search above shows through Google Webmaster Central .
My
Google Releases New Link Reporting
Tools article from last month explains more about this .
But the public link reporting tool is fine for the explanation I ’m doing . )
One of the top sites listed linking to us is Graywolf ’s SEO Blog , from this page .
If I go to the page , I can see him linking to us .
The link to Search Engine Land says ( that ’s what “ anchor text ” is , the text in a link ) , “ Search Engine Land ” like this :
It ’s not surprising that Search Engine Land is the top phrase used to link to us .
It ’s our name , so lots of people link to us that way .
But now let ’s look at something else .
“ More ” is the second most popular phrase used to link to us .
Weird , right ?
Well , chances are there are lots of people linking to our stories and using the words “ more ” in the link .
How They Link , Not How Many Links , Influences Ranking
As you can see , the data is great information .
The text people use to link to you is one of the most important factors — often the most important factor — for how you will rank in Google .
Let me repeat that .
The anchor text used to link to your pages often is the most important reason you ’ll rank well for particular words .
People still continue to mistakenly think that doing well at Google is about getting as many links as you can .
It ’s not .
It ’s about getting quality links from important sites and ideally , very descriptive links — links using the terms you want to rank for in the anchor text .
If you ’re trying to show up for some key phrase , the new data will show you if people are linking to you that way , as seen by Google .
If not , then you understand that a lot more targeted link building work may need to be done .
Down at the bottom of the table , you ’ll see a “ Download this table ” option .
That will let you download the data , if you want to play with it more .
The Old Keyword Table
I started off saying that anchor phrases are better than anchor keywords , which Google started reporting in February 2006 .
Before today ’s change , this is what Google reported about our anchor text as the top ten words :
search engine land google the 2007 for searchengineland searchcap day
See the first three ?
On the new report , you can understand that Google was seeing lots of links that said “ search engine land ” and breaking the link text into the individual words .
That was terrible , because it meant you had no idea of the exact order used in your most popular links .
To explain this even more , see the number four term , “ google . ”
Actually , that ’s kind of useful to know — that out of all the links out there to our site , Google occurs as the fourth most popular term in them .
Potentially , that might help us rank for that particular word .
But breaking it apart meant I was unable to see that the word was really part of longer phrases people use to link
to us , like this :
google releases new link reporting tools
releases new link reporting tools will google remain the start page for the
remain the start page for the google kills bush ’s miserable failure search & other
kills bush ’s miserable failure search & other google ramps up personalized search
ramps up personalized search google ‘s agent rank patent application
‘s agent rank patent application google news top of mind even if not
news top of mind even if not q&a with marissa mayer google vp search products
If I have to choose , phrases are more useful .
But ideally , I ’d love both .
Wish List
Now that I ’ve gotten one wish — anchor phrases rather than anchor keywords — I want more .
My wish list :
Anchor Keywords : I know , I abused them when starting out this story .
But they can be useful to see in addition anchor phrases .
So let ’s have them both !
I know , I abused them when starting out this story .
But they can be useful to see in addition anchor phrases .
So let ’s have them both !
Number Of Links :
It ’s great that I can see the exact way people are linking to me , but how about the number of those links ?
Just how many more people link to me using the number one phrase versus the number two phrase ?
Enquiring minds want to know !
It ’s great that I can see the exact way people are linking to me , but how about the number of those links ?
Just how many more people link to me using the number one phrase versus the number two phrase ?
Enquiring minds want to know !
Who Links ?
Let me drill down into any particular phrase and see the exact pages that are linking to me in that way .
This I want more than anything else , especially because , as I ’ll explain , it ’s something you ca n’t get easily from any of the major search engines .
Will we get it ?
Perhaps , plus maybe some things I did n’t think of .
“ There a lot that we can do with linking data that could help webmasters , and we ’re looking at how we can provide more information .
We aggregate phrases right now , but perhaps we can break those out .
We might also show more than 100 phrases in the future , ” said Google Webmaster Central product manager Vanessa Fox .
Aggregate Data
By “ aggregating ” phrases , Fox is talking about how Google will remove punctuation and capitalization , so that all “ variations ” of a phrase get consolidated into one .
Consider people linking to a Star Trek : The Next Generation site in all these ways :
Star Trek : The Next Generation
Star Trek – The Next Generation
star trek , the next generation
Star Trek , The Next Generation
Star Trek The Next Generation
Star Trek | The Next Generation
The same five words are used in the exact same order , so currently , Google considers all the variations to be the same phrase .
To do this , it strips out most punctuation ( apostrophes and ampersands seem to still stay in ) and reports all variations like this :
star trek the next generation
In the future , potentially those who care could get an breakdown showing exact spellings , punctuation usage and so on .
Internal Links & Subdomains
A few more details about the anchor text data .
First , it comes only from external links to your site .
Anchor text you use on your own site is n’t counted .
Second , links to any subdomains you have are NOT included in the data .
So if you had several sites like this :
mysite.com
products.mysite.com
blog.mysite.com
videos.mysite.com
Then links to all of them would NOT show up for the mysite.com report .
Want to see link data for a particular subdomain ?
Then you need to make a separate account for that subdomain .
What about this popular situation ?
mysite.com
www.mysite.com
If these are separate domains ( IE , when you enter them into your browser , the domain does n’t change ) , then the links are reported separately .
The exception is if you redirect .
If entering www.mysite.com makes the domain change to mysite.com ( similar to what we do here at Search Engine land ) , then the mysite.com account will cover any www.mysite.com links .
FYI , that ’s true for any domain or URL you redirect to another domain .
Hunting Down The Links
Remember how I said I could n’t find an example of the people linking to me and using the word “ more ” in the links ?
What a pain !
I could n’t do it .
Nor could I figure out why the 30th most popular anchor text link to our site was :
askmeaboutmybra.com
I ’ve got nothing to say about my bra .
I do n’t wear one .
Who and why people are linking to us that way is a mystery .
Maybe it ’s a glitch , but it underscores something I ’ve wanted for ages .
That ’s better search commands allowing me to see exactly what anchor text is used to link to a site .
I ’ve especially wanted this as we ’ve had various link bombs or Google bombs erupt .
Sure , Google ’s fixed the Google bomb problem ( see Google Kills Bush ’s Miserable Failure Search & Other Google Bombs for more on that ) .
But it ’s still interesting to research the ways people are linking to sites , the words they are using .
Two major search engines offer anchor text searching .
Not Google .
Not Yahoo .
Instead , it ’s Ask and Microsoft that do .
However , I do n’t think the Ask “ inlink ” command works properly ( Ask is getting back to me on this ) .
Nor is it helpful without a related “ link ” command .
So I ’ll focus on Microsoft .
Microsoft added an anchor search command back in June 2005 .
It looks like this :
inanchor :
If you want to find pages that have particular words embedded in anchor text , then you use that command with the word , like this :
That search should bring up all the pages that have a link containing the word “ miserable ” in the link .
If I wanted to find more than one word in links , I have to do this way :
That should bring back pages that use both words in links on them — which would be pretty much a way to find all the people who have been playing in the “ miserable failure ” link bomb game over the past two years .
Unfortunately , the command — like Ask’s — does n’t seem to work .
In both cases , I get back the official President George W. Bush web page .
I can assure you , there are no hyperlinks containing the words “ miserable ” and / or “ failure ” on that page .
In fact , neither of those words even appear in ordinary text .
Let ’s pretend it DID work .
Remember how I wanted to find the pages linking to Search Engine Land and using the word “ more ” in the hyperlinks ?
To do this , I ’d need to combine two commands .
I ’ll bold the two different ones :
That would bring back only pages linking to Search Engine Land and which had links using the word “ more ” in the link text .
However , even if inanchor was working properly , this search STILL would n’t be enough .
That ’s because you could have a page that links to Search Engine Land in one place — with ANY text in the hyperlink — and has a hyperlink to some other page that uses the word “ more ” in it .
I struggle to think of what type of new command could be added to do exactly what I want .
That ’s what makes the new Google reporting so especially cool .
It is the only way you can easily get the most popular anchor text from across the web pointing at your site .
If Google adds some of the wish list items , especially the ability to see exactly what pages link using particular phrases ,
it only gets better .
The News Corporation , owner of The New York Post , bought two weekly newspapers in the Bronx yesterday , giving it a chain of neighborhood papers throughout three New York City boroughs that it hopes will complement The Post .
News Corporation did not disclose the price it paid to the owners , David Kiesman and John Collazzi , for The Bronx Times and The Bronx Times Reporter .
Although News Corporation has been in the limelight in recent weeks for its bid to acquire Dow Jones , the publisher of The Wall Street Journal , the company also owns a number of small local papers .
Yesterday , News Corporation said it would expand the reach of the Brooklyn and Queens newspaper chains it bought last September into more neighborhoods .
Including the two Bronx papers , the company ’s weekly newspapers in New York have a combined circulation  some paid , but mostly free  of nearly 300,000 .
Researchers in the College of Engineering at UC Santa Barbara have discovered how to make polymeric micro- and nanoparticles in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes using commonly - available lab chemicals and equipment .
Knowing how to create these particles in the average laboratory environment will facilitate further discovery , as the particles are essential to understanding the role of shape in particle function .
Polymeric micro- and nanoparticles are used in a wide range of applications including medical imaging , drug delivery , and beauty and personal care products .
These applications typically use spherical particles .
While making particles in other shapes could be extremely useful , fabricating shapes other than spheres has been technically challenging .
The research team , led by Samir Mitragotri , a professor of chemical engineering , with Julie Champion , a graduate student , and Yogesh Katare , a post - doctoral researcher , used spherical polystyrene beads as a starting point .
In one approach , the beads were liquefied by heat or solvents and then stretched .
In the second , the beads were embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol film and the film was stretched to create voids around the beads .
These voids were then filled by liquefying the beads using heat or solvent .
From these two simple techniques , more than 20 different shapes were formed , ranging from simple rods and eggs to lenses , diamonds , food - shaped ravioli and tacos .
The methods used to create the potpourri of micro- and nanoparticles allow the researchers to control the size and shape of the particles created , a crucial factor in the development of nonspeherical particles in a variety of fields , including drug delivery , microbiology , advanced materials and rheology .
This research was funded by the NIH program of excellence in nanotechnology .
Their research is published in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Poll : Half of Americans would ' never ' vote for Sen. Clinton RAW STORY
Published : Sunday October 21 , 2007

Print This Email This Bad news for New York 's junior senator .
While Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) has won broad support in national tracking polls in her quest for the presidency , the former first lady is steeped in negative attitudes , according to a Zogby International poll released Sunday .
Half of likely voters nationwide said they would never vote for New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton , in a poll Zogby conducted Oct. 11 - 15 , 2007 , with a margin of error of +/ 1.0 percentage point .
" This is up from 46 % who said they could never vote for Clinton in a Zogby International telephone survey conducted in early March , " the poll asserts .
" Older voters are most resistant to Clinton  59 % of those age 65 and older said they would never vote for the New York senator , but she is much more acceptable to younger voters : 42 % of those age 1829 said they would never vote for Clinton for President . "
Rep. Dennis Kucinich and former Sen. Mike Gravel rank second and third on the " who I 'd never vote " for list , respectively .
Democratic New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and former Republican Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee fared best , suggesting they could do better in national polls as voters get to know them better .
" Richardson was forever objectionable as President to 34 % , while 35 % said they could never vote for Huckabee and 37 % said they would never cast a presidential ballot for Obama , " the survey showed .
No word on Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert , who entered the race last week .

Browse column W ith all this official talk about Russians having more babies , how strange it is that sex should disappear from most forms of advertising in the capital .
Low - key promo activities still see scantily clad waifs drumming up interest in everything from mayonnaise to mobile phones , but traditional , broad - reaching advertising channels such as outdoor and television seem to have been stripped free of sex .
Call it the new Late - Putin Era Puritanism .
There 's something very interesting going on here .
Similar to the " have more babies " campaign out now , the key trend is first laid - out by the authorities .
The private sector then falls into line .
The problem here is that the message comes out as " have more babies , but have less sex " .
Maybe it's a classic case of conflicting agendas within various departments .
I first realized what was going on while in Kiev several weeks back .
I was driving past a billboard depicting a well - shaped young woman bending over in tight leopard - patterned hot pants .
The ad was for furniture .
It struck me that I had n't seen its Russian equivalent in a long time .
This is not a rubber .
And if it is , do n't talk about it .
To get what 's going on here , it helps to understand the way regulators approve advertising .
In Russia , there 's a committee that signs off on any ads that hit airwaves , billboards or magazines .
Each ad is scrutinized by individuals from this committee and can be rejected depending on a single member 's interpretation of guidelines , their mood , whatever .
What 's more , approval for these ads takes place after the ads are produced and submitted to media outlets for distribution and broadcast .
This means that an ad can be pulled from broadcast days before it 's scheduled to hit the airwaves .
Since sexual advertising seems lately to rub censors the wrong way , so to speak , it 's not surprising that advertisers have stayed clear of salacious themes .
If you 're spending $ 50,000 on a photo shoot or $ 200,000 on a TV spot , you 're not going to risk that money by giving a Late - Putin Puritan on the approval board a reason to reject your investment , well after the production money has been spent .
Instead , you will simply remove all sexual content at the creative stage .
With the trashy ads of the late 90s vanishing , I wistfully recall how several stretch ceiling manufacturers and distributors ( for some reason , this was a big thing for them back in the day ) used laughingly crude sexual content as a way to push their products .
One company had a series of outdoor adverts across Moscow that depicted a woman in a miniskirt climbing a step ladder to inspect a ceiling .
At the bottom of the ladder was a balding guy in a suit , checking out her action .
Nothing but nostalgia , now .
Even campaigns of an inherently sexual nature seem to have been neutered .
Condom manufacturers , for example , used the safe sex platform to both raise awareness for their product and educate the public about STDs .
Some AIDS prevention NGOs even went so far as to manufacture private - label condoms .
Last summer , the Moscow authorities decided to implement their own AIDS prevention PSAs , and plastered the city and airways with a Bush - esque abstention campaign .
The message ?
Using condoms is n't a way to prevent AIDS because condoms break .
The only way to prevent AIDS is to stop having sex altogether .
Most NGOs and condom advertisers curbed their advertising activities altogether after that .
Next to be hit were the gentlemen 's clubs , a battle still in progress .
This summer , the Duma held a vote in an attempt to outlaw any advertising for clubs that seem sexual in nature .
If passed , it would eliminate all advertising for strip joints , gentlemen 's clubs , VIP saunas , etc .
It is the logical culmination of a trend , the origins of which remain mysterious .
Only thing I can say is that I 'll be buying fewer stretch ceilings .

International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) rejected
the fast - track approval of the controversial
Microsoft - supported OOXML document format as an ISO standard
in a vote
on 2 September 2007 .
During the voting process the reputation of ISO as a dependable
technical standardization organization was questioned .
For example , in Sweden a Microsoft representative
was
caught offering to recompense partners for voting yes to OOXML .
Also a
sudden interest from
countries like Ivory Coast
to the OOXML issue has
been found suspicious .
We studied the relation between the corruption level
and voting behaviours of the countries .
We found that more corrupted the country is , the more likely it was to vote for
the unreserved acceptance of the OOXML standard proposal .
We used the [ Transparency
International ‘s ] 2006
CPI index
( Corruption Perceptions Index ) as a measure of corruption .
CPI index is a number between 1 and 10 .
A small CPI index means that the country is perceived to be very corrupted , while a large CPI index means that the country is perceived to have little corruption .
Haiti has the smallest CPI index of 1.8 , while the countries perceived having the least amount of corruption ( Finland , Iceland , New Zealand ) have a CPI index of 9.7 .
In barplots below the CPI index has been rounded down to the closest integer value .
ISO received a total of 87 votes , of which 70 was given either by the Secretariat country ( USA ) , participating members ( “ P Member ” ) or observers ( “ O Member ” ) ; in the graph below only these 70 votes are shown .
The votes are counted
according to the
complicated voting rules of ISO .
The remaining 17 countries – most of
which are perceived to be relatively corrupted ( median CPI index 3.0 ) – mostly supported the OOXML ( approval 13 , approval with comments 2 , abstention 2 , disapproval 0 ) .
Is this just a random coincidence ?
The median of the CPI index of the above mentioned 70 countries is 3.95 .
Of the most corrupted half ( CPI index less than 3.95 )
23 or 77 % voted for approval ( approval or approval with comments ) and 7 or 23 % for
disapproval ; 5 abstained .
Of the least corrupted half ( CPI index more than 3.95 )
13 or 54 % voted for approval and 11 or 46 % voted for disapproval ; 11 abstained – see the table below .
This statistics supports with a P value of 0.073 the hypothesis that the corrupted countries were more likely to vote for approval ( one - tailed Fisher ’s Exact Test ; two - tailed test would give
a P value of 0.092 ) .
In other words : if the probability of an approval vote would be independent
of the corruption level of the country , the probability of
a positive correlation of at least the observed magnitude
would be about 7 % .
Lots of corruption Little corruption Approval 23 13 Disapproval 7 11
One should be careful in interpreting the result , though .
For example , the statistical test does not naturally tell anything about the reason
of the relation between corruption level and voting behaviour of a country ;
in any case , whatever the reason for the correlation ,
also some quite uncorrupted countries voted
for the approval .
And although the trend is interesting and the results informative ,
the [ above ] conclusion is still not particularly
strong due to a relatively small number
of voting countries [ for a stronger statistical result with
a P value of 0.019 see the following 6 September addition : ] .
Added 6 September 2007 :
In hindsight , a natural choice for the statistical test would have been
the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test .
It is more powerful than the test described above
and it in fact gives stronger results :
The OOXML standard failed to pass , because only 17 ( 53 % ) out of 32 P - members were in favour of the standard ( 66.6 % would have been required ) ; and
because 18 ( 26 % ) out of 69
national body votes were negative ( at most 25 % would have been allowed ) .
The countries which are perceived to be more corrupt were more likely
to vote for the approval than the countries
perceived less corrupt ( P value of 0.085 in the P - member vote , P value of 0.019 in the national body vote , using
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test ; Fiji has been excluded because it has no CPI index ) – see the figures
of the votes .
Added 12 September 2007 :
A question raised , for example , in NOOOXML.org discussion about this article , was whether the new P - members were more likely to vote for approval .
According to
Groklaw , there were total of 11 new P signups
( Ivory Coast , Cyprus , Ecuador , Jamaica , Lebanon , Malta , Pakistan , Trinidad and Tobago , Turkey , Uruguay and Venezuela )
of which 9 voted for approval or approval with comments , 1 ( Ecuador ) for disapproval and 1 ( Trinidad and Tobago ) abstained .
Summarizing , in the P - member vote
the votes were divided accross new and old members as follows :
New P-member Old P-member Approval 9 ( 90 % ) 8 ( 36 % ) Disapproval 1 ( 10 % ) 14 ( 64 % )
We can conclude that the new P - members were more likely to vote for approval than the old P- members ( 90 % vs. 36 % respectively , P value of 0.0073 , Fisher ’s Exact Test ) .
There has been lots of discussion of the meaning of the results .
The fact is that of the countries perceived more corrupt larger fraction voted for OOXML , and of the countries perceived less corrupt smaller fraction voted for OOXML .
We can also state with a reasonable confidence that the countries perceived more corrupt were indeed more likely to vote for the OOXML than the less corrupt .
Similarly , we can conclude with a reasonable confidence that the new P - members were indeed more likely to vote for the approval of the OOXML than the old P - members .
As stated above , the statistics alone do not reveal the reason for the correlations .
However , the observed correlation cannot be dismissed because the reason for it is more difficult to establish than the correlation itself .
To find the reasons one should look behind the numbers : for example , why did countries like Ivory Coast find a sudden interest to ISO standards ?
Was what happened in Sweden just an isolated incident ?
What about other oddities ?
Even without CPI indices the issues raised elsewhere should be enough for the ISO and many national standards organizations to seriously re-examine the integrity their decision making processes .
[ 5 September 2007 : the interpretation of P value was corrected and comments of significance added ; corrected comment on voting process
( also the votes of non-members are counted in one part of the voting process ) ;

Appendix :
For the technically inclined
The data set is relatively easy to study using the attached CSV file of the voting results and
CPI indices .
Using freely available R ,
the Wilcoxon Rank Sum
Test yielding a P value of 0.019 can for example be obtained
as follows :
# Read in the data table : B <- read.csv ( " http://www.effi.org//wp-content/uploads/ooballot_0.txt " )
# CPI indices of the countries that voted for approval : capp <- B[!is.na( B[ , " CPI " ] ) & ( B[ , " Vote " ] == " Approval " | B[ , " Vote " ] == " Approval with comments " ) , " CPI " ]
# CPI indices of the countries that voted for disapproval : cdis <- B[!is.na( B[ , " CPI " ] ) & B[ , " Vote " ] == " Disapproval " , " CPI " ] #
Is there a relation between the CPI index and voting behaviour of a country ?
wilcox.test( capp,cdis ) # W = 281.5 , p-value = 0.01944 #
Make a nice figure of the result , containing votes of all national bodies # ( except Fiji which has no CPI index ) : x <- matrix ( c( table ( factor ( floor ( capp ) , levels =2:9 ) ) , table ( factor ( floor ( cdis ) , levels= 2:9 ) ) ) , nrow=2 , ncol=8 , byrow=TRUE , dimnames=list ( c ( " approval " , " disapproval " ) , 2:9 ) ) barplot( x , main = '" 18 negative votes out of 69 " ' , xlab= " lots of corruption « CPI » little corruption " , ylab = " national body votes ( except Fiji ) " , legend.text=c ( " approval " , " disapproval " ) )
It is easy to see from the
resulting figure
that the countries which are perceived to be more corrupt were indeed more likely
to vote for the approval of the proposed OOXML standard than the countries
perceived less corrupt , the observation which is also confirmed by the statistical test .

Jeroen Lapré is racing to complete his first independent film , Maelstrom II , in time for Sir Arthur C. Clarke 's 90th birthday .
He hopes to visit the great author at his home in Sri Lanka , unveil the completed film , and interview him about the future of humanity in space .
ILM employees can pitch their ideas to the management .
If the proposal is exciting enough , the artists are allowed to use company resources after hours , but they are not given any funding or time off from work .
Knowing that a key to his success would be simplicity , Lapré read through every story by Clarke in reverse chronological order until he found one with a minimum of characters , locations , and props – Maelstrom II .
When his proposal to make the short film was approved , he assembled a team of ILM veterans and procured the second - generation digital cameras that were used to film Star Wars Episode III .
Lapré has been a science fiction lover since early childhood .
His first love was the Star Wars
trilogy – years later he went to work for Industrial Light and Magic and contributed to all three prequels .
In 2001 , NASA scientist Jay
Trimble introduced Clarke and Lapré by email .
The young artist was thrilled .
He had been toying with the idea of making scientifically accurate and dramatically compelling short films .
After his correspondence with the legendary science fiction writer , Lapré was sure that his first solo project would be a story by Clarke .
Chuck Marra portrays the lead character , Cliff Leyland , a down - on - his - luck worker who hitches a ride on a freight capsule from the moon to earth in order to save money .
As the protagonist is catapulted homeward , power to the electromagnetic launcher fails – sending him into an unstable orbit around the moon .
Thus begins a race against time to save him before he crashes into the lunar surface .
In a rather poetic parallel to the story , Lapré is frantically trying to finish the digital effects and editing while searching for sponsors , working full time at ILM , and raising two kids .
We will have a gallery of high definition digital images from the film soon .
For the moment , here are some production stills from the Old C main stage at ILM 's Kerner facility .

Ever since the first banner ad found its way online , there has been a virtual arms race between ad placement technology and ad blocking .
The latest chapter in this ongoing saga revolves around Adblock Plus , an extension that can be integrated into the Firefox browser that essentially blocks all ads .
And in short , due to the fact that tools like this exist , several webmasters are now refusing to allow netizens to access their respective websites via a Firefox browser .
The New York Times recently weighed in on the issue as did Chris Soghoian of CNet , who suggested in part that ,
In the end , a few things are clear : Users of advertisement - skipping technology are essentially engaged in theft of resources .
There is nothing ethically or morally wrong with an ad - blocker .
It is no different than using any other technology to filter language or explicit content .
No one is being harmed nor has property been destroyed or stolen ( the owner was not deprived of their property ) .
Plain and simple : if you do not want to pay for the bandwidth and hosting charges , do n't put material online .
Just because you are trying to make a living does not mean anyone should partake in your business model .
After all , should everyone that visits your site be required to click on one of the ads ?
Furthermore , if you can't survive off an ad - based revenue model , try something else — like subscriptions — or perhaps find a different day job .
Addendum : I think there is a little confusion about my original post .
I was simply criticizing the notion that content theft was occurring and not criticizing the practice of blocking those with ad blockers ; there is nothing wrong with anti-blocker blocking .
Therefore it would be fallacious to think either group has the moral high - ground for their specific actions .

Let ’s face it : Ron Paul does n’t have a lot of new ideas .
His foreign policy harkens back to the very first President , George Washington .
George Washington , who gave up a dictatorship , given to him by the continental Congress to prosecute the revolutionary war , was crazy .
Washington was the original “ decider ” and gave up all of that power so that a bunch of politicians could meet and draft the Constitution .
That same tired old document to which Ron Paul keeps referring in speech after speech .
Now , if Washington would have just kept his dictatorship , he could have written the Constitution himself .
Think of all the good Washington could have done with the power he so cavalierly abandoned .
He could have taken over Canada .
Instead he advised us to avoid making promises to defend other nations in order that the U.S. would remain peaceful and the federal government would remain small .
That idea actually was original at the time .
I mean , if you think George Washington was crazy , you should have seen his contemporaries in Europe .
They made alliances all the time .
They made wars all the time too .
Probably because the Royal leaders in Europe were all related .
You think you have mother - in - law problems .
George Washington was wise to figure this out 211 years ago .
But that was 211 years ago .
Not original in 2007 .
Presidents really did n’t start to realize how important it was to have a grand vision and original ideas until Lincoln .
Lincoln was not a handsome man and I think he may have been a little jealous of Washington ’s dictatorship and his good looks .
Whether it was the affects of syphilis or the fact that he was a lawyer , he definitely thought outside the box .
He could have done what Dr. Paul does by studying the constitution and the words of those who drafted it .
However , he did n’t want to seem unoriginal .
It did n’t matter to him that the founders believed secession was a valid , non-violent response to tyranny .
It did n’t matter to him that 600,000 Americans had to die in order for his ideas to come to fruition .
Lincoln ’s originality is unsurpassed .
No President since has managed responsibility for so many deaths .
In fact , his record may never be surpassed if you stick to Americans killed in war .
All of the other forty - two Presidents before and after him have n’t managed to combine for his record .
This must be a bitter pill for them .
Wilson was another visionary though he also fell short of Lincoln .
Wilson made the world “ safe for democracy . ”
He was one of the first President ’s to go to war to make an idea safe .
He also made U.S. monetary policy safe for the Federal Reserve by signing the Federal Reserve Act .
He made America safe from freedom by signing the income tax .
His pice de rsistance was the Treaty of Versailles .
Very original idea in foreign affairs .
The treaty was so punitive it put things in motion for WWII .
The Germans apparently got a bit upset when the French marched into Germany and confiscated goods directly from German factories as a means to collect reparations .
Later , in WWII , France was attacked and occupied by Germany .
The French Politicians claimed it was because Germans hated them for their wine but Ron Paul calls this sort of thing “ blowback . "
I think he got that word from the CIA and did n’t make it up .
Our current President makes up lots of words because he ’s smart and original .
By Franklin Delano Roosevelt , we start getting into the unoriginal category .
FDR promised he would n’t get the U.S. in war but did a lot of things to get the U.S. in a war .
He did this covertly .
FDR did have some truly original ideas .
One was that an economic depression can be reversed by increasing taxes and redistributing that money to people who do n’t have jobs .
Shifting production from the private sector to government was extremely original .
Internment camps not so much .
The American Indians probably could tell you this was an old idea .
You need to be careful when choosing who you ’ll support .
Original ideas are important .
Tom Tancredo has some intriguing and original ideas lately as does Barack Obama .
Tancredo thinks we should bomb Mecca in a virtual “ neener neener neener ” — letting the terrorists know who ’s really the boss of the world .
Now that ’s original .
At least as far as President ’s go .
When I was in 5th grade , a boy playing kickball said something like that but he was talking about whose dad could beat up whose and I do n’t think Tancredo is the right age to have been there to overhear it .
I ’ll have to give him the benefit of the doubt .
Obama says we should just march into Pakistan and get Osama bin Laden whether Musharraf likes it or not .
Again , I do n’t remember Obama being at my elementary school .
He probably went to a private school where those kinds of conversations did n’t occur .
I had to go to public school and they happened all the time , let me tell you .
Bush is pretty original too .
I mean , if you accept that he actually has ideas and is n’t remotely controlled through a chip implanted in his brain by Dick Cheney ’s physicians , then you have to credit him with some very original ideas .
Where Wilson made the world safe for an idea , Bush put a different perspective on it and made war on an idea .
Where FDR promised against war and covertly involved the US in a war , Bush promised not to involve us in nation building but then blatantly reversed that stance shortly before his second - term campaign .
Not only was it original , it was ballsy .
The most original idea Bush has professed is the one about pre-emptive war .
It ’s hard to say if it ’s his idea but I ’m certain he ’s jealous of Washington because he calls himself the decider .
He ’s vying for a Lincoln - esque legacy by using up the last of the original ideas .
Ron Paul may sound different then the current crop of Republican candidates , and the current President , but really he ’s not very original .
In fact , he sounds like Bob Taft who most of us would n’t know about but for Ron Paul ’s incessant referrals to historical figures .
Ron Paul would turn back the clock on many original ideas put forth by past Presidents .
Wilson ’s income tax ?
Gone .
The Iraq war and pre-emptive war , the two Bush additions to original Presidential thought gone as well .
The department of Education ?
Homeland Security ?
Welfare ?
All Gone .
No original idea would be spared from the boring veto pen of a Paul presidency .
The Best of Rick Fisk
Ca n't a guy change his website without people suddenly asking questions about it ?
Well , if you 're the billionaire mayor of the country 's largest city who may or may not have presidential / gubernatorial leanings , then no .
And not when he announces to to the press , either .
Mayor Bloomberg 's mikebloomberg.com website , which had most recently been his mayoral election and re-election site , underwent a makeover that emphasizes all of his initiatives .
The mayor told the press , " This new Web site is the single place where people can go to find out what I ’ve done not only in government , but in business and philanthropy as well . "
You can visit the site yourself , but this NY Times description is on the nose : Visitors " will find celebratory images of the mayor holding children and smiling amid a receptive public . "
Not to mention links to coverage about it in major national publications , like Time , Fortune , and Newsweek .
The Mayor still denies he 's running for higher office , and his people say that he simply wanted to have a site to show " all parts of his life , " it 's funny that the Mayor needs PR firm Rubenstein Communications to let people know .
And everyone else thinks the site smells of 2008 :
From the Daily News :
Hank Sheinkopf , a political consultant , said the Web site is a clear sign that Bloomberg is " seriously testing " the waters for a potential 2008 White House bid .
" The purpose is without question to keep people guessing and to see how the public reacts , " Sheinkopf said .
" In politics , when people are serious , they do n't do things by accident . "
Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion , said there 's no question Bloomberg is " keeping his options open . "
" He 's saying he 's going to go into philanthropy , but some of his words and actions belie that , " Miringoff said .
" Speculation will only continue to grow . "
From the AP :
" It 's clearly a campaign Web site .
All that 's missing is the office [ he 's seeking ] , " said Baruch College political science professor Doug Muzzio .
" The question is , is he running for office or is he just pushing an agenda ?
I think for now , he 's just pushing an agenda , but certainly the intent is to keep the presidential discussion alive . "
" He 's been very good at saying , ' No , no , no ' while continuing to tweak us about the possibility , " Muzzio said .
" The Web site does n't say ' Mike Bloomberg for President , ' but whatever this is , it 's the start of something . "
From the NY Times :
“ It looks to me like the precursor of an independent bid for the presidency , ” said George Arzt , a consultant and veteran of city politics .
“ He hits all the hot - button domestic issues : housing , economy , poverty , education . ”
From the NY Sun :
" The only thing missing is a sign up sheet ! " the campaign manager of Vice President Gore 's 2000 presidential bid , Donna Brazile , said via e-mail after looking at Mr. Bloomberg 's new site .
We 'll know he 's serious about running if he starts a Twitter account .
Iraq 's Kurds expressed satisfaction yesterday at the death of Saddam Hussein , but their joy was tempered with disappointment that their greatest tormentor would never face justice for what he had done to them .
Saddam had been standing trial in a second case on charges of genocide against the Kurds during the Anfal campaign in the late 1980s , during which more than 4,000 villages were destroyed and more than 100,000 people killed in a series of military sweeps in the Kurdistan region that included the regular use of chemical weapons .
The former dictator was also due to face separate charges over the gas attack on Halabja in March 1988 that killed 5,000 Kurds .
Sources at the special tribunal trying Saddam and six members of his former regime in the Anfal trial said yesterday that proceedings would resume on January 8 .
The remaining defendants are Ali Hassan Majid , known as Chemical Ali , a cousin of Saddam , described by Kurds as the evil face of the Anfal campaign ; Sultan Hashim Ahmad Jabburi Tai , former defence minister ; Sabir Abdul Aziz Douri , director of military intelligence ; Hussein Rashid Mohammed , a senior military officer ; Taher Tawfiq Ani , former governor of Nineveh province ; and Farhan Mutlaq Jubouri , head of military intelligence in northern Iraq .
Under Iraqi law , all outstanding charges against an executed person must be dropped .
Without the interest that would be caused by the presence of the chief defendant , Kurds fear that their past suffering will attract less attention from fellow Iraqis and the international community .
A spokesman for the Kurdish president , Massoud Barzani , said : " We hope that Saddam 's execution will lead to a new chapter among the Iraqi people , and to ending innocent people 's sufferings . "
But he added : " We also wish that the execution not be used as an excuse to ignore the documentation of the enormous crimes committed against the Kurds . "
" How can I be sad that the tyrant is gone ?
It is like a dream come true for the survivors in my family , " said Herro Mahmoud , a primary school teacher in Sulaymaniyah who lost her father and uncle to the Anfal ( which means spoils of war ) .
" But I think they should have waited until the other cases had been heard , and all the scale of the other atrocities would be known . "
Other Kurds said they felt cheated .
" Saddam was hanged for the murder of 148 people in Dujail .
But why wo n't he face the court for killing hundreds of thousands of Kurds ?
Do our dead and our traumatised people not deserve to be honoured ? " said Bijar Ahmed , an English student at the university of Koi Sanjaq .
Mahmoud Othman , a prominent Kurdish MP in Baghdad who survived several assassination attempts by the former regime , criticised the Iraqi government 's apparent rush to carry out the death sentence before the end of the Anfal trial .
" It was very important to keep him alive so that we could know the full details of what happened during all the atrocities that were committed , " he said .
" We need to know how and why he did what he did and who helped him , by providing political and material support to his regime . "
Saddam had taken many secrets to his grave , he said , including vital knowledge about " the foreign companies and countries that supplied the parts and expertise to make chemical weapons . "

After two encores of the performance , rain dispersed the protest , which then moved to Elizabeth Street , outside the Sheraton on the Park hotel , where witnesses said protesters blocked an APEC motorcade .
Protesters took to the streets before police officers forcibly pushed people off the road , yelling : " Move , get off the road . "
Around 200 protesters lined both sides of Elizabeth Street and played blaring music , as police on bicycles stood watch .
Barely minutes after many in the crowd moved towards the hotel , a helicopter swooped over the scene while a bus delivered an additional 20 police officers .
Protesters , carrying placards reading " Sign Kyoto , you wankers " , cheered and clapped , chanting " Bush , Howard , USA , how many kids did you kill today ? "
Police could not immediately confirm the reports that protesters had hindered a motorcade .
At the Bums for Bush protest , organiser Will Saunders said while the protest did not approach the mooning world record - 2000 people , or 4000 cheeks - it was enjoyed by all .
" Just because you feel strongly about an issue does n't mean you can't laugh about it , '' Mr Saunders said .
" There 's many ways of making a point , ( this is ) the Australian way . "
The protest also involved a 21 - bum salute to the 21 countries in APEC , some spelling out " bums not bombs " .
High school students Ben Leffley and Daniel Holmes travelled for three hours from Lithgow , west of the NSW Blue Mountains , to attend the rally .
Mr Leffley , 18 , said the war in Iraq was the biggest motivation for him to join the protest , and he did not believe mooning was the best way to oppose it .
" We 've come here because we really believe what George Bush and John Howard are doing is not right , " he said .
''( The protest ) was good , though probably not the most effective way . ''
But Mr Holmes , 17 , said mooning was an excellent way of attracting attention to a cause .
" It may be somewhat symbolic but it 's more the fact that it 's raising awareness ... people are going to want to find out why we 're showing our arses and that will raise awareness , " he said .

Alexander Kaiser , Ph.D. , of Midwestern University ’s Department of Physiology , Division of Basic Sciences , was the lead author in a recent study to help determine why insects , once dramatically larger than they are today , have seen such a remarkable reduction in size over the course of history .
“ There were hundreds of ideas to explain the small size , but none of them could be proven , ” Dr. Kaiser said .
To test their theory that it was an insect ’s respiratory system that limited its size , he and his colleagues launched an extensive study using beetles and fruit flies .
The study , much of which was performed at Illinois ’ Argonne National Laboratory , involved the examination of various beetles ’ respiratory systems , using new x-ray beam technology to help determine how they breathe .
Findings show that Dr. Kaiser and his colleagues are on the right track in their theorizing .
Insects breathe through a network of air filled tubes that deliver oxygen directly to the cells .
These tracheal tubes , especially in the leg , take up more room in larger beetles .
“ More than 300 million years ago , there was 31 to 35 percent oxygen in the air , ” Dr. Kaiser said .
“ That means that the respiratory systems of the insects could be smaller and still deliver enough oxygen to meet their demands , allowing the creatures to grow much larger . ”
Dr. Kaiser and his team plan to conduct similar studies in the future using more ancient species such as dragonflies , since beetles and fruit flies are considered relatively “ new ” species in comparison .
It 's a nice coincidence that Paprika opens on June 15th , since it's my birthday , and really , one could n't ask for a better birthday present .

Paprika is the latest vision from the fevered brain of Japanese anime director Satoshi Kon , whose vivid imaginings spawned the films Perfect Blue , Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers ( a gentle nod to the latter is slipped in at the very end of Paprika ) .
After the plodding stupidity of so much recent animation ( Shrek et al ) , Paprika has the ease and fluidity of pure movement .
It is so mercury - quick , gleaming and sleek , that while watching it , you too want to shuck off your heavy flesh and become weightless .
The film wastes little time in preamble , it plunges you directly into the middle of a dream that begins with a sinister circus and ends with a man falling through space .
The central character in Paprika is , naturally enough , Paprika , a fox - coloured slip of a creature , who acts as a type of dream therapist .
With the aid of a device called the DC Mini , Paprika enters sleeping minds and unravels the mysteries therein .
She is one - part dream warrior to two - parts digital pixie , with an easy manner and the earthy good sense of a Yiddish grandmother .
Paprika 's special skills have been enlisted to help a hard - nosed detective named Konakawa ( Akio Ohtsuka ) , who is plagued by a reoccurring nightmare in which he endlessly chases a phantom man through different movies : a spy film , a romance , and a Tarzan flick .
The dream always ends in an anonymous hallway with a falling man ; the final scene is from a murder that Konakawa failed to solve .
Or is it ?
These startling first moments are a pure giddy delight .
Watching it , I felt a stupid smile attach itself to my face , and there it stayed for the duration .
The ' Dream Team '
After her session with the cop , Paprika zooms off into the land of nod , and the sun comes up on a woman who is the seeming opposite of our will - o- the - wisp heroine .
Dr. Atsuko Chiba ( Megumi Hayashibara ) is a scientist with a great deal of interest in dreams .
But unlike Paprika , Dr. Chiba 's polar demeanor is such that a chill seems to follow her into the room .
Dr. Chiba and her colleague , Dr. Kosaku Tokita ( Toru Furuya ) work for a mysterious research lab that developed the DC Mini .
As a pair , they could n't be more different : as goofily innocent as Dr. Chiba is severe , Dr. Tokita 's huge rounded body is the physical opposite of Dr. Chiba 's thin hard figure .
On her way to the lab , Dr. Chiba must first rescue Dr. Tokita , who has become lodged in an elevator , but that is the least of their problems ; someone has stolen three DC Minis .
The theft was apparently an inside job and the guilt falls on a member of the research lab who has mysteriously vanished .
Worse still , whoever has stolen the machines is using them to wreak havoc by mixing reality and dreams .
A fact that is made amply clear when the third member of their dream team , Dr. Torataro Shima ( Katsunosuke Hori ) suddenly goes stark raving mad .
' Candy - coloured insanity '
In an instant the film dives deep into the vision that sent Dr. Shima leaping off a building .
In his dream , an enormous parade , full of every imaginable object -- refrigerators and frogs , dolls and toaster ovens -- is marching across the countryside .
It is the parade of kitsch , of pop culture icons , and plastic junk , consumer culture 's endless appetite for stuff made flesh .
Each item is saluting the sky like some demented vision of Leni Riefenstahl , as if the ultimate fascist movement is that of stuff , of images and ideas , co-opted and used to sell more stuff .
It is oddly thrilling to watch this candy - coloured insanity marching resolutely onward .
In Paprika 's veritable sea of imagery , it is the single most arresting notion in the entire film , and as the narrative loops back to it , it only grows in power .
While Dr. Chiba and Dr. Tokita 's desperate search for the DC Mini continues , the thin membrane between flesh , machinery and fantasy dissolves and the cycle of madness expands .
The device was actually the brainchild of Dr. Tokita , but even he does n't really understand how this dream machine actually works .
Soon enough ordinary people are partaking of a mass delusion , as the junk parade consumes everything in its path .
A 'molotov cocktail of acid and speed '
Meanwhile , Konakawa is on a personal quest to solve the mystery of his mind - forged manacles .
Apparently the detective is hiding something from himself , and it has more to do with movies than he cares to admit .
Another date with Paprika ends up in a movie theatre , where Konakawa describes the nature of film language , ( pan focus , crossing the axis etc . ) .
It 's a moment of self - reflexivity , a film within a film , within a cartoon , that speaks to the different layers all taking place at the same moment .
Before he became a cop , Konakawa was a film student , but an early betrayal made his abandon his chosen career .
It 's only when he stops denying his buried love that things can move forward .
The same thing is also happening to Dr. Chiba , who has been keeping a number of secrets from herself .
Desire , however curious or odd , cannot be thwarted by mere reason , and in dreams it works its magic full - force .
As the action gets bigger and wilder , like Alice in Wonderland on a Molotov cocktail of acid and speed , it becomes difficult to hold on to one single plotline .
There are a number of simultaneous narrative streams functioning on different planes of existence ( dreams , the Internet , movies ) .
Indeed , it 's often hard to know where to rest your eyes .
The sheer density of visual information is overwhelming ; it 's an embarrassment of riches .
But maybe that 's the idea .
If the dangers posed by the continued deluge of information are the subtext of Paprika , the all - devouring parade of junk makes this notion explicit ; its jolly madness is all the more sinister for being so mundane .
Every item is something that is intimately familiar -- whether it's the Statue of Liberty or Mickey Mouse .
But it 's the sheer amount of stuff that clots your brain and threatens to subsume you .
Several times in the film , the point is made that dreams are the one place that the mind can roam free , that they are the last place where there are no rules .
In colonizing this place , the human spirit is commercialized , hollowed out and filled with garbage .
But even these ideas are offered up lightly .
Before you 've had time to register the social critique , the film whacks you upside the head with another barrage of sound and colour , and you drown .
A ' distinctly modern ' combination
In navigating the slippery layers of reality , nothing is quite as adept as animation .
Like a gleaming silver fish , the drawn image can leap from water to air and back again with liquid grace .
So too , Paprika merges multiple media into one fluid whole .
There is something distinctly modern in this combination of ideas and technology .
It 's something that the Facebook , millennial generation can also do with disarming ease -- exist simultaneously in a variety of different medium .
Even while they 're talking to you , they can be text messaging , checking their email , and watching a film on their cell phones .
This level of multitasking can sometimes be disconcerting to people raised on only one type of reality , but it points out the continued evolution of the human mind .
At the heart of the film is n't the conflict between science and fantasy , nor even commodification and freedom , but the intractability of love .
Love persists like dreams themselves ; try to squash it and it slips away , hiding in the deepest pools inside your brain , waiting for the right moment to resurface .
Love always finds a way to come slipping out sideways , staging sabotage attacks on your rational mind .
In the end , both Dr. Chiba and detective Konakawa surrender to passion , whether it's love of film or the plain old romantic stuff .
Paprika has the curious effect of making you feel strangely happy afterwards , as if some internal load you had n't even realized you were carrying is suddenly lifted .
It sings .
Go see it , even if it 's not your birthday , you might feel like it is .
Paprika opens today at Cinemark Tinseltown in Vancouver .

Yes , they serve at the pleasure of the President , but he can't ( as is becoming clearer and clearer ) single out and fire attorneys who are prosecuting cases he does n't want them to be prosecuting or because the perception is that they are not loyal enough to the President , rather than the Rule of Law .
That 's why the administration is lying about the true motivations behind the purge and that 's why they did n't just come out at the very beginning and say they wanted to give other people the opportunity to serve .
It 's not a question of whether the President has the authority to fire USAs ( he clearly does ) ; it 's about why he fired them and what reason he gave for doing so .
Are the wingnuts really that dense ?
Or do their jobs just depend on carrying water for these people regardless of the facts ?
The tongue is a wonderful thing .
It allows you to taste , talk , and â€¦ touch .
Some people are just naturally more skilled with their tongue than most and we are going to showcase some of that talent .
This asian girl has fantastic talent with her tongue , especially the last bit :

High Level Debate Stalled Syria Air Strike U.S. officials say flawed Iraqi intelligence led to caution on this situation .
Oct. 5 , 2007  --
The September Israeli airstrike on a suspected nuclear site in Syria had been in the works for months , ABC News has learned , and was delayed only at the strong urging of the United States .
In early July the Israelis presented the United States with satellite imagery that they said showed a nuclear facility in Syria .
They had additional evidence that they said showed that some of the technology was supplied by North Korea .
One U.S. official told ABC's Martha Raddatz the material was " jaw dropping " because it raised questions as to why U.S. intelligence had not previously picked up on the facility .
Officials said that the facility had likely been there for months if not years .
" Israel tends to be very thorough about its intelligence coverage , particularly when it takes a major military step , so they would not have acted without data from several sources , " said ABC military consultant Tony Cordesman .
U.S. Cautious After Flawed Iraq Intelligence
A senior U.S. official said the Israelis planned to strike during the week of July 14 and in secret high - level meetings American officials argued over how to respond to the intelligence .
Some in the administration supported the Israeli action , but others , notably Sect. of State Condoleeza Rice did not .
One senior official said the U.S. convinced the Israelis to " confront Syria before attacking . "
Officials said they were concerned about the impact an attack on Syria would have on the region .
And given the profound consequences of the flawed intelligence in Iraq , the U.S. wanted to be absolutely certain the intelligence was accurate .
Initially , administration officials convinced the Israelis to call off the July strike .
But in September the Israelis feared that news of the site was about to leak and went ahead with the strike despite U.S. concerns .
The airstrike was so highly classified , President Bush refused to acknowledge it publicly even after the bombs fell .
ABC 's Martha Raddatz filed this report for " World News With Charles Gibson . "
To build off last night 's post about the MacBook Pro that survived a mugging and gunshot , an anonymous source at a major US news organization sent in his photos of a Titanium Powerbook that came under fire in Tekrit , Iraq and survived to tell the tale .
The first image , taken just after the shot went through an armored Humvee and the Pelican Case .
For the rest of the story , click through .
The bullet missed the Lacie external drive but hits the edge of the Powerbook 's display .
Peep the ballistics – right into the edge .
The laptop continued to work fine for years – including the screen .
Thanks , anonymous tipster !
Emergency Services Hack Gets Teen Arrested
Authorities used computer forensics to find and arrest a teenager who allegedly made a false 911 call that resulted in a homeowner staring into the barrels of a SWAT team 's assault rifles .
Around midnight on the evening of March 29 , 2007 , a Lake Forest , Calif. , man awoke to the sound of what he took to be a prowler .
Concerned for the safety of his wife and two toddlers , he armed himself with a kitchen knife and stepped into his back yard to find himself staring into the barrels of a SWAT team 's assault rifles .
The man and his wife were both handcuffed at gunpoint and held until the SWAT team determined that the report that brought them to the house -- a call that claimed someone had been shot and killed in the house and that further killing would take place -- was a prank .
This incident is described in a statement issued by Tony Rackauckas , District Attorney for Orange County , Calif. , which says that the alleged perpetrator of the prank , Randall Ellis , 19 , of Mulkiteo , Wash . , was arrested last week though the use of forensic computer technology and is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday in Santa Ana , Calif .
A spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney declined to provide more details about the investigation .
Ellis is charged with one felony count of computer access and fraud , two felony counts of false imprisonment by violence , one misdemeanor count of falsely reporting a crime , and two felony counts of assault with an assault weapon by proxy .
The assault by proxy charge represents an attempt to hold the defendant responsible for initiating the series of actions that put the victims of the prank at gunpoint .
Ellis allegedly hacked into the 911 system in Orange County from his home in Washington .
Having allegedly chosen the Lake Forest couple at random and obtained their names by calling their home , Ellis is believed to have placed a fake call to an Orange Country emergency operator claiming that someone had been shot at the couple 's home and threatening further violence .
Ellis is also accused of making similar prank calls to 911 systems in Arizona , Pennsylvania , and Washington .
We welcome your comments on this topic on our social media channels , or [ contact us directly ] with questions about the site .
Regular readers of this site know my opinion about computers counting elections .
But so that my position is clear to all new readers I 'll make it simple .
The only condition under which I would even think of giving any credibility to an election of any type that was counted on a computer would be with a manual validation of the results immediately after the election of a sufficient quantity of randomly chosen voted paper ballots ( which eliminates touchscreen voting all together ) to determine the accuracy of the computer reported results .
I could get more detailed but it really is n't that difficult .
Arizona just passed emergency legislation for the 2006 election addressing this very issue .
But I had to sue to get them to even pretend to implement the law while I was running for Secretary of State to bring attention to this issue , and there are still lawsuits pending in Arizona that will have many election officials having to stay after school when it is all over .
I know all of the bullet points given to those on the front lines by the puppet masters and I can tell when I am being bullshitted just like most Americans can .
For days I have been following up on leads given me by election integrity activists and GOP activists her in Iowa that have been directed to me on this issue or I to them .
I have seen the wide support for the Ron Paul campaign but I know what is going to happen .
The Military Industrial New World Empire Order of ( fill in the blank here ) will not allow the people to deny them the ability to finish with the largest bank robbery of all history , ... In My Not So Humble Opinion .
I just talked to Aaron Russo today ( his battle with cancer continues , warm thoughts and prayers are due him for his efforts and accomplishments ) , Aaron Russo is the producer of the movie " America : From Freedom to Fascism " .
I 've known Aaron for years and he has been committed to sharing what he believes is at the core of what has gone wrong in America .
I called him today to share with him what i have witnessed across the country as I travel for the RonPaulRevolution .
In every city I 've been in where Dr. Paul speaks in several states , the most cheered position of Ron Paul is the elimination of the Federal Reserve .
Even more than the Iraqi War issue ( a close second , ... but still clearly second ) .
This has been a surprise to many first timers to these events .
I started to notice it when it was pointed out to me at the Las Vegas Rally in early July .
Last night in Fairfield , Iowa I heard the same response from hundreds of people living in the middle of a state with nothing but cornfields around them as far as the eye can see .
I think Aaron and Dr. Paul , and many others that understand what has happened to America , are right , the most productive country in all human history has been plundered to the bone and it is time for another r3VOLution .
Aaron 's movie has doe exactly what he had hoped .
It has provided an historical record of what has happened , how and the all important WHY .
The courage of Congressman Ron Paul to be even a small part of the film , long before he made the decision to run for president , is just another testament of his character .
His willingness to take on the biggest and the baddest is the trait most required in a any type of revolution .
I want to take this opportunity thank both men for what they have already done .
Aaron , you have already accomplished what you set out to do .
You were were right to take on this project and see it through .
You will live forever in the hearts of those that understand how important it was to help educate so many that were needed .
Thank you !
But I am of the opinion that the bad guys have no intention of " playing fair " .
I am amazed at the resistance to the idea that the same people that would wage needless wars , spy on innocent people , steal property , counterfeit money ( to name but a few things ) in an ever increasing spiral of domination and plunder , would somehow be ethically restrained from committing the election fraud that helped make it all possible .
I am very comfortable sharing my opinion about the Iowa Straw Poll being held this Saturday , August 11th 2007 ..... ' If the ' bad guys ' _can_ get away with reporting results that show less support for Ron Paul than is really there , _they will_!'
I did my best to determine the method of validationg the election results and could get no " official " response until today .
Mary Tiffany is the Iowa State GOP Communications Director .
After finally getting her on the phone and introducing myself as a visiting radio talk show host from Phoenix she was kind enough to take my questions seriously and promised to get back to me today .
I had planed to arrive at their downtown office in Des Moines should she not call me by 4:30 pm Iowa time .
I was on my way to the Iowa State GOP HQ when I received Mary 's call at 4:35 pm .
She was clear and straight to the point .
Each campaign was welcome to have representatives witness the feeding of the paper ballots into the counting computers but that there would not be a manual count of any kind .
I then asked what would happen to the original paper ballots .
She asked me to hold for a moment while she checked .
In our earlier phone conversation she said that I needed to talk to " Eric " the Iowa State GOP 's Political Director so I can only imagine she was likely getting directions from him .
She came back on the line to say that the paper ballots would remain with the machines and would not elaborate further .
I asked if the paper would be destroyed and she would not / could not answer .
So there you have it .
The same machines that California just decertified 3 days ago and Florida is in the spot light about as well , are going to be used to determine the future of the very people behind the computer printouts for the election results .
It has become very clear to me why a small state like Iowa is made the first state .
The local party charges $ 35 for _any_
Iowan that is old enough to vote in the 2008 election to cast a ballot .
This fundraiser for the Iowa GOP is worth millions in direct and indirect revenue for the GOP here and the businessmen and rocking the boat that brought the money is n't going to happen .
So what should be done ?
I am of the opinion that the education of the people of Iowa and the country has already started to happen and the net benefit for the revolution is worth all of the effort no matter what is reported by the Live Free or Diebold Computers .
But I encourage us all not to be deterred by a muted result of the people 's voice .
The Bad Guys hear us and they are very worried that their time is near an end .
But their fear also makes them very dangerous in too many ways to count .
So the only advice I have is for us to keep doing exactly what we have been doing , ... ignoring them .
Their rigged polling , their rigged elections , their bias media , their fearmongering and warmongering are all signs of defeat and I am very encouraged by the awareness of most of the activist supporting Ron Paul .
However , there are still some that seek some kind of sanction from the very people that would suffer greatly from a Ron Paul presidency , ...
Why ?
Their opinion matters to me far less than almost any Junior High School student .
Heck , ... it'll likely be an 8th grader with some inside information and a Blog that will be the final straw that breaks through the mind fog of an entire generation .
For those of you that have not been to an event where hundreds show up with only 24 - 48 hours notice of a Ron Paul appearance that has every demographic represented , I encourage you to go to one when you have a chance .
You 'll understand that you are already free , ... you just have to work to make certain that the Bad Guys realize it , ...
Heh , I did n't say it'd be easy , nothing worth while is .

The World ’s smallest one person helicopter
by Dhiram Shah
Sean Connery using a Jet Pack to escape from the bad guys in the 007 flick “ Thunderball ” was cool , after seeing something like that everyone of us must have thought if only … .
Here is a more practical and comfortable alternative , the GEN H - 4 from Gene corporation – Japan is your personal helicopter .
It comes with a seat and landing gear so all you have to do is strap on and you are ready to go .
Unlike traditional helicopters it has 2 sets of coaxial , contra- rotating rotors ( KA - 52 Hokum for all you military buffs ) which eliminates the need of a tail rotor for balancing .
The rotors have a length of only 4 meters ( 118 inches ) so no parking problems too .
It is powered by 4 lightweight 125 cc 2 cylinder engines which use standard gasoline .
The GEN H - 4 can fly to a maximum altitude of 1000 meters at a top speed of 90 km / hr ( 59 mph ) for upto 30 minutes .
You dont require a license to fly the GEN H - 4 in Japan and the inventors claim it is easy as riding a bicycle and with just 2 hours of practice you can master it .
The controls also resemble a bicycle handle .
( Images and Video after the jump )
You dont get the GEN H - 4 as a ready unit , Gene corp is selling it as assembly kits .
It is available in Japan for 3,780,000 Yen ( $ 32,500 ) .
Bicycle like controls are easy to use .
Props to Dr. Joao Freire from Brazil for the video .
AceCraft is the licensed distributor in the US and sells the GEN H - 4 for $ 30,000 .
