A vote to bail out foreign bankers will defeat her in 2010
Kirkpatrick was one of eight House Democrats who opposed a bill ( HR 1664 ) to limit the payment of bonuses to employees of companies that receive federal aid under so - called “ bailout ” legislation .
She was one of three Democrats who voted against a bill ( HR 1728 ) aimed at overhauling mortgage lending practices and curbing what supporters describe as “ predatory ” lending practices -- but which opponents described as over - regulation .
“ We have three districts , two of which are Republican districts that are held by Democrats , one of which is a slightly Democrat district that is held by a Democrat , but it ’s a very conservative district , ” Pullen said , referring to Arizona seats held by Democrat Reps .
Gabrielle Giffords , Harry Mitchell and Ann Kirkpatrick , all of whom will be Republican targets in 2010 .
“ We have some opportunities , I think , in Arizona . ”
Giffords has drawn an early challenger , while Mitchell will face the winner of what is so far a two - way primary .
Arizona Republicans hope to woo State Rep. Bill Konopnicki , who flirted with a bid in 2008 , to run against Kirkpatrick .
“ I hope he does ( run ) .
I think he ’ll be a great candidate , ” Pullen said of Konopnicki .
“ I think he held off last time because he realized it was just a really tough environment for Republicans in 2008 . ”
Pullen said he had spoken with Konopnicki several times , and that he expects a formal decision within four or five weeks .
If there be in our midst one low , sordid , vulgar soul ... one tongue leprous with slander ; one mouth which is like unto a den of foul beasts giving forth deadly odors ; if there be one character which , while blotched and spotted all over , yet raves and rants and blackguards like a prostitute ; if there be one bold , bad , empty , bellowing demagogue , it is the gentleman from Illinois . "
Last year there were few primary races anywhere in America with as marked a contrast between an excellent candidate and a completely unqualified one as in the race for the open seat in Arizona 's vast 1st CD .
Howard Shanker was the progressive grassroots candidate and the Establishment mediocrity was now Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick .
As a member of Congress Kirkpatrick has proven what was obvious to any observer -- residents of AZ - 01 still have the least effective representation of anyplace in America .
Like other right - wing , corporate shills , Kirkpatrick calls her abysmal Republican voting record " independent . "
" Independent of Democratic principles and values " would be a better way to describe it .
As this morning ' sexplained : Basically whenever it comes to a choice between working families and her big corporate donors , Kirkpatrick crosses the aisle and votes with the GOP in favor of the corporate special interests that have devastated the country 's-- and her constituents '-- finances .
Washington observers consider her to be one of the most dimwitted and ineffective members of Congress and a complete waste of a seat .
The only positive thing we 've ever heard about her from anyone was that she dresses neatly every day and that she 's not a crook like her predecessor , Rick Renzi -- although she does tend to vote almost exactly like him .
Renzi's still waiting trial on multiple corruption , fraud and money - laundering charges but Kirkpatrick is carrying on his tradition of unresponsive and incompetent representation for Arizona .
" She 's definitely the weakest member of the delegation , " one staffer told us today .
" She was well - financed though and the DCCC was pushing her .
" The upside of the DCCC push is that she owes them -- big time .
The party never asks her to compromise her " independence " and let 's her vote with the GOP whenever she likes -- which is almost always , at least when it comes to contentious , substantive legislation .
But this week is different .
This week , Kirkpatrick is being forced to vote for a $ 108 billion bailout for European bankers .
It 's a vote most observers in Arizona politics say will cost her her seat .
But this is one the powers inside the Democratic Party -- particularly Rahm Emanuel , Obama 's Karl Rove -- are demanding .
Kirkpatrick does n't have the nerve to defy him .
She joined the reactionary Blue Dog caucus as soon as she was elected and claims to be against massive government spending programs .
Although Emanuel has attempted to wrap this one up in pretty bows and disguise it as support for our troops and for the car industry , the $ 108 billion bailout for foreign banks has caused John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) , Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) , to join Raul Grijalva ( D - AZ ) in opposing the bill .
The Republican party has been targeting her as a tool of Nancy Pelosi .
It is n't true and it has n't stuck .
But with her vote for the European bank bailout that Pelosi is pushing this week , it will stick -- and stick hard enough to defeat Kirkpatrick in 2010 .
Sources close to state Rep. Bill Konopnicki , the NRCC's # 1 choice to run against her , say that if Kirkpatrick votes for the bailout , as expected , Konopnicki will jump into the race because it's an issue he can win with , easily .
Randy Pullen and his family have donated many thousands of dollars to Arizona Republicans and Pullen has recently become the treasurer of the RNC .
The Pullen family is very confident that Kirkpatrick has no chance to survive a vote for a foreign bank bailout , which they also feel will take down two other Arizona Blue Dogs , Harry Mitchell and Gabby Giffords , both of whom are likely to follow Emanuel 's lead into what looks more and more like a Democratic Party Suicide Pact .
Here 's a message on this that went out to bloggers in Arizona today .
They did n't even bother mentioning Kirkpatrick -- as though she were just another Republican : Jane Hamsher reports that Kirkpatrick may have been frightened into standing up to Emanuel and voting " no " tomorrow .
Blue Dogs who do n't will suffer at the polls next year .
And Emanuel knows he 's starting to lose them .
So what 's his latest strategy ?
We hear he 's turning to vulnerable Republicans and telling them he can get the DCCC to " go easy " on them next year if they vote for the Supplemental tomorrow .
It 's one thing if he makes a deal with Vern Buchanan in Florida or Chris Smith in New Jersey , but we 're hearing that he 's offering to protect Republicans who have been slated asDCCC targets , like Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) , Bill Young ( R - FL ) , Leonard Lance R- NJ ) and Charlie Dent ( R - PA ) .
Watch tomorrow to see if any of these characters cross over and vote with Team Emanuel to bail out European bankers .
And speaking of Rahm , there was a passage I read this morning in Charles Pierces ' book , Idiot America by an angry Minnesota congressman :
Fits to a t , huh ?
Labels : 2010 congressional races , Ann Kirkpatrick , Arizona , government bailout , IMF , Rahm Emanuel , supplemental budget
At ground level ozone is a potent pollutant and greenhouse gas .
But on the edge of space , the ozone layer is the earth 's sunscreen .
It 's no coincidence that life crept out of the primeval ocean only after that natural sunblock formed over half a billion years ago .
Back then the bare surface of early earth was cooked by the equivalent of an industrial UV tanning light all day long .
If the harsh UV were let through again today , forests , grasslands , and commercial crops would wither and die .
Phytoplankton , the key fundamental link for much of the planet 's food chain , would crash .
The direct and indirect effect on our modern civilization would be immediate and catastrophic .
Chloro - fluorocarbons ( CFCs ) were developed in the early 20th century as an alternative to refrigerants like ammonia or sulfur dioxide .
CFCs , like freon , were a huge commercial success in part because , unlike their toxic and corrosive counterparts , they were almost wholly inert .
A person could inhale them by the bucketful with no ill effects .
But once in the ozone layer , CFCs break apart , and the now free , reactive chlorine or fluorine particles become a catalyst capable of breaking down an unlimited number of ozone molecules .
Fortunately , scientists discovered the danger posed by CFCs , and policy makers moved quickly to address it .
Now , a new study by NASA suggests that that effort may have averted disaster :
Led by NASA Goddard scientist Paul Newman , a team of atmospheric chemists simulated ' what might have been ' if chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and similar ozone - depleting chemicals were not banned through the Montreal Protocol .
The scary part ?
According to this projection , had the world paid heed to clowns like Tom DeLay or Rush Limbaugh who blabbed on about the ' ozone depletion myth , ' this grim scenario would not just be something for our great - grandchildren to worry about .
It could be happening now .

PORT OF SPAIN , Trinidad and Tobago  President Obama said Saturday that he would soon announce “ the elimination of dozens of government programs shown to be wasteful or ineffective , ” and he used his weekly radio address to name two new high - level officials to assist him in that effort .
The president said that in his cabinet meeting on Monday  the first time the full body will meet  he would ask department and agency heads to propose specific ways to cut their budgets by eliminating inefficient programs .
Mr. Obama , who is in this island nation for a gathering of leaders of the Western Hemisphere , often uses his weekly address to talk about energy , health care or the economy .
On Saturday , he used it to announce the appointments of Jeffrey Zients , a management consultant and entrepreneur , to be chief performance officer , and Aneesh Chopra , Virginia ’s secretary of technology , to be chief technology officer .
“ If we ’re going to rebuild our economy on a solid foundation , we need to change the way we do business in Washington , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ We need to restore the American people ’s confidence in their government  that it is on their side , spending their money wisely . ”

This is n't a trick question .
Antimatter is exactly what you might think it is -- the opposite of normal matter , of which the majority of our universe is made .
Until just recently , the presence of antimatter in our universe was considered to be only theoretical .
In 1928 , British physicist Paul A.M. Dirac revised Einstein 's famous equation E=mc² .
Dirac said that Einstein did n't consider that the " m " in the equation -- mass -- could have negative properties as well as positive .
Dirac 's equation ( E = + or - m c2 ) allowed for the existence of anti-particles in our universe .
Scientists have since proven that several anti-particles exist .
These anti-particles are , literally , mirror images of normal matter .
Each anti-particle has the same mass as its corresponding particle , but the electrical charges are reversed .
Here are some antimatter discoveries of the 20th century :

Positrons - Electrons with a positive instead of negative charge .
Discovered by Carl Anderson in 1932 , positrons were the first evidence that antimatter existed .
Anti-protons - Protons that have a negative instead of the usual positive charge .
In 1955 , researchers at the Berkeley Bevatron produced an antiproton .
Anti-atoms - Pairing together positrons and antiprotons , scientists at - Pairing together positrons and antiprotons , scientists at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , created the first anti-atom .
Nine anti-hydrogen atoms were created , each lasting only 40 nanoseconds .
As of 1998 , CERN researchers were pushing the production of anti-hydrogen atoms to 2,000 per hour .
When antimatter comes into contact with normal matter , these equal but opposite particles collide to produce an explosion emitting pure radiation , which travels out of the point of the explosion at the speed of light .
Both particles that created the explosion are completely annihilated , leaving behind other subatomic particles .
The explosion that occurs when antimatter and matter interact transfers the entire mass of both objects into energy .
Scientists believe that this energy is more powerful than any that can be generated by other propulsion methods .
So , why have n't we built a matter - antimatter reaction engine ?
The problem with developing antimatter propulsion is that there is a lack of antimatter existing in the universe .
If there were equal amounts of matter and antimatter , we would likely see these reactions around us .
Since antimatter does n't exist around us , we do n't see the light that would result from it colliding with matter .
It is possible that particles outnumbered anti-particles at the time of the Big Bang .
As stated above , the collision of particles and anti-particles destroys both .
And because there may have been more particles in the universe to start with , those are all that 's left .
There may be no naturally - existing anti-particles in our universe today .
However , scientists discovered a possible deposit of antimatter near the center of the galaxy in 1977 .
If that does exist , it would mean that antimatter exists naturally , and the need to make our own antimatter would be eliminated .
For now , we will have to create our own antimatter .
Luckily , there is technology available to create antimatter through the use of high - energy particle colliders , also called " atom smashers . "
Atom smashers , like CERN , are large tunnels lined with powerful supermagnets that circle around to propel atoms at near - light speeds .
When an atom is sent through this accelerator , it slams into a target , creating particles .
Some of these particles are antiparticles that are separated out by the magnetic field .
These high - energy particle accelerators only produce one or two picograms of antiprotons each year .
A picogram is a trillionth of a gram .
All of the antiprotons produced at CERN in one year would be enough to light a 100 - watt electric light bulb for three seconds .
It will take tons of antiprotons to travel to interstellar destinations .

The secret memoirs of Zhao Ziyang , the Communist Party leader ousted for opposing the military crackdown on student protesters in Tiananmen Square , exploded into the open yesterday , four years after his death .
Dictated during his years of house arrest and smuggled out on cassettes disguised as children 's music or Peking opera , the book will be pored over for clues about the workings of the secretive group of men who make up the inner core of China 's Communist Party .
The decisions made in Beijing 's Zhongnanhai compound have global impact as China is an emerging superpower , but little is known about how it functions .
Prisoner of the State : The Secret Journal of Zhao Ziyang may change all that .
The publishers , Simon and Schuster , were so worried about news of the Zhao book leaking that they listed it as Untitled by Anonymous in their catalogue .
It was not supposed to go on sale until next Tuesday but several stores in Hong Kong broke the embargo and put it on the shelves .
And the clamour – just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 4 June Tiananmen Square massacre , when tensions are high about political dissent in China – was intense .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Zhao was a powerful figure within China 's opaque apparatus of power , but his decision to back the student protesters in Tiananmen Square cost him his career , and earned him 16 years under arrest in his Beijing home .
His last public appearance was on 19 May , 1989 , when he visited the young demonstrators in front of the Forbidden City and urged them to leave Tiananmen Square , warning that police would use force if they did not .
Standing beside him was his aide , Wen Jiabao , who escaped the taint of his allegiance to Mr Zhao to become the current premier .
As the tanks rolled into central Beijing on 3 June Mr Zhao writes : " While sitting in the courtyard with my family , I heard intense gunfire .
A tragedy to shock the world had not been averted , and was happening after all . "
The current Chinese leadership says the crackdown was a " disturbance " by " hooligans " and says crushing the revolt was essential to ensure a stable foundation for the country 's economic growth .
Mr Zhao takes the opposite view .
" I had said at the time that most people were only asking us to correct our flaws , not attempting to overthrow our political system , " he wrote .
There are lively examples of his rivalry with the veteran revolutionary and former supreme leader Deng Xiaoping .
Mr Deng is hailed in China as the architect of the last 30 years of reform and economic liberalisation .
However , Mr Zhao paints a very different picture , one of a double - crossing and cunning political leader at odds with the official hagiography .
Mr Zhao – who was the general secretary of the Communist Party from 1987 to 1989 – says by removing him from power , Mr Deng and others had simply ignored their own rules meant to prevent a return to the cult of personality that characterised the Mao years .
The decision was made without a vote in the Politburo and the memoir describes in gripping detail how Mr Deng summoned the Standing Committee to his house to purge Mr Zhao .
" Reading Zhao 's unadorned and unboastful account of his stewardship , it becomes apparent that it was he rather than Deng who was the actual architect of reform , " writes Roderick MacFarquhar , professor of Chinese history at Harvard University .
Mr Zhao – the son of wealthy landowner who was purged as a capitalist sympathiser during the Cultural Revolution before being rehabilitated – believed the cure for China 's problems lay in gradual but unceasing movement towards Western - style democracy , something the current leadership has ruled out .

The book is being published in Chinese by New Century Press , which is run by Bao Pu , the son of Mr Zhao 's most trusted aide Bao Tong who remains under police surveillance .
Bao
Tong yesterday shrugged off suggestions that the leaked memoirs could split the Communist Party but said senior leaders were likely to read the book .
" It will give them a lot to think about , and cause them to think about the Party 's basic survival , " he told Reuters .
In a review of the book , Perry Link , a leading commentator on Chinese politics , noted how incarceration had given Mr Zhao time to reflect on China 's place in history .
" At the end , we see Zhao arrive at positions more radical than any he had taken before – positions that the Chinese government had long been calling ' dissident ' ...
The Communist Party will have to release its monopoly on power .
Ultimately , China will need parliamentary democracy , " Mr Link writes .
Mr Zhao died a lonely old man in his Beijing house in 2005 .
" The entrance to my home is a cold , desolate place . "
But his astonishing memoir may mean his life takes on a whole new significance .
China 20 years ago : Students vs the party
The 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre was described as " a tragedy to shock the world " by Zhao Ziyang , and a " disturbance " instigated by " hooligans " by the Chinese regime .
The image of a lone man standing in front of a row of tanks remains an enduring image of the incident , which sprang from protests over the government 's refusal to allow public mourning upon the death of pro-democracy official , Hu Yaobang .
The protest became a proxy for more generalised anger at the government 's authoritarianism .
Over seven weeks , the crowd swelled to over 100,000 students and workers .
A hunger strike led authorities to take brutal steps to suppress the protests , and tanks drove the students from the square – killing 2 to 3,000 people in the process .
Prisoner of State : Extracts from the book
On the 17 May meeting " I walked out as soon as the meeting adjourned .
At that moment , I was extremely upset .
I told myself that no matter what , I refused to become the General Secretary who mobilised the military to crack down on students . "
On the Tiananmen crackdown " On the night of June 3rd , while sitting in the courtyard with my family , I heard intense gunfire .
A tragedy to shock the world had not been averted , and was happening after all ...
First , it was determined then that the student movement was a planned conspiracy of anti-Party , anti-socialist elements with leadership .
So now we must ask , who were these leaders ?
What was the plan ?
What was the conspiracy ?
What evidence exists to support this ?
Second , it was said that this event was aimed at overthrowing the People 's Republic and the Communist Party .
Where is the evidence ?
I had said at the time that most people were only asking us to correct our flaws , not attempting to overthrow our political system . "
On democracy " It would be wrong if our Party never makes the transition from a state that was suitable in a time of war to a state more suitable to a democracy society ...
The ruling Party must achieve two breakthroughs .
One is to allow other political parties and a free press to exist .
The second ... is , the Party needs to adopt democratic procedures and use democratic means to reform itself ...
Different opinions must be allowed to exist , and different factions should be made legitimate . "
The last word " Whether the Communist Party persists should be determined by the consequences of society 's political openness and the competition between the Communist Party and other political powers (...)
The trend is irrefutable , that the fittest will survive . "
Nelson 's battlefield : Google Earth finds the forgotten clumps of trees planted as a living map to commemorate Admiral 's victory at Battle of the Nile
For two centuries they have stood in the heart of England , a landlocked tribute to the brilliance of Admiral Lord Nelson .
Planted across three - quarters of a mile of Wiltshire countryside , a series of tree clumps mark the positions of British and French ships during the Battle of the Nile .
But despite being one of the largest memorials of its kind in the world , the secret of the Nile Clumps has until now been known only to a few locals and military historians .
History taken root :
The named clumps in the Wiltshire countryside were among the 14 - strong British fleet commanded by Nelson
The National Trust has launched a campaign to change all that .
It is promoting the memorial as a tourist attraction for visitors to Salisbury Plain .
Historians are also urging the public to explore the site using Google Maps - the online collection of aerial photographs .
The living memorial lies about a mile east of Stonehenge .
It is thought to have been planted by landowner Baron Douglas of Amesbury some years after Nelson 's death in 1805 , at the request of Captain Thomas Hardy and Nelson 's mistress , Lady Hamilton .
Tribute : Admiral Lord Nelson
It is believed there were originally 31 clumps , representing the 17 French and 14 British ships , but only 19 remain after the rest were felled or blown over during the centuries .
' The Battle of the Nile in 1798 was one of Nelson 's most significant clashes with Napoleon , ' said National Trust volunteer Stephen Fisher .
' Forget Trafalgar , this was Nelson 's finest hour and at the time was his most famous victory .
' Not only did this battle halt Napoleon 's ambitions for Egypt , but it was one of the most decisive victories over the French fleet .
Only two of their ships survived the encounter while not a single British ship was lost . '
The clumps consist of beech , maple and hawthorn , and 1,400 of the original trees still survive .
Some of the gaps were filled in a replanting operation by Amesbury Rotary Club a decade ago .
Richard Whitney , of the National Trust , said : ' Each clump carries the name of a different vessel - like the Vanguard , Goliath or Bellerophon .
Before now that information has only been mentioned in a few guidebooks , on the internet or embedded in local knowledge .
' With images from the Royal Naval Museum , the information will finally make it clear to visitors the story of these trees . '
The tall beeches in the middle of the clumps were designed to represent the soaring sails of the military boats , with the maple and hawthorn representing the body .
Finest hour : A 19th - century painting of the battle
Many historians agree that the Battle of the Nile was more significant than Trafalgar , the battle in which Nelson died .
In August 1798 , the French were at anchor in Aboukir Bay in shallow water , using the shore to protect the south - western side of the fleet , while the north - eastern faced open sea .
Although the ships were chained together , Nelson believed the chain between the last ship in the line and the shore was sunk deep enough to let a vessel pass .
In a daring night - time manoeuvre , his fleet slipped through the gap and attacked the French on their unprotected side .
Lord Nelson coming on deck during the battle
The battle established Britain as the dominant sea power during the French revolutionary wars and was immortalised in the poem Casablanca , known for its opening line ' The boy stood on the burning deck ' .
Nelson 's flagship during the battle was the Vanguard .
Other British ships commemorated by surviving copses include the Minotaur , Defence , Swiftsure , Theseus , Orion , Bellerophon and Alexander .
The Nile Clumps stand behind King Barrow Ridge on the Stonehenge landscape between the stones and the Countess Roundabout .
This is not the only wooded tribute to the Battle of the Nile .
On the former Swarland Estate near Alnwick , Northumberland , a line of trees takes the shape of the coastline of the Nile delta .
Other trees appear to be in the positions of the British and French fleet .

Editor ’s note : MoveOn has sent a response to Tom Hayden , which is published below his article .
The most powerful grassroots organization of the peace movement , MoveOn , remains silent as the American wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan simmer or escalate .
The executive director of MoveOn , Justin Ruben , met with President Obama in February , told the president it was “ the moment to go big , ” then indicated that MoveOn would not be opposing the $ 94 billion war supplemental request , nor the 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan , nor the increased civilian casualties from the mounting number of Predator attacks .
[ See Ari Melber , The Nation , Feb. 27 , 2009 ]
What was MoveOn ’s explanation for abandoning the peace movement in a meeting with a president the peace movement was key to electing ?
According to Ruben and MoveOn , it was the preference of its millions of members , as ascertained by house meetings and polls .
The evidence , however , is otherwise .
Last December 17 , 48.3 percent of MoveOn members listed “ end the war in Iraq ” as a 2009 goal , after health care [ 64.9 % ] , economic recovery and job creation [ 62.1 % ] , and building a green economy / stop climate change [ 49.6 % , only 1.5 % ahove Iraq . ]
This was at a moment when most Americans believed the Iraq War was ending .
Afghanistan and Pakistan were not listed among top goals which members could vote on .
Then on May 22 MoveOn surveyed its members once again , listing ten possible campaigns for the organization .
“ Keep up the pressure to the end the war in Iraq ” was listed ninth among the options .
Again , Afghanistan and Pakistan were not on the MoveOn list of options .
Nor was Guantanamo nor the administration ’s torture policies .
“ Investigate the Bush Administration ” was the first option .
MoveOn is supposed to be an Internet version of participatory democracy , but the organization ’s decision - making structure apparently assures that the membership is voiceless on the question of these long wars .
What if they included an option like “ demanding a diplomatic settlement and opposing a quagmire in Afghanistan and Pakistan ? ”
Or “ shifting from a priority on military spending to civilian spending on food , medicine and schools ? ”
This is no small matter .
MoveOn has collected a privately - held list of five million names , most of them strong peace advocates .
The organization ’s membership contributed an unprecedented $ 180 million for the federal election cycle in 2004 - 2006 .
Those resources , now squelched or sequestered , mean that the most vital organization in the American peace movement is missing in action .
What to do ?
There is no point raving and ranting against MoveOn .
The only path is in organizing a dialogue with the membership , over the Internet , and having faith that their voices will turn the organization to oppose these escalating occupations .
The same approach is necessary towards other vital organs of the peace movement including rank - and - file Democrat activists and the post- election Obama organization [ Organizing for America ] , through a persistent bottom - up campaign to renew the peace movement as a powerful force in civil society .
This is not a simple matter of an organizational oligarchy manipulating its membership , although the avoidance by MoveOn ’s leadership is a troubling sign .
There is genuine confusion over Afghanistan and Pakistan among the rank - and - file .
The economic crisis has averted attention away from the battlefront .
Many who voted for Obama understandably will give him the benefit of the doubt , for now .
Silence sends a message .
The de facto MoveOn support for the $ 94 billion war supplemental reverberates up the ladder of power .
Feeling no pressure , the Congressional leadership has abdicated its critical oversight function over the expanding wars , not even allowing members to vote for a Decmber report on possible exit strategies .
In the end , a gutsy sixty voted against HR 2346 on May 14 , but many defected to vote for the war spending , including Neil Abercrombie , Jerry Nadler , Obey , Xavier Becerra , Lois Capps , Maurice Hinchey , Jesse Jackson , Sheila Jackson - Lee , Patrick Kennedy , Charles Rangel , Lucille Roybal - Allard , Loretta Sanchez , Rosa De Lauro , Bennie Thompson , Jerry McNerney , Robert Wexler , and Henry Waxman .
[ Bill Delahunt , Linda Sanchez and Pete Stark were not recorded ] .
If there were significant pressures from networks like MoveOn in their Congressional districts , the opposition vote might have approached 85 .
Appropriations chair David Obey in essence granted Obama a one - year pass to show results in Afghanistan .
If the war appears to be a quagmire by then , he claimed , the Democrats will become more critical .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered the same message ; according to the Washington Examiner on May 6 : “ There wo n’t be any more war supplementals , so my message to my members is , this is it . ”
Pelosi ’s words were carefully parsed , saying that the White House would not be allowed another supplemental form of appropriation , which is different from an actual pledge to oppose war funding .
This one - year pass means that the grass - roots peace movement has a few months to light a fire and re-awaken pressure from below on the Congress and president .
In the meantime , here are some predictions for the coming year :
IRAQ : Will Obama keep his pledge to withdraw combat forces from Iraq on a 16 - month timetable , and all forces by 2011 ?
At this point , the pace is slowing , and the deadline being somewhat extended , under pressure from US commanders on the ground .
Sunnis are threatening to resume their insurgency if the al - Maliki regime fails to incorporate them into the political and security structures .
The President insists however , that he is only making adjustments to a timetable that is on track .
Prognosis : precarious .
AFGHANISTAN : Will the Obama troop escalation deepen the quagmire or be a successful surge against the Taliban by next year ?
Another 21,000 troops and advisers are on their way to the battlefield .
Civilian casualties are mounting , causing the besieged Karzai government to complain .
Preventive detention of Afghans will only expand .
US deaths , now over 600 , are sure to increase this summer .
Taliban may hold out and redeploy in order to stretch US forces thin .
Prognosis : escalation into quagmire .
PAKISTAN : US policies have driven al Qaeda from Afganistan into Pakistan ’s tribal areas , where US is attacking with Predators and turning Pakistan ’s US - funded armed forces towards counterinsurgency .
Public opinion is being inflamed against the US intervention .
Prognosis : an expanding American war in Pakistan with greater threats to American security .
IRAN : With or without US complicity , Israel may attack Iran early next year , with unforeseeable consequences in Iraq and Afghanistan .

Tom Hayden served 18 years in the California legislature , and is the author of ten books .
Editor ’s Note : Here ’s a response from MoveOn.org :
We appreciate Tom Hayden ’s attempt to start a discussion here about the progressive posture on security issues , and we even understand his attempt to use MoveOn as a foil .
We agree that it ’s time to confront the organizing challenges of building an effective peace movement in the Obama era , and we expect MoveOn and MoveOn members to play an important role in this .
In order to have a productive conversation , however , we have to make sure the facts are correct .
Tom ’s characterization of our democratic process is inaccurate ; the Top 10 issues we focus on were both nominated by and chosen by MoveOn members .
Even more erroneous is Tom ’s description in the lead of his piece of Justin ’s conversation with the President .
Our Executive Director , Justin Ruben , never “ indicated that MoveOn would not be opposing the $ 94 billion war supplemental request , nor the 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan , nor the increased civilian casualties from the mounting number of Predator attacks . ”
The article by Ari Melber which Tom referenced as a source does not say that Justin said this .
That particular conversation was about MoveOn members ’ current organizing focus on energy , health care , and the economy .
And our belief that the administration should “ go big ” on progressive policies in these arenas .

Rick Sugarek knows not to splash through the puddles inside " the mouth of the beast . "
That is what he calls the gaping wound near Redding known to everybody else as the Iron Mountain Mine , which is widely regarded by scientists as one of the most polluted places in the world .
The project manager for the Environmental Protection Agency said he once dropped a pen in some running water inside the mine and when he recovered it , it was coated in copper .
The water is so acidic that droplets eat holes in blue jeans and dissolve the stitching on boots , much like battery acid .
Sugarek stood Thursday in a shaft once known as the Richmond Mine .
It is the source of the toxic stew that has polluted the Sacramento River and its tributaries for more than a century , killed thousands of fish and turned a once - majestic mountain into a hellish breeding ground for nasty bacterial slime that helps create what geologists say is the " world 's worst water . "
But on this day Sugarek was full of hope , despite the dismal surroundings .
The EPA was recently awarded $ 20.7 million in federal stimulus funds to clean up the heavy metals that have flowed into and accumulated at the bottom of the Keswick Reservoir for decades , threatening fish if not people .
Sugarek said the metals have settled to the bottom and do not affect the quality of the drinking water .
The money , combined with $ 10 million already budgeted for the project , will pay for construction of three pumping stations , piping and the hydraulic dredging of the 170,000 cubic yards of fine toxic metals that to this day coat the bottom of the Spring Creek arm of the reservoir .
Separating out the solids
" What we 're trying to deal with now is the 50 years of stuff that has accumulated at the bottom of the reservoir since it was built , " said Sugarek , who has been working at the Toxic Superfund site for 20 years .
" This is an important management area for California 's water supply , and toxic chemicals are flowing down . "
Sugarek said the idea is to clean up the site , not restore the ecosystem , so other areas are not contaminated .
He said a storm could stir up the sludge in reservoir .
The plan then is to dredge the area over the next 18 months , pump the fine sediments up to a treatment center that will separate out the solids .
The toxic sediments will then be dried out and dumped into a 12 - acre pit on nearby federal land .
The pit will be lined with thick plastic sheets and then covered and planted over .
Prospecting in 1860s
The work is expected to employ as many as 300 people over three years .
In the end , Sugarek hopes , the threat to waterways , including the Sacramento River , should have ended .
The trouble began in the 1860s when gold and silver prospectors first discovered the mountain , about 9 miles northwest of Redding .
Poisonous runoff
The real damage began when a company called Mountain Copper took over the 4,400 - acre mine in the 1890s and began to supply sulfuric acid to refineries in the Bay Area .
At the turn of the century , it was the largest copper mine in California , and a small city of laborers lived on the mountain .
Twenty cavities the size of office buildings were drilled into the mountain .
Much of the work on the Richmond Mine occurred during World War II , leaving the entire mountain scarred .
The mining operation turned to rubble what was originally a 200 - foot - thick by 3,000 - foot - long underground deposit of pyrite , exposing it to oxygen , water and bacteria that combined to create the poisonous runoff .
Water that flowed out of the shaft where the pyrite lay formed bluish blocks of acid salt , which deer sometimes used as salt licks .
The Bureau of Reclamation built an earthen dam in 1963 to block the steady flow of sludge , but it would often overflow during heavy winter rains and the copper and metals would get into the Sacramento River .
The mine was finally abandoned in 1966 and collapsed in on itself shortly after that .
The problem , it seemed , only got worse .
Lethal blend of copper , iron
Tens of thousands of fish have been killed since then .
By the time the EPA took over management of the area in the 1980s , a ton of acidic water and heavy metals a day were flowing into the river , Sugarek said .
The water in the debris dam was blood red from a mixture of iron and copper .
Desperate , the EPA built the Slick Rock Creek Retention Dam in 2004 , which captured 98 percent of the sludge .
The sludge is dried and dumped in the open pit mine on top of the mountain .
Now the EPA is concentrating on the leftover mess .
But money cannot completely resolve the problem .
Researchers recently found six unique strains of bacteria that live in a bed of pink slime that is part of a little - understood biochemical cycle that devours iron , produces sulfuric acid , and creates a nightmarish broth of copper , zinc and arsenic .
That toxic broth will continue pouring out of the mine forever , or until someone figures out a way to neutralize the chemical and biological reactions , scientists say .
" We spent a good deal of time trying to see if we could shut it down , and our conclusion was that we could n't , " said Sugarek , adding that the only hope is for some future innovation or new technology .
" We know we can continue what we are doing for 100 years .
The estimate is that it will take the mountain about 3,000 years to use up all the pyrite . "
The damp , dark passage where Sugarek stood Thursday was nothing compared with the hellish alien environment deeper inside the mine .
There , chemical reactions drive temperatures up to 130 degrees , the water is almost pure sulfuric acid , and stalactites and stalagmites of acid salt cover the walls .
Dissolving aluminum , skin
" If you go back 1,500 feet , the temperature is 100 degrees , you start to see the acid salts and it smells like sulfur , " Sugarek said .
" You do n't want to use an aluminum ladder because it will just dissolve . "
A NASA scientist once sent a robot into the bowels of the mine .
It did not return , Sugarek said .
Nobody that he knows of has been killed , but Sugarek said a worker testing the water above the debris dam suffered " some exfoliation of the skin " after his rubber raft was punctured and he was forced to swim to safety .
Little help from owner
The elderly owner of the property , Ted Arman , who bought the 3,500 - foot mountain from the last mining company for $ 100,000 , has not been much help , proposing a resumption of mining in addition to construction of a 200 - foot - tall marble statue of Jesus Christ .
Sugarek said rockslides and dam failures are still concerns .
" We have shut the leak off , " he said .
" What we 're worried about is that a discharge from the debris dam during a big storm could cause an environmental disaster . "

Advertisement Masked attackers have raided a wedding party in south - eastern Turkey , killing 44 people , including six children .
Sixteen women also died when attackers wielding automatic rifles and grenades burst into a celebration in Bilge Koyu , in Mardin province , officials said .
Turkey has fought Kurdish separatists in the area for 25 years , but this attack has been linked to a local " blood feud " and a pro-Turkish militia .
Eight people were arrested with weapons overnight , the interior minister said .
Besir Atalay said investigators had spent the night speaking to eyewitnesses in an effort to identify those responsible .
The identities of those arrested have not yet been announced .
According to what my relatives told me unknown gunmen opened fire from the door and from the window .
I 've seen lots of bodies , their faces are unrecognisable
Tarik Kalkan , local resident
Village Guards divide Turkish Kurds
" Eight people have been caught and detained , and their weapons confiscated .
This can be understood as a blood feud between two families , " Mr Atalay said .
Local media said there had been a feud between families in the village in recent years .
Other unconfirmed reports said the assailants included members of a militia known as the Village Guards , who have helped government troops fight Kurdish separatist rebels in recent years .
The Village Guards were set up in 1984 and have long been accused of involvement in illegal activities , says the BBC's David O'Byrne in Istanbul .
If the group 's complicity in these killings is proved , it is likely to reinforce calls for it to be disbanded , our correspondent adds .
Horrifying scene
The attack took place at a wedding celebration in the village of Bilge Koyu , about 20 km ( 12 miles ) from the city of Mardin .
One report said there were about 200 guests at the wedding .
One relative who took the body of his nephew to a hospital said the site of the attack was horrifying .
" You could not believe your eyes , " Ahmet Can told Channel 24 .
Ferhat Ozen , deputy governor of Mardin province , said the assailants stormed into a house where wedding guests had assembled , firing automatic rifles and throwing hand grenades .
Paramilitary police were sent to the village to pursue the attackers , he said .
Another man whose relatives were caught up in the attack accused the gunmen of using explosives .
" The shooting started right after they took their position to perform prayers , " Tarik Kalkan said .
" I 've seen lots of bodies , their faces are unrecognisable .
It 's obvious that some explosives were also used . "
Mr Atalay , the interior minister , was quick to play down suggestions of a Kurdish terror strike .
" Based on the investigations so far , we have reached the opinion that it was not a terror event , but the prosecution is still investigating , " he said .
Although the interior minister did not mention the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) by name , analysts say his comments suggest the government is ruling out an attack by Kurdish militants .
Rebels have been battling for more autonomy since 1984 in the south of Turkey - an insurgency which has claimed more than 40,000 lives .
The violence means many people carry guns - and our correspondent says tribal and family loyalties in the region run deep .

In their race for one or more seats in the European Parliament , the Swedish Pirate Party has gathered support from all layers of society , including some well known public figures .
One of them is Lars Gustafsson , one of Sweden 's most prolific writers , who openly expressed his support for the Pirate Party today .
Lars Gustafsson is a Swedish poet , novelist and literary critic whose controversial writings often go against the establishment .
For several years he worked as a professor at the University of Texas teaching philosophy and creative writing , until he retired in 2006 .
True to his defiant nature , Gustafsson – who has moved back from Texas to Sweden – is now openly supporting the Pirate Party ‘s ideologies .
In an editorial he wrote for the Swedish news outlet Expressen today , he explains why he decided to vote for this up and coming political movement in the upcoming European elections ( translation ) .
People ’s freedoms and privacy on the Internet are at stake according to Gustafsson , something that can be largely attributed to draconian laws that are passed based on proposals put forward by the pro-copyright lobby .
Furthermore , patents on medicine and Monsanto ’s copyrighted crop have an equally negative impact on people ’s freedom and even their health , something the Pirate Party is also strongly against .
“ We ’re delighted that one of Sweden ’s most senior and respected writers came out in full and unreserved support of the Pirate Party ” , Rick Falkvinge , leader of the Pirate Party told TorrentFreak .
“ Not only in support , but he is also spot on in his reasons .
Starting his editorial with the story of how the ancient Persian ruler ordered the sea whipped because it gave him unfavorable winds , and moving on to repression of the printing press in France , he has understood the issue thorougly . ”
“ I can only hope that his piece serves as a wake - up call for parts of the elder creative community that has still to see beyond the lobby propaganda , ” Falkvinge added .
Luckily Gustafsson is not the only public figure supporting the Pirate ’s cause .
In fact , many others begin to understand that the anti-piracy and pro-copyright lobbies are overstepping their boundaries .
Writer Unni Drougge , who spoke out in defense of The Pirate Bay recently and held a speech at a Pirate Party rally , is also sympathetic towards Sweden ’s third largest political party .
“ Today I want to distance myself from the greedy and power hungry copyright lobby that willingly plows the field for the Big Brother society , and also give my full support to The Pirate Bay , by donating my latest published book .
And I do n’t think I ’ll lose a penny by doing it , ” she wrote in a recent editorial , giving one of her books away for free .
Support for the Pirate Party is still growing in Sweden , especially among those outraged at the recent Pirate Bay verdict .
Rick Falkvinge is confident that they will make it into the European Parliament with at least one seat .
“ I ’m extremely optimistic , ” he told Torrent Freak earlier .
“ It ’s not a question of ‘ a ’ seat any more .
If everybody who is angry with the Pirate Bay verdict goes to vote , we will get at least one seat , and probably more . ”
The European elections take place in early June throughout Europe and early voting has already started in Sweden .
The German Pirate Party is also contending for a seat in the European Parliament .
Two - year - old British girl Dakota Clarke can see for the first time after undergoing pioneering stem cell treatment in China .
Dakota , who was born blind , is the first British patient to undergo the new type of therapy .
The £ 30,000 treatment , which involves stems cells taken from an umbilical cord being fed into her forehead , has allowed her to see people , objects , colours and lights around her .
Dakota suffers from Septo-Optic Dysplasia , which means the optic nerve does not develop properly , and has responded quicker than expected to the treatment .
Her parents , Wilma , 28 , and dad Darren , 34 , are hoping she will continue to improve and have a life time of sight .
Speaking from the Qingdao People ’s Hospital in southern China , Mrs Clarke , from Newtownabbey .
near Belfast , said : “ We did n’t know if the treatment would work , and people kept telling us it was too experimental , but we had to do this .
“ It ’s been worth every single penny to see the changes in her . ”
Mr Clarke added : “ It ’s nothing short of a miracle for us .
She can see the world for the first time .

When the federal government approved billions of dollars for infrastructure projects as part of the stimulus plan , the intention was to invest in such things as bridges , roads and highways .
But officials in Arizona have decided to spend a million dollars of their stimulus funds on … road signs .
For the past three decades , signage along Interstate 19 south of Tucson has informed travelers of their destinations in kilometers , not miles .
The signs were installed in the early 1980s in anticipation of a changeover to metrics that never came about , so transportation officials figure the time is right to move back to miles .
Some folks in Arizona are not happy with the decision .
Preservationists believe the signs should remain to mark a period in state history , while many business owners do n’t want to spend money on new marketing materials to update exit numbers and directions as part of the switch to miles .

Noted failure and hapless funnymaker , Michael Steele , has once again unwittingly helped Democratic claims about the GOP ’s lack of inclusiveness .
Steele told the audience that “ no one knows what the hell it means ” when the GOP refers to itself as a “ big tent . ”
So he offered another analogy : The GOP is a hat .
Some people wear a hat frontwards , others cocked to the left , he explained .
Some wear it backwards , he added , echoing a past statement , ” because that ’s how they roll . ”
But “ the strength of the party is in this : … the fact that you ’re willing to put the damn thing on …
The problem we ’ve had as a party is : too many of our friends , neighbors , colleagues are taking the hat off , because we ’ve decided we do n’t like the way they wear it …
The GOP is not about how you wear the hat , but the fact that you want to wear the hat . ”
I see where he was going , but , as usual , he did n’t convey HIS message so much as he did Obama’s .
Cause , seriously , who wears hats regularly nowadays ?
Besides white guys in the deep South ( where trucker caps and cowboy hats are still king ) , no other demographic is regularly sporting headgear anymore .
So , yes , it was a perfect analogy to the GOP base as of now :
You can wear your cowboy hat while fake - clearing brush , or your trucker cap while listening to Rush in the morning , but both are acceptable .
As are those whose hat - wearing habits date back to the 1930s .
Everybody else , though , is irrelevant .
Or maybe invisible .
Certainly they ’re not in the party .
Well said , my good sir .
For the very first time in New York coastal waters , the voices of singing blue whales have been positively identified .
Acoustic experts at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology ’s Bioacoustics Research Program ( BRP ) and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( DEC ) confirmed that the voice of a singing blue whale was tracked about 70 miles off of Long Island and New York City on Jan. 10 - 11 , 2009 , as the whale swam slowly from east to west .
At the same time , a second blue whale was heard singing offshore in the far distance .
“ These endangered blue whales are the largest animals ever to have lived on this planet , and their voices can travel across an ocean .
It ’s just amazing to hear one singing out there on New York ’s ocean stage only tens of miles from Carnegie Hall and Broadway ! ” said Christopher Clark , director of Cornell ’s BRP .
“ This opens a whole new universe of opportunities for all of us to learn more about and appreciate these species and the vitality of New York ’s marine environment . ”
New York State ’s DEC Commissioner Pete Grannis added , “ This is a very important moment in the environmental history of New York State .
Blue whales were almost hunted to extinction by the middle of the 20th Century , and the fact that now we 're finding them migrating not far off our shores is truly remarkable .
Although whaling no longer occurs in U.S. waters , whales still face numerous threats including vessel strikes and marine debris , and this latest finding will enable DEC and its partners to develop science - based management plans to protect these magnificent creatures . ”
During 2008 - 2009 , ten of Cornell ’s acoustic recorders were deployed about 13 miles from the New York Harbor entrance and off the shores of Fire Island to study the acoustic environment of New York waters and examine whether noises , including shipping traffic , are affecting the whales .
By knowing the whales ’ seasonal presence , New York state policymakers can make critical conservation decisions to help protect blue whales by developing management plans to avoid ship collisions with whales and reduce noises that interfere with their communications .
The acoustic monitoring was initiated from March through mid-May of 2008 to record the northward migration of right whales from their calving grounds off the Florida eastern coast to their feeding grounds off Maine , New Hampshire and Massachusetts .
Cornell scientists and DEC are able to monitor and provide specific data on the species that are detected , including when and where they occur in New York waters throughout the year .
We need a climate change ' Churchill ' to lead us away from planet - wide devastation , writes James Lovelock in the latest edition of Conservation magazine , part of the Guardian Environment Network
In a small way , the plight of the British in 1940 resembles the state of the civilized world now .
At that time we had had nearly a decade of the well - intentioned but quite wrong belief that peace was all that mattered .
The followers of the peace lobbies of the 1930s resembled the environmentalist movements now ; their intentions were more than good but wholly inappropriate for the war that was about to start .
It is time to wake up and realize that Gaia , the Earth system , is no cozy mother that nurtures humans and can be propitiated by gestures such as carbon trading or sustainable development .
Gaia , even though we are a part of her , will always dictate the terms of peace .
I am stirred by the thought that Gaia has existed for more than a quarter the age of the universe and that it has taken this long for a species to evolve that can think , communicate , and store its thoughts and experiences .
If we can keep civilization alive through this century perhaps there is a chance that our descendants will one day serve Gaia and assist her in the fine - tuned self - regulation of the climate and composition of our planet .
We have enjoyed 12,000 years of climate peace since the last shift from a glacial age to an interglacial one .
Before long , we may face planet - wide devastation worse even than unrestricted nuclear war between superpowers .
The climate war could kill nearly all of us and leave the few survivors living a Stone Age existence .
But in several places in the world , including the U.K. , we have a chance of surviving and even of living well .
For that to be possible , we have to make our lifeboats seaworthy now .
Back in May 1940 , we in the UK awoke to find facing us across the Channel a wholly hostile continental force about to invade .
We were alone without an effective ally but fortunate to have a new leader , Winston Churchill , whose moving words stirred the whole nation from its lethargy : " I have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears , and sweat . "
We all need modern Churchills to lead us from the clinging , flabby , consensual thinking of the late twentieth century and to bind our nations with a single - minded effort to wage a difficult war .

Farid Hilali , a Moroccan - born former resident of the UK , alleges he was tortured with the complicity of the British intelligence services
guardian.co.uk
A parliamentary inquiry into allegations of British collusion in torture is set to investigate whether counter - terrorism chiefs ordered the repeated torture and rendition of a former British resident .
Speaking for the first time about his ordeal , Farid Hilali told the Guardian that during his detention in the United Arab Emirates a British secret service agent turned up at the prison where he was being abused and interrogated him , knowing that he had been tortured .
Hilali says he was then rendered to Morocco , where he was tortured for a further 22 days .
Hilali says that throughout this he was questioned extensively about alleged extremists living in the UK , and about surveillance photographs that had been taken in London .
He says he believes his torturers were supplied the pictures by Britain .
Hilali 's detention took place in 1999 , and if the allegations prove true it would make him the first known victim of Britain 's alleged complicity in torture , indicating that the practice started before the 9/11 attacks that led to George Bush declaring a " war on terror " .
Hilali , now aged 40 , was born in Morocco and had been living in London for a decade when he travelled to the UAE .
He says that after being detained he was repeatedly beaten on the soles of his feet , given electric shocks while blindfolded , and handcuffed , kicked and beaten .
The Guardian has obtained some corroboration of Hilali 's account , including details from the former Guantánamo detainee Moazzam Begg .
Begg says that in the summer of 1999 an MI5 officer interviewed him about Hilali .
Begg says the agent , whom he can identify , knew Hilali was being held in the UAE and told him that he would not be returning to Britain .
Begg further alleges the MI5 agent , who called himself Andrew , ignored allegations that Hilali was being tortured .
Under the 1988 criminal justice act , those who order or collude in torture can be jailed for life .
They have a defence if they can show they had lawful authority .
Presented with Hilali 's claims , a member of the foreign affairs select committee , which is investigating allegations of British involvement in torture , said his allegations must be investigated .
Paul Keetch MP , a Liberal Democrat member of the committee , said : " We should invite him to give us the evidence he has .
We need to be proactive about investigating what has happened in the past . "
The Labour MP Mike Gapes , chair of the committee , said : " If somebody wishes to send information to us as a committee , we would give it proper consideration . "
Hilali's lawyers are writing to the committee and to Scotland Yard .
The attorney general has asked the police to investigate allegations of British security service involvement or collusion in torture .
Hilali says he will testify before any investigation and still remembers the face of the man he says is a British agent whom he begged for help .
" If I 'm given a photograph I would recognise him , because I can never forget that face .
I am prepared to give evidence to the police , and to parliament . "
The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture called for a special UN inquiry .
A foundation spokeswoman , Sonya Sceats , said : " The [ British ] government insists that it does not condone torture , but where there are credible allegations of complicity by its intelligence officers these must be investigated not only by our courts but also by an international body .
It is high time that the UK allowed the UN 's torture committee to scrutinise cases of this sort . "
There is further partial corroboration as Hilali managed to hold on to a UAE document recording his detention that states he is banned from contact with the outside world .
He has a copy of the plane ticket transferring him from the UAE to Morocco on 14 October 1999 .
There was no return flight booked and Hilali says this amounts to a rendering .
Hilali was eventually returned to Britain and made a claim for asylum in 2003 that included his allegations that Britain ordered his torture .
He says he was arrested for terrorism soon afterwards but was never questioned about any specific offence .
The case against him was then dropped .
Spain managed to extradite him , claiming he was involved in a terrorist cell based there .
In March 2009 a Spanish judge ordered his release from jail as the case against him seemed to founder – leaving him free to tell his full story for the first time .
Mehr Glück als Frau Lahmar - Schadler - Lüdenscheid ( siehe voriger Eintrag ) hatte nun einer meiner Mandanten beim Bundesverfassungsgericht .
Bei dem Betroffenen , der in Bayern wohnt , war zu früher Morgenstunde die Polizei angerückt :
Er soll über sein Internetforum raubkopierte Filme und Spiele verbreitet haben .
Die Verdachtslage war mehr als dünn .
Es lag lediglich die Anzeige eines Bürgers vor , der sich darüber beschwerte , in dem Forum fänden sich Links zu Raubkopien .
Den
Text der betreffenden Beiträge verstanden die Beamten schon mal nicht .
Im Forum wird türkisch gesprochen .
Statt erst mal zu ermitteln , was hinter den Links ( zu Rapidshare , nicht zu meinem Mandanten ) steckte , wurde einfach eine Hausdurchschung angeordnet .
So geht es nicht , befand nun das Bundesverfassungsgericht :
Den angegriffenen Entscheidungen lasse sich nicht entnehmen , dass die Verdachtsgründe über bloße Vermutungen und vage Anhaltspunkte hinausreichten .
Die Gerichte hätten keine konkreten Anhaltspunkte dafür genannt , dass die Links überhaupt auf urheberrechtliche geschützte Inhalte verwiesen .
Überdies hätten sich weder Staatsanwaltschaft noch Gerichte mit der Frage beschäftigt , wieso ausgerechnet der Forenbetreiber für mögliche Links zu Raubkopien hafte .
Der Umstand , dass jemand ein Internetforum betreibt , mache ihn jedenfalls nicht schon deswegen zum Verdächtigen wegen problematischer Links .
So hätte zumindest überprüft werden müssen , ob in dem Forum auffällig viele Links zu Raubkopien zu finden sind .
Dies könne möglicherweise zur Annahme führen , der Betreiber billige zumindest derartige Angebote .
Als weitere Möglichkeit nennt das Bundesverfassungsgericht bekannt gewordene Abmahnungen durch Rechteinhaber .
Das Gericht hält die Durchsuchung auch für unverhältnismäßig .
Zuvor hätte zumindest überprüft werden müssen , ob die vom Anzeigenerstatter beigefügten Ausdrucke authentisch waren und ob hinter den Links tatsächlich urheberrechtlich geschützte Filme oder Spiele abzurufen sind .
Außerdem hätte zumindest versucht werden müssen , den Autor der jeweiligen Beiträge zu ermitteln .

Will President Obama Send a Wreath to Confederate Memorial at Arlington ?
Scholars seek end to presidential tradition of wreath for Confederate vets .
May 23 , 2009  --
On Memorial Day , President Barack Obama will participate in an annual presidential tradition -- a public wreath - laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia .
But the day may be marred by a brewing controversy over whether President Obama will send a wreath to the cemetery 's Confederate Memorial , as presidents have done since Woodrow Wilson .
A group of several dozen university professors and scholars have written a letter to the president asking him to not send a wreath or any commemorative token to the Confederate Memorial .
Click here to read the full text of the letter .
" We ask you to break this chain of racism stretching back to Woodrow Wilson , and not send a wreath or other token of esteem to the Arlington Confederate Monument , " the letter states .
" This monument should not be elevated in prestige above other monuments by a presidential wreath . "
In their letter to the president , the group says that the monument is a " denial of the wrong committed against African Americans by slave owners , Confederates , and neo-Confederates . "
The White House did not say whether Obama would send a wreath on Monday .
The Confederate monument at Arlington dates back to 1914 , when it was unveiled on the 106th anniversary of the birthday of the president of the Confederacy , Jefferson Davis .
In the early days , though hundreds of Confederate soldiers were buried at Arlington , it was considered a Union cemetery and family members of Confederate soldiers buried there were not allowed to visit the graves .
In 1900 , Congress authorized a special section of Arlington to be set aside as a burial location for nearly 500 Confederate soldiers .
They are buried in concentric circles , with the monument built in the center .
On June 4 , 1914 , President Woodrow Wilson spoke at the monument as veterans from the Union and Confederate Armies laid wreaths on the graves , as a symbol of unity .
Since then , American presidents have sent a wreath to adorn the monument .
President George H. W. Bush changed the traditionby sending a wreath on Memorial Day , not on Davis ' birthday as his predecessors had done .

The competition is still in progress , though my team ’s decided to stop — we ’ve had enough fun for one year , and there ’s only so far you can go with very little sleep and shockingly poor maths — but we ’ve done much better than last year , learning from our previous mistakes …
Last year , the competition was to write a controller for a Martian Robot .
You were given the simulator and the scenario files for it and had to write a controller to direct it to avoid boulders , rocks , and 7 - fingered martians .
Control was a little tricky , our path finding frequently never terminated fast enough and we never actually figured out how hard it was to direct the Robot until about an hour before the finish — and yes , we went the whole 72 hour distance then .
We were totally wiped out , realised we ’d solved the wrong question , or at least not spotted where the difficulty lay until it was far far too late and ended up doing very badly — somewhere below 250th position .
In the course of the three days we wrote about 9000 lines of Haskell and almost every commit comment was either a single letter or a curse of some sort .
A friend of ours wrote a very simple controller ( in C++ ) and did very much better than us .
We learnt several things from that experience .
One was to really think about the problem and work out where the difficulties lie before getting bogged down in a broken implementation .
The other was the value of writing tools — namely visualisers so that you could see what ’s going on .
A picture really does paint a thousand words , and Haskell has some nice GTK +/ Cairo bindings so it ’s pretty easy to knock out a good visualiser .
Last year , because communication with the simulator was via network sockets , we also used this to dump out data to be visualised .
We had to run the simulator in real time ( though some teams did work out how to hack it so it would run much much faster ) and so it made sense to run the visualiser in real time too — it was pretty cool to watch what our rover was doing and we also dumped out our graph for route finding which we overlaid too .
However , because it was so timing sensitive , we found that our rover behaved differently if it was running with the visualiser or not — the extra cost of dumping out debug information altered its behaviour !
This year , the task involved moving satellites between different orbits .
We were given only the compiled scenarios , and a spec of the VM which they were to run on .
So step one was implementing the VM .
This was pretty straight forward , though we immediately spotted we want this to run as fast as possible because a valid solution could be up to 3,000,000 “ seconds ” long and there ’s no way we ’re sitting around for that !
— 3,000,000 seconds is 833 hours which is about 11.5 times longer than the whole competition was due to last !
So I pretty much treated Haskell as C , got out the bit masks , and had the whole thing running in my CPU cache ( ok , I have a 12MB L3 cache , so it ’s not as impressive as it sounds ! ) .
I was quite pleased — with a bit of maths I worked out I was spending about 250 CPU cycles per VM instruction — about 8 million instructions per second .
We were getting through the 3,000,000 “ seconds ” in under 2 minutes and this was clearly very usable .
We were also dumping out to a file all sorts of debug information which we would later parse and build a visualiser for .
Sadly , that same friend I mentioned earlier also wrote a VM in C++ and got to about 35 CPU cycles per VM instruction .
Still , within a factor of 10 is quite good for Haskell — both of us used pretty much every trick we knew to make it go fast .
I guess there ’s still work to be done for the GHC developers !
Next task was writing the visualiser .
Again , Haskell , GTK +/ Cairo , a nice slider to allow us to step through each frame , plotting the output , and a textual dump of the information we capture in each frame .
Also , quick navigation to the next “ interesting ” event — eg when we fire thrusters — searching for events like these amongst 3 million frames is a little frustrating , so quickly being able to jump computationally was a good extra feature .
It suddenly became very cool to rapidly step through every 100 frames and get a primitive video of our satellite moving about , and gravity playing havoc with its every move !
And now to the problem itself .
There ’s a thing called a Hohmann Transfer which allows you to change between different orbits using two burns .
You use one burn to push you out of your current orbit and to go into an elliptical orbit , and then 180 Â° later you do another burn which puts you back into your target circular orbit .
Task one was simply doing this maths , getting it right , and going from one circular orbit to another .
Sometimes the orbit would be further out , sometimes further in .
This was reasonably straight forward .
The second task was not only changing orbits , but also meeting up with another satellite in the target orbit .
You had to stay within 1 km of the target satellite for 900 seconds to pass .
So , between two steps , you could use your position and your target ’s position to calculate enough information to solve the necessary equations .
You would know how long you needed to sleep for ( i.e. carry on in the current orbit ) , how much you needed to burn , how long the transfer between orbits would take , and what the final burn would be .
In this task , there were four scenarios .
Three of them we got quite quickly , but the fourth eluded us for a long time ( in fact , although we got a solution , we do n’t have a single piece of code that can do all four tasks , so it does n’t really count ) .
The problem with the fourth scenario is that the target satellite is a VERY long way out .
Our equations are for continuous maths , but the simulator is discrete .
So when we calculate exactly how long to sleep for ( which is the number of VM steps , or “ seconds ” to sleep for ) , that value has a fraction , but you ca n’t sleep for fractions .
So this means that you either burn a bit early , or a bit late , or you try to spread the burn over two steps .
Either way , you burn at the wrong time , and so you arrive in the wrong place ( exactly the same rounding issue happens with the transfer time ( i.e. the amount of time to spend in the elliptical orbit ) , and so you either try to come out of the elliptical orbit early or late ) .
For close to earth , as three of the four problems were , this inaccuracy does n’t matter too much — the perimeter of the circles you ’re landing on is small enough that if you ’re out by a few fractions of degrees , you ’re still in real terms close enough to the target satellite to be within 1 km and score points .
When you ’re going a long way from the earth , these few fractions of degrees correspond to a long distance — the closest I could reliably get was just under 10 km away from the target .
Not good enough .
We tried going too far out and ahead of the target , and then trying again in the hope that it ’d be easier to be more accurate if we were closer to the target to start with .
We tried going just not far enough and behind the target and trying again , all to no avail .
The problem there is that when you ’re a long way out , each step of the simulator counts for several thousand miles , and if your window of when you need to fire your thruster to hit the target is quite small , you can frequently miss it between two steps .
We actually discovered that it was much much better to try going out , if you miss it , come all the way back in to , say an orbit of 1.025 * EarthRadius and then going back out — this was faster and gave us many more attempts , and as we were orbiting the Earth so quickly , we could afford to wait until the stars were in alignment , a particular simulator step showed us that we were really really close to the ideal time to fire , and to try again .
Sadly , again due to the differences between the continuous maths we were doing and the discrete maths of the simulator , after a few outs and ins , we noticed we were very much not in a circular orbit around Earth when we thought we were .
Rounding errors had rather crept up on us .
So that is where we got stuck .
We spent many hours arguing about maths and angles .
About the only maths we did n’t argue about was vectors , but then we ’d previously ( re -) written ( several dozen ) vector maths libraries as a result of games we ’ve written ( or attempted ) so those libraries are reasonably solid .
The visualiser worked really really well — our friend with the uber - fast C++ VM did n’t have one , and it showed , when he was staring at columns of numbers not understanding what his satellite was doing .
Really , we needed to throw all our maths away , and implement an iterative solver — effectively cloning the maths the simulator was doing .
Only this way could we be accurate enough .
But neither of us have maths strong enough to solve those equations , or at least enough clue to work out where to start .
Nevertheless , at one point , we were in 52nd position , which is a stunning improvement from last year , though we have dropped back a bit now as other teams are still working on it .
It finishes at 7 pm BST today , though we ’re not going to do any further work on it .
For those interested , the 3rd part of the question was the same as the 2nd part — i.e. meet up with a different satellite , except that now the target satellite can be in an elliptical orbit , and you can start in an elliptical orbit too .
The fourth part was to add in an element of AI so that you can visit several randomly positioned satellites , stopping at a special refueling satellite if necessary to refill , and doing it as fast as possible .
Oh yes , and the Moon makes an appearance in the fourth part , adding much more fun to your equations ( figure - of - eight orbits around the Earth and Moon anyone ?! ) .
We took it at a much more relaxed pace this year , I even had to go out to play in a concert at one point , though it was mercifully brief , but had more fun than last year , did better , and did n’t make anywhere near as spectacular mistakes !
LIZ IS NOT A ‘ GREAT GUEST ’….
Liz Cheney made four television appearances yesterday , showing up on all three major cable networks .
She ’s made seven national appearances since Monday .
Media Matters updated its comprehensive list , and found that Liz Cheney has been on national television 22 times in the last 24 days .
Mind you , Liz Cheney is not a journalist or a media professional .
She ’s not a celebrity or a candidate for public office .
She does n’t work for a news outlet , government agency , party , think tank , or activist organization .
She is n’t known for saying anything especially provocative , amusing , counter - intuitive , or thought - provoking .
Liz Cheney is given a media platform , over and over again , to defend her father , attack the president , and repeat transparently ridiculous Republican talking points .
None of the networks that has featured her on - air “ analysis ” seem to find it at all strange that they ’re seeking political commentary on Dick Cheney ’s national security efforts from his own daughter .
Greg Sargent chatted with MSNBC this afternoon about the odd trend .
MSNBC is shrugging off the growing criticism of the extensive airtime the network has granted Liz Cheney to mount a political defense of her father and a political offensive against the Obama administration , with a network spokesperson saying , “ Liz is a great guest . ”
As more critics are beginning to notice , Liz Cheney is not an ordinary GOP commentator .
She is an active spokesperson on her father ’s behalf at a time when questions about how to handle the Bush torture program are actively being debated by the White House and Congress .
Her appearances are not comparable to those of conventional GOP guests .
Yet … Liz Cheney has been granted a near - constant platform on MSNBC to act as her father ’s chief defender and go after Obama , often without meaningful challenge from either a co-guest or from anchors .
They also note that it ’s unclear what makes her newsworthy enough , in and of herself , to merit all that airtime .
The whole of the defense is , “ Liz is a great guest . ”
Except , that ’s not at all true .
Liz Cheney not only lies routinely on national television , she occasionally even repeats bogus arguments that even her father wo n’t say .
My friend Rachel Maddow joked last night , “ Liz Cheney is still on TV — making news by apparently making stuff up . ”
This is n’t to pick on MSNBC , which has featured Liz Cheney ’s on - air attacks four times in the last eight days , and six times in the last 24 days .
The other cable nets are just as bad .
There ’s no modern precedent for such a ridiculous arrangement .
Dick Cheney launches a crusade against the White House , and to supplement his attacks , the networks turn to his daughter — 22 times in 24 days ?
This is n’t journalism .
It ’s just crazy .

Until this week , Peshawar 's Pearl Continental hotel was a rare island of air - conditioned calm in an increasingly dangerous country , for foreigners and local elites only of course .
Its bombing this week is a crude but effective reminder that the Taliban is not a spent force .
Peshawar , the restless capital of Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province , has had many visitors over the past several years .
A key outpost on the long trading route that links south with central Asia , for centuries it has been famed as an enchanted if sleepy backwater where anything from liquor to the latest computers could be purchased for a price .
That character has changed these past few years .
This week 's massive bomb blast at the city 's premier hotel affirmed Peshawar 's transformation into one of the key battlegrounds in the war against the Taliban .
Whether the attack was aimed directly at aid agencies delivering humanitarian goods to the families displaced by the war in the NWFP is unclear .
But the murder of three UN Food Programme employees along with eight others has for the moment stalled international efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance to the vast numbers made homeless by this war .
The attack on the Peshawar Pearl Continental may have had an added meaning for the United States .
The US was on the cusp of completing a deal for its purchase as part of a massive expansion of its Peshawar consulate , a key base for the co-ordination of American intelligence in this region .
The consulate expansion was part of the $ 1bn ( £ 607 m ) project that will see its missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan expanded ever further .
Just as the Islamabad Marriott appeared to be targeted in last September 's massive bomb blast because it was frequented by foreign diplomats and American intelligence operatives , the Peshawar Pearl Continental was often frequented by American embassy and intelligence staff and , possibly , their local operatives .
The hotel was also frequented by American officials in the 1980s , only in those days they were co-ordinating efforts to arm the most radical , Islamist militants they could muster to fight the godless communists in Afghanistan .
Already there is an almost total disconnect between Pakistanis and the several hundreds of Americans and other foreign government workers living in Peshawar and other parts of Pakistan .
One rarely meets foreigners in any part of Pakistan these days .
The latest string of bombings will exacerbate that disconnect .
In Peshawar , ordinary citizens are increasingly avoiding the markets and bazaars for fear of being the next victims of a bomb attack .
As one mother in the University Town district told me last week , her son 's appointment with the dentist was cut short because the police had received threats that a car laden with explosives was parked around the corner .
The dental practice happened to be located close to an office of the Awami National Party , a secular Pashtun nationalist political party currently in government in the NWFP .
Thankfully , on that occasion , there was no blast .
But many are wondering when their luck will run out .
Spare a thought for those who have already faced the worst of fates .
The millions made homeless by the conflict were already struggling under the sweltering heat with only minimal access to water , food and electricity .
Many , although far from all , were totally reliant on humanitarian aid from UN - coordinated international relief efforts .
The UN 's decision to pull out of those efforts owing to the security situation leaves these communities in unimaginably worse conditions than before .
Compounding this hell , the numbers of displaced are expected to rise .
Under immense pressure from the United States , the Pakistan army has expanded its operations in the NWFP to include Orakzai and the Waziristan tribal agencies and Bannu , along the border with Afghanistan but well to the south of the Swat valley .
Although largely cleared of Taliban control , operations continue in the Swat valley where pockets of insurgents remain .
The simple truth is that it is unclear how deeply the Taliban and those sympathetic to its cause – to establish an Islamic state along rigid , literal interpretations of scripture as in Afghanistan under the Taliban – have infiltrated deeper into Pakistan .
For years now it has been an open secret that the Afghan Taliban , who with a few exceptions has chosen not to get embroiled in the conflict within Pakistan , has run safe houses in northern Balochistan .
Many of its and the Pakistani Taliban 's footsoldiers are recruited from the large pool of poor young men of southern Punjab 's Seraiki belt , particularly among the Waraich clan that the Mughals and British considered one of the great " martial races " of the subcontinent .
In short , the latent potential of a broader Taliban insurgency in Pakistan remains strong .
As it remains in the international spotlight , Pakistan is in the unenviable position of having to prove that it is capable of defeating the Taliban while , at the same time , ensuring it does not splinter the broad network of largely NWFP - based Taliban militants into the rest of the country .
It is the stuff of a general 's worst nightmares .

Seattle proto -emo heroes Sunny Day Real Estate have broken up twice , in 1995 and 2001 .
But they 're back together again for a North American reunion tour , and this time , all four original members are on board .
After the band 's 1995 breakup , bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith joined Dave Grohl 's Foo Fighters .
When Sunny Day got back together in 1997 , Goldsmith rejoined , but Mendel remained a Foo .
This time , though , Mendel is back in the fold .
In a statement from Sub Pop , Mendel said , " I was n't around for the second version of the band that recorded the third and fourth albums , so I 've always had a feeling of unfinished business there .
We had all these outsized ideas back then , ' Everyone 's going to learn a new instrument , ' and ' Let 's do a rock opera , ' but before we could get anywhere with them , the band broke up .
We left behind all these weird and beautiful songs , though , and they 've stuck with me all this time .
I 'm really happy that we get a chance to play them together again . "
The reunion tour kicks off September 17 in Vancouver , and yes , they will play California .
To celebrate , on September 15 , Sub Pop will reissue the band 's two original - lineup albums : the stone classic 1994 debut Diary ( one of the best - selling albums in Sub Pop history ) and the 1995 follow - up LP2 ( better known as The Pink Album ) .
The reissues will include bonus tracks and new liner notes .

All technology comes with one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century ; hacking .
Whether ethical or black - hat hacking , hacking has come a long way over the years and hacking method have been adjusted to suit the advancements in technology .
People try every day to get better access to resources while others try to take advantage of what other people have worked so hard for .
Even radio waves are not safe !
Air - gapped systems are attracting a lot of attention from hackers , with the realization that you can attack isolated devices with different malware through radio frequencies .
It is common belief that devices that are disconnected are impossible to hack .
While that has been true in the past , the story has changed from impossibility to difficult , but possible .
Hackers can trigger alarm systems and confiscate sensitive information through radio hacking .
Here is everything you need to know about radio hacking today .
Radio communication and hacking
Many IoT devices have been exploited through radio signals , by taping on various radio protocols .
If you analyze radio communication and different modulation schemes , you will find the need for fastening the security for your network and IoT devices .
Technically , electromagnetic waves are responsible for the swift communication between different IoT devices .
These waves include radio signals .
For any information to be relayed through radio , the electromagnetic waves to have to come in play .
Ideally , there are different ways to categorize electromagnetic waves , and based on the frequency , the type of electromagnetic waves change .
What is a frequency ?
Frequency entails the number of times that a radio wave is completed within a particular period .
This makes the difference between radio waves and all other kinds of waves , including , Infrared radiation , Ultraviolet light , visible light , X - rays , and Microwaves , to mention a few .
Typical radio waves oscillate between 3 kHz to 300 GHz .
For you to get started with radio hacking , you must understand how the radio waves work and what frequencies you can tap into to get through the wave .
How radio hacking happens
History records that signal intrusion through radio hacking is not a new thing .
Some radio stations have suffered from hacking where hackers intercepted their frequencies to plant information to share with the public .
Luckily , for the incidences that have happened , hackers have made it clear that the stations had been hijacked .
When radio hacking happens , the people involved usually gain control over the kind of content that people access in a particular radiofrequency .
For example , if you are tuned in to your favorite radio station and you do not like the music they are playing , radio hacking would allow you to play the music of your choice .
While that may not be malicious enough , cybercriminals capitalize on radio hacking to intercept message transmission , in a bid to play a message to get a target person and make them act a certain way .
Even worse , radio hacking can be used to intercept communication in the security sector , like the military .
For hackers to get through radio transmissions , they have to set up a radio listening station to help gather information on whether or not the information thereof is of importance to them .
This step is necessary as one to ensure you are tapping into the correct radio frequency and decoding the hidden radio signals of the right transmission .
However , you can also hack a radio to pick up different frequencies and tap into various networks .
Once you are connected to the right radio wave , you can rebroadcast a series of codes into the frequency .
This way , you not only access all the information being transmitted through that frequency but also , sabotage the communication and launching an attack to cause havoc .
History records hackers who initiated a radio hacking that led to setting off an alarm in Dallas , Texas , which set off sirens that caused a great distraction in Dallas broadcast .
You will need to use Raspberry Pi and wire to get this done .
Using Raspberry
Pi for radio hacking
With Raspberry
Pi , it is easy to hack into a civilian FM radio frequency within 87.5 MHz to 108 MHz .
The Raspberry Pi’s general - purpose input - output ( GPIO ) pin allows you to broadcast in the radio spectrum by connecting to peripherals .
You can get through to one of the frequencies and transmit your messages to the audience of that radiofrequency .
You can share audio - based messages with the target audience , change the music , and if you take it a notch further with an app like rpitx , share slow - scan TV images .
However , even with Pi , you will need a wire to act as antennae to complete the broadcast signal intrusion .
The antenna usually acts as an FM modem for trading data between different devices .
Companies indulge in radio hacking to influence the beliefs of their target audience , against other businesses that play FM radio or vehicle radio systems .
The other advantage of radio hacking is that it allows you to convey your message directly to everyone tuned in to a radio frequency while retaining anonymity .
All this is highly beneficial to hackers because almost everyone has a radio , either at work , on their car or at home .
While talking about the dustup between David Letterman and Sarah Palin , Republican strategist John Feehery instantly tried to say that no one made jokes about Chelsea Clinton .
Contessa Brewer would n’t let that go and stopped him right in his tracks , which led Feehery to try and claim that Chelsea was n’t 14 when the jokes were being made .
Brewer then corrected that and reminded him , complete with finger wag and all , that Chelsea was only 12 .
Considering how offended Sarah Palin is by Letterman ’s jokes , I am sitting here wondering if she will boycott Rush Limbaugh now .
Ok you caught me – I ’m not wondering .
We all know the answer to that , just like we saw how she never seemed to worry about the “ jokes ” her former running - mate made about Chelsea .

Endeavour was to carry seven astronauts to the space station
The launch of space shuttle Endeavour has been cancelled due to a hydrogen leak , Nasa officials have announced .
Endeavour was due to take off from Cape Canaveral with seven astronauts at 0717 local time ( 1117 GMT ) , but launch was cancelled several hours beforehand .
The problem was discovered during fuelling , before the astronauts had donned their spacesuits .
The shuttle was to deliver equipment for space experiments , as well as drop off a new station crew member .
Mission controllers are expected to meet on Saturday to decide when to reschedule the launch .
Crew switch
The leak was found on the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate , which is attached to the shuttle 's external tank .
The leak is similar to one which grounded the Endeavour 's sister shuttle Discovery in March .
When it does launch , the ship will take three days to reach the International Space Station ( ISS ) , where six astronauts work .
With the shuttle 's seven crewmembers , it will mean there will then be 13 individuals at the platform - a new record .
Endeavour will carry its usual complement of seven astronauts Endeavour is due to deliver the final components of Japan 's Kibo laboratory .
During five scheduled spacewalks , an external platform will be added to the lab that will enable experiments to be performed that require materials to be exposed to the harsh environment of space .
Endeavour astronauts also need to fit equipment to the exterior of the platform such as batteries and a spare space - to - ground antenna .
Endeavour will deliver a new crew member ( Tim Kopra ) to the ISS and bring back another ( Koichi Wakata ) who has lived aboard the platform for more than three months .
When it does lift off , Endeavour will be making the 127th space shuttle flight , and the 29th to the station .

Extra votes haunt two recent elections , run by two different companies , in two different places
PLUS : Sequoia shocker !
Company agrees to turn over source code to D.C. without even a fight !
Brad Friedman Byon 6/8/2009 , 5:28 pm PT
Two stories of thousands of " phantom votes " being added to election result totals by electronic voting system were in the news over the past couple of days .
One is some news in the older story of 1,500 votes added to a precinct 's results in D.C. 's primary election last September .
The maker of the failed voting system , Sequoia Voting Systems , Inc. , originally tried to blame " static electricity " and then " human error " for the failure .
But as the D.C. City Council was having none of it , the company has now agreed to allow an independent inspection of its hardware and software , in order to avoid yet another expensive court battle for the beleaguered company .
The other story concerns nearly 5,000 " phantom " ballots added by the ES&S AutoMark optical - scan system used in last week 's Rapid City ( Pennington County ) , South Dakota , City Council race , for some still unknown reason , currently chalked up for now to " software glitch . "
The discovery of the failure led to a change in the originally reported election results .
The skinny on both stories , and an extra observation or two on the Sequoia / D.C. matter , follow below ...
The S. Dakota story first , from Wired 's Kim Zetter ...
A software glitch in an optical - scan voting system added nearly 5,000 ballots to the tally of a South Dakota election this week .
The error was discovered only after the election results were called , according to the Rapid City Journal .
The problem occurred when officials combined tallies from optical - scan machines in three precincts in Rapid City in Pennington County .
The tabulation software used to combine the totals added 4,875 phantom ballots to the count .
The system indicated 10,488 ballots were cast when , in reality , only 5,613 ballots existed , indicating that the glitch was n't simply a matter of doubling the votes .
...
The incumbent in a city council race who appeared to win the race went to bed believing he'd received just 49.96 percent of the vote , which was more than his opponents received but short of the 50 percent plus 1 vote he needed to avoid a runoff election .
A recount found that he actually received 51.8 percent of the votes .
Pennington County uses Auto - Mark machines and tabulation software from Election Systems and Software [ ES&S ] .
And back in D.C. where thousands of " phantom votes " were added in last year 's election , Sequoia is being forced to ...um... I mean , agreeing ... to turn over source code for independent examination , according to Tim Craig at WaPo ...
Sequoia Voting Systems agreed yesterday to turn over sensitive information to the D.C. Council about how the District 's voting machines work and tabulate results , setting the stage for one of the most comprehensive probes on the reliability of electronic voting equipment .
The agreement is a response to the election night chaos in the September primaries , when Sequoia machines tabulated more ballots than there were voters , resulting in thousands of phantom votes .
Electoral change advocates said the agreement , finalized yesterday in D.C. Superior Court after the city threatened a lawsuit , is one of the first times a manufacturer of electronic voting machines has been forced to endure a public vetting of how its equipment tabulates returns .
" It is certainly going to serve as a precedent not just for further investigations in the District of Columbia , but around the country , " said John Bonifaz , legal director for Voter Action , a national voting rights organization .
According to a copy of the agreement , the District will have access to technical information on the internal workings of the machines , known as the source code .
In the same story , there was an interesting shift in tone from Sequoia 's previously - incorrigible spokesperson , and denialist - in- chief , Michelle Shaffer ...
Michelle M. Shafer , vice president of communications and external affairs for Sequoia , said the company is " cooperating with the city council to resolve this matter without incurring further legal costs . "
" We would like to move past this and resolve this once and for all and do what we can to make sure voters in D.C. feel confident about their voting system , " Shafer said .
That statement is a pleasant , and noteworthy change of pace for Shafer .
VotersUnite.org 's Ellen Theisen asked over the weekend , in the ' Daily Voting News ' , while linking to our exposé from last year , revealing that Sequoia does n't actually own the Intellectual Property rights to their own systems ( despite arguing to protect them in court case after case ) ...
One of Sequoia 's original suggestions [ for the " phantom votes " in D.C. ] was that it was static discharge or human error .
But the DC Board of Elections did n't buy it .
They pursued , investigated , and finally decided to go to court .
Sequoia immediately caved .
Could it be because Sequoia does n't own the intellectual property rights ?
Frankly , given what we exposed here about Sequoia last year , I think they'd be ill - advised to try and make their IP - related " proprietary trade secrets " claims in court any more .
Particularly as the owner is the Venezuelan Chavez - tied firm that they told federal investigators they 'd entirely divested from .
Sequoia has also had serious cash issues over the past year , and the cost of continuously going to court to protect something they do n't even own --- in state after state , following failure after failure --- has got to be taking its toll .
If Shafer would like to inform us otherwise , of course , on any of this , she 's welcome to .
She long ago stopped responding to The BRAD BLOG 's requests for comment .
The most remarkable thing about Barack Obama 's fourth press conference , just concluded , was n't his semi - tougher tone on Iran , or his pleasingly sharp words for the private insurance industry or even his admission ( without specifics ) that he still sneaks the occasional smoke .
The most remarkable thing was that the best question – I mean far and away the best question – did n't come from a journalist .
A journalist conveyed it – Nico Pitney of the Huffington Post .
He was called on second .
As any political junkie knows , Pitney has been doing a fantastic job over the last several days aggregating hundreds of Tweets from Iran and doing his own original reporting , becoming a real go - to source for people wanting to stay up - to - the - minute on post- election developments .
So Obama called on Pitney and even shot him props for the job he 's been doing .
Then Pitney asked not his own question , but a question from an Iranian that he had solicited earlier : " Under which conditions would you accept the election of Ahmadinejad , and if you do accept it without any significant changes in the conditions there , is n't that a betrayal of the – of what the demonstrators there are working towards ? "
We 'll get to the substance of the question , but first it 's worth reflecting on the fact of it .
This is a Moment .
With the advent of television , politicians learned to go around the press and speak directly to the people .
But " the people " always meant , you know , the people of his own country .
Now , with social media , " the people " means the globe .
It 's kind of an amazing thing that this anonymous ( so far ) Iranian , sitting at home last night in Tehran or Shiraz or wherever it was , minding his or her own business , could convey a question to a journalist halfway across the world and that the question would end up being conveyed to the president of the United States .
It 's kind of an unsettling thing for the traditional media .
This Politico description of the moment is kind of snippy and huffy - puffy .
It notes that Obama broke protocol by calling on HuffPo that early .
And it describes the moment as a " clearly coordinated exchange " .
It was coordinated , obviously , insofar as Obama had Pitney on his list and knew , apparently , that Pitney would be conveying a question from Iran .
But that does n't mean Obama knew the specific question .
In fact the evidence suggests that he did n't know it , because he did n't really answer it ( presidents , I guess , can duck global citizens ' questions too ) .
It was an important and tough question that got right to the heart of the matter .
Where 's this going ?
One of these years , the " press conference " may give way to the " news conference " ( that is , no press involved ) , in which a president takes questions via social media from the people .
All the people everywhere .
It 's a new world .

Ancient Argentinian skeletons may help resolve a raging anthropological debate : whether or not early Americans came from a single original population .
" We do n’t know how people got to the New World , when , or who they were , " said anthropologist Judith Habicht - Mauche at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
" Those questions are very much up for grabs right now and very controversial . "
The controversy centers around two conflicting sets of data .
Studies of skull shapes noted that people in South America 14,000 years ago looked different from the people that were there 8,000 years ago and from modern Native Americans .
Some anthropologists think that means there were at least two migrations to South America .
The first group , Paleoamericans , had long narrow skulls and small eye sockets and was closely related to Northeast Asians .
The second , Amerindians , had short broad faces , larger eye sockets , and was related to Southeast Asians .
But the molecular data disagrees .
Studying modern people 's mitochondrial DNA , which is inherited from the mother , suggests all the Native Americans in South America split off from a single Northeast Asian group that migrated over about 15,000 years ago .
Now for the first time , anthropologists have put the same bones to both tests .
The verdict : The DNA is right .
There was a single ancestor , at least for the part of Argentina they studied .
The work , done by a group from the Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Buenos Aires , Argentina , was published in PLoS ONE Friday .
The team studied 8,000 - year - old bones from an archaeological site in east central Argentina called Arroyo Seco 2 .
They also used bones from three different historical periods found in other nearby sites to see how skull shape and mitochondrial DNA changed over time .
They ran the skulls through standard statistical analyses to compare their shapes to each other and to modern humans .
They focused mostly on facial features , which are thought to change less through the generations than other parts of the body .
" Facial structure is not as influenced by new environmental things , like cold or diet , " said anthropologist David Smith of the UC Davis .
" With facial data , you 're more on solid ground . "
To extract the DNA , they subjected the bones to some rough treatment .
To keep them from being contaminated with modern genetic material , the researchers soaked bones and teeth in hydrochloric acid , irradiated them with ultraviolet light , sand - blasted them , and powdered them in liquid nitrogen .
These are mostly standard procedures for DNA extraction , but very few researchers had used them on such old bones .
" It ’s really hard to extract mitochondrial DNA from old skeletons like that , and we have very few of them , " Haibcht - Mauche said .
" You probably could n’t do this in the United States .
People are n’t going to let you do destructive stuff on the oldest bones in North America . "
They found that , even though older skulls and newer skulls still looked different , they shared the same genetic markers .
This lends support to the idea that these ancient Argentinians had a single common ancestor .
" What that does is , it drops out an idea .
These guys who have different cranial features , these very earliest guys , they ’re not coming from a separate genetic pool , " Haibcht - Mauche said .
" Paleoamericans were the original guys . "
The group discussed several explanations for the difference in face shapes , including evolution in response to changes in climate and diet .
If the original population that entered South America was small before fanning out across the continent , the resulting groups of people could look very different while still being genetically related .
" Morphology is much more responsive to environmental pressure and selective pressure , " Smith said .
" With selection driving many different genes that affect the same feature , you can get very very rapid morphological change . "
" It always surprised me how when anthropologists measure the physical shape of these skulls and compare them to DNA and find they ’re different , they tend to ignore the possibility of evolution happening , " said Nate Dominy , an anthropologist at UC Santa Cruz .
" This paper basically calls attention to this and says ' Yeah , people are going to evolve to fit their own environmental circumstances . ' "
But anthropologists who study skull shapes caution against seeing DNA as a smoking gun .
" A misconception people have is that DNA will give you the truth , and anything else will give you an approximation of the truth , " said Christopher Stojanowski of Arizona State University .
" But different types of DNA might not give you the same answer . "
For instance , mitochondrial DNA and Y - chromosome DNA each only carry genetic information from one parent .
Studying only one of them only tells half the story .
" It really is important to continue with both types of research , " Stojanowski said .
" It ’s important to embrace disparities that arise when you do different types of data analyses , rather than assume that this indicates necessarily that one is wrong .

This is the second part of a series “ All about types ” in Javascript .
Automatic type conversion
You have seen it before :
var element = document.getElementById( " someId " ) ; if ( element ) { // do something }
That ’s an automatic type conversion .
The if - statement expects a boolean value , and if the given expression does not return one , the result is converted .
document.getElementById either returns an object or null .
Null is converted to false , any object to true .
That ’s why constructions as the above work .
In general , every time an operator or a statement expects a value of a certain type but a different type is given , automatic type conversion occurs .
There are several statements that require some special type and do type conversion when neccessary .
That ’s the if - statement , while and do - while and the for - statement .
They all require booleans , so other types are converted to boolean .
The most common operators are the mathematical operators , such as + and - , and the comparison operator == ( and their comrades += , -= etc. and != ) .
I will cover the uglier operators first .
Automatic type conversion when dealing with the + operator
The + operator is an ugly element of Javascript .
While it ’s also overloaded in other languages , it ’s also clear ( and intuitive ) what happens there .
That ’s different from Javascript .
What ’s the intuitive way to add a boolean to an object ?
Is there any way to define some semantics for adding a boolean to an object ?
I ca n’t think of one .
Yet it can be done in Javascript .
When dealing with two numbers , the + operator adds these .
When dealing with two strings , it concatenates .
3 + 5 ; // 8 " hello " + " world " ; // " hello world " " 3 " + " 5 " ; // " 35 "
When one operand is a string and the other is not , the other is converted to a string and the result is concatenated .
" the answer is " + 42 ; // " the answer is 42 " " this is " + true ; // " this is true " var a ; " a is " + a ; // " a is undefined "
In any other case ( except for Dates ) the operands are converted to numbers and the results are added .
1 + true ; // -> 1 + 1 -> 2 null + false ; // -> 0 + 0 -> 0
Dates for some reason are converted to strings , and thus the two operands are concatenated .
new Date ( ) + 86400000 ; // that 's not adding one day to date ! // that results in " Tue May 19 2009 10:46:30 GMT+020086400000 " or something
The comparison operator ==
The first book on javascript that I read was ppk on JavaScript .
There I read [ … ]
An empty String ” becomes false .
All other values become true . .
Of course I had to test this by myself and tried to convert the string “ 0 ” to a boolean .
How do you know if this converts to true ?
Compare it !
( No , actually not .
Do n’t repeat my mistake .
Read the next part of this series about how to explicitly convert types . )
So I did this :
" 0 " == true ; // do n't do this
To my surprise this evaluated to false .
I even wrote an email to ppk to point out that error in his book , which I find quite embarassing by now .
The reason behind that is the unexpected ruleset of type conversion using the comparison operator .
In my case I expected it to convert the string “ 0 ” to a boolean , but it did not .
Actually , the boolean was converted to a number .
Yes , to a number .
In the next step “ 0 ” was converted to a number as well .
Therefore these were the steps taken :
" 0 " == true ; // first step : convert true to a number " 0 " == 1 ; // second step : convert " 0 " to a number 0 == 1 ; // last step : compare false ;
That tought me a lot about javascript .
If you compare two values of the same type using the comparison operator no type conversion is done ( although the results sometimes are surprising , I might cover this in an own article ) .
So it comes down to compare two values of different types .
The first rule is : null and undefined are equal .
null == undefined ; // true
The second rule is : when in doubt convert to number .
If you compare a string and a number , convert the string to a number .
If you compare a boolean to something else , convert the boolean to a number .
On the other hand , if you compare an object to something else , convert it to a primitive by calling its valueOf method ( and if that does not return a primitive call toString ) and go on .
The Date object is different of course .
Its valueOf normally returns a number , yet in combination with the comparison operator it returns a string representation .
This table shows it all .
Note that the comparison operator is commutative , that means x == y and y == x return the same value .
It is said that when the 20th century is long gone , it will be remembered for two revolutionary theories – those of relativity and quantum physics .
While both have led to a deeper understanding of our world , quantum physics stands alone in its profound weirdness – the ability to accurately predict totally counter - intuitive aspects of the physical world .
From the simple indisputable oddity of the double slit experiment to the philosophical implications of Schrodinger ’s cat , it becomes clear that we still understand very little of the actual mechanics of our world .
When explanations are lacking , the mystical is often brought up to fill the void .
This has degenerated today into complete pop-psychology crap such as The Secret or What the Bleep Do We Know , but the role that human consciousness plays as an “ observer ” , if any , was considered very early by the founders of these theories .
These arguments brought forth by some of the finest thinkers of our time echo to this day .
Niels Bohr
Winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 , employed by the Manhattan Project , and father of the Bohr model familiar to every high school student , Niels Bohr was first accused by Einstein of introducing “ mystic ” elements in his explanation of quantum physics – mystic elements which in Einstein ’s view had no place in science .
This was part of the famous Bohr - Einstein debates , and was perhaps not a fair criticism .
Bohr appeared to not worry excessively about the “ reality ” underpinning the equations of quantum theory , and was simply more concerned about the equations of quantum theory rather than their implications .
He rejected the hypothesis that the wave function collapse requires a conscious observer , insisting that “ It still makes no difference whether the observer is a man , an animal , or a piece of apparatus ” .
His view is perhaps best summarized in the following quote recalled by Heisenberg :
This argument looks highly convincing at first sight .
We can admittedly find nothing in physics or chemistry that has even a remote bearing on consciousness .
Yet all of us know that there is such a thing as consciousness , simply because we have it ourselves .
Hence consciousness must be part of nature , or , more generally , of reality , which means that , quite apart from the laws of physics and chemistry , as laid down in quantum theory , we must also consider laws of quite a different kind .
But even here I do not really know whether we need greater freedom than we already enjoy thanks to the concept of complementarity .
In short , if the numbers work out , do n’t worry too much .
Wolfgang Pauli
But some did worry .
Pauli was a skeptic ’s skeptic – a man so dedicated to rationality it led him down a strange path .
In 1927 the Solvay Conference was busy reaching consensus that Bohr ’s approach was the best way to regard quantum physics ( the Cophenhagen Interpretation ) , but Pauli was equally confident in a different interpretation .
He tried to trace out just what part of consciousness it is that seems to prevent an in - depth , rational understanding .
Deeply influenced by Schopenhauer ’s The World as Will and Representation , Pauli appropriated his concept of a will “ which breaks through space and time ” .
He viewed that the acquisition of knowledge in mathematics or quantum physics “ gives rise , however , to a situation transcending natural science ” that can even acquire a “ religious function ” in human experience .
This is not a belief in the religions of old , but as Pauli states “ I do not believe in the possible future of mysticism in the old form .
However , I do believe that the natural sciences will out of themselves bring forth a counter pole in their adherents , which connects to the old mystic elements . ”
Perhaps the most interesting viewpoint on Pauli was that of Heisenberg , who viewed Pauli ’s paradigm as even more rational than Bohr ’s equation - focused approach because only he acknowledged that the scientific evidence pointed to something pre-rational or ‘ mystical ’ .
Pauli claimed that consciousness was presented philosophically by mystics and studied scientifically by psychologists .
With the advent of quantum mechanics , physicists should then be able to unify both approaches .
Unfortunately , we continue to wait .
Albert Einstein
Einstein was a scientific superstar , with fame not equalled to this day .
One day , a quote was making the round in British newspapers that Einstein subscribed to the theory that “ the outer world is a derivative of consciousness ” .
His response was swift and critical .
No physicist believes that .
Otherwise he would n’t be a physicist .
Neither do [ Eddington and Jeans ] .
. . .
These men are genuine scientists and their literary formulations must not be taken as expressive of their scientific convictions .
Why should anybody go to the trouble of gazing at the stars if he did not believe that the stars were really there ?
Einstein ’s opposition to Bohr ’s view or more “ mystical ” approaches is often cast as the great divide between the philisophies of idealism and those philosophies based on realism .
Pauli often referred to Einstein ’s “ philosophical prejudice ” assuming that reality is independent of any mind .
In fact , his approach and objections were far more subtle .
His major concern was the incredibly subjective aspect of consciousness introducing an unmeasurable “ geist ” , and this clash with the precise and well defined philosophical principles of physics such as locality or determinism .
This led to Einstein ’s famous attempt at “ breaking ” quantum physics , the EPR paradox .
At first a thought experiment which appeared to demonstrate quantum physics violating the seemingly well established principle of locality , later experiments showed that quantum physics instead proved locality false .
Violations of locality and determinism seemed to bother Einstein greatly , and this can be seen in his famous quote objecting to the randomness involved in wave function collapse under Bohr ’s interpretation , that “ God does not play dice ” .
Bohr , summing up the debate perfectly , replied “ Einstein , stop telling God what to do with his dice . ”
John von Neumann
The “ last of the great mathematicians ” , von Neumann solved one of the great problems of quantum theory .
While the theory itself was established and experimentally verified , it lacked a “ deep ” mathematical understanding based on an axiomatic approach .
He treated the world as a Hilbert space , an infinite dimensional structure .
While classical mechanics approached the world as a collection of points with six different characteristics ( position and momentum along the x , y , and z axis ) , von Neumann ’s approach considers a quantum system as a point in infinite dimensional space , corresponding to the infinite amount of possible outcomes .
This led to very interesting implications in terms of “ measurement ” .
While the “ measurement ” of a classical system simply involved finding one or more of those six values , the “ measurement ” of a quantum system involved mathematical operators acting on an infinite amount of values to produce a finite measurement .
The interesting conclusion arises when we consider the “ real ” interpretation of these mathematical operators .
While we may say that an scientific instrument has caused wave function collapse , we run into the problem that no physical system ( and a scientific instrument is a physical system completely described by quantum mechanics ) can cause wave function collapse .
We can describe the entire ensemble perfectly as a Hilbert space .
But we do not experience this Hilbert space – we measure and experience only finite values .
The conclusion von Neumann reached is that consciousness , whatever it is , appears to be the only thing in physics that can ultimately cause this collapse or observation .
This does not mean that consciousness is “ required ” for the universe to work , but that wave function collapse appears to be caused by consciousness and we observe only a tiny slice .
We are therefore an “ abstract ego ” acting as a measurement device on the infinite values of true reality .
Today
Today , the argument has largely died down , a combination of practicality and lack of any suitably shocking experimental results .
The majority of physicists today take the approach of “ it works ” , namely that quantum physics produces accurate predictions of the real world and that the mathematical formalism is just that – a mathematical formalism that produces accurate results .
It may not reflect the true reality of the world ( whatever it is ) , but it is suitably accurate to any level of precision that we are physically able to obtain .
One may stay awake at night wondering “ why ” , but one will not get much work done with this approach .
Perhaps more clarity lies in the future , but in the meantime – we will have to tolerate crap that tells us we can “ will ” our way to riches with quantum mechanics ( and coincidentally make the authors rather rich , will indeed ) instead of a rational approach dedicated to the pursuit of truth .
HELSINKI , March 31 ( Reuters ) - Microsoft last week lost European browser market leadership for the first time in years , when Mozilla ’s Firefox 3 took the top spot from Internet Explorer 7 , Web analytics firm StatCounter said on Tuesday .
Mozilla Foundation 's Firefox 3 had 35.05 percent of the European Web browser market last week , followed by Internet Explorer 7 MSFT.O with 34.54 percent .
“ The move is partly explained by a small switch from Internet Explorer 7 usage to Internet Explorer 8 , but also by growing market share overall by Firefox 3 , ” Aodhan Cullen , the chief executive of StatCounter , said in a statement .
“ The data shows that Firefox is closing the gap and is now just 10 percent behind all Internet Explorer versions in Europe , ” Cullen said .
In February Internet Explorer 7 had a global market share of 41 percent , followed by Firefox 3 with 24 percent , according to StatCounter .

The next FreeBSD point release is almost done .
Late Friday , developers released the second release candidate for FreeBSD 7.2 which is supposed to be the final RC before this release reaches general availability on May 4th .
RC2 comes three weeks after the Beta release of FreeBSD 7.2 , and it looks to me like this release is on track .
There is one item that developers noted might be an issue with the RC2 .
There is one known issue with 7.2- RC2 .
We switched from KDE3 to KDE4
and during my tests done before uploading the images a problem with
package dependencies for KDE4 was discovered , " FreeBSD developer Ken Smith wrote .
For the most part FreeBSD from my point of view looks like an incremental update , though on the desktop side the KDE shift is a big one .
That said , most FreeBSD users are likely to be using it as a server where KDE version 3 or 4 is n't a issue .
PC - BSD , the desktop derivative of FreeBSD recently came out with its 7.1 release which included KDE 4.2.2 as its default .
A project aimed at pigeon - holing the Australian population has found that new car buyers are more likely to live in outer suburbs than inner-city areas .
And upper - income , lifestyle - focused families are more likely to splash out on a new vehicle than those who closely manage their money .
Roy Morgan research polled more than 50,000 people before breaking them down into demographic groups under a program dubbed Helix Personas .
“ Leading lifestyle ” households with an income of around $ 117,000 per year were the broad social group most likely to consider new cars .
Delving deeper into the data , researchers found that “ Self - made lifestylers ” , career - focused high - earning professionals with a household income of around $ 145,000 , were the most likely to splash out on new wheels .
Jordan Pakes , automotive account director for Roy Morgan Research , says the group for the most part owned their own homes and had not migrated from overseas .
“ Self - Made Lifestylers account for 1.6 per cent of the Australian population , but around 2.7 per cent of the new car intender market , ” he says .
“ They can be found in Williamstown , Templestowe and Mount Eliza in Melbourne , and Cherrybrook , Caringbah and Illawong in Sydney . ”
The group are considered likely to admire “ visible achievements ” and social standing over values such as fairness or conservation .
Nicholas Tynan , sales manager at the Tynan Motors group of new car dealers in Sydney ’s Sutherland Shire , says the region has “ always been an area of growth and an area of boom ” .
Tynan says falling new car prices were an added incentive for middle - class suburbs .
“ Some of it would be from the cost of new cars .
Cars are becoming much more affordable .
“ I was selling the Jeep Grand Cherokee five or six years ago , when the SRT model was $ 115,000 .
“ These days that car is $ 88,000 loaded with everything . ”
Pakes says Mazda was on the top of shopping lists for regular cars , while Audi was the premium brand most likely to be considered .
The survey data suggests that “ Savvy self - starters ” , a multicultural group that values education , were considerably less likely to buy a new car compared to the general population .

When Bill O’Reilly ’s camera crew ambushed Mike Hoyt at a bus stop in Teaneck , N.J. , a few months ago , the on-camera confrontation and the microphone in his face reminded him , oddly enough , of the “ 60 Minutes ” interviewer Mike Wallace .
Mr. Hoyt , executive editor of The Columbia Journalism Review , was well - versed in the venerable art of the on - camera , on - the - street confrontation , perfected by Mr. Wallace and other hard - charging television journalists in decades past .
Now , in an appropriation of Mr. Wallace ’s techniques , ambush interviews have become a distinguishing feature of Mr. O’Reilly ’s program on the Fox News Channel .
Mr. Hoyt , one of more than 50 people that Mr. O’Reilly ’s young producers have confronted in the past three years , said the interviews were “ really just an attempt to make you look bad . ”
In almost every case Mr. O’Reilly uses the aggressive interviews to campaign for his point of view .
Mr. O’Reilly , the right - leaning commentator who has had the highest - rated cable show for about eight years , has called the interviews a way to hold people accountable for their actions .
“ When the bad guys wo n’t comment , when they run and hide , we will find them , ” he said on “ The O’Reilly Factor ” recently .

Seriously , I bow to President John " Beach Boys " McCain who has faithfully continued the War In Iran ( and , before you say it , OF COURSE , I 'm as disturbed as anyone about the awful but unavoidable photos of dead children and the rape scandal currently coming out of the detention camp in Tehran ) , because we now see that without such senseless loss of human life it'd not be possible for us to see images like THIS ...

Here 's hoping we 've learned our lesson and follow their lead on health care reform !
So much for agreeing on the denunciation of violence against health care workers .
A Republican Senator has put a hold on a Senate resolution condemning such violence because it mentions those scary words : " reproductive health . "
So much for agreeing on at least one basic premise in the debate about choice , reproductive rights , or even reproductive health .
Yesterday , a Republican Senator used his power to put a “ hold ” on a Senate Resolution originally introduced by U.S .
Senators Jeanne Shaheen ( D - NH ) , Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , and Amy Klobuchar
( D - MN ) condemning violence against women ’s health providers , thereby blocking any vote on the resolution .
Senators have the power to do this anonymously and with no explanation .
This way , Republicans can get away with sorrowful expressions to the media on violence , but do n’t have to be put to the test of actually voting to denounce the violence against either Dr. Tiller or clinic workers generally .
My use of the male pronoun here is deliberate :
The odds are overwhelming it is a male Republican Senator , as Senator Snowe is a co-sponsor , and that leaves only three female Republicans , Murkowski , Hutchinson , and Collins .
The resolution , written and intended to be non-controversial , condemned the use of
violence against providers of women ’s health care services .
This condemnation of violence is apparently too much for some Republicans to bear .

“ I realize that the issue of reproductive choice is divisive and that
there are many heartfelt feelings on both sides of the aisle , ” said
Senator Shaheen .
However , I was hopeful that , regardless of our differences of
opinion on this sensitive issue , the Senate could come together and pass
a resolution that rejects the use of violence against women ’s health
care providers .
It is a sad day when the elected leaders of the
greatest Democracy on earth can’t agree to protect those exercising
their constitutional rights .
Sad indeed .
And i would add disgraceful .
And telling .
And honestly ?
I find it disgusting .
What does this resolution say that is so controversial it can not be brought to a vote ?
The full text of Senate Resolution 187 ( Condemning the use of violence against providers of health care services ) reads as follows :
Whereas Dr. George Tiller of Wichita , Kansas was shot to death at church
on Sunday , May 31 ;
Whereas there is a history of violence against providers of reproductive
health care , as health care employees have suffered threats and
hostility in order to provide crucial services to patients ;
Whereas the threat or use of force or physical obstruction has been used
to injure , intimidate , or interfere with individuals seeking to obtain
or provide health care services ; and Whereas acts of violence are never an acceptable means of expression and
always shall be condemned : Now , therefore , be it
Resolved , That the Senate —
(1) Expresses great sympathy for the family , friends and patients of
Dr. George Tiller ;
(2) Recognizes that acts of violence should never be used to prevent
women from receiving reproductive health care ; and
(3) Condemns the use of violence as a means of resolving differences
of opinion .
Original co-sponsors of the resolution first introduced by Shaheen , Boxer , and Klobuchar included 43 additional Senators , including : Murray ; Durbin ; Dodd ;
Schumer ; Lautenberg ; Mikulski ; Landrieu ; Gillibrand ; Harkin ; Carper ;
Sanders ; Kaufman ; Wyden ; Kerry ; Lieberman ; Tom Udall ; Levin ; Brown ;
Whitehouse ; Burris ; Mark Udall ; Stabenow ; Baucus ; Cantwell ; Bingaman ;
Inouye ; Cardin ; Specter ; Johnson ; Feingold ; Leahy ; Tester ; Snowe ;
Begich ; Akaka ; Bennet ; Feinstein ; Warner ; McCaskill ; Reed ; Kennedy ,
Lincoln ; and Merkley .
Republicans objected to the resolution from the start , urged its sponsors to eliminate references to reproductive health .
“ The
resolution faced objection by some colleagues on the other side of the
aisle , and the Senators were urged to eliminate references to women’s
reproductive health care in order to unanimously pass the resolution , ” stated a press release on the issue .
“ Everyone has the right to work for changes in the law , but there is no
place for violence in any of our debates , ” said Boxer .
To assault a
health care worker , a patient or anyone else because of a disagreement
about an issue , regardless of how contentious , brings all of humanity
down into a dark pit of violence .
Klobuchar added :
As a former prosecutor I have seen how acts of violence can tear apart
communities .
No matter how heated the debate or how
great our differences , violence is never the answer .
Supporting a
bipartisan bill that denounces the use of violence is basic common sense
and we need to pass this without further delay .
Last week , the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a
resolution condemning violence in places of worship .
Shaheen , Boxer and
Klobuchar were asked adopt the House language in the Senate , but decided
to move forward with their resolution , as they feel condemning violence
against women ’s health care providers and agreeing not to use violence
as a means of resolving differences are not objectionable viewpoints .
Well , apparently , they were wrong .
Apparently , there is no common ground in the Senate on not using violence where women ’s health is concerned .
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other .
- Abraham Lincoln
A lesson everyone must learn is the need to persist when it is difficult .
When we experience defeat and rejection , the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit , but the successful have learned to persist .
Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield
Before Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield became the bestselling authors of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series , which has now sold over 100 million copies , they were rejected by 140 publishers .
They were told by their agent , “ I ca n’t sell this book — I ’m giving it back to you guys . ”
The Wright Brothers
Before the Wright brothers became the inventors of modern aviation , they had thousands of failed experiments and glides .
Orville Wright wrote , “ Our first experiments were rather disappointing .
The machine at times seemed to be entirely beyond control ” ( Wilbur Wright , Orville Wright , Octave Chanute , and Marvin Wilks McFarland , The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright : 1899 -1905 , ( McGraw - Hill , 1953 ) p. 75 ) .
Stephen R. Covey
Stephen R. Covey , author the The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People , created one of the largest leadership development companies in the world .
Before the company was worth $ 160 million , the company endured 11 straight years of negative cash flow .
The company had nothing in the bank , they were totally extended on their accounts payable , and their credit lines were maxed out .
Their “ debt to tangible net worth ” ratio was 223 to 1 .
Over the next two and a half years , the company value grew to a worth of $ 160 million ( Stephen M.R. Covey , The Speed of Trust , ( New York : Free Press , 2006 ) p. 109 ) .
Sam Walton
Before Sam Walton founded Wal - Mart , he lost his first store , a Ben Franklin variety store , after 5 years of hard work .
Sam Walton wrote of the experience , “ It was the low point of my business life .
I felt sick to my stomach .
I could n’t believe it was happening to me .
It really was a nightmare .
I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community — done everything right — and now I was being kicked out of town .
It did n’t seem fair .
. .
I ’ve always thought of problems as challenges , and this one was n’t any different .
. .
The challenge at hand was simple enough to figure out : I had to pick myself up and get on with it , do it all over again , only even better this time .
. .
I had a chance for a brand - new start , and this time I knew what I was doing ” ( Sam Walton , Sam Walton , ( New York : Doubleday , 1992 ) p. 30 - 31 ) .
Walt Disney
Walt Disney suffered a devastating setback in 1928 ; a blow so harsh that his career seemed about to disintegrate .
He lost his first successful cartoon creation , “ Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , ” because he had naively signed away the ownership rights .
Emerging empty - handed from the debacle , Disney did n’t quit .
He continued to work and his next creation was Mickey Mouse ( Daniel Gross , Forbes Greatest Business Stories of All Times , ( New York : John Wiley & Sons , 1996 ) p. 123 ) .
Colonel Sanders
Before Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC ) was one of the world ’s largest restaurants , Colonel Sanders drove all across the country from restaurant to restaurant cooking batches of chicken for restaurant owners and their employees looking for someone willing to purchase his chicken recipe .
Colonel Sanders persisted through 1,009 rejections until he got a ‘ yes ’( Anthony Robbins , Unlimited Power , ( New York : Simon & Schuster , 1986 ) p. 14 ) .
After his first ‘ yes , ’ his franchising idea began to take off .
By 1964 , at age 74 , Colonel Sanders had more than 600 franchised outlets for his chicken in the United States and Canada , and he sold his interest in the U.S. Company for $ 2 million ( $ 13 million in 2006 dollars ) .
KFC now does billions in sales each year and serves millions of customers daily in over 13,000 restaurants in 80 countries .
Sylvester Stallone
Before Sylvester Stallone was a famous writer and actor , he was rejected by over 600 casting agents and was unable to sell his first 8 screen plays .
In 1975 , Stallone saw a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner in which Wepner was a 30:1 underdog .
Inspired by this fight , Stallone began developing the Rocky screenplay .
The script was purchased by United Artists and opened in theaters on November 21 , 1976 .
Rocky took in $ 117 million ( $ 389 million in 2006 dollars ) in U.S. box office sales , with Stallone making more than $ 5 million ( $ 16.6 million in 2006 dollars ) .
Conclusion
There are no failures in life , only those who quit before success .
Failure is a part of learning .
The formula for success is trying until you succeed .
If you give up during the struggle , you will never experience the victory .

NAZRAN , Russia ( Reuters ) -
The head of Russia ’s Muslim region of Ingushetia was seriously injured on Monday in a suicide bomb attack that weakened the Kremlin ’s fragile grip on the North Caucasus .
The bomber detonated explosives as Ingush President Yunus - Bek Yevkurov ’s convoy drove by on his way to work at about 8:30 a.m. local time , the local prosecutor said in a statement .
The president ’s driver was killed and three others were wounded .
The blast wrecked his armored Mercedes and gouged a 2 - meter ( 6ft ) crater in the road , a witness told Reuters .
Yevkurov , 45 , was rushed to hospital in Nazran , the largest city , where he underwent surgery .
A doctor said he was on an artificial respirator .
A presidential aide said he was conscious and his life was “ not yet ” in danger .
President Dmitry Medvedev condemned the attack on Yevkurov , a Kremlin appointee , as a “ terrorist act ” and vowed a “ direct and severe ” response .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , marking the anniversary of Russia ’s entry into World War Two , said the attackers were “ on a par with the Nazis . ”
Ingushetia has taken over from its neighbor Chechnya as the main center of violence along Russia ’s turbulent southern flank , challenging the Kremlin ’s rule and , security forces say , providing a foothold for global networks of Islamist militants .
“ Today ’s action was an attempt to ... destabilize the situation , ” the head of the FSB domestic intelligence service , Alexander Bortnikov , told Medvedev .

No one claimed responsibility for the attack .
STRONG EXPLOSION
The explosion ripped roof tiles off a nearby house and dislodged bricks from walls .
Television pictures showed a burned - out wreck of a car in a ditch at the side of the road .
Doctors said Yevkurov had suffered head injuries , burns and damage to internal organs and decided he should be flown to Moscow for more treatment .
A hospital doctor , who asked not to be identified , said the blast was so strong that “ it is hard to see how anyone could have survived . ”
Ingush presidential press secretary Kaloi Akhilgov , who said he was with the president in hospital , said Yevkurov “ has injuries of medium gravity .
He is conscious . ”
Asked if the president ’s life was in danger , Akhilgov said : “ No , not yet . ”
The smallest of Russia ’s regions in size , Ingushetia has a population of around half a million people who rank among the poorest in the country .
Corruption , poverty and violence plague the region .

Medvedev appointed highly decorated ex-paratroop officer Yevkurov as president in October , replacing former secret police officer Murat Zyazikov who was blamed by critics for fanning an insurgency with heavy - handed measures by special services .
Rebels tried to assassinate Zyazikov on the same stretch of road in 2004 , local officials said .
An ethnic Ingush , Yevkurov was the commander of Russian troops who took control of Pristina airport in Kosovo in 1999 after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia .
“ While there were assassinations before and the level of this very targeted terrorism was obviously increasing , both in Ingushetia and Dagestan , this is out of the range of expectations , ” said Oslo - based International Peace Research Institute analyst Pavel Baev .

Nearly four decades after astronaut Neil Armstrong planted his boot on the surface of the moon , the U.S. is about to take the first small step toward colonizing Earth ’s tag - along satellite .
On Wednesday , NASA is scheduled to launch a robotic mission aimed at finding the best site for Earth ’s first off - world colony , the centuries - old dream of science fiction writers and utopians .
This time , we ’re not just going for a walkabout or to hit golf balls and cruise around in a $ 10 - million moon buggy , as the Apollo astronauts did .
Ultimately , we hope to pack up the kids and the dog and move in .
“ We ’re going to provide NASA with what is needed to get human beings back to the moon and to stay there for an extended duration , ” said Craig Tooley , project manager for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , one part of the two - pronged mission .
Advertisement
The orbiter itself is expected to produce the most detailed topographic maps of the moon ever made , as well as first - ever glimpses inside perpetually shadowed craters at the north and south poles .
Inside those craters , scientists hope to find caches of frozen water that have been hidden away for billions of years .
The mission wo n’t stop there .
Using a second spacecraft -- the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite -- NASA is planning to punch a hole in one to see what comes out .
Both of the spacecraft will be launched together with a two - stage rocket , and nearly four months from now , the agency will use the spent second stage of the rocket as a battering ram to create a crater 66 feet wide by 13 feet deep and send a 6 - mile - high plume wafting into space that should provide a show for hobbyists on Earth with decent - sized telescopes .
“ This should be spectacular , ” said Tony Colaprete , the satellite ’s project scientist .
“ It should be a very visible impact from Earth . ”
Advertisement
The biggest uncertainty hanging over the $ 579 - million mission as it prepares for launch at Cape Canaveral in Florida is the question of whether the lunar outpost will ever be built .
The plan for a lunar colony was developed as a consequence of President George W. Bush ’s 2004 Vision for Space Exploration , which proposed putting human beings back on the moon by 2020 .
That plan also called for using the moon as a jumping - off point for a still more ambitious plan to put astronauts on Mars .
But President Obama has not endorsed the Bush vision .
The administration ’s recent decision ordering a review of the future of human spaceflight stirred anxieties in the passionate space community .
Some observers wonder whether Obama is setting the stage for a pullback from Bush ’s grand vision to a much more limited one -- similar to the one that led NASA to abandon the moon in the ‘ 70s in favor of the much - derided space shuttle program .

In his May 19 testimony to a Senate science subcommittee , Christopher Scolese , acting NASA administrator , indicated that he was well aware the long - term plan for humans to colonize other worlds could be in danger .
He took note of the fact that “ the administration will provide an updated request for exploration activities , as necessary . ”
“ In the meantime , ” he said , “ NASA is proceeding as planned with current exploration activities , including . . . lunar systems . ”
An hour after launch on Wednesday , the 4,000 - pound reconnaissance orbiter will separate from the crater - sensing satellite and rocket portions of the spacecraft .
After a nearly five - day cruise , it will use a dozen guidance thrusters to settle into orbit about 30 miles above the lunar surface , which is much more of a mystery than many might think .
Other than the equatorial area explored by the Apollo missions , “ images of the rest of the moon are pretty poor , ” Tooley said .
“ We have much better images of Mars than the moon . ”

The problem is particularly acute at the poles , where the current maps can be off as much as 10 miles , even though the current NASA plan calls for establishing the outpost at one of the poles .
The poles have areas of perpetual sunlight and perpetual shade .
The sunlight would be useful as a source of solar power for colonists .
The shaded areas may feature deposits of ice that have been locked up for billions of years .
Such ice could be used not just as a source of water .
Through electrolysis , it could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen .
The oxygen could be used both for respiration and to make rocket fuel for trips back and forth to Earth .
But there ’s no definitive proof ice is there .
The possible presence of water on the moon “ is a hotly and passionately debated topic , ” Tooley said .
Tantalizing clues point in both directions .
One of the most persuasive came from the 1998 Lunar Prospector mission , which detected large stores of hydrogen in sunken craters , where the temperature never rises above minus 270 degrees .
Yet , recent efforts to find water with other international satellites orbiting the moon have failed .
Advertisement
The current mission aims to answer that question and strip away the last shrouds of mystery from the moon .
The lunar orbiter carries seven instruments , among them a set of cameras that can resolve features as small as 18 inches across , the size of a small boulder .
A laser altimeter will bounce beams off the surface to create a detailed view of the landscape -- mountains , ridges and valleys .
An instrument dubbed CRaTER will measure the radiation environment .
NASA has long known that exposure to cosmic and solar radiation is a hazard for anyone living on the lunar surface .
“ If we ’re going to stay on the moon a long time , we ’re going to have to figure out how to protect ourselves , ” Tooley said .
Advertisement
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will have a good chance of finding water , if it ’s there .
But sometimes , nothing beats getting your hands dirty , and that ’s where the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite comes in .
After the orbiter parts company with the satellite and rocket shortly after launch , the crater - busting combo will go into a looping Earth orbit to line up a space - based knockout blow to the moon .
The punch will be delivered by the second - stage of the Atlas V rocket ( by then devoid of fuel ) , called a Centaur .
After sling - shotting around the Earth to gain momentum and achieve the highest possible angle for its plunge into the moon , the SUV - sized Centaur will barrel into the targeted crater on the morning of Oct. 8 at about 5,600 mph .
It will shatter any surface ice and send up a huge plume of dust .
Four minutes after the collision , the accompanying satellite will fly through the debris to take measurements of the chemical composition .
Any water blasted out of the crater will quickly decompose .
But the satellite carries among its nine instruments a set of visible light and infrared cameras , as well as spectrometers , specifically designed to spot the decomposing chemicals .
After flying through the cloud , the satellite will crash into the lunar surface some distance away .
Miles above , watching the drama unfold , will be the reconnaissance orbiter .
Advertisement
And a bit farther away , down on terra firma , hobbyists by the thousands will be training their telescopes on the moon ’s underbelly .
NASA still has n’t decided which crater to pummel .
It must be shallow enough that the material blasted out can rise above the rim so the spacecraft can fly through it to take measurements , Colaprete said .
NASA wo n’t settle on a target until 30 days before impact , when it will have the orbiter ’s measurements to help guide the choice .
It could take months to unravel what the spacecraft finds .
But if it turns up unequivocal proof of water on a purportedly dead world , no one is going to sit on that bombshell .

“ If we hit a high concentration of water , we will report that as soon as we can , ” Colaprete said .

INDIANAPOLIS 
It ’s unlikely that any group of professionals is happier to highlight the dullness of their work than small - town bankers .
At a recent conference held here by the Indiana Bankers Association , attendees said it over and over : our business is plodding and boring and we would not have it any other way .
“ Banking should not be exciting , ” said Clay W. Ewing , president of retail financial services at German American Bancorp , a community bank in Jasper .
“ If banking gets exciting , there is something wrong with it . ”
It is an ethos squarely at odds with the risk - addicted style of megabanks , like Citigroup and Bank of America , that trafficked in the subprime mortgages and complex financial products that helped drive the country into the grimmest recession in decades .
His arm flails away from the counter several times before he 's able to direct the sugar dispenser over the cup .
The spoon twitches in his hand , banging against the sides of the mug .
Gamble pauses mid-sentence , unable to remember the ending of the story he just began telling .
Gamble takes a sip of tea and politely excuses himself .
He shuffles to the door , climbs down two steps and plops down on the hood of the cherry red Porsche sitting in the driveway of his Liverpool home .
He pulls a small marijuana pipe out of his pocket , brings it to his lips and inhales deeply .
A look of relief flashes across Gamble 's face .
He also looks a little guilty .
" Every time I light that pipe , I feel like a criminal , " Gamble says .
" I should n't have to .
I 'm way too sick for that . "
A few puffs later and the change in Gamble is striking .
The tension in his limbs lessens .
His gait improves .
He speaks clearly and freely .
" What am I supposed to do ? "
Gamble asks , almost pleading for approval .
" Marijuana makes my life a little livable .
I do n't get stoned .
I do n't get that euphoric feeling .
It just helps the tremors . "
Two years ago , Gamble was diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis .
Unlike other forms of the disease , Gamble 's type of MS promises a steady progression of disability without relapse or remission .
There is no cure .
Gamble remembers the exact moment he knew he was sick .
He was flying a jet , doing 600 mph and climbing to 36,000 feet when his body went numb from the neck down .
Before being diagnosed , Gamble spent most of his waking hours flying : first , as an Army paratrooper , then as a transport pilot .
During his almost 13 years in aviation , he flew the bodies of dead soldiers home to their families , carried travelers to their destinations as a commercial pilot for US Airways and shuttled celebrities , dignitaries and politicians to events on private planes .
" Now it 's the politicians I used to fly that need to help me out , help out us sick people , " Gamble said .
Grounded because of his illness , Gamble now uses his time to advocate for the legalization of medical marijuana .
He recently traveled to Albany to tell lawmakers his story first hand .
" I used to be a hot - shot pilot , " Gamble said .
" Now , I 'm all about the MS awareness . "
Gamble is far from the stereotypical tie - dyed hippie pushing for pot .
He 's clean cut .
He wears a crucifix around his neck and a dog tag engraved with the words , " God does n't give what you can't handle . "
He hopes his military experience gives him credibility .
" I 'm not glad that I 'm sick , but I 'm glad that because of my background , maybe people will listen to me , " Gamble said .
State lawmakers this year have introduced bills in both the Senate and Assembly to protect patients from being arrested if they use medical marijuana under a doctor 's recommendation .
Similar legislation passed the Assembly two straight years but died each session in the Senate .
" Medical marijuana 's safety and efficacy in treating certain painful , often life - threatening diseases is a well - documented scientific fact , " said Sen .
Thomas Duane , D - Manhattan , the Senate sponsor of the bill .
" There is no reason we can't establish common sense controls to ensure safe access to this medicine for suffering patients who have their doctors ' recommendations while ensuring it does n't wind up in the wrong hands . "
" It is cruel to make seriously ill patients criminals for relying on medical marijuana for relief when their doctor recommends it , " said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried , D - New York , the bill 's Assembly sponsor .
Gamble understands some people 's hesitation about medical marijuana .
He recognizes that the drug is n't for everyone .
If a legalization bill were passed , he said , education would have to be a key component .
Parents , for example , would need to treat medical marijuana as they would any prescription drug , locking it in a medicine cabinet and teaching their children to stay away .
Those concerns , however , are n't a reason to kill the bill , Gamble said .
" A lot of people abuse alcohol and they put it up on billboards , " Gamble said .
" Yes , it 's illegal .
But I 'm not going to stop . "
Thirteen states have enacted laws that remove criminal penalties for medical marijuana patients .
Eleven of those states conducted before - and - after studies , and all have seen marijuana use by youths decline since passing medical marijuana bills , Duane said .
" The reason I think that I 'm doing so well is because I smoke pot , " Gamble said .
The marijuana helps restore Gamble 's appetite .
He has lost 20 pounds since being diagnosed .
It also helps Gamble sleep .
Without it , he said , his legs shake violently and his body locks up -- a frightening sensation , he said .
" If I do n't smoke , I turn into a disaster , " Gamble said .
" It 's embarrassing to me .
I 'm still getting used to being around people . "
Marijuana also keeps Gamble off stronger narcotics .
As it is , Gamble takes an assortment of almost a dozen drugs daily .
His medication list fills half a notebook page , while a tally of his symptoms takes up the entire sheet .
So far , Gamble has avoided having to use a wheelchair , but he expects the bright yellow model he ordered to arrive any day .
" If I did n't have the marijuana , I 'd probably be getting prescribed Hydrocodone , Morphine , Vicodin , and those are the drugs people are abusing , " Gamble said .
" They 're quick to give you the pain pills at the hospital , but I think I 'm doing the right thing .
I 'm doing my best to stay off the heavy stuff , the stuff that makes me completely numb . "
" It 's not a cure , " Gamble explained of the marijuana .
" I 'm still in pain .
It 's just a remedy for a couple of hours .
If there was something else they could give me to help , I 'd take that . "
More than a dozen national and state medical organizations support medicinal marijuana use , including the Medical Society of the State of New York ( which has lobbied in Albany for a medical marijuana bill ) , the National Academy of Sciences ' Institute of Medicine and the American College of Physicians .
" Cannabinoids ( the active ingredient in marijuana ) have been shown to ease pain , help with muscle spasms , help with appetite , help with mood state , " said Dr. Gregory Carter , professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington and author of " Marijuana Medical Handbook : Practical Guide to Therapeutic Uses of Marijuana . "
" Even more interesting , we 're now seeing cannabinoids can help nerves protect against toxins and can have an anti-inflammatory effect . "
That could be key to helping patients with such diseases as Alzheimer 's and rheumatoid arthritis , Carter said .
Synthetic marijuana drugs , such as Marinol , pale in comparison to the real thing , Carter said .
" They 're not as effective at all , " he said .
The synthetics take longer to absorb , and patients have little ability to control their dosage .
Ironically , Marinol contains 100 percent pure THC ( the active ingredient in marijuana ) and can be prescribed with a simple phone call from a doctor , whereas natural cannabis contains 20 percent THC but is considered a Schedule 1 substance , meaning the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers it as having a high potential for abuse with no accepted medical use .
" It 's just ridiculous , " Carter said .
" It 's mind - boggling how stupid the laws are , how they have ruined people 's lives and how much they have cost the government .
They 're just absolutely insane . "
" I think the DEA and FDA need to stop being guided by propaganda , " he continued .
" Rational minds need to drive drug policy , separating myth from fact , right from wrong , and responsible medicinal use from other uses . "
Because marijuana is illegal in New York state , Gamble must buy his stash on the black market .
Two of his " dealers " are an older couple , one of whom is dying of cancer .
They sell marijuana on the side to pay their bills .
" Instead of paying $ 200 an ounce , why can't I go to a dispensary and pay a $ 50 co-pay ? "
Gamble asked .
For Gamble , the biggest challenge is fighting people 's assumptions that he 's just some pot - head kid .
" I look normal , " he said .
" But I 'm not . "
More than worrying about himself , Gamble says he fears for the old lady who has no access to marijuana to ease her pain .
Legalization could even help close the state 's budget deficit , Gamble suggested .
" I mow my lawn .
I pay my taxes .
I visit my family .
I do n't want to feel like what I 'm doing is wrong , " Gamble said .
" You do n't know what this is like .
I 'm doing the best I can to be a law abiding citizen .
But there 's too much pain . "
For reasons still not fully understood , an MS patient 's immune system attacks the protective sheath that surrounds the body 's nerve fibers .
The damage shows up as scar tissue ( sclerosis ) , which can disrupt signals sent by the brain .
That disruption leads to symptoms that range from mild , such as numbness , to severe , such as blindness and paralysis .
In Gamble 's case , lesions have peppered his brain .
The biggest measures 9 millimeters in diameter and sits at the top of his brain stem .
Gamble used to keep copies of his MRI 's posted on his kitchen wall , with the lesions highlighted in red glitter paint , but he decided the artwork was too morbid .
As far as smoking pot , Gamble says he generally chooses to smoke in private , but he 's not worried about getting caught .
Nurses encourage him to do whatever makes him feel better , he said .
Friends in law enforcement turn a blind eye .
" I have not had one person say , ' That 's wrong , do n't do it , 'Â ¤ " Gamble said .
With Democrats in control of the state Senate for the first time in decades , Gamble believes this could be the year a medical marijuana bill passes in Albany .
He said lawmakers received him very well during his recent trip to the Capitol .
" They seem pretty optimistic , upbeat , positive , " he said .
" I think it helped having me there . "
Both the Senate and Assembly bills are moving through the committee process now .
Gamble hopes lawmakers bring the legislation to a vote before this year 's session ends in June .
" This should be the year , " Gamble said .
" I do n't want to be a criminal anymore . "
Sidebar : Who 's Opposed ?
The state Senate has yet to vote on the issue , but medical marijuana bills have passed the Assembly twice -- in 2007 and 2008 .
Each time , votes followed party lines .
Democrats approved the legislation , while Republicans voted against it .
The trend included Central New York lawmakers .
Why the " no " votes ?
Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb , R - Canandaigua , said he believes legalization is a federal issue .
" Nationally , it 's against the law to purchase and distribute marijuana , period , " Kolb said .
" Right now , if we set up a mechanism for marijuana to be sold , it would be in ( conflict with ) federal law .
If Congress wants to set national policy on something of this nature , that 's fine .
But I do n't think it 's up to individual states to determine drug policy . "

Analysis of the Green Dam Censorware System Scott Wolchok , Randy Yao , and J. Alex Halderman
Computer Science and Engineering Division
The University of Michigan Revision 2.41 – June 11 , 2009 * Update : Addendum 1 added June 18 , 2009
Summary
We have discovered remotely - exploitable vulnerabilities in Green Dam , the censorship software reportedly mandated by the Chinese government .
Any web site a Green Dam user visits can take control of the PC .
According to press reports , China will soon require all PCs sold in the country to include Green Dam .
This software monitors web sites visited and other activity on the computer and blocks adult content as well as politically sensitive material .
We examined the Green Dam software and found that it contains serious security vulnerabilities due to programming errors .
Once Green Dam is installed , any web site the user visits can exploit these problems to take control of the computer .
This could allow malicious sites to steal private data , send spam , or enlist the computer in a botnet .
In addition , we found vulnerabilities in the way Green Dam processes blacklist updates that could allow the software makers or others to install malicious code during the update process .
We found these problems with less than 12 hours of testing , and we believe they may be only the tip of the iceberg .
Green Dam makes frequent use of unsafe and outdated programming practices that likely introduce numerous other vulnerabilities .
Correcting these problems will require extensive changes to the software and careful retesting .
In the meantime , we recommend that users protect themselves by uninstalling Green Dam immediately .
Green Dam displays this message when it detects banned phrases .
Introduction
According to recent news reports ( NYT , WSJ ) , the Chinese government has mandated that , beginning July 1 , every PC sold in China must include a censorship program called Green Dam .
This software is designed to monitor Internet connections and text typed on the computer .
It blocks undesirable or politically sensitive content and optionally reports it to authorities .
Green Dam was developed by a company called Jin Hui and is available as a free download .
We examined version 3.17 .
How Green Dam Works
The Green Dam software filters content by blocking URLs and website images and by monitoring text in other applications .
The filtering blacklists include both political and adult content .
Some of the blacklists appear to have been copied from American - made filtering software .
Image filter Green Dam includes computer vision technology used to block online images containing nudity .
The image filter reportedly works by flagging images containing large areas of human skin tone , while making an exception for close - ups of faces .
We 've found that the program contains code libraries and a configuration file from the open - source image recognition software OpenCV .
Text filter Green Dam scans text entry fields in various applications for blocked words , including obscenities and politically sensitive phrases ( for example , references to Falun Gong ) .
Blacklisted terms are contained in three files , encrypted with a simple key - less scrambling operation .
We decrypted the contents of these files : xwordl.dat , xwordm.dat , and xwordh.dat .
We also found what appears to be a word list for a more sophisticated sentence processing algorithm in the unencrypted file FalunWord.lib .
When Green Dam detects these words , the offending program is forcibly closed and an error image ( shown above ) is displayed .
URL filter Green Dam filters website URLs using patterns contained in whitelist and blacklist files ( * fil.dat , adwapp.dat , and TrustUrl.dat ) .
These files are encrypted with the same keyless scrambling operation as the blacklists for the text filter .
Five of the blacklists correspond to the categories in the content filtering section of Green Dam 's options dialog ( shown below ) .
We found evidence that a number of these blacklists have been taken from the American - made filtering program CyberSitter .
In particular , we found an encrypted configuration file , wfileu.dat , that references these blacklists with download URLs at CyberSitter 's site .
We also found a setup file , xstring.s2g , that appears to date these blacklists to 2006 .
Finally , csnews.dat is an encrypted 2004 news bulletin by CyberSitter .
We conjecture that this file was accidentally included because it has the same file extension as the filters .
Security Problems
After only one day of testing the Green Dam software , we found two major security vulnerabilities .
The first is an error in the way the software processes web sites it monitors .
The second is a bug in the way the software installs blacklist updates .
Both allow remote parties to execute arbitrary code and take control of the computer .
Web Filtering Vulnerability
Green Dam intercepts
Internet traffic and processes it to see whether visited web sites are blacklisted .
In order to perform this monitoring , it injects a library called SurfGd.dll into software that uses the socket API .
When a user access a web site , this code checks the address against the blacklist and logs the URL .
We discovered programming errors in the code used to process web site requests .
The code processes URLs with a fixed - length buffer , and a specially - crafted URL can overrun this buffer and corrupt the execution stack .
Any web site the user visits can redirect the browser to a page with a malicious URL and take control of the computer .
We have constructed a demonstration URL that triggers this problem .
If you have Green Dam installed , clicking the button on our demonstration attack page will cause your browser ( or tab ) to crash .
This proof - of - concept shows that we are able to control the execution stack .
An actual attacker could exploit this to execute malicious code .
Green Dam 's design makes this problem exploitable from almost any web browser .
At this time , the surest way for users to protect themselves is to uninstall Green Dam .
Blacklist Update Vulnerability
We found a second problem in the way Green Dam reads its filter files .
This problem would allow Green Dam 's makers , or a third - party impersonating them , to execute arbitrary code and install malicious software on the user 's computer after installing a filter update .
Users can enable automatic filter updates from the Green Dam configuration program .
Green Dam reads its filter files using unsafe C string libraries .
In places , it uses the fscanf function to read lines from filter files into a fixed - length buffer on the execution stack .
This creates classic buffer - overflow vulnerabilities .
For example , if a line in the file TrustUrl.dat exceeds a certain fixed length , the buffer will be overrun , corrupting the execution stack and potentially giving the attacker control of the process .
The filter files can be replaced remotely by the software maker if the user has enabled filter updates .
The updates could corrupt these vulnerable files to exploit the problems we found .
This could allow Green Dam 's makers to take control of any computer where the software is installed and automatic filter updates are enabled .
Furthermore , updates are delivered via unencrypted HTTP , which could allow a third party to impersonate the update server ( for example , by exploiting DNS vulnerabilities ) and take control of users ' computers using this attack .
Removing Green Dam
Green Dam allows users who know its administrator password to uninstall the software .
We tested the uninstaller and found that it appears to effectively remove Green Dam from the computer .
However , it fails to remove some log files , so evidence of users ' activity remains hidden on the system .
In light of the serious vulnerabilities we outlined above , the surest way for users to protect themselves is to remove the software immediately using its uninstall function .
Conclusion
Our brief testing proves that Green Dam contains very serious security vulnerabilities .
Unfortunately , these problems seem to reflect systemic flaws in the code .
The software makes extensive use of programming techniques that are known to be unsafe , such as deprecated C string processing functions including sprintf and fscanf .
These problems are compounded by the design of the program , which creates a large attack surface : since Green Dam filters and processes all Internet traffic , large parts of its code are exposed to attack .
If Green Dam is deployed in its current form , it will significantly weaken China 's computer security .
While the flaws we discovered can be quickly patched , correcting all the problems in the Green Dam software will likely require extensive rewriting and thorough testing .
This will be difficult to achieve before China 's July 1 deadline for deploying Green Dam nationwide .

Addendum 1 : Green Dam Quietly Patched ; Still Vulnerable — June 18 , 2009
Following our initial analysis , the makers of Green Dam have released at least one security update and two filter updates .
These updates address the original web filtering security vulnerability we described above , disable certain blacklists that were copied from the CyberSitter program , and bring the software into compliance with the OpenCV license .
Unfortunately , we have discovered an additional remotely - exploitable security vulnerability in the patched version .
Even with the updated version installed , any web site a user visits can exploit this problem to take control of the computer .
We continue to recommend that users protect themselves by uninstalling Green Dam immediately .
While Green Dam 's developers have patched the software quickly , the program 's continuing vulnerability suggests that its security problems run deep .
We fear that the deeper problems cannot be resolved in time for the July 1 deadline for PC makers to distribute Green Dam on all new PCs sold in China .
Green Dam Security Patch
On June 17 , we observed that the Green Dam installer had been updated to correct the web filtering vulnerability that we described in our original report .
The update appears to have been released at around 12:00 GMT on June 13 .
We do not know why the update seems to have been deployed silently ; the program is still marked as version 3.17 , and we have seen no official announcement of the change .
The installer we examined previously is 10,355,637 bytes in size and has the SHA - 1 hash 4aaa6cec69b4dfd952eda3512a0b45c1f34a0f7 c , and the new installer is 10,200,230 bytes in size and has the SHA - 1 hash ee93d0ead4982b53d489b4766d6f96e7618fcd6e .
Since these changes do not carry an official version number , we will refer to them as version 3.17a .
So far , the new version is only available by downloading a fresh copy of the software from the maker 's web site .
The changes are not currently being distributed through the software 's internal update mechanism .
Green Dam 3.17a has been modified to address several security bugs , including the original demonstration attack we described above .
Despite these attempts to make the software secure , we found a new remotely - exploitable vulnerability in the patched program .
It took us just over an hour to find this new vulnerability and approximately five hours to develop a demonstration .
New Web Filtering Vulnerability
Green Dam intercepts Internet traffic using a library called SurfGd.dll .
Even after the security patch , SurfGd.dll uses a fixed - length buffer to process web site requests , and malicious web sites can still overrun this buffer to take control of execution .
The program now checks the lengths of the URL and the individual HTTP request headers , but the sum of the lengths is erroneously allowed to be greater than the size of the buffer .
An attacker can compromise the new version by using both a very long URL and a very long " Host " HTTP header .
The pre-update version 3.17 , which we examined in our original report , is also susceptible to this attack .
We have implemented a second demonstration attack for this new vulnerability .
The page includes a Flash applet that sends a malformed HTTP request to our server .
Your browser or tab should crash immediately upon loading the demonstration page if you are running Green Dam 3.17 or 3.17a and have Flash installed .
While our demonstration only causes a crash , a real malicious web site could exploit this vulnerability to take control of the computer .
We continue to recommend that users uninstall Green Dam immediately to protect themselves .
While our demonstration page uses Flash , this vulnerability is not limited to computers with Flash installed .
Attacks are also possible using other browser plugins such as SilverLight or Java .
Worse , because Green Dam monitors every program that uses the socket API , it will attempt to filter any outgoing message that is structured like an HTTP request , whether or not it actually came from a web browser .
Therefore , any program that can be made to send attacker - controlled data over TCP is exposed to both of the web filtering vulnerabilities .
We anticipate possible exploits in a variety of networked programs .
We are encouraged that Green Dam 's developers have updated the program so quickly .
This shows that they take security seriously .
Yet even after the recent fix , it is still possible for any web site a Green Dam user visits to exploit other security problems to take control of the computer .
As we stated in our original report , the program makes use of insecure programming practices , and there are likely to be more undiscovered problems .
Consequently , making Green Dam safe will require substantial changes and careful retesting .
It is unlikely that the required changes can be completed in the 12 days remaining before China 's July 1 deadline for mandatory distribution of Green Dam with new PCs .
Updates to Blacklists , Whitelists , and Documentation
Green Dam 's makers have released two filter updates through the software 's internal update mechanism .
These updates are not installed automatically by default , but users can apply them by clicking a button in Green Dam 's configuration program or enabling automatic updates within the program .
Update 3.173 was released on or around June 12 , and 3.174 was released on or around June 17 .
Changes in 3.173
With the 3.173 update installed , Green Dam no longer appears to employ the blacklist files derived from CyberSitter .
Instead , it uses an updated version of the adwapp.dat blacklist .
This list does not seem to be based on CyberSitter : it is over 6000 lines long and contains only five lines in common with any of the CyberSitter blacklists .
By examination of the update file ( kwupdate .dat ) , we have established that version 3.173 moved the blacklist files auctfil.dat , bsnlist .dat , and gblfil.dat from C : \Windows \system32 to C: \Windows , and it updated wfile .dat , TrustUrl.dat , and adwapp.dat .
The developers added three new entries to adwapp.dat : two pornographic sites and the site cmd5.com , which is currently hosting directions on how to change the Green Dam password back to the default .
The updates to wfile .dat disable the CyberSitter blacklists , leaving only the adwapp.dat blacklist active .
However , the blacklists copied from CyberSitter continue to be present on the computer following the update , and several of the CyberSitter blacklists are still used in the 3.17a version of Green Dam now being distributed on the maker 's web site .
The update also removed 603 entries from TrustUrl.dat , a whitelist of sites that are not subject to filtering .
Notable entries on the whitelist include aol.com , ibm.com , download.com , abcnews.com , symantec.com , dell.com , china.com , zdnet.com , *.gov.cn , apple.com , filterdam.com , lssw365. * , doubleclick.net , time.com , nokia.com.cn , amazon.com , ebay.com.cn , icq.com , and tucows.com .
Curiously , “ lssw365 ” is whitelisted for all top level domains , exempting them from filtering .
This includes the site lssw365.org , a Chinese site dedicated to opposing Green Dam .
Changes in 3.174
The 3.174 update changed the program 's help file , kw.chm , and moved that file from C : \Windows to C : \Windows \Help .
The update added the license text required for the OpenCV open - source project to Green Dam 's help , as shown in the screenshot below :
Update 3.174 added the OpenCV license agreement to Green Dam 's help file ( click to enlarge ) .
OpenCV is an open - source computer vision package developed by Intel .
Green Dam uses it to try to recognize online images that contain nudity .
OpenCV is distributed under a license that allows free commercial and educational use , but requires that programs using it include a copy of the license text .
We examined Green Dam and found that it contains code libraries and a configuration file derived from version 1.0rc1 of OpenCV , confirming earlier reports on SourceForge .
In particular , we found striking similarities between xcore.dll , Xcv.dll , and Xtool.dll from Green Dam and cxcore099.dll , cv099.dll , highgui099.dll from OpenCV 1.0rc1 , respectively .
Furthermore , Green Dam's XFimage.xml is identical to haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml , except that the license at the top of haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml ( lines 2 - 44 ) is not present in XFimage.xml .
While the 3.174 filter update added the required license , Green Dam 's use of OpenCV prior to version 3.174 may be in violation of OpenCV 's license .
The license still does not appear in the 3.17a version of Green Dam now being distributed on the maker 's web site .

Two federal appeals court opinions -- one signed by Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor -- have created a quandary for those who cherish the protections of the Bill of Rights and also believe in meaningful gun control .
But the way out of the dilemma is not to urge the high court to pick and choose which constitutional rights are protected against state and local laws .
Among the charges leveled by some conservatives against Sotomayor is that she has been insufficiently protective of the 2nd Amendment , which says that “ the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . ”
Exhibit A was the judge ’s role in a decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ~jmm257/000-decision.pdf upholding the constitutionality of a New York state law banning the possession of nunchucks .
Sotomayor and two other judges ruled that the 2nd Amendment applies only to the federal government , a long - standing view that the Supreme Court did n’t address when it struck down a gun control law in Washington , D.C. , last year .
In legal jargon , the high court has n’t explicitly “ incorporated ” the 2nd Amendment in the 14th Amendment , which protects “ liberty ” against state interference .
Other amendments long have been incorporated , making it possible to sue the states for violating many of the protections of the Bill of Rights .
Using the 2nd Circuit decision to portray Sotomayor as an opponent of gun rights became harder last week when two of the nation ’s most prominent conservative judges issued an opinion espousing the same view .
The opinion for a three - judge panel of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals was written by Judge Frank Easterbrook , a President Reagan appointee .
The justices may soon address the incorporation question in order to resolve a conflict between the position taken by the 2nd and 7th circuits and the opposite view adopted by the San Francisco - based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .

It ’s tempting for supporters of gun control -- including this page -- to hope that the high court will rule that the 2nd Amendment does n’t apply to the states .
That would be a mistake and would give aid and comfort to conservative legal thinkers , among them Justice Clarence Thomas , who have questioned the incorporation doctrine .
We were disappointed last year when the Supreme Court ruled that the right to keep and bear arms was an individual right , giving short shrift to the first part of the amendment , which refers to “ a well - regulated militia . ”
But we also believe the court has been right to use the doctrine of incorporation to bind states to the most important protections of the Bill of Rights .
If those vital provisions are to be incorporated in the 14th Amendment , so should the right to keep and bear arms .

Dams are supposed to help farmers manage water supply and boost crop yields , but in Africa they may actually have cut agricultural production , researchers warn .
Africa has over 1000 large dams , the majority of which are used for irrigation , say Eric Strobl of the École Polytechnique in Paris and his brother , Robert Strobl of the European Commission in Brussels .
The pair used satellite images to compare crops around the dams with those in nearby areas .
Between 1981 and 2000 , the dams caused an average 1 per cent drop in annual yields , conclude the Strobls .

Downstream from dams , farmers can benefit from a steady year - round water flow .
But those around the dam itself are often not so lucky .
In dry years , the reservoir behind a dam can only be maintained if local farmers are prevented from extracting too much water from the rivers that flow into it .
That leads to less irrigation and lower yields around the dams , which more than cancels out the downstream benefits .
‘ No gains ’
A 1 per cent drop in not necessarily a disaster , says Eric Strobl .
“ But if a country is already in poverty it could mean a lot . ”
Rohini Pande of Harvard University produced similar results when she examined dams in India .
“ The main way to look at this is that there is no [ agricultural ] gain from dams , ” she says .
“ And building them costs a lot of money . ”
Despite his findings , Strobl says that large dams can have a positive impact if they are more effectively located .
He looked at the effect of building dams on around 1400 sites in Africa where as many farmers as possible benefit from the downstream irrigation .
His preliminary calculations suggest that these dams could boost yields by almost 20 per cent even in dry years .
Rich before poor
But big dams often attract opposition from advocacy groups , and Strobl ’s optimistic predictions will not change that .
Terri Hathaway , a Cameroon - based campaigner with International Rivers , says that major dam projects often benefit large farmers and industry at the expense of local people .
The 7 - kilometre long Merowe Dam in Sudan , which began producing electricity earlier this year , is one example .
The dam will ultimately pump out 1250 megawatts , more than doubling the country ’s electricity capacity .
The reservoir behind the dam contains 10 million cubic metres of water , but tens of thousands of people were displaced when it was created .
Some were moved to distant desert areas and have since protested about water shortages .

Websense sees tripling of such active sites and “ pockets ” over last year
Rascism , hate , and militancy sites have tripled in number over the past year on the Web and within corners of social - networking sites like Facebook , YouTube , Google and Yahoo , according to one vendor tracking them .
Websense is now tracking about 15,000 of these hate and militancy sites , with 1,000 added in just the first five months of this year .
Hate groups include white supremacist Ku Klux Klan - style , Neo -Nazi and skinhead groups , as well as weapon - toting militant extremists of all stripes , including Islamic militants .
Some of the militant and racist sites use " secret symbols or phrases which allow members to identify one another , " writes Charles Renart , senior director of advanced content research at Websense Security Labs , in a blog on the subject .
For instance " RAHOWA " is said to be an acronym for " racial holy war " that is used by many white - supremacist groups .
Site owners often try to hide them or make the sites accessible only to their selected " friends , " he points out .
Numerical symbols such as " 88 " also frequently indicate a racist or militant site , and " HH " is shorthand for the old Nazi greeting " Heil Hitler . "
Pagan folklore symbols may -- though not necessarily -- be used for white - supremacy purposes .
Some tend to masquerade as news sites .
Renart says it 's hard to say exactly why there appears to be such a strong increase in hate sites in the past year except that Web 2.0 - style social networking is something that can be conveniently exploited in " pockets of activity . "
The scope of it is international .
Most of the activity is in English , though terror videos are usually in Arabic , Renart says .
The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters : A Review
I was in Barnes & Noble on 6th Avenue , applying for a job that I did not get , and I decided to stroll over to the new fiction section and paw over some jacket copy to kill time and to see who 's important these days .
I stood there with a grim expression on my face and one fist tight against my side -- a callow young man half - parts rage and half - parts regret -- and I opened pastel book cover after pastel book cover , reading snippets about heartwarming adventure in the heartland , about glum and aristocratic northern men making changes in the world , and about the broken marriages of the middle - aged ( WHAT WILL THEY DO NOW WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE EARNED ) .
As I fumed and muttered , one of my eyeballs started to twitch and I could hear the manager behind me whisper to the security guard about my odor and ire .
Was I going to explode right there in the store ?
But then , I picked up a paperback with bright orange letters tastefully stamped into the ice blue center in the same font that you would find on a bottle of patent medicine .
As I touched the book , my nerves cooled and my hand steadied .
Was this an elixir to soothe the collywobbles and brain fever ?
The book was called " The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters , Volume Two .
" Great fucking title -- if it delivered .
Volume Two ?
Where was Volume One ?
What was going on ?
Was this a new book ?
On the back of this book , there were not blurbs from Richard Ford or from Annie Proulx .
Evidently , Michiko Kakutani had skipped this one .
All the blurbs kept comparing the book to food : " a confection , " " a marvelous tea cake , studded with treats . "
Already , I was hungry .
I felt an animal lick of pleasure in the back of my mind from merely hefting the weight .
One blurb , from the Herald , said : " A vivid fantasy , liberally spiced with chases , stakeouts , fights , fetish gear , and a satisfyingly long trail of bodies .
" That is exactly what I like to read .
Why had I never heard of this story ?
What had n't anyone with whom I associate -- many of them furious readers with myopic " reader 's stoops " and the credit problems to prove a life of literacy -- heard of this story ?
Had " The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters " just come out ?
It was in the " new fiction " section , after all .
Yes .
The paperback said " February 2009 . "
But then I looked again : it also said " Bantam hardcover edition of Volumes One and Two published September 2006 .
" It had taken three years for this book to make the transition from tome to pulp ?
Multiple volumes !
I raced to the stacks and located " Volume One " as the security guard picked up a magazine across from me and pretended to read it , staring at my jittery back .
" Volume One " was blood red , and the back was just as mystifying about the plot within .
Something about a broken engagement and assasins .
" Fuck it , " I said .
" I have no money , but I am buying this book anyway out of spite .
You were trying to hide this book from me , world .
Even though I cannot afford the $ 12 dollar price tag on this , I am going to read it and shame you for trying to bury a book on me that is exactly the sort of thing I like .
What else are you hiding from the world , publishers ?
" Along with several other volumes , I took this book with me on a long car trip across America to get my birth certificate .
I finished it , and then , as soon as I got back to New York , I bought " Volume Two " and finished it in something like six uninterrupted hours of reading .
I 'll tell you about why you 've never heard of this book in a minute -- but first let me review it .*** This is Mr. Dahlquist 's first novel , and in every biographical note abut him , he is painted as a cipher , a " playwright from the Pacific Northwest who now lives in New York . "
Fine .
Anyway , I like not knowing anything about authors : I like to pretend that books write themselves -- or rather , that they are assembled from blood , pain , memory , and fire and then take on a life of their own .
The two paperback volumes of " The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters " were originally published as one 700 page novel , and , as such , the paperback copies bleed together seamlessly and should be regarded as one complete work .
This , his first book , is both wunderkammer and wind - up dragon : it is set in a nameless fake European city sometime in the past and tightly ( TIGHTLY ) follows the paths of three outsiders as they each independently discover , confront , and hunt down a murderous cabal within the city that seeks to gain power over influential figures for mysterious reasons .
Their paths overlap and they gradually form an alliance of expedience as they help each other to pursue independent , but related , goals .
Here is the setting of this book :
The three central heroes are familiar types : they are the virgin ( Miss Temple -- lawful good ) , the spy ( Captain Svenson -- true neutral ) , and the killer ( a man called " Cardinal Chang " -- lawful evil ) .
Their enemies are also familiar types : seductress , scientist , dandy , soldier , politician , and aristocrat .
Structurally , the book is broken down into long , third - person chapters that follow each of our heroes in turn as they explore a debauched city and an even more debauched manor house in the country .
This book has : graphic sex , graphic violence , difficult ontological claims about life and death , shrewd contemplations on the pleasures of cult mentality , half - hearted speculations on the nexus of class and destiny , a dirigible , and so many murders !
This book does not have : wacky historical cameos and alternate history bullshit , magic , gratuitous winks at modern political problems , or an easy one - to - one allegory between the events portrayed within and the events of any world war or election .
Why people do n't like this book : despite being a work of high fantasy and adventure , the heroes are despicable and flawed , and the only superpowers on display are courage and cunning .
The virgin is a prig and plantation - heiress , the killer is indiscriminate , crude , and ignoble , and the spy is a bookish , German , cowardly depressive .
The sexiest roles in this novel go to the villains .
Instead of offering escape into virtue , the book was written to be cherished like drug- chocolates .
You 'll like it .
Imagine if Oscar Wilde wrote an action - adventure thriller during a particularly tempestuous love affair with a young street thief .
The book was not written to moralize or to make dull people happy by spelling out when to rest or when to clap .
People complain about the " wordiness " : to crib from Emperor Joseph to Mozart , the book has " too many notes , " and too many dark holes to appeal to its intended " market " ( teenagers ?
science fiction fans ?
who knows ? ) .
Actual flaws in this book : the prose IS overwrought and thermonuclear , which is great , but I often found myself jazzed - up with suspense , only to receive a description of a drawing room .
Sometimes , especially in the latter half , the book was like a French farce , with people crashing into boudoirs and abducting their lovers while shrieking clues and then crashing through another wall or dropping through the floor .
Other times , the book felt like the blow - by - blow account of a tedious D&D game , and I felt like I needed character sheets and inventories of all the principal protagonists .
Not a bullet goes missing , nor a special skill unused .
Look , America .
I know you .
I know the people among you who read for the physical pleasure of it -- for the flexing , stretching , bending , and deepening of your imagination .
I know the people among you who are ALWAYS reading a book -- indiscriminately and without giving a shit about whether or not it is the " right " book .
I know you people who read without caring what your preferences say about the size of your intellectual dick or the depth of your intellectual cunt .
" The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters " is a great book to READ , as a physical thing .
It is florid , tense , powerful , and strange .
Reading this book is like stepping into a bodega to get out of the rain , and then realizing that the bodega is actually an opium - den and flesh - parlor .
Before you can be stabbed in the belly and tossed out the the back door by security , one of the courtesans takes a liking to you and leads you to a private room for dinner and a cordial .
Afterward , a blind Hessian who has been shivering in a corner grabs you by the arm and begins to speak .
He tells you a tale while the courtesan slips out of the room and the drugs that were slipped into your tea begin to take effect .
I have a friend who used to smoke crack and then read book after book in a dingy Austin co-op , absorbing them all , loving every minute .
If this is the kind of thing you like to do , check this book out .
This book reminds one that " literary fiction " does not refer to theme and setting , but to quality of writing and depth of perception .
Dahlquist has a peculiar and ornate style that demands a world worthy of his flowers and spice , and in this book he has written himself a place where he will feel comfortable stretching his powers .
Although debates rage on the internet , this book is neither " gaslamp , " " steampunk , " nor " alternate history . "
It is a story that tries to be as pure as possible to its own internal dream logic .
What does Dahlquist care about his place in the fiction canon ?
He is , as he will tell you , a PLAYWRIGHT ( maybe the most successful playwright in the history of America ; more on that later ) .*** If you like , you may read a selection from this novel at Scribd.com to see if you will like it before you drop thirty bucks on two paperbacks :
You can also play two text - adventure games specifically created by the publisher to market this book .

Remember how thrilling it used to be to type in the right command and receive a chunk of text that did not contain your death ?

WEST *** The reason you have never heard of this book , I later discovered , is that it was a huge , hairy failure .
This book is thrilling , utterly original , and fun as shit .
This is the kind of book that makes you break off dates to be alone with it .
But no one was buying .
Instead of a failure , the book could have been a knockout success for some small publisher .
The bar was set too high : some editors read it and loved it and decided that it would be the greatest book in the history of America -- or , anyway , they wanted to bounce their stock price around a little bit -- so Dahlquist received a famous TWO MILLION DOLLAR advance on this book ( his first novel ! ) , with instructions to write sequels .
Anyway , after a powerful over - hyping campaign that STILL FAILED TO REACH ME ( AN IDEAL READER ) , the book did n't sell the copies it needed to sell , and Dahlquist still has n't made back his advance ( he is about a million short , go figure ) .
Anyway , his name is now anathema in an industry which trades on instant gratification and instant karma these days .
Still , for two million dollars , I would n't mind being a reclusive outcast playwright banished from the publishing world .
What playwright will ever see two million dollars in their lifetime without writing for the movies ?
Still , business deals like these are a tremendous problem for publishing , considering how long it takes for fun books to trickle down into the hands of fun-loving readers .
While this book will someday spawn an entire cottage industry of slash - fiction all to itself , it may never be the roaring success it ought to be .
But you 'll like this book , I know you will , because you do n't fret and panic about finding the ONE book to read this year ; the ONE book that everybody is talking about .
You read like a paper shredder .
I 'll leave you with my favorite passage , about a surgeon who has developed a famous treatment for frostbite : " Svenson kept walking , his boots grinding on the wet cobblestones .
His thoughts began to wander , the wet chill of the fog taking him to his time in Warnemunde , the cold rail of the pier , the snow falling silently into the sea .
He remembered , as a boy , walking into the winter forest -- wanting to be alone , in despair once again -- and sitting in his thick coat under a pine tree , pressing the snow around him into a soft burrow , lying back and looking at the high branches .
He did n't know how long he'd lain there , his mind drifting , perhaps even close to dangerous sleep , when he became aware that he was cold , that the heat from his body had been steadily leeched away by the snow and frosted air .
His face was numb .
It had happened so gradually , his mind had been elsewhere -- he could no longer remember the girl 's name -- but as he forced his frozen limbs to work , rolling first to his knees and then to a shambling walk , he had a moment of insight , that he had just seen in miniature his own life -- and every human life -- a process where heat slowly , relentless dissipated in the face of unfeeling and beautiful ice .
" Later , the surgeon will kill a motherfucker with a shard of glass .
Dahlquist , have you been reading my diary ?
NOTE : The sequel to " The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters " -- entitled " The Dark Volume " -- just came out ( silently , like a goddamn mouse ) last week .
I hear it ends on a cliff - hanger , meaning there must be another one in the works .
Neat .
In case you did n’t see it , here ’s Jason Jones of the Daily Show at The New York Times talking about “ aged news ” and challenging an editor to “ find one thing in there that happened today . ”
Editor and Publisher sort of sniffs about why The Times would allow someone in to make fun of them .
They might just have a sense of humor .
The fail - proof way to make magnificent meatloaf at home !
Recipe adapted from an Alton Brown recipe
Ingredients 1 pound ground sirloin 1 pound ground turkey 1 onion , minced 1 carrot , minced 1 red pepper , minced 1 poblano pepper , seeded and minced 3 garlic cloves , minced 1/ 2 Teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 Teaspoon chili powder 1 Teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 Teaspoon black pepper 1 1/2 Teaspoon kosher salt 6 ounces bread crumbs ( I like Italian flavored Panko . ) 1 egg Glaze : 1 Cup ketchup 2 Teaspoons cumin 1 Teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 Teaspoon hot sauce ( adjust to your liking ) 2 Tablespoons honey
Show Directions
1 ) Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit .
2 ) To make the glaze , combine all ingredients well .
Taste it and adjust to your liking .
It should be pretty strong if you are tasting it by itself .
3 ) For all the vegetables , be sure to mince them very finely .
If you have a food processor , it ’s easiest to pulse them a few times in that .
4 ) Add a small drizzle of oil to a large skillet over medium heat .
Add the onion , carrot , peppers , and garlic to the pan and cook until veggies soften , just a few minutes .
5 ) Once veggies are cooked , add them to a large bowl with all the other meatloaf ingredients .
Use your hands to really mix everything together well .
6 ) Pack the meatloaf into a 9×5 loaf pan .
Then invert the pan on a baking sheet ( I like to line mine with parchment for easy cleanup ) .
7 ) Bake the meatloaf free - form for 15 minutes , then remove it and coat it with some glaze every 15 - 20 minutes .
The meatloaf will need to bake for 60 - 70 minutes to be cooked through .
8 ) Let the meatloaf cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving .
Serve it with extra glaze on the side !
Preheat your oven to 325 and then make your glaze .
Just combine all that stuff in a bowl and stir it up well .
Taste it and adjust to your liking .
It should be pretty strong if you are tasting it by itself .
Then get these guys ready :
You need to make sure that these are very finely chopped .
I recommend peeling everything and then pulsing it a few times in the food processor .
You do n’t want it to be a paste , but just really small piece .
The only thing I chopped by hand was the poblano because I wanted some larger chunks of that in the final product .
Cook your veggies .
This is really important .
Not only does it draw out tons of flavor , but it will also help bind your loaf together later .
If you were to put them in raw , it might work , but I would n’t trust it .
Just saute your very finely chopped veggies ( along with your chopped garlic ) for about 3 minutes in bit of oil .
You do n’t want the veggies browned , just softened a bit .
Get a large bowl and combine all your dry ingredients .
Mix these up well .
If you do n’t use Italian bread crumbs maybe add a bit more thyme and some oregano to get the same spices in the mix .
Then it is pretty easy .
Stir in your veggies and then both your ground meats .
Once it is all mixed together , add your one egg .
You do n’t need more than one .
The real trick of this recipe is that you do n’t actually cook it in a loaf pan .
Instead you use the loaf pan to form it , but then you cook it free form .
This is a great change from the normal way to cook meatloaf for two reasons :
First , if lets some of the fat drain away instead of just sitting in the loaf pan .
Second , you can glaze the entire surface of the loaf !
I ’m using a 10 inch loaf pan for this guy .
This needs to cook until it has an internal temperature of 155 degrees .
For me this was about an hour of cooking .
After it is in the oven for 15 minutes , take it out and give it a complete coat of the glaze mixture .
I glazed it again after about 15 more minutes in the oven .
Because the glaze rocks .
Once this is done , let it cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving .
This may not appear to be a very glamorous meal , but it is really tasty .
The leftovers are best if eaten over the next day or two .
While it will keep for a week probably , it starts to dry out a bit after a few days .
Best application for leftovers : Meatloaf sandwich .
I ’ve had a lot of meatloafs in my life and dislike most of them .
This guy , however , was really packed with flavor and super - moist .
For meatloaf , it is pretty freakin’ sexy .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says California should study other nations ’ experiences in legalizing and taxing marijuana , although he is not supporting the idea .
He says it ’s time to debate proposals such as a bill introduced in the Legislature earlier this year that would treat marijuana like alcohol .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , a San Francisco Democrat , says taxing marijuana at $ 50 per ounce would bring more than $ 1 billion a year to the state .
Schwarzenegger said during a Tuesday news conference that “ it ’s time for debate ” on the idea .
But he warned against making harmful decisions just for the sake of raising money .
He said some other nations have had negative experiences .
Ammiano ’s bill is on hold in the Legislature .
He delayed seeking approval until next year .

Fiji 's self - declared Prime Minister , Frank Bainimarama , claims Australia 's Defence Force chief threatened him in 2006 .
Commodore Bainimarama says Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston threatened him in an early morning phone call made when the Fijian leader was recovering from a " heavy grog session " the night before .
" He says it did n't happen .
Well , it did happen , " Commodore Bainimarama told Sky News .
" He woke me up early in the morning to tell me ' do n't ever do anything that will pit my troops against yours ' .
" He made a threat .
I said I really do n't know where he was coming from and that was the end of the conversation . "
Commodore Bainimarama 's extraordinary claim comes ahead of the country 's likely suspension from the Pacific Islands Forum for refusing to hold democratic elections this year .
Commodore Bainimarama says he has no intention to meet tonight 's deadline , set by the forum , to announce democratic elections .
Commodore Bainimarama says Fiji's new election date of September 2014 was set after the President abdicated the constitution , so he will be sticking to that and extending the country 's state of emergency .
" We want this calm to continue for a while , " he said .
" The emergency regulation was brought entirely for the media censorship , to ensure that there 's calm in the nation . "
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says Fiji will be suspended from the Pacific Island Forum .
Mr Smith says the move will take effect from tomorrow and is the automatic consequence of Fiji 's refusal to return to democracy .
" Given that Fiji has shown no intention to return to democracy and on the contrary has torn up its constitution , the effect of that resolution will be Fiji is automatically suspended from the forum and the meetings of the Pacific Island forum itself , " he said .
Rudd rejects talks
Australia and New Zealand have both ruled out talks with Commodore Bainimarama .
Commodore Bainimarama wants to meet with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who has flatly refused .
Mr Rudd says he has no intention of meeting with Commodore Bainimarama in the present climate .
" This is a bloke who just abolished freedom of the press in Fiji , " he said .
" This is a bloke who just sent independent judges , including those from Australia , packing .
" This is a bloke who just suspended the constitution of Fiji .
" We invited Fiji to announce an election timetable within a reasonable timeframe .
Not only did they not respond to that but they then went in exactly the reverse direction . "
Suspension imminent
New Zealand 's Foreign Minister , Murray McCully , says Fiji 's suspension does not mean the door will be permanently closed on Commodore Bainimarama .
" I think he should expect that people are going to treat him with a degree of caution , " he said .
" They know they can contact us if they want to contact us at any time .
" They 've got my telephone number .
I 'm sure the same goes for Australian Minister Stephen Smith . "
However academics , including the University of Auckland 's Dr Hugh Laracy , are criticising the stonewalling .
" These people who are criticising him , I think are being naive and not recognising the practicalities of his difficult situation , " he said .
Dr David Neilson from New Zealand 's Waikato University says Commodore Bainimarama is being boxed into a corner he will find difficult to get out of .
" If we had taken his project at face value and given more constructive support to facilitate the re-establishment of a robust election system , we may have furthered the cause of a return to democracy more effectively then what we 've done , which is basically to make it more and more difficult for that to happen as the regime gets bogged down with the effect of economic sanctions . "
Having just passed its super - controversial Cr�ation et Internet " graduated response " law , you might think the French government would take at least a brief break from riling up the " internautes . "
Instead , the government is prepping a new crime bill that will , among other things , mandate Internet censorship at the ISP level , legalize government spyware , and create a massive meta - database of citizen information called " Pericles . "
French newspaper Le Monde has the details on the new law , dubbed " Loppsi 2 . "
Together with the recent Dadvsi law ( which banned DRM circumvention ) and Cr�ation et Internet ( which disconnects repeat online copyright infringers ) , Loppsi 2 will " fix " France 's various cybersecurity issues .
Think of the children
Loppsi 2 allows the state to install software that can " observe , collect , record , save , and transmit " keystrokes from computers on which it is installed .
In essence , it allows for government - installed Trojans for a period of four months ; a judge can extend this period for four months more .
In the US , the FBI has used similar techniques for several years , installing a program called CIPAV on suspects ' computers to record and transmit " pen register " data back to investigators .
Under Loppsi 2 , French ISPs would also need to participate in a Web censorship regime that initially appears targeted at child pornography .
Critics like Jean - Michel Planche , who advises the French government on Internet issues , are already calling the new bill the end of an open and neutral Internet .
Finally , the bill allows for a database called " Pericles " that can pull together information from various existing French databases to create a " super - dossier " on people .
According to Le Monde , such a database could contain all sorts of crucial , personal information , and sounds certain to set off the same debates that have taken place in the US whenever similar projects have been floated .
Oh — and did we mention that Loppsi 2 funds all sorts of other crime - fighting techniques , including automated camera systems that record the license plates of cars passing by on the motorway ?
Taken together , the Loppsi 2 draft shows just how serious the Sarkozy government is about getting some control over this crazy Internet thing that all the kids are using now .
Actually , this is a situation playing out in most developed countries at the moment , and it's not yet clear whether a global consensus will emerge on how to deal with law enforcement challenges on the ' Net .
Numerous countries in Europe already run Internet child porn blacklists ; massive government databases exist or are being developed just about everywhere ; graduated response laws are slowly moving into the mainstream .
France just seems more interested than most in adopting all of these ideas in the shortest possible timeframe .
THE Rudd Government has acknowledged that the supremacy of the US has begun to fade and Australia is preparing for an uncertain future in which it can no longer rely on the protection of its main ally .
In a fundamental shift in defence plans , the Government has explicitly declared that US primacy in the Asia - Pacific - the bedrock of the nation 's security since World War II - may be ending .
The change , caused by the rise of new great powers such as China , is set to produce growing regional tensions and a " sudden deterioration " in Australia 's security .
A 20 - year defence blueprint , to be released by the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , today , prepares for a multibillion - dollar build - up of naval and air forces to ensure that Australia can defend its northern and sea approaches .
It says a regional shake - up is under way but US supremacy will not be blunted before 2030 and assesses the chances of an attack on Australia in the short term as " very remote " .
The white paper , Defending Australia In The Asia Pacific Century : Force 2030 , is the first since 2000 and outlines a range of security threats , including instability caused by the financial crisis , cyber warfare , failed states in the Pacific , Islamist terrorism , weapons of mass destruction , and climate change .
In England , rugby players throwing off their clothes at the first opportunity is no new thing but at least they usually wait till they get off the pitch ( and are in the bar ) , before getting started .
In Dunedin , New Zealand , however , every year two teams of sevens go to battle fully starkers .
The nude rugby international , which started as a celebration of New Zealand 's national nude day , was held yesterday as a warm - up – although temperatures were reportedly cold enough to prove embarrassing – to the forthcoming match between the All Blacks and France .
Needless to say , there were plenty of tackles flying about with only one interruption … when a fully - clothed streaker ran on to the pitch .
Non-therapeutic male circumcision is discussed in a recent Australian Policy Online report .
Personally , I ’d see non-therapeutic male circumcision in the same category as intimate or genital piercing , and covered by a section of the Summary Offences Amendment ( Tattooing and Body Piercing ) Bill 2008 ( Vic ) Division 6 :
44 (2 ) : A body piercer must not perform body piercing on the genitalia , anal region , perineum or nipples of a person under the age of 18 years , whether or not consent has been given to the body piercing .
It ’s worth noting that the Current Issues Brief No. 3 , 2008 from the Research Service of the Victorian Parliament discusses the Victorian bill , and regulations in other Australian jurisdictions , the paper does not even contain the word circumcision .
The paper also notes circumstances covered by other bills :
Causing injury or serious injury intentionally , recklessly or negligently , and endangerment offences under sections 16 , 17 , 18 , 23 and 24 of the Crimes Act 1958 ; and
Female genital mutilation under section 32 of the Crimes Act .
Some belief systems use the term " circumcision " when genital mutilation is the only realistic term .
Why should the law be sexist ?
In the " Purposes " of the bill , the stated intent includes prevention of scarification of those under 18 , defined as follows :
scarification means the cutting of the skin of a person to create scar tissue ;
Male circumcision , therapeutic or not , certainly creates scar tissue !
The 2008 bill gives reasonable protection for surgeons ( presumably to cover therapeutic procedures ) :
43A (1 ) Nothing in this Division applies to body piercing performed in good faith — in the course of a regulated health service provided by a registered health practitioner ; or
in the course of clinical training by a registered student .
In the 2008 bill , it is explicitly stated that " regulated health service " has the same meaning as in the Health Professions Registration Act 2005 ( Vic ) :
regulated health service means a health service usually provided in a regulated health profession
A religious activity is not a health service !
Section 44 makes no bones about intimate piercings of those under 18 – parental consent and / or the wishes of the child simply do not matter .
It is an offence .
Full stop .
Now I have no problem with a religiously - motivated circumcision of an adult .
It ’s their problem , and indeed , it ’s good for rational society because there is the chance that a firm believer in any faith will not be able to procreate as the result of the circumcision .
Let ’s look at the Judaic and Christian so - called logic in particular :
A child cannot confirm their religious adherence until they are adolescents , notably 13 for Judaic males .
Genital mutilation for religious reasons should surely require the informed consent of the subject as to both the religion and the process .
So , by their own logic , a non-reversible procedure carried out as part of religious adherence should not be carried out on pre-teens – parental consent or not .
It ’s really no different from Munchausens By Proxy , although the perpetrators are not clinically insane , even though they are patently irrational ( indeed belief with no rational inquiry is regarded as a virtue ) .
The paper published at the APO comes originally from the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute and includes the following ( my bolding ) :
The Institute received the reference from the Commissioner for Children who is a member of the Council of Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity .
The Commissioner asked the Institute to investigate the legal issues relating to the circumcision of males under the age of majority .
The Commissioner was concerned that some procedures , when performed without medical indication and without the competent consent of the child , may traverse the rights of children .
Circumcision satisfies the legal definition of both wounding and assault .
Young children , infants in particular , may be unable to communicate consent and would almost certainly not be able to understand the nature of a circumcision procedure .
Thus infants , and most young children , will not be able to provide consent that might make a circumcision lawful .
Section 2A ( 2 ) (e ) of the Tasmanian Code provides that there is no free agreement when a person : " agrees or submits because he or she is overborne by the nature or position of another person . "
No legislation in Tasmania provides a general power for parents to make legal , through their consent or authorisation , what would otherwise be an offence to their children .
Common law cases contain non-binding statements suggesting that a person who circumcises a child is not criminally responsible for the act if the child ’s parents consented to , or authorised , the procedure .
The basis for this proposition is uncertain .
Would non-therapeutic circumcision of the child of atheists be legal ?
Would a jury decide differently based on the religion position of one or both parents ?
Where the paper cites arguments in favor of allowing circumcision without consent , those arguments are tortuous , and designed to satisfy the irrational beliefs of powerful religious groups .
It seems to me that any organization that promotes or even accepts the genital mutilation of infants is no better than a child pornography ring , and should be declared an illegal organization .
Actually , there are more parallels with a child abuse network than a child pornography ring .
It also seems to me that prohibiting female " circumcision " while allowing the analogous procedure on a male infant without compelling therapeutic need , is merely enshrining sexism and religious apartheid in law .
It must stop .

We ’ve all got pieces of furniture that look like they ’re on the way out .
When I first moved to Atlanta , a friend gave me a coffee table .
I had no money and very little furniture , so I was grateful even though the table was sort of …well … it was ugly , alright ?
It was an ugly , ugly table .
Rather than pitch it , I decided to give it a fresh coat of white paint and try my hand at a mosaic .
We still have that little coffee table living out on the front porch !
It ’s a little bit dusty at the moment , but I ’ll show you a picture if you promise not to judge my housekeeping skills :
[ Mosaic coffee table .
The measuring cup is for watering the veggies you see in the background . ]
Even though it ’s a little bit worn now and the colors have faded from sitting in the sun , I love that little table like no other .
I ca n’t look at it without thinking about the time spent carefully laying out the pattern until the design was just how I wanted it and the rewarding process of painting the wood and laying the tile .
What started as an ugly hand - me - down is now a treasured piece !
Here are a few options if you ’re looking to do your own furniture revamp !
Mosaic
If you ’re trying to spruce something up that can support a little bit of weight , mosaic might be a good option !
Not only can you salvage a scratched tabletop , you can divert some trash from the waste stream while you ’re at it !
You might cover your project with recycled glass , old bottlecaps , or broken ceramics or tiles that would have headed for the landfill .
Check out this tutorial from eHow for mosaic instructions .
Decoupage
Mosaic is a little bit labor - intensive and requires a whole lot of materials .
If you ’re looking for something a bit simpler , decoupage might be what you ’re after !
You can even decoupage fabric onto a worn out chair to give it a whole new life !
What a great chance to raid your scrap bin !
For some more decoupage inspiration check out this post over at Ikea Hacker .
They show a lovely combination of paint and decoupage and a beautiful table decoupaged with paint chips .
Here are some helpful decoupage instructions from Gothic Martha Stewart .
Paints and Stains
Whether you want to simply change the color of your piece or add a fancypants design , there are a bunch of great options out there !
Check out these vibrant stains that Lenore used to spruce up an old dresser .
If paint is more your speed , hunt down a low - or no-VOC variety .
Jessica Gottlieb has a few eco-friendly paint options over at Eco Child ’s Play .
For some tips on painting furniture , This Young House has you covered !
Fabrics
If you ’re sewing - inclined , you might consider recovering or slip covering an old piece .
An old table or trunk can look brand new if you put together a fitted slip cover for it .
Feeling really ambitious ?
You might try recovering the whole piece , like the famous IKEA chair revamp by Minouette .
For a simpler , no - sew recovering option , check this video from ReadyMade on reupholstering a dining room chair .
You can keep this eco-friendly by using a low - VOC spray adhesive , like this one from 3M :

Senate Democrats say they will strip out $ 80 M in new funding in a wartime spending bill to begin the process of closing the Guantanamo detention facility .
| REUTERS
Democrats fold on closing Gitmo
In a clear setback for President Barack Obama , Senate Democrats moved Tuesday to both wipe out $ 80 million in new funding for the closing the Guantanamo detention facility and bar the administration from moving prisoners to U.S. soil until there is a more detailed plan provided to lawmakers .
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) confirmed the decision , which follows intense pressure from Republicans going into debate over a $ 91.3 billion wartime spending bill expected to come to the floor late Tuesday .
Advertisement
“ We ’ll wipe out all the money , ” Inouye said , “ And I ’ll put in a provision that says none of the funds in this bill or any other bill can be used to pay for the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo to the United States . ”
Inouye held out the option that Obama could still seek funding as part of the regular Defense and Justice Department appropriations bills for the new fiscal year that begins Oct.
1 . But at this stage , securing the money now — without an approved plan — was a “ non-starter , ” he said .
Following
House debate last week on the same bill , Obama is left with no money and less flexibility than when he first made his funding request this spring .
The wholesale retreat heightens the importance of a Thursday speech by Obama when he is expected to address the Guantanamo issue .
At a time when new polls actually show the president riding high on national security issues , Guantanamo has proved especially nettlesome .
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player
This was well illustrated by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s seemingly contradictory comments following a Democratic caucus luncheon Tuesday .
Reid said that closing Guantanamo was the right decision but “ We will never allow terrorists to be released in the United States . ”
Asked next , if he could see a day when Guantanamo detainees might be transferred to prisons on American soil , Reid refused to clarify his remarks .
“ We do n’t want them around , ” he said .
In recent days , Obama has sent mixed signals himself as he sorts through the complexities of how to bring to trial the remaining prisoners .
Republicans have used this confusion to play on the localized fears and emotions of voters about prisoners being transferred to prisons in their states .
“ Obama has n’t done us any favors on this , ” said one Democratic leadership aide .
“ He ’s a little of this , a little of that .
The Republicans have one compelling message . ”
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) was early to see the localized politics of the issue and has been beating the drums steadily for weeks on the Guantanamo issue .
With his blessing , Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) — whose state is home to Ft. Sill , a possible detention side -- was already poised to offer language barring the transfer of any detainee to American soil .
Whether Inhofe will still proceed was not clear , but Democrats clearly hope by their action to preempt what promised to be a messy fight .
As reported from Inouye ’s committee last week , the Senate bill had provided $ 80 million sought by Justice and the Pentagon to begin to carry out Obama ’s executive order that Guantanamo be closed by early next year .
The House last week stripped out all of the money , but Inouye had hoped to chart a middle course that kept the money in place but allows none of it to be released until the White House has come forward with a detailed plan to address security concerns among lawmakers .
Given the emotions of the moment , these hopes were short lived .
In a week when Obama is poised to win both credit card reform and anti-foreclosure legislation from Congress , frustrated Republicans have seized on Guantanamo as an opportunity to bloody the president on what ’s been a signature issue for him .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) could see his Democrats already wavering , as signaled by Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) over the weekend .
Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh , who must run for re-election in Republican - leaning Indiana next year , ( D - Ind. ) , said he welcomed the decision to drop the money .
And even freshly elected senators with a six year term in front of them could see the dangers .
“ I did n’t hear anybody bring it up , ” said Sen . Tom Udall ( D - N.M. ) recalling town meetings he held during the spring break in April .
“ Buy my guess is if you had one headline that we were opening a facility , the first issue would be where ?
And if it was in Albuquerque New Mexico , I ’d think we would get many , many calls . ”
A beauty queen whose opposition to gay marriage turned her into an overnight poster girl for America 's conservative movement has been stripped of her hard - won tiara , after failing to properly discharge the onerous responsibilities of a reigning Miss California .
Carrie Prejean shot to global prominence after telling judges at the Miss USA pageant in April that " marriage should be between a man and a woman , " but was fired on Wednesday for what Miss California officials described as repeated " contract violations . "
Her sacking had nothing to do with a media feeding frenzy over recently - discovered topless photos of Prejean , or the revelation that she 'd undergone breast enhancement surgery .
Neither was it related to tabloid reports that , for all her grandstanding about traditional values , Prejean 's mother , Francine , is a lesbian .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Instead , Donald Trump , the entrepreneur who owns the Miss USA organisation , told reporters that Miss Prejean had simply failed to do her job : refusing , to appear on Larry King 's CNN show , or show up at several public events organised by the pageant 's sponsors .
" I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract , " he said .
" Unfortunately , it just does n't look like it is going to happen …
Carrie is a beautiful young woman and I wish her well as she pursues her other interests . "
Miss Prejean , who will be replaced by her runner - up Tami Farrell , nonetheless claimed that her termination was politically motivated : " None of this would be happening right now if I had just said , ' Yeah , gays should get married , " she said .
This wo n't make things cozier between Intel ( INTC ) and Microsoft :
The chip giant is showing off a new version of its Moblin operating system , a Linux - based OS for netbooks .
If it gets any traction on netbooks -- the PC industry 's biggest growth segment -- that could be bad news for Microsoft 's dominant Windows .
WSJ : Moblin v2.0 , designed for use with an Intel chip called Atom , comes with a distinctive interface called M - zone that 's designed to help users play digital media , use the Internet and engage in social networking .
Partners such as Novell Inc. , which will help adapt and sell Moblin , say the easy - to - use software could help Linux finally expand beyond a tiny niche in the PC market .
" For users who are looking for an alternative to Windows , it 's disruptive , " said Guy Lunardi , whose title at Novell is director of client preloads .
While Linux - based netbooks have been on the market for years , and Google ( GOOG ) will supposedly power some netbooks with its Android operating system , Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Windows XP is currently the dominant netbook OS .
If Microsoft can make a decent , low - cost version of its forthcoming Windows 7 for netbooks , there 's no reason to think that 'll change any time soon .
People are familiar with Windows , and people like to use what they 're familiar with .
But if someone like Intel or Google can make an excellent Linux - based operating system with a great feature set and user interface -- that 's significantly cheaper for netbook makers to use as the basis of their devices -- that could disrupt Microsoft longer - term .
Or , of course , Apple could steal the show and make today 's netbooks look like Rio MP3 players .
Unsourced rumors that Last.fm handed over user data to the RIAA have resurfaced thanks to renewed and revised accusations against Last . fm 's parent company , CBS .
We reached out to the targets of the rumor to see if they had official comment .
The RIAA , Last.fm , and CBS vehemently deny the claims , in broad terms , with one related party speaking on the condition of anonymity going so far as to call the story an instance of " irresponsible journalism . "
It all started in February when TechCrunch published information from an unnamed " source " claiming that Last.fm had handed over individual user data to the RIAA after U2's then - unreleased album leaked onto the Internet .
It was argued that this showed the RIAA how many users ( and their IP addresses ) had downloaded copies of the music and listened to it .
The accusations sparked some panic among the Last .fm community .
Last.fm quickly issued a " full and categorical denial " of the accusations , and the RIAA told Ars that it had n't requested the data , and did n't even know where the rumor came from in the first place .
Some months later , Tech Crunch returned to the topic with a new rumor based on yet another unnamed source who is said to be " very close to Last.fm . "
The claims now have morphed from Last . fm secreting the data to the RIAA , to CBS doing so .
Or , maybe , CBS did n't send it to the RIAA , maybe they sent it to a record label .
Or , perhaps , CBS was intending to send it , but never actually did .
As a result , Last. fm 's Russ Garrett has issued a strongly worded denial on Last . fm 's forums .
" That particular data is controlled tightly inside Last.fm and is only stored for a short period of time .
Any request for such data would have to be approved by myself first .
The suggestion that CBS 's ops team provided this data is just not possible — Last . fm operates as a separate entity and their operations staff do not have access to our system , " Garrett said .
" It really seems like someone is trying to slander us here . "
In another post , Garrett clarified that Last.fm has never given data linking IPs to scrobbles to any third party or to CBS , for that matter .
CBS is obviously frustrated by the airtime this story has gotten and has issued its own statement on the matter to Ars Technica .
" [ A ] bsolutely no individual user or listener information was supplied to the RIAA by Last.fm or any division of CBS Corporation in the past , nor do we plan to do so in the future , " CBS told Ars .
When we asked if perhaps CBS had transferred the data to a music label or other third party , CBS said , " We never handed over user info to the music labels or anyone else . "
And , once again , the RIAA confirmed that it played no part in this drama : " We 've made no such request for this information , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told us .
This all leaves us in the same place we were in February — with a slew of accusations , a handful of denials , and zero evidence .

Summary : Debian a step closer to Mono independence , whereas Ubuntu does not quite tolerate Mono criticism
G note has just been added to lenny - backports , so there is hope that Debian will remove Mono as a by - default component .
Sooner or later it might , just like Fedora .
Although Ubuntu can follow suit and remove Mono as a default component by simply replacing applications , it does not seem likely to happen when pro-Mono people gain positions of power .
We warned over a year ago that this might happen to Ubuntu .
Being the most ubiquitous distribution on the desktop , it is a preferred battleground for the likes of Novell and Microsoft to advance interests .
Rigging of votes , for example , is not far fetched at all .
The longer time flies , the worse it gets because Ubuntu ignores many people 's desire to cull Mono out and even suppresses those who dare to speak against Mono .
Now , watch this from Brainstorm .
People make the suggestion that Mono should not be included by default and the page gets frozen with the following reason :
This entry was marked as not being an idea the 3 June 09 .
If this is a bug report , please use the Ubuntu bug tracker .
How is this not an idea ?
Sounds like an excuse to silence ‘ dissent ’ .
One of our readers ( unrelated to the above ) told us this yesterday :
Hi Roy , the other day I noticed you linked to my brainstorm thread about keeping RB and not moving to Banshee , I mostly did it because I like RB and Banshee , besides of bringing a Mono dependency , is not really as good .
The thread , out of sudden was declared a ‘ duplicate ’ , what ’s worse is that the votes were not just locked ( like what happens in brainstorm when something is marked as duplicate ) but completely removed :
http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/20016/
It used to have many votes for ‘ Keep Rhythmbox ” and many negative votes for “ Move to Banshee ” , it seems that the Mono zealots have acquired too much control of ubuntu brainstorm this is a disgrace .
What exactly is happening with Mono in Ubuntu ?
This is not intended to seem like a complaint about Ubuntu , but maybe a constructive way forward would be voting with the feet and rewarding distributions that do listen and do recognise the problems with Moonlight and Mono .
I still have 3 computers running Ubuntu and they give the false impression that Mono is acceptable ; even if removed afterwards it ’s akin to buying a computer with Windows just to wipe Windows .
That would still count as Windows market share , just not installed base .
To people who study trends of perceived consumer desire , this may matter a lot and affect future decisions . █

Periodically , I 'll receive an e-mail from a reader inquiring describing a very unusual sight that they have seen in the sky .
A typical inquiry might read something like this :
" I happened to be outside the other night when I caught sight of an ordinary - looking star that suddenly became super - bright .
My first thought was that perhaps I was witnessing something akin to a supernova . . . the death of a star . "
The person goes on to explain how the flare died away seconds later , as quickly and mysteriously as it came .
If you have ever seen such a sight , then in all likelihood you 've witnessed an " Iridium flare , " caused by one in a fleet of satellites that have been put into Earth orbit since the late 1990's ; satellites that can briefly appear to flare to incredible brilliance .
And you can spot them , too , if you first find out when they 're likely to occur .
Space mirrors
An Iridium communication satellite 's Main Mission Antenna is a silver - coated Teflon antenna array that mimics near - perfect mirrors and are angled at 40 - degrees away from the axis of the body of the satellites .
This can provide a specular ( direct ) reflection of the Suns disk , periodically causing a dazzling glint of reflected sunlight from their 484 mi ( 780 km ) orbits .
At the Earth 's surface , the specular reflection is probably less than 50 miles wide , so each flare can only be viewed from a fairly small area .
Iridium satellites normally traverse the sky on the edge of visibility , at +6 magnitude .
On this astronomer 's scale , smaller numbers represent brighter objects .
Venus outshines all stars and planets reaching a magnitude of - 4.8 at its very brightest .
Iridium satellites can provide reflective flares of magnitude - 8 .
That 's almost 20 times brighter than Venus , based on how the brightness scale works .
The flares can last anywhere from 5 to 20 seconds before the satellite once again becomes almost invisible to the naked eye .
In fact , it is even possible to see such flares during the daytime , if you know exactly where to look .
Where to look
If you wish to see such brief flares for yourself , you will first have to know your exact latitude , longitude and local time zone .
Then , log on to a web page that will tell you when the next Iridium flares can be seen .
One such site is Heavens Above , hosted by the German Aerospace Center .
This site and others also provide viewing information for the International Space Station , the Hubble Space Telescope and other satellites .
A bit of caution : Not all Iridiums flare according to the predicted schedules .
Some of the Iridium satellites are either tumbling or otherwise not operational so their future movements cannot be reliably predicted .
A fully operational satellite should be orbiting the Earth at 14.34 revolutions per day .
You may wonder why are the satellites called " Iridium ? "
It has absolutely nothing to do with the metallic element that occurs in platinum ores .
Originally , it was conceived that a total of 77 Iridium communication satellites would be placed into Earth orbit .
Since the atomic number for Iridium is 77 , a satellite constellation 's name was conceived .
In reality , a total of 88 satellites were launched between May 5 , 1997 and June 11 , 1999 .
An additional five more were launched on February 11 , 2002 .
Typically , the expected lifetime of a satellite is 5 to 8 years .

THERE is fresh evidence that the budding field of social neuroscience is producing misleading results because of statistical methods often used to analyse brain scans .
In January , Hal Pashler of the University of California , San Diego , and colleagues , sparked controversy when they criticised the statistical methods used by a clutch of high - profile research teams to link brain activity to emotions .
They said the teams ’ results could be inflated because random noise was not properly accounted for .
Now Nikolaus Kriegeskorte of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland , and his colleagues report that of more than 100 brain - imaging …

When Danielle Smith and her family posed for their Christmas card photo last year , they knew they 'd share it with family and friends .
But the Missouri family was n't expecting it to show up in the Czech Republic , splashed across a huge storefront advertisement .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Smith , 36 , who lives in the St. Louis suburb of O'Fallon , said yesterday that she posted the photo on her blog and some online social networking sites .
It featured Smith , her husband Jeff and their two children .
About 10 days ago , a college friend was driving through Prague when he spotted their huge smiling faces in the window of a store specialising in European food .
He snapped a few pictures and sent them to a flabbergasted Smith .
" It 's a life - size picture in a grocery store window in Prague - my Christmas card photo ! " she said .
Mario Bertuccio , who owns the Grazie store in Prague , said the photo was from the internet .
Details were sparse , but he said he thought it was computer - generated .
When told it was a real photo - of a real family - he said he started taking steps to remove it .
" We 'll be happy to write an email with our apology , " said Bertuccio .
The Smiths and photographer Gina Kelly had n't authorised anyone to use the pictures .
Kelly said she has asked a professional photographers ' organisation to help figure out how her image wound up in Prague .
Smith has had 180,000 hits on her website since she recently posted the story about the well - travelled snapshot .
She said the photo was n't used in an unseemly manner , only to tell potential shoppers about the store 's delivery service .
Smith said next time she posts a photo on the internet , she 's going to lower the resolution or add an electronic watermark to make it hard to reproduce .

" This story does n't frighten me , but the potential frightens me , " Smith said .
Urban legends and myths continue to dupe us .
Until the Paris tasting in 1976 , the myth that France was the only Country that could produce high quality wine lived on in oenophiles minds .
Even though you may laugh at the myths below some people are still fooled by them .
Let ’s try to set the record straight .
Here are the top 10 myths about wine .
10 . Fruit used to describe wine went into making it .
Unless you are buying a wine made from a fruit other than grapes , it is made from the grape varietal on the label , and not from fruit used to describe it ( e.g. , black cherry , strawberry , kiwi ) .
It ’s comparable to artificial flavors , i.e. they taste similar to whatever is being copied but do not contain the actual ingredient .
So when you see , “ hints of raspberry , cherry , and vanilla ” on the label , the producer is simply describing how the wine tastes similar to these components , they were n’t actually used in the production of the wine .

9 . You need a different wine glass for different types of wines .
Again , this is a myth that was debunked a long time ago .
You do need a tulip shaped glass or a glass that tappers towards the top to concentrate the aroma toward your nose , but , different shapes to place wine on your tongue in different areas or to aerate the wine faster are n’t necessary .
Get yourself a nice set of stemware ( Riedel Ouverture Red Wine , Zinfandel or these Riedel O Stemless ) and save the space in your cupboard .

8. You ca n’t age wines sealed with an alternative closure
In fact , the data shows that screw caps , or twist - offs as they are sometimes called , are more consistent at sealing wine than cork .
One study , cited in the March 31 , 2005 issue of Wine Spectator on pages 59 - 60 , found that screw caps allowed .001 cc ’s of oxygen per day on average , versus corks that allowed anywhere from to .1 to .001 cc ’s of air to enter a wine bottle .
In fact , 7 of the 35 bottles sealed with cork allowed .1 cc’s !
That means twist - offs are more consistent and let in less oxygen over time , which would result in longer bottle aging .
The cork industry would like to have you believe otherwise , but do n’t buy it , screw caps are here to stay and you wo n’t have a problem letting these wines age .

7. Bordeaux , Burgundy , Champagne , Sherry , and Port are grape varieties .
Thanks to a confusing labeling system from the old world this is a common mistake wine consumers make .
Cities in France , Spain , Italy , and Portugal , among others , restrict production of grape varieties in their area .
For a winery to receive legal approval and label their wine , it must be made in the manner mandated by the organization that oversees production there .
That means Champagne is not a variety of wine , but the place where some sparkling wine is made .
Want to make a non-sparkling wine in the Champagne region from say , Cabernet Sauvignon , and write that on the label ?
You can ’t .
Same with Bordeaux , which is a blend of different red varietal grapes , Burgundy , which is primarily made from Pinot Noir , and Port , which is made from various red and white grape varieties .

6 . Pair white wine with fish or chicken and red wine with red meat
Although this is the most common answer to ‘ what wine should I pair with what food , ’ it is incorrect .
The better way to pair food and wine is by anylizing the flavors of the food and the flavors of the wine .
For example , if you are grilling fish and decide to season it with a little salt , lemon , and butter , a nice Sauvignon Blanc with citrus notes or a Chardonnay with buttery flavors would work great .
If , however , it ’s salmon that will be smothered in a blackberry sauce , you would be better suited in choosing a fruity red wine like a Pinot Noir , Merlot , or even a Syrah .
The best thing to do is read the description of the wine from the label or a review on a blog and then pair like with like .
It ’s also helpful to understand that wines with firm tannins work better with salty dishes , or that acidic wines need a dish with a bit of acid , or how spicy food works better with wines with some residual sugar and not a high alcohol level .
Just remember there are no hard and fast rules to this .
Dr. Vino has been playing with impossible pairings for some time so search out advice if you get stumped , it ’s available .

5 . Wine lovers are snobs
Only people that live in Napa or Bordeaux are …. no , I kid .
Actually , most serious wine lovers are students of it and are quite down to earth .
It ’s the people that mask their ignorance with arrogance you have to watch out for .
True wine lovers are passionate about continuing their wine education , and are willing to share their knowledge and a glass with anyone interested .
Photo by Eda Cherry
4 . You can discern wine quality by looking at the legs .
You swirl your glass , set it down and notice that a thin , clear layer has stuck to the inside of the glass , and begins to drip down .
Sometimes referred to as tears , this is simply a small amount of alcohol and water that adheres to the surface of the glass and as the alcohol evaporates water is left dripping it ’s way back in .
Why ?
Water is a primary component in wine , and alcohol evaporates much quicker , so when left on the glass , the alcohol evaporates and the surface tension of the water increases forming drops that gravity takes control of .
This is not a measure of the viscosity or the quality of the wine so do n’t worry about it .
Further reading on this phenomena can be found here [ kitchensavy.com ] and on Wikipedia .

3. Drink Red Wine At Room Temperature , White Wine Chilled
Although this idea is n’t necessarily wrong , it ’s interpretation almost always is .
Many see this as letting a red wine sit out on the counter so it can come to the current room temperature , and opening white wine right out of the fridge .
The real idea behind room temperature for red wine was getting it to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit , the typical temperature of a “ room ” when this saying was popularized .
Many professionals agree , the best way to enjoy wine if you do n’t have the luxury of a temperature controlled storage device , is to put your red wines in the fridge for about 5 – 15 minutes before consuming , white wines about 20 – 30 minutes .
If you store your wine in the fridge , take the whites out for at least 15 minutes before serving , reds at least 30 .
Again , it is n’t an exact science , but typically you ’re looking for around 60 degrees Fahrenheit on a red , a little below that for a white , and a bit colder for anything that sparkles .
Some argue that nuances are n’t observed in white wines that are too cold , which is true .
I find that if you chill your wines , over the course of the evening they will warm up and you can observe the development through the night .
Professor Bainbridge expands on the subject a bit at the bottom of this op -ed The Red Wines of Summer .

2 . All wines get better with age .
Actually , a very small number of wines have the proper structure to hold up to aging .
Most wines are made with the intention that they will be opened within a few years .
The small amount of trophy wines that garner the majority of the press are the ones that have been built for longer aging , and most people do n’t even buy these wines .
So if you ’ve been saving that white Zinfandel from 10 years ago because you think it ’s getting better , might want to cut your losses now .

1. Smelling the cork in a restaurant will tell you if the wine is bad .
Cork ’s smell like …. well , cork , and wo n’t give you an indication of the quality of the wine .
It ’s the wine that you want to smell , the cork is only offered to you for a quick examination .
So what should you be looking for when the waiter hands you the cork ?
If you ’re buying an expensive bottle the biggest thing you want to avoid is fraud , and if you ’re at a reputable restaurant , they ’re going to be buying from reputable sources , but again , this is just a precaution .
Does the winery ’s name , logo , or other branding information appear on the cork ?
Has the cork been damaged , compromised , allowed seepage in any way ?
If it is a more expensive bottle , does the year stamped on the cork match the vintage of the wine ?

Firmware 2.80 was n’t the PS Cloud rumor , but rather an update that kept the PS3 unhacked .
A recent hack , Open Remote Play , allowed you to access your PS3 through a cell phone , laptop , or desktop via Remote Play .
The latest update prevents you from taking advantage of this hack .
Dashhacker had this to say about the latest PS3 firmware update :
As some of you may already know , Sony has blocked Open Remote Play as of PS3 firmware v2.80 , June 24th .
At this time , ORP will no longer work for longer than about 30 – 60 seconds .
I ’ve only looked at the problem for a few minutes but it seems that they ’ve “ poisoned ” the video stream by some means rather than changing the keys or cryptography .
I ’ll study what they ’ve done and patch FFmpeg within the next … week ?
month ?
Not too sure how long it ’ll be before I can undo Sony ’s greedy brain damage .
I ’ll post any progress here as I muddle through it .
Sony has done everything in its power to prevent the PS3 from suffering the same fate as the PSP did due to rampant hacking .
Hopefully the features made available by this hack will come to the PS3 in a future firmware update .

In 1944 , during World War II , Japan launched a top secret project , nearly two years in the making , to send thousands of " balloon bombs " ( called Fu- Go Weapons ) to the United States .
The goal of the attack was to create panic , forest fires , and show the United States that it could be attacked from afar .
Each of the more than 9,000 balloon bombs launched towards the United States , over the course of several months , carried a 15 kilogram bomb that would detach from the balloon and explode on impact with the ground .
On November 3 , 1944 , Japan launched its first series of Fu - Go Weapon balloon bombs as a way of " invading " the US from afar and creating havoc among its citizens and government ..
It was meant to be " revenge " for the Doolittle raids on Japan .
The balloons were n't designed to navigate themselves and that 's part of the wonder of this Japans offensive .
The ballons would rise to the sky , from the beaches of Japan , and follow the Jet Stream all the way to the United States .
From the time the balloons were launched , it would take 3 - 4 days to reach the United States .
About 1,000 of the more than 9,000 balloons actually reached the United States or Canada .
The rest are believed to have failed during their journey , falling into the ocean .
The United States government went to extraordinary measures to keep information on the Japanese balloon bombs out of the media .
The United States knew that Japan could only measure its success based on media reports .
And giving them that type of intelligence information could cause them to refine the balloons to be more accurate and deadly .
To date , the majority of Americans still do n't know about the balloon bomb attacks .
The attacks are most known about in Oregon because five children and one adult were killed when they found a balloon in the forest and tried to pull it out , triggering the unexploded bomb .
A memorial was set up for them where the incident took place .
It is the only known deaths from the attacks .
This Website has been designed to provide you with more information and insight into the Japanese balloon bomb attacks .
This week police and anti-piracy groups moved to close down a very large BitTorrent tracker .
With 250,000 users , Snowtigers was possibly the largest French tracker .
According to reports , police arrested 10 members of staff and seized more than 20 servers , after the military assisted in locating the operators .
France .
Land of romance , cheese and fine wines – and administrative base for one of the world ’s biggest semi-private BitTorrent trackers .
Born in 2005 , SnowTigers offered all the usual BitTorrent site content but being French , also carried links to home grown music and movies , a situation the authorities moved to end this week .
On Tuesday , police backed up by members of ALPA ( Association Against Audiovisual Piracy ) moved to close down SnowTigers , making 10 arrests in the Paris and Toulouse areas .
According to Zataz , 21 servers were also seized .
France is becoming known as a country engaging in an increasingly aggressive fight against piracy and their enthusiasm seems to have gone through the roof in this case , with an ALPA spokesperson confirming that they had “ worked very closely with the military ” to locate the staff of the semi-private site .
Snowtigers fell prey to the military
The police and anti-piracy groups seem to be focused on the revenue generated by SnowTigers which they claim should have gone to the rights holders .
ALPA president Frédéric Delacroix insisted that SnowTigers was a criminal organization .
“ The site has garnered several hundred thousand euros , ” he claimed .
As rumors persist that SnowTigers invitations were available to buy via various sources for around 30 euros each , while other users simply donated money to the site , Frédéric Delacroix of ALPA was keen to sow the seeds of doubt in their direction .
“ All people who have paid money [ to the site ] can now be questioned , ” he said .
Attacking the other major lifelines for any BitTorrent tracker – the releasers and heavy users – Delacroix hinted that there may be prosecutions around the corner for them too .
“ We are dealing with a truly international network , ” he said , adding “ the investigation is not complete , it exceeds our French borders . ”
Indeed , according to Zataz , SnowTigers had other servers located outside France , namely at LeaseWeb in The Netherlands and Netelligent in Canada .
The status of those servers is unclear .
An ultra-powerful laser can turn regular incandescent light bulbs into power - sippers , say optics researchers at the University of Rochester .
The process could make a light as bright as a 100 - watt bulb consume less electricity than a 60 - watt bulb while remaining far cheaper and radiating a more pleasant light than a fluorescent bulb can .
The laser process creates a unique array of nano - and micro-scale structures on the surface of a regular tungsten filament — the tiny wire inside a light bulb — and theses structures make the tungsten become far more effective at radiating light .
The findings will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .
" We 've been experimenting with the way ultra - fast lasers change metals , and we wondered what would happen if we trained the laser on a filament , " says Chunlei Guo , associate professor of optics at the University of Rochester .
" We fired the laser beam right through the glass of the bulb and altered a small area on the filament .
When we lit the bulb , we could actually see this one patch was clearly brighter than the rest of the filament , but there was no change in the bulb 's energy usage . "
The key to creating the super - filament is an ultra - brief , ultra - intense beam of light called a femtosecond laser pulse .
The laser burst lasts only a few quadrillionths of a second .
To get a grasp of that kind of speed , consider that a femtosecond is to a second what a second is to about 32 million years .
During its brief burst , Guo 's laser unleashes as much power as the entire grid of North America onto a spot the size of a needle point .
That intense blast forces the surface of the metal to form nanostructures and microstructures that dramatically alter how efficiently can radiate from the filament .
In 2006 , Guo and his assistant , Anatoliy Vorobeyv , used a similar laser process to turn any metal pitch black .
The surface structures created on the metal were incredibly effective at capturing incoming radiation , such as light .
" There is a very interesting ' take more , give more ' law in nature governing the amount of light going in and coming out of a material , " says Guo .
Since the black metal was extremely good at absorbing light , he and Vorobyev set out to study the reverse process — that the blackened filament would radiate light more effectively as well .
" We knew it should work in theory , " says Guo , " but we were still surprised when we turned up the power on this bulb and saw just how much brighter the processed spot was . "
In addition to increasing the brightness of a bulb , Guo 's process can be used to tune the color of the light as well .
In 2008 , his team used a similar process to change the color of nearly any metal to blue , golden , and gray , in addition to the black he 'd already accomplished .
Guo and Vorobeyv used that knowledge of how to control the size and shape of the nanostructures — and thus what colors of light those structures absorb and radiate — to change the amount of each wavelength of light the tungsten filament radiates .
Though Guo cannot yet make a simple bulb shine pure blue , for instance , he can change the overall radiated spectrum so that the tungsten , which normally radiates a yellowish light , could radiate a more purely white light .
Guo 's team has even been able to make a filament radiate partially polarized light , which until now has been impossible to do without special filters that reduce the bulb 's efficiency .
By creating nanostructures in tight , parallel rows , some light that emits from the filament becomes polarized .
The team is now working to discover what other aspects of a common light bulb they might be able to control .
Fortunately , despite the incredible intensity involved , the femtosecond laser can be powered by a simple wall outlet , meaning that when the process is refined , implementing it to augment regular light bulbs should be relatively simple .
Guo is also announcing this month in Applied Physics Letters a technique using a similar femtosecond laser process to make a piece of metal automatically move liquid around its surface , even lifting a liquid up against gravity .

Who was Michael Jackson writing all those songs for during his career ?
Some lucky lady ?
No .
Brett Favre .
I was doing some investigating for a Jackson tribute post comparing Jackson ’s song titles to players and teams in the NFL .
For example , the song “ Bad ” was matched up with the Detroit Lions because the Lions were , well , bad ( “ horrendous ” is my word choice , but MJ does n’t have a song called “ Horrendous ” ) .
Favre was on that list in it ’s infancy under the song “ Circus Girl ” ( more on that later ) .
I was looking for more songs .
And every song I looked at reminded me of Favre .
Am I serious ?
Yes , I am .
Favre parallels the Jackson song titles quite well .
Almost too well …
“ Bad ” – Originally for the Lions , this aptly describes Favre play for the New York Jets down the stretch in 2008 .
And hopefully it will describe is play in 2009 for the Minnesota Vikings .
“ Circus Girl ” – The circus follows Favre everywhere .
Originally this was usually applied to ESPN ’s tendency to be on their knees 24/7 for Favre , but the circus tent has gotten bigger as NFL Network has joined in ( Scott Hanson staking out Favre ’s plane was just too much ) .
Also , many people think Favre is a girl .
Something that his intense waffling and teary - eyed “ retirement press conference ” exuded .
“ Cry ” – Just watch this video .
Self - explanatory .
“ Dangerous ” – Favre with the ball .
He ’d burn the defense deep or burn his offense with a pick .
Either way , danger was imminent .
“ Dirty Diana ” – For all intensive purposes , I ’m calling this one “ Dirty Deanna ” as it has been suggested that Deanna Favre is the one that has a problem with Ted Thompson and that she is the one driving him to come back .
“ Do n’t Walk Away ” – What legions of fans told Favre to do .
“ Fly Away ” – I feel this one suits Brett the Jet .
He flew away to the Big Apple , but as the season ended , I think all he wanted to do was “ Fly Away . ”
“ For All Time ” – Favre is an all - time quarterback .
He ’ll still be a Packer for all - time in most people ’s eyes .
“ Give In To Me ” – Favre wanted the Packers to give in to him and give him his job back last summer .
Thompson did n’t blink and Aaron Rodgers is the Packers new franchise quarterback .
“ History ” – So much history around Favre in all his records .
Touchdowns , yards , interceptions , it ’s all there .
Not to mention he played on the hallowed tundra of Lambeau Field .
“ Invincible ” – Favre thought he was indeed invincible and his play showed it .
Consecutive games streak .
You need to be nearly invincible to do that .
“ Money ” – According to multiple sources , money and a contract is the only thing between Favre and Minnesota purple .
“ Morphine ” – A low blow here , but we all know how much Favre loved his painkillers …
“ Never Can Say Goodbye ” – I do n’t think he will ever be able to say goodbye to the game .
He ’ll be on the sidelines in a hospital bed asking Brad Childress to put him in .
“ One More Chance ” – For Brett , one more chance to play in New York has turned into one more chance to play in Minnesota .
God only knows how many chances he ’ll have before he ’s done .
“ They Do n’t Care About Us ” – I ’d guess that ’s how Brett and Deanna felt after supposedly being forced out of Green Bay by Ted Thompson .
Of course Brett , the whole world ’s against you .
“ Thriller ” – I ’m sure most of you scrolled down to this one on the list first .
Favre was an entertainer .
He was a thriller .
His game was to thrill you with the touchdowns and then kill you with the interceptions .
But damn , watching some of those games were some of the most thrilling experiences a fan could have watching football .
It ’s one of the reasons that people still want to watch him .
He ’s a thriller , hands down .
So what do you all out there have ?
Comment with your Favre connections to MJ songs .
80 points for whoever can come up with one for “ Superfly Sister . ”
Researchers have discovered that “ missing ” genetic information unexpectedly reappears in later generations .
By poring over the genome of the model plant , Arabidopsis thaliana , scientists at Purdue University found specific genetic information present in a “ grandparent ” and “ grandchild , ” even though it was seemingly absent in the “ parent . ”
The study is featured in the March 24 issue of the journal Nature .
For more than a century , a basic tenet of inheritance has dictated that an organism ’s genome passes directly from one generation to the next in a predictable manner — from grandparents — to parents — to children .
Now , Susan Lolle , Robert Pruitt and their colleagues have shown this cardinal rule of inheritance is sometimes broken .
The scientists reached their conclusion by tracking how genetic information passes through multiple Arabidopsis generations .
In violation of current genetic theory , they found a significant percentage of the plant grandchildren had genetic information identical to that of the grandparent , but not the parent .
But how could the child acquire genetic information from its grandparent , if the parent had lost it ?
Lolle and Pruitt postulate that the “ lost ” genetic information securely resides outside the standard genome and is only retrieved under particular circumstances when it may be beneficial to restore genomic sequences back to an ancestral state .
So , the information was not lost , but rather “ hidden ” — from scientists anyway .
How does the plant benefit by accessing a cache of its ancestor ’s genomic information ?
Lolle said , “ This ancestral information acts like a reserve genetic template that plants can make use of should living conditions become less ideal . ”
She continued , “ In this way , we think plants get a ‘ second chance ’ to win the genetic lottery . ”
Like any good scientist , Lolle was skeptical of her own results and hesitant to believe something so novel was occurring .
For years she reasoned there were trivial explanations for what she was seeing .
Eventually , however , Lolle could no longer discount the evidence , so she meticulously repeated experiments and verified results , ruling out all explanations afforded by conventional dogma .
The data became irrefutable — the genetic information was “ skipping ” a generation .
It ’s a nearly heretical theory .
Indeed , the implications will have scientists pondering old results anew .
As Rita Teutonico , the National Science Foundation program manager who oversees this work said , “ We knew the project was ambitious , but these results challenge us to re-think some genetic paradigms and demonstrate that some very forward thinking ideas warrant investigation . ”
Teutonico continued , “ This result illustrates the benefits of the NSF ’s support of bold , high - payoff science . ”

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
In the northwest Pacific Ocean , the Oyashio Current flows down out of the Arctic , past Siberia and the Kamchatka Peninsula .
Around the latitude of Hokkaido , Japan , it begins to veer eastward and converges with the warmer Kuroshio Current , flowing into the area from the south .
This image from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite from May 21 , 2009 , illustrates how the convergence of these two currents affects phytoplankton ( the microscopic plant - like creatures that form the base of the marine food web ) .
When two currents with different temperatures and densities ( cold , Arctic water is saltier and denser than subtropical waters ) collide , they create eddies .
Phytoplankton growing in the surface waters become concentrated along the boundaries of these eddies , tracing out the motions of the water .
The swirls of color visible in the waters southeast of Hokkaido ( upper left ) , show where different kinds of phytoplankton are using chlorophyll and other pigments to capture sunlight and produce food .
The bright blues just offshore of Hokkaido may be churned up sediment , rather than phytoplankton .
During the spring bloom season , nutrients are abundant in the surface waters .
( The water has been “ resting ” all winter , when light levels were too low — and storms were too frequent — to support phytoplankton growth ) .
But as the phytoplankton deplete the available nutrients , the bloom will taper off .
At this stage , the eddies in the convergence zone can give a boost of nutrients at the surface because they do n’t just circulate the surface water ; they also produce upwelling .
The upwelling can draw nutrient - rich water up from deeper in the ocean , allowing smaller blooms to occur later in the growing season .

Usually when we hear the name Hitler it conjures up images of death camps and Nazi high kick marches , but does anyone really know the true philosophy and religious / political thoughts behind the man who rallied all these people into these death marches ?
More specifically , do you know if Hitler was Left - Wing or Right - Wing ?
Well , you 're about to find out so read on !
Hitler as you know it stood for the Nazi Party ( National Socialist Party ) .
As you know it , Socialism is as we define it , a very left - wing political party .
Hitler was also very much involved and active in worker 's unions ( probably the place where he got his power ) .
What did the Nazi Party become ?
It became an organization of government control and totalitarianism .
People feared the government and Hitler and were also afraid to speak out or go against the government .
But in the beginning most people supported Hitler .
Hitler was liked by the people and seen as a saviour type figure .
He was more specifically seen as a person for the people and much of his power as stated earlier came in many of the worker 's unions he headed and ran .
Did you know that it was a crisis that gave Hitler power with his Nazi Party ?
The Burning of the Reicstag helped Hitler to make a case against the Communist party the only other opposing force at the time ( and the two battled for power .
Think of it like a Protestant versus Baptist struggle .
Two beliefs founded on the same principle but with differing views in a lot of areas ) .
After taking power in Germany Hitler later waged war against the Communism in Russia , the same concept here .
But yes , Hitler was very much Left - Wing .
He was big on Government control , mass media control , etc. and we all know what fruit came out of that and the Nazi / National Socialist Party movement .
For the people is not always for the people !
Hope you learned something here !
Note : I 'm deleting meaningless comments on this post .
It seems most people do n't understand the concept of Left - Wing / Right - Wing .
Someone even went as far as to call Facism Right - Wing !
Left means more , Right means less , it 's that simple .
Thanks .

AUCTION OF AFRICAN ART
From Gross Collection
Collecting African art can be a risky business ; fakes are everywhere .
Even Picasso was fooled .
The market has recently become so lucrative that unscrupulous craftsmen now create copies , skillfully adding signs of wear , that can deceive even the most knowledgeable buyer .
And there are no good tests to reassure collectors .
( Carbon 14 testing of wood , which has an accuracy range of plus or minus 50 years , is useless in a field in which most objects are less than 100 years old . )
One collector who seemingly beat the odds was Chaim Gross ( 1904 - 1991 ) , a Ukrainian - born New York - based sculptor .
On Saturday Sotheby ’s will put on view 80 pieces of African art from his vast collection .
They will go on sale May 15 .
Like his contemporaries Picasso , Matisse , Brancusi and Henry Moore , Gross greatly admired African art and acknowledged its influence .
From the 1920s through the ’60s he avidly acquired examples at flea markets , auctions and galleries in New York , London , Brussels and Paris , which is still the center of the African art market .
He helped found the National Museum of African Art in Washington , which in 1976 opened the traveling exhibition “ The Sculptor ’s Eye : The African Art Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Gross . ”

In the securities lending arb , stocks and bonds are lent out by custodians and investment managers .
The loan is collateralized by the borrower with cash , the lender promises the borrower a return on that cash and then invests the cash in repo and short - term debt at a spread to that promised rate of return .
The sec lending market is in the trillions .
This market is basically rolling overnight repo right now as it tries to dig itself out of the MTM / liquidity hole .
Many of the Fed / Treasury balance sheet efforts have been basically attempts to supplant securities lenders .
Sec lending funds were the biggest buyers of 1 - 3yr FRNs ( hence , TLGP ) .
Lenders were also the biggest buyers of AAA cards and autos ( read TALF 1.0 ) .
They were the second - biggest buyers of ABCP after 2 a7 funds ( ergo AMLF ) .
Indirectly they were the largest funder of LT2 bank debt ( via SIVs MTNs ) .
They 're large repo counerparties , and did everything from short - dated CDS to liquidity put options on Canadian levered super - senior CDOs .
Many stock lending funds , which have similar accrual accounting regimes to ' 40 Act money - market funds , have broken the buck but are still trading at $ 1 . for example see the section beginning " We may be exposed to customer claims " on p.11 .
What does this mean ?
Not only are certain securities lending providers opening themselves up to significant litigation risk but , importantly , clients in stocks can't reallocate to bonds ( or vice - versa ) , since the sec lending funds are n't letting them out ( except in - kind ) .
Finally , of course , as long as sec lenders remain hurt but unsupplanted , they stay short duration , which extracts hundreds of billions of $ $ in term financing capacity out of the market .
Fed wo n't act as a lender of last resort since they 're still smarting from the AIG sec lending bail - out they did n't see coming .
Zero Hedge has always been fascinated by the behemoths of securities lending ( or not so much lately ) State Street and Bank Of New York : these firms , which allegedly had just marginal toxic exposure , were in the front lines for the TARP bailout and have traditionally been handled with velvet gloves by the administration .
In fact , many would say the custodian firms are in a league of importance much higher than even Goldman or JP Morgan as with their repo activity , security lending and cash collateral reinvestment , they are the de facto center of the shadow banking system .
A Cliff notes version of the stock lenders '
Modus Operandi , sent in compliments of a reader :
It is no surprise that in order to incite a return to pre-Lehman economic levels ( the administration 's # 1 goal bar none ) , not only the stock market would have to much higher from its March lows ( a task largely accomplished through market increases on disappearing breadth , liquidity extraction by the likes of Goldman Sachs , and assorted last minute inexplicalbe ramp ups in the various futures and ETF markets ) , but also the shadow system would have to be back with a vengeance .
And while new mechanisms to achieve this such as securitization replacement alphabet soups have yet to prove their efficacy , the real heart of the shadow banking system Frankenstein is and has always been the repo market .
Which is why we were greatly troubled when we learned recently on good authority that Federal representatives may have opened multiple undisclosed - type accounts with none other than State Street Global Advisors over the past few months .
All of these accounts are allegedly handled by one single trader , who is cocooned and isolated from interaction with other partners .
Zero Hedge can , as of yet , not vouch for this being 100 % factual and is asking readers who may have additional knowledge of the situtation to please come forward and share their views ( tips@zerohedge.com ) .
If , indeed , the Federal Reserve or other derivatives of the administration , are now directly involved in trading , managing repo terms , stock lending , collateral distribution and other liquidity - crucial aspects of what was once an efficient market , then indeed this rally could be written off not merely as the biggest short covering rally of all time , but one that has been explicitly orchestrated by those who should be most impartial to an efficiently working market .
Zero Hedge is investigating .

Microsoft Corp. estimates it lost about $ 14 billion last year to software piracy -- and those may prove to be the most lucrative sales never made .
Although the world ’s largest software maker spends millions of dollars annually to combat illegal copying and distribution of its products , critics allege -- and Microsoft acknowledges -- that piracy sometimes helps the company establish itself in emerging markets and fend off threats from free open - source programs .
The gist of the beneficial piracy argument is that the retail price Microsoft charges for signature products such as Windows and Office -- as much as $ 669 , depending on the version -- can rival the average annual household income in some developing countries .
So the vast majority of those users opt for pirated versions .
The proliferation of pirated copies nevertheless establishes Microsoft products -- particularly Windows and Office -- as the software standard .
As economies mature and flourish and people and companies begin buying legitimate versions , they usually buy Microsoft because most others already use it .
It ’s called the network effect .
Advertisement
“ The first dose is free , ” said Hal Varian , a professor of information management at UC Berkeley , facetiously comparing Microsoft ’s anti-piracy policy to street - corner marketing of illicit drugs .
“ Once you start using a product , you keep using it . ”
Even as the Internet makes global piracy easier than ever , Microsoft ’s revenue and profit have risen steadily .
It earned $ 12 billion on $ 41.4 billion in revenue in calendar ’05 .
That record of success has led many experts and software companies to regard piracy as less of a problem than initially assumed or even part of a comprehensive strategy , said Eric Goldman , a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee and the former chief counsel of a Silicon Valley Internet firm .
“ Is widespread piracy simply foregone revenue , a business model by accident or a business model by design ? ” he asked .
“ Maybe all three . ”
Advertisement
Of course , Microsoft executives prefer that people buy , but theft can build market share more quickly , as company co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates acknowledged in an unguarded moment in 1998 .
“ Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China , people do n’t pay for the software .
Someday they will , though , ” Gates told an audience at the University of Washington .
“ And as long as they ’re going to steal it , we want them to steal ours .
They ’ll get sort of addicted , and then we ’ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade . ”
That ’s exactly what has happened around the globe , according to the Business Software Alliance , a Microsoft - backed anti-piracy group .
Even Vietnam , which at more than 90 % has the highest piracy rate in the world , has improved from 100 % in 1994 .
The No. 1 software firm in Vietnam : Microsoft .
Closer to the company ’s Redmond , Wash. , headquarters , the decline of piracy in the United States has tracked Microsoft ’s rise .
Stratospheric 25 years ago , the U.S. piracy rate dropped to 31 % in 1994 , then to 21 % in 2004 -- the lowest in the world .
Advertisement
Microsoft ’s public posture on piracy is one of zero tolerance .
“ We ’re all working five days a week and getting paid for three , ” said Cori Hartje , the company ’s director of license compliance .
“ We do everything we can to stop piracy . ”
The company sues online auctioneers and computer makers that supply pirated products , including Windows , the operating system for more than 90 % of the world ’s personal computers .
It cooperates with law enforcement agencies to seize pirated discs and warns users around the globe that counterfeit programs may destabilize their systems .
The effort even prompted Islamic clerics in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to declare fatwas , or religious edicts , against software piracy .
Advertisement
Microsoft , like most other software companies , has experimented with technical tricks to prevent copying , such as discs that could be used only once and hardware “ dongles ” that had to be connected to the PC before a software program could run .
Legitimate users complained bitterly .
Such methods caused software bugs and prevented customers from reinstalling programs when their computers malfunctioned , yet hackers quickly subverted each new attempt .
“ Copy protection is a balancing act because it always reduces the value of your product , ” said Bruce Schneier , chief technical officer of Counterpane Internet Security Inc .
“ State - of - the - art copy protection makes your customers hate you . ”
By 1986 , like most other software companies , Microsoft abandoned copy protection .
Advertisement
Now it attacks piracy with technical and legal carrots and sticks .
In 2004 , it launched the Windows Genuine Advantage program , which offers special features and updates for legal users .
It also requires a product activation key -- a string of letters and numbers the retail buyer of Windows or applications such as Word must enter to install the product on a computer .
Experts applauded the approach as thoughtful , given past problems with copy protection .
But it does little to deter piracy , because thousands of activation keys -- stolen or generated by software programs -- can be found easily on the Web .
Microsoft ’s legal approach differs sharply with that of the music industry , which sues as if it were in the fight of its life , said John G. Palfrey Jr. , director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School .
“ They put Napster out of business and sued Grokster to the Supreme Court , ” he said .

Like Microsoft , the music industry sees network effects from piracy .
For little - known artists who have trouble getting airtime , piracy can be crucial to create buzz .
But instead of generating revenue growth , pirated music generally replaces a CD purchase .
In most countries , music revenue is falling .
In a loudly public campaign , music publishers have pressed more than 15,000 suits against individual pirates worldwide .
Microsoft and the Business Software Alliance have rarely sued individuals , instead making claims against dozens of distributors and institutional users of illicit products .
More commonly , according to industry observers , Microsoft has cut pragmatic deals to convert institutional piracy into standard sales .
Instead of suing , it asks organizations found to use illicit copies to replace them with licensed , paid versions .
Microsoft wares become entrenched without competitive bidding , via piracy , and formal forgiveness cements the commercial relationship .
Microsoft declined to comment on how often it uses this approach .
Advertisement
Piracy also prevents free , open - source alternatives such as Linux from chipping away at Microsoft ’s monopolies , especially in developing nations .
China , for instance , promotes Red Flag Linux -- a local , open - source competitor to Windows .
As Gates concluded in 1998 , piracy may be the only way Microsoft can stay in that market , embracing the opportunity to gradually convert pirates to payers .
If Microsoft launched a draconian crackdown , UC Berkeley ’s Varian said , it would provoke the obvious reaction : “ People would just switch to open source . ”
In China , pirated versions of Windows are easy to find on the street for 5 yuan , or about 62 cents .
Why does n’t Microsoft put the thieves out of business by giving away or deeply discounting local - language versions of its products ?
The strategy would offer network benefits while providing better data on users .
Consistent global pricing reduces confusion for multinational buyers , Hartje said .
Advertisement
Experts believe high prices encourage piracy but offer the company offsetting advantages .
If Microsoft sold Windows for , say , $ 10 , it would lose money on every copy because of manufacturing , distribution and support costs .
At zero cost to Microsoft , piracy enhances network effects by getting Windows out to users who ca n’t or wo n’t pay , without undercutting normal prices .
“ Microsoft benefits from piracy , then says , ‘ If you think prices are high , blame the Chinese , because they are the thieves , ’ ” said Ariel Katz , a law professor at the University of Toronto and an expert on the economics of piracy .
“ They like us to feel guilty -- to think that piracy is wrong and immoral .
Economically , it ’s not necessarily true , but it resonates with the public . ”

The bad parents 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
It is truth often acknowledged but less often spoken that the main problem with schools today is parents .
Oh , do n't argue with me .
Yes , there 's not enough money and the infrastructure - whatever did we do before the word " infrastructure " gained wide circulation ?
- is crumbling , and kids today , whaddya gonna do ?
All these things are true , but education is a 24 - hour thing , maybe 17 if you do n't count the sleeping hours , and if the parents are n't gonna play the game , the kids are n't gonna get anywhere .
But there are all kinds of ways to not play the game .
Some of them we are familiar with , and we decry them when we are in the decrying game .
For instance : parents who do n't have enough time .
They are single parents , and / or they are working two jobs , and / or they can never get to parent - teacher conferences because they are caring for an aging relative , and all the other heartaches of these tough times .
And there are some parents who are none of those things , but they do n't care and they do n't show up .
They believe that school is a scam , or a plot , or a waste of time , or a babysitting service , or whatever .
They do n't ask their kids about it ; they do n't check homework ; they drink 10 bottles of vodka and leave some Top Ramen on the kitchen counter for dinner .
These are the bad parents .
Some of them even self - identify as bad parents and occasionally they weep - these are often the vodka parents .
We will ignore for the moment , although not in real life , truly abusive parents .
They will be tried in a separate , and more merciless , court .
Whatever kind of bad parent they are , they help set up a situation that leaves the teacher powerless .
Let us postulate that there are bad teachers , too , but let 's agree that there are more bad parents than bad teachers , because at least you have to take a test to become a teacher .
I am sympathetic to teachers , even though the work they do could hardly be described as " thankless . "
Maybe the administrators are jerks and the state Legislature is a pain and the parents are annoying and all that , but there 's always the kids , and the kids thank you even when they do n't thank you .
OTOH : long hours , low social status , frequently dreadful food .
And the occasional , unexpected heartbreak .
Teachers have thick skins , but there are some things that penetrate even the hardest of carapaces .
But what I have been hearing about lately is the exact opposite kind of bad parents , the ones who care too much , and / or the ones who think that little Timmy or Laura can do no wrong .
This bad grade must be a mistake , this report of a playground incident is clearly a misunderstanding , this note home from the teacher merely illustrates that the teacher has no understanding of the sensitivities , of the needs , of the intelligence of the beloved little one .
His / her essay was actually presaging the work of Immanuel Kant in the " Critique of Pure Reason , " since it makes no sense at all , but it makes no sense for a reason .
These are also the parents who believe that the activity known as " running around the playground " is both dangerous and nonproductive .
Jump - rope rhymes in French would be so much better .
It 's this sense of entitlement you hear about so much .
I wrote a column Thursday about the behavior of people in pharmacy lines , and I realized later that " entitlement " was the word I left out .
There 's just a belief that they are owed things , almost anything .
They deserve pride of place because they 've been watching too much Oprah or something .
They want to be their own best friends , and they do that by insisting that everything must go the way they had planned for it to go .
As the old saying goes , an expectation is just a resentment waiting to happen , and so these folks accumulate a lot of resentments .
And because they are also ( naturally and normally ) protective of their children , they get triply resentful when their child does not meet their expectations , and they decide to lash out at the teacher .
Sadly , they are also likely to lash out at the kid , blaming everyone but themselves .
I 'm not sure whether this is a modern disease , but it sure seems to have increased in my lifetime .
So my message is : Stop it !
Right now !
Let your teachers teach , and go do an extra hour of yoga .
Thank you .
Nature is gone .
It was gone before you were born , before your parents were born , before the pilgrims arrived , before the pyramids were built .
You are living on a used planet .
From the Fields is a periodic Wired Science op - ed series presenting leading scientists ' reflections on their work , society and culture .
Update : Erle Ellis has written a response to Wired Science commenters , " Save the planet ?
From who ? "
Erle Ellis studies the ecology of human - managed landscapes and their changes at local , regional and global scales at the University of Maryland - Baltimore County .
He has been investigating long - term environmental changes in rural China since 1992 and in urban and suburban Baltimore since 2000 .
His recent work characterizes global patterns of anthromes : human - altered ecosystems .
He 's the director of the Laboratory for Anthropogenic Landscape Ecology .
If this bothers you , get over it .
We now live in the Anthropocene ― a geological epoch in which Earth ’s atmosphere , lithosphere and biosphere are shaped primarily by human forces .
Yes , nature is still around ― back - seat driving , annoying us with natural disasters from time to time , and everywhere present in the background ― but definitely in no position to take the wheel .
That ’s our job now .
Do n’t blame nature for global warming , sea level rise , invasive species , mass extinctions , crop failures and poverty .
That ’s our thing .
Society needs to learn from recent scientific efforts to explain changes in greenhouse gases and the biosphere during the Anthropocene .
Three lines of evidence demonstrate that we live on a planet reshaped by humans for thousands of years .
The first evidence dates back to the beginnings of science itself , when amateur scientists stumbled across the bones of massive , long - extinct mammals like the mastodon , giant ground sloth and saber - toothed tiger .
The last glaciation can't explain their disappearance 10,000 years ago , because they survived many preceding glaciations .
Current theory holds that prehistoric hunters drove these species to extinction .
A few human - driven extinctions might seem like just a sad historical footnote , but it 's far more than that .
The species that humans eliminated were keystone species whose lifestyles , like those of elephants in Africa today , tended to profoundly shape and sustain ecosystem form and function by their feeding habits .
Nature just has n’t been the same since well - armed hunters came on the scene .
And what of the wild forests of Amazonia and North America that we think of as pristine ?
Think again .
The second line of evidence — from archaeology , paleo - ecology and even epidemiology — that humans lived all over these lands is growing .
Man burned down the forests millenniums before Columbus , first to enhance hunting for the wild species attracted to the regrowth , and later for agriculture .
While probably never cleared in their entirety , areas long believed to be the wildest places on Earth are almost certainly still recovering from human alterations that are evident from earthworks , artifacts , anthropogenic charcoal and the sediment record .
Finally , the geologic evidence .
About 7,000 years ago , levels of carbon dioxide and methane began rising .
During every previous similar interglacial period , of which there are at least seven , greenhouse - gas levels fell .
To explain this , palaeoclimatologist Bill Ruddiman formulated the " early anthropogenic hypothesis , " which holds that the source of these gases was land clearing and flooding for rice production by prehistoric farmers beginning 8,000 years ago .
While this hypothesis still ruffles the feathers of many a climatologist , there remains no better evidence explaining the Holocene greenhouse - gas anomaly .
It is even possible that global warming caused by prehistoric farmers has delayed the onset of the next ice age , which is due right about now .
So there you have it : Ours is a used planet .
Thanks to us , Earth has become warmer , less forested and less biodiverse for millenniums .
So what now ?
First of all , we ’ve got to stop trying to save the planet .
For better or for worse , nature has long been what we have made it , and what we will make it .
And it 's time for a " postnatural " environmentalism .
Postnaturalism is not about recycling your garbage , it is about making something good out of grandpa 's garbage and leaving the very best garbage for your grandchildren .
Postnaturalism means loving and embracing our human nature , the nature we have created to feed ourselves , the nature we live in .
What good is environmentalism if it makes you depressed about the future ?
This is about recognizing that our farms , and even our backyards and cities , are the most important wildlife refuges in the world and should be managed as such .
We can keep people out of places we want to think of as wild , but these places will still be changing because of global warming and the alien species we introduce without even trying .
If we want these places to look like they did before us , we will have to constantly recreate them .
It will be a huge job for us humans to keep nature " wild . "
Instead , it ’s high time we saved ourselves — and not from nature .
It ’s true that prehistory is littered with the remains of failed civilizations , but Homo sapiens is not going away .
Indeed , we humans can totally trash the planet and still survive .
We already have in many ways .
Do n’t like it ?
Stop trashing it !
Use renewable energy .
Clean it up .
Repair it .
Get to work .
There is plenty more mileage left in this spaceship Earth .
Think about that while enjoying a trip to your local zoo or arboretum — the most biodiverse places that ever existed on Earth .

PDF Most Common File Type in Targeted Attacks Posted by Patrik @ 18:40 GMT
We 've covered targeted attacks many times in the past and we 've also covered PDF and vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat / Reader being used to install malware .
So we decided to take a look at targeted attacks and see which file types were the most popular during 2008 and if that has changed at all during 2009 .
In 2008 we identified about 1968 targeted attack files .
The most popular file type was DOC , i.e. Microsoft Word representing 34.55 % .
So far in 2009 we have discovered 663 targeted attack files and the most popular file type is now PDF .
Why has it changed ?
Primarily because there has been more vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat / Reader than in the Microsoft Office applications .
Like the two vulnerabilities we mentioned a week ago .
These are scheduled to be fixed by Adobe on May 12 .
More info about targeted attacks and how they work can be found in the Lab 's YouTube video .
By George Friedman Successful revolutions have three phases .
First , a strategically located single or limited segment of society begins vocally to express resentment , asserting itself in the streets of a major city , usually the capital .
This segment is joined by other segments in the city and by segments elsewhere as the demonstration spreads to other cities and becomes more assertive , disruptive and potentially violent .
As resistance to the regime spreads , the regime deploys its military and security forces .
These forces , drawn from resisting social segments and isolated from the rest of society , turn on the regime , and stop following the regime 's orders .
This is what happened to the Shah of Iran in 1979 ; it is also what happened in Russia in 1917 or in Romania in 1989 .
Revolutions fail when no one joins the initial segment , meaning the initial demonstrators are the ones who find themselves socially isolated .
When the demonstrations do not spread to other cities , the demonstrations either peter out or the regime brings in the security and military forces — who remain loyal to the regime and frequently personally hostile to the demonstrators — and use force to suppress the rising to the extent necessary .
This is what happened in Tiananmen Square in China :
The students who rose up were not joined by others .
Military forces who were not only loyal to the regime but hostile to the students were brought in , and the students were crushed .
A Question of Support
This is also what happened in Iran this week .
The global media , obsessively focused on the initial demonstrators — who were supporters of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's opponents — failed to notice that while large , the demonstrations primarily consisted of the same type of people demonstrating .
Amid the breathless reporting on the demonstrations , reporters failed to notice that the uprising was not spreading to other classes and to other areas .
In constantly interviewing English - speaking demonstrators , they failed to note just how many of the demonstrators spoke English and had smartphones .
The media thus did not recognize these as the signs of a failing revolution .
Later , when Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke Friday and called out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , they failed to understand that the troops — definitely not drawn from what we might call the " Twittering classes , " would remain loyal to the regime for ideological and social reasons .
The troops had about as much sympathy for the demonstrators as a small - town boy from Alabama might have for a Harvard postdoc .
Failing to understand the social tensions in Iran , the reporters deluded themselves into thinking they were witnessing a general uprising .
But this was not St. Petersburg in 1917 or Bucharest in 1989 — it was Tiananmen Square .
In the global discussion last week outside Iran , there was a great deal of confusion about basic facts .
For example , it is said that the urban - rural distinction in Iran is not critical any longer because according to the United Nations , 68 percent of Iranians are urbanized .
This is an important point because it implies Iran is homogeneous and the demonstrators representative of the country .
The problem is the Iranian definition of urban — and this is quite common around the world — includes very small communities ( some with only a few thousand people ) as " urban . "
But the social difference between someone living in a town with 10,000 people and someone living in Tehran is the difference between someone living in Bastrop , Texas and someone living in New York .
We can assure you that that difference is not only vast , but that most of the good people of Bastrop and the fine people of New York would probably not see the world the same way .
The failure to understand the dramatic diversity of Iranian society led observers to assume that students at Iran 's elite university somehow spoke for the rest of the country .
Tehran proper has about 8 million inhabitants ; its suburbs bring it to about 13 million people out of Iran 's total population of 70.5 million .
Tehran accounts for about 20 percent of Iran , but as we know , the cab driver and the construction worker are not socially linked to students at elite universities .
There are six cities with populations between 1 million and 2.4 million people and 11 with populations of about 500,000 .
Including Tehran proper , 15.5 million people live in cities with more than 1 million and 19.7 million in cities greater than 500,000 .
Iran has 80 cities with more than 100,000 .
But given that Waco , Texas , has more than 100,000 people , inferences of social similarities between cities with 100,000 and 5 million are tenuous .
And with metro Oklahoma City having more than a million people , it becomes plain that urbanization has many faces .
Winning the Election With or Without Fraud
We continue to believe two things : that vote fraud occurred , and that Ahmadinejad likely would have won without it .
Very little direct evidence has emerged to establish vote fraud , but several things seem suspect .
For example , the speed of the vote count has been taken as a sign of fraud , as it should have been impossible to count votes that fast .
The polls originally were to have closed at 7 p.m. local time , but voting hours were extended until 10 p.m. because of the number of voters in line .
By 11:45 p.m. about 20 percent of the vote had been counted .
By 5:20 a.m. the next day , with almost all votes counted , the election commission declared Ahmadinejad the winner .
The vote count thus took about seven hours .
( Remember there were no senators , congressmen , city council members or school board members being counted — just the presidential race . )
Intriguingly , this is about the same time it took in 2005 , though reformists that claimed fraud back then did not stress the counting time in their allegations .
The counting mechanism is simple : Iran has 47,000 voting stations , plus 14,000 roaming stations that travel from tiny village to tiny village , staying there for a short time before moving on .
That creates 61,000 ballot boxes designed to receive roughly the same number of votes .
That would mean that each station would have been counting about 500 ballots , or about 70 votes per hour .
With counting beginning at 10 p.m. , concluding seven hours later does not necessarily indicate fraud or anything else .
The Iranian presidential election system is designed for simplicity : one race to count in one time zone , and all counting beginning at the same time in all regions , we would expect the numbers to come in a somewhat linear fashion as rural and urban voting patterns would balance each other out — explaining why voting percentages did n't change much during the night .
It has been pointed out that some of the candidates did n't even carry their own provinces or districts .
We remember that Al Gore did n't carry Tennessee in 2000 .
We also remember Ralph Nader , who also did n't carry his home precinct in part because people did n't want to spend their vote on someone unlikely to win — an effect probably felt by the two smaller candidates in the Iranian election .
That Mousavi did n't carry his own province is more interesting .
Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett writing in Politico make some interesting points on this .
As an ethnic Azeri , it was assumed that Mousavi would carry his Azeri-named and - dominated home province .
But they also point out that Ahmadinejad also speaks Azeri , and made multiple campaign appearances in the district .
They also point out that Khamenei is Azeri .
In sum , winning that district was by no means certain for Mousavi , so losing it does not automatically signal fraud .
It raised suspicions , but by no means was a smoking gun .
We do not doubt that fraud occurred during the Iranian election .
For example , 99.4 percent of potential voters voted in Mazandaran province , a mostly secular area home to the shah 's family .
Ahmadinejad carried the province by a 2.2 to 1 ratio .
That is one heck of a turnout and level of support for a province that lost everything when the mullahs took over 30 years ago .
But even if you take all of the suspect cases and added them together , it would not have changed the outcome .
The fact is that Ahmadinejad 's vote in 2009 was extremely close to his victory percentage in 2005 .
And while the Western media portrayed Ahmadinejad 's performance in the presidential debates ahead of the election as dismal , embarrassing and indicative of an imminent electoral defeat , many Iranians who viewed those debates — including some of the most hardcore Mousavi supporters — acknowledge that Ahmadinejad outperformed his opponents by a landslide .
Mousavi persuasively detailed his fraud claims Sunday , and they have yet to be rebutted .
But if his claims of the extent of fraud were true , the protests should have spread rapidly by social segment and geography to the millions of people who even the central government asserts voted for him .
Certainly , Mousavi supporters believed they would win the election based in part on highly flawed polls , and when they did n't , they assumed they were robbed and took to the streets .
But critically , the protesters were not joined by any of the millions whose votes the protesters alleged were stolen .
In a complete hijacking of the election by some 13 million votes by an extremely unpopular candidate , we would have expected to see the core of Mousavi 's supporters joined by others who had been disenfranchised .
On last Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday , when the demonstrations were at their height , the millions of Mousavi voters should have made their appearance .
They did n't .
We might assume that the security apparatus intimidated some , but surely more than just the Tehran professional and student classes possess civic courage .
While appearing large , the demonstrations actually comprised a small fraction of society .
Tensions Among the Political Elite
All of this is not to say there are not tremendous tensions within the Iranian political elite .
That no revolution broke out does not mean there is n't a crisis in the political elite , particularly among the clerics .
But that crisis does not cut the way Western common sense would have it .
Many of Iran 's religious leaders see Ahmadinejad as hostile to their interests , as threatening their financial prerogatives , and as taking international risks they do n't want to take .
Ahmadinejad 's political popularity in fact rests on his populist hostility to what he sees as the corruption of the clerics and their families and his strong stand on Iranian national security issues .
The clerics are divided among themselves , but many wanted to see Ahmadinejad lose to protect their own interests .
Khamenei , the supreme leader , faced a difficult choice last Friday .
He could demand a major recount or even new elections , or he could validate what happened .
Khamenei speaks for a sizable chunk of the ruling elite , but also has had to rule by consensus among both clerical and non-clerical forces .
Many powerful clerics like Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani wanted Khamenei to reverse the election , and we suspect Khamenei wished he could have found a way to do it .
But as the defender of the regime , he was afraid to .
Mousavi supporters ' demonstrations would have been nothing compared to the firestorm among Ahmadinejad supporters — both voters and the security forces — had their candidate been denied .
Khamenei was n't going to flirt with disaster , so he endorsed the outcome .
The Western media misunderstood this because they did n't understand that Ahmadinejad does not speak for the clerics but against them , that many of the clerics were working for his defeat , and that Ahmadinejad has enormous pull in the country 's security apparatus .
The reason Western media missed this is because they bought into the concept of the stolen election , therefore failing to see Ahmadinejad 's support and the widespread dissatisfaction with the old clerical elite .
The Western media simply did n't understand that the most traditional and pious segments of Iranian society support Ahmadinejad because he opposes the old ruling elite .
Instead , they assumed this was like Prague or Budapest in 1989 , with a broad - based uprising in favor of liberalism against an unpopular regime .
Tehran in 2009 , however , was a struggle between two main factions , both of which supported the Islamic republic as it was .
There were the clerics , who have dominated the regime since 1979 and had grown wealthy in the process .
And there was Ahmadinejad , who felt the ruling clerical elite had betrayed the revolution with their personal excesses .
And there also was the small faction the BBC and CNN kept focusing on — the demonstrators in the streets who want to dramatically liberalize the Islamic republic .
This faction never stood a chance of taking power , whether by election or revolution .
The two main factions used the third smaller faction in various ways , however .
Ahmadinejad used it to make his case that the clerics who supported them , like Rafsanjani , would risk the revolution and play into the hands of the Americans and British to protect their own wealth .
Meanwhile , Rafsanjani argued behind the scenes that the unrest was the tip of the iceberg , and that Ahmadinejad had to be replaced .
Khamenei , an astute politician , examined the data and supported Ahmadinejad .
Now , as we saw after Tiananmen Square , we will see a reshuffling among the elite .
Those who backed Mousavi will be on the defensive .
By contrast , those who supported Ahmadinejad are in a powerful position .
There is a massive crisis in the elite , but this crisis has nothing to do with liberalization :
It has to do with power and prerogatives among the elite .
Having been forced by the election and Khamenei to live with Ahmadinejad , some will make deals while some will fight — but Ahmadinejad is well - positioned to win this battle .
BONN . ( hpd ) Bundesfamilienministerium will religionskritisches Kinderbuch indizieren .
Im Oktober 2007 kam das satirische
Kinder - und Erwachsenenbuch
„ Wo bitte geht 's zu Gott ? fragte das kleine Ferkel " von Michael Schmidt - Salomon und Helge Nyncke auf den Markt und fand sehr bald eine große Fangemeinde .
Auch Pädagogen und Psychologen waren von der frechen , kleinen Geschichte ( „ Dawkins for Kids " ) angetan .
So urteilte der renommierte Kinder - und Jugendpsychiater Prof. Dr. Peter Riedesser , Direktor der Universitätsklinik für Kinder - und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie am Universitätsklinikum Hamburg - Eppendorf , das Buch sei „ als Gegengift zu religiöser Indoktrination von Kindern pädagogisch besonders wertvoll " .
Ursula von der Leyens Bundesministerium für Familie , Senioren , Frauen und Jugend sieht die Sache jedoch völlig anders : Das Ministerium beantragte die Indizierung des Kinderbuchs als jugendgefährdende Schrift .
Nach Angaben der Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien wird die mündliche Verhandlung Anfang März stattfinden .
Der Verlag und die Autoren wehren sich entschieden gegen die Vorwürfe des Ministeriums und sprechen von politischer Zensur : Der Indizierungsantrag sei ein durchsichtiger Versuch , Religionskritik aus den Kinderstuben zu verbannen .
Man werde diesen „ Anschlag auf die Meinungsfreiheit " nicht hinnehmen , heißt es .
Folgt auf den Karikaturenstreit nun ein Kinderbuchstreit ?
Die Argumentation des Ministeriums
Im ministerialen Indizierungsantrag wird behauptet , das Buch sei „ geeignet , die Entwicklung von Kindern und Jugendlichen oder ihre Erziehung zu einer ( sic ! ) eigenverantwortlichen und gemeinschaftsfähigen Persönlichkeit zu gefährden " .
Jugendgefährdend seien Medien , „ wenn sie unsittlich sind , verrohend wirken , zu Gewalttätigkeit , Verbrechen oder Rassenhass anreizen " .
Dass ausgerechnet die niedlich illustrierte Geschichte vom kleinen Ferkel zu solcher „ Verrohung " beitragen könne , wird damit begründet , dass in dem Buch „ die drei großen Weltreligionen Christentum , Islam und das Judentum verächtlich gemacht " und „ die Besonderheiten jeder Religion (...) der Lächerlichkeit preisgegeben " würden .
Nach Ansicht des Ministeriums werde dabei insbesondere das Judentum auf diffamierende Weise angegriffen , so dass „ Text und Abbildung mithin antisemitische Tendenzen " aufweise .
„ Mit dem Antisemitismusvorwurf an der falschen Adresse ! "
Autor Schmidt - Salomon , der aufgrund seines jüdisch klingenden Namens selbst seit Jahren Zielscheibe antisemitischer Propaganda ist , findet diese Behauptung „ ungeheuerlich " : „ Dieser Antisemitismusvorwurf ist nichts weiter als ein fadenscheiniger Vorwand , um Religionskritik aus den Kinderstuben zu verbannen !
Offensichtlich hat es einige Leute irritiert , dass sich das Ferkelbuch in der Weihnachtszeit besser verkaufte als die traditionelle , apologetisch - religiöse Kinderliteratur .
Also hat man nach einer Möglichkeit gesucht , um dem einen Riegel vorzuschieben .
Doch mit dem Antisemitismusvorwurf spaßt man nicht !
Und bei mir , der ich als humanistischer Philosoph ganz wesentlich durch säkulare Juden wie Freud , Einstein , Marx oder Erich Fromm geprägt bin , sind die Damen und Herren des Ministeriums nun wirklich an der falschen Adresse gelandet ! "
Schmidt - Salomon , dessen „ Manifest des evolutionären Humanismus " zu den meistverkauften dezidiert humanistischen Büchern der letzten Jahre zählt , war noch vor wenigen Monaten in iranischen Medien als „ zionistischer Agent Israels " bezeichnet worden , da er als Vorstandssprecher der Giordano Bruno Stiftung die PR - Kampagne „ Wir haben abgeschworen ! " des „ Zentralrats der Ex- Muslime " geleitet hatte .
„ Insofern bedeutet der Antisemitismusvorwurf eine interessante Erweiterung meines Portfolios ! " , scherzt der Philosoph bitter .
„ So viele antisemitische jüdische Agenten dürfte es ja nicht geben ... "
Was ihn am Indizierungsantrag des Familienministeriums besonders stört , ist „ das darin zum Ausdruck kommende , undifferenzierte Bild des Judentums " .
Offenbar wisse man im Ministerium nicht , „ dass die allermeisten Juden progressiv , wenn nicht gar säkular , denken und sich in einer Schärfe , die das Familienministerium arg erschrecken würde , von jenen ultraorthodoxen Wirrköpfen distanzieren , die meinen , das Alte Testament bzw . die Thora wörtlich nehmen zu müssen " .
Nur dieses orthodox - religiöse Judentum werde „ mit guten Gründen " in dem Buch kritisiert , nicht „ die " Juden schlechthin .
Auch greife das Buch nicht „ die " Religionen an , sondern nur jene Formen , die nicht durch die Schule der Aufklärung gegangen seien .
„ Schwere Wahrnehmungsstörungen "
Die Argumentation des Ministeriums sei über weite Strecken derart grotesk , dass er am Anfang gedacht habe , es handle sich um einen „ dummen Scherz " , erklärt Schmidt - Salomon : „ So wird uns vom Ministerium doch allen Ernstes vorgeworfen , dass während der Sintflut Omas , Babys und Meerschweinchen ertrinken !
Ja , um alles in der Welt , haben diese Leute denn noch nie die Bibel gelesen ?!
Wenn dies ein Grund sein sollte , um ein Buch zu verbieten , so müsste man doch zuerst einmal die Bibel auf den Index der jugendgefährdenden Schriften stellen !
Unser Buch hebt diese biblischen Ungeheuerlichkeiten doch auf humorvolle Weise auf !
Es sagt den Kindern augenzwinkernd : Nur keine Sorge , ihr braucht wirklich keine Angst zu haben !
Diese Geschichte vom biblischen Rachegott , der Omas , Babys und kleine Meerschweinchen ertränkt , ist frei erfunden ! "
Auch Helge Nyncke , der das „ kleine Ferkel " illustriert hat , ist über den Indizierungsantrag empört .
Dass „ ausschließlich der Rabbi " als unsympathisch und gewalttätig dargestellt werde , wie es im Schreiben des Ministeriums heißt , könne nur behaupten , wer unter „ schweren Wahrnehmungsstörungen " leide oder gar „ bewusst einseitig und tendenziös sichtbare Tatsachen " ignoriere oder verfälsche .
„ Ich empfinde das als eine äußerst bedenkliche Wirklichkeitsverzerrung " , sagt Nyncke .
Ganz offensichtlich werde in dem Antrag „ ein Feindbild aufgebaut , das in dem Buch überhaupt keine Entsprechung findet " .
Im Gegenteil , die „ ganz bewusste gestalterische Gleichbehandlung aller drei Religionsvertreter werde absichtlich unterschlagen und in antijüdische Propaganda umgemünzt " .
„ Eine Unverschämtheit " , so der Zeichner .
Fassungslos habe er zur Kenntnis genommen , sagt Nyncke , dass die Antragsteller in dem Handgemenge zwischen den streitenden Gottesdienern ausgerechnet dem Rabbi Mordabsichten unterstellten , diese aber weder beim Bischof noch beim Mufti zu entdecken glaubten .
Eine so offensichtliche Projektion der eigenen vorurteilsgeprägten Sichtweise auf eine ganz anders gemeinte bildliche Darstellung sei „ an Peinlichkeit kaum noch zu überbieten " .
Zu viele Gewaltvideos angeschaut ?
Möglicherweise habe „ die verantwortliche Referentin des Familienministeriums in Ausübung ihrer beruflichen Pflichten zu viele Gewaltvideos angeschaut " , meint Schmidt - Salomon .
Andernfalls könne er sich kaum erklären , warum die Jugendschutzreferentin fantasiere , dass der Rabbi „ einem Vertreter des christlichen Glaubens eine Schriftrolle auf den Mund drückt und ihn zu ersticken droht " , wie es in dem ministerialen Schreiben heißt : „ Also ehrlich : Den Unterschied zwischen einer harmlosen Rauferei und einem Mordversuch sollte man doch schon erkennen können !
Nebenbei : Haben
Sie schon einmal versucht , einen Menschen mit einer dünnen Papierrolle zu ersticken ?
Wenn Ihnen das gelingen sollte , melden Sie sich doch bitte bei Uri Geller ! "
„ Anschlag auf die Meinungsfreiheit "
Gunnar Schedel , der Leiter des Alibri Verlags , in dem das Kinderbuch erschienen ist , spricht von einem „ Anschlag auf die Meinungsfreiheit " .
Den Indizierungsantrag aus dem Haus von der Leyen sieht er im Zusammenhang mit dem Bestreben konservativer Politiker , der Religion bei der Kindererziehung wieder mehr Gewicht zu verleihen : „ Offenbar stört unser ‘ Ferkelbuch ' die Pläne des Familienministeriums zur christlichen Werteerziehung " , meint der Verleger .
Mit ihren Bemühungen , Kinder gegenüber nicht - religiösen Sichtweisen abzuschotten , stehe Ministerin von der Leyen freilich nicht alleine .
„ Ich erinnere nur an den Aufruf Edmund Stoibers , die Kinderbücher des ‘ falschen Propheten ' Janosch aus deutschen Kinderzimmern zu verbannen " , sagt Schedel .
Für den Fall einer Indizierung kündigt der Verleger den Gang durch die juristischen Instanzen an : „ Wir werden diesen durchsichtigen Zensurversuch sicherlich nicht hinnehmen . "
Schedel ist davon überzeugt , dass eine solche Klage die Unterstützung zahlreicher nationaler wie internationaler säkularer Verbände finden würde , „ schließlich geht es hier nicht nur um ein Kinderbuch , sondern um eine Verteidigung von Grundrechten ! "
Auch die beiden Autoren wollen eine mögliche Indizierung ihres Buchs keineswegs akzeptieren .
„ Auch Kinder haben ein Recht auf Aufklärung " , meint Michael Schmidt - Salomon .
„ Schauen Sie sich doch einmal in der Welt um !
Nie zuvor war Religionskritik so wichtig wie heute !
Man kann gar nicht früh genug damit beginnen , den Menschen die Angst vor archaischen Glaubenssätzen zu nehmen .
Diese Glaubenssätze führen , wie wir tagtäglich in den Medien erfahren müssen , zu jener Verrohung , die man nun ausgerechnet dem Ferkelbuch unterschieben möchte .
Wer die Geschichte vom kleinen Ferkel gelesen hat , der weiß , dass sie ganz sicher nicht zu Hass aufstachelt , sondern zu Heiterkeit .
Das kleine Ferkel führt uns auf humorvolle Weise jene menschlich - allzumenschlichen Unzulänglichkeiten vor , die sich auch , aber nicht nur , im religiösen Glauben widerspiegeln .
Es mag ja Menschen geben , die eine solch humorvolle Sichtweise der menschlichen Existenz nicht ertragen können und deshalb beleidigt nach Zensur schreien .
Derartige Leute sollten in Ministerien aber wirklich nicht das Sagen haben ! "
„ Man muss auf alles gefasst sein ... "
Glaubt der Autor , dass es am 6 .
März , dem Tag der mündlichen Verhandlung , tatsächlich zu einer Indizierung seines Kinderbuchs , also zu einem weitreichenden Verkaufsverbot , kommt ?
„ Wenn vernünftige Argumente bei dieser Verhandlung auch nur einen Pfifferling wert sind , kann ich mir das beim besten Willen nicht vorstellen ! " , sagt Schmidt - Salomon .
„ Ich gehe fest davon aus , dass die Verantwortlichen der Bundesprüfstelle diesen verrückten Indizierungsantrag abschmettern werden und somit das Buch auch weiterhin frei über den Buchhandel erhältlich sein wird !
Allerdings sollte man nicht übersehen , dass auf der Gegenseite mächtige Interessensgruppen mit im Spiel sind .
Man muss also auf alles gefasst sein ... "

The US military has been embarrassed by footage broadcast on al - Jazeera television which shows soldiers and a chaplain discussing how to convert Afghans to Christianity .
This brought a predictable reaction in Afghanistan , where former prime minister Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai told Reuters news agency : " We consider this act as a direct attack on our religion that will arouse Afghans ' emotions to take actions against them . "
The US miltary claims the footage was shown out of context and al - Jazeera insists it was not .
The troops in the video seem aware that Centcom 's General Order Number 1 forbids them from proselytising while on active duty but one says there are ways around this – for example , by presenting people with Bibles as " gifts " .
It is not the first time the US military has got into hot water over religion .
Lt Gen William Boykin , an evangelical Christian and warrior against Satan , caused a stir by recalling how a Muslim fighter in Somalia had claimed to have the protection of Allah against US forces .
" Well you know what I knew , that my God was bigger than his , " Boykin said .
" I knew that my God was a real God , and his was an idol . "
The military orders are there for a reason : bringing Jesus into the Afghan conflict is politically stupid and it reinforces the claims of bin Laden and others that western forces are engaged in a " crusade " .
Equally , I can't imagine the US military would be very pleased if Afghans started turning up at their bases with copies of the Qur'an and wanting to discuss its contents .
That said , though , al - Jazeera seems to have missed a more important point about free speech .
It is a crime in Afghanistan to try to convert people away from Islam - and it should n't be .
Freedom of speech requires that everyone should be allowed to express their views , and this includes trying to persuade others to agree with them .
Setting aside the miliary aspects of this , if a private citizen of any nationality wishes to go to Afghanistan and talk about Christianity , why should they be prevented from doing so ?
It may be a foolhardy thing to do , but who has the right to stop them ?
Earlier , we knew that scientist designed Adam robot that could be controlled by human thought alone .
Now news comes of a bot that does n’t need to bother with any human thought at all .
Researchers believe that it is to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings .
Adam appears to be doing impressively well for a young scientist , performing scientific research automatically , without the need for further human intervention .
Earlier it is reported that Adam autonomously supposed that certain genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae code for enzymes that catalyze some of the microorganism ’s biochemical reactions .
The yeast is notable , as scientists apply it to model more complex life systems .
The researchers applied their own separate experiments to confirm that Adam ’s hypotheses were both novel and correct–all the while probably wondering how soon they ’d become obsolete .
Adam is a still a prototype , but Ross King , a professor of computer science ’s team , – says they believe their next robot , Eve ( do n’t leave those two in the lab alone together ) holds promise for scientists searching for new drugs to combat diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis , an infection caused by a type of parasitic worm in the tropics .
“ We hope to have teams of human and robot scientists working together in laboratories ” , finally , Ross King said .
Apparently , the ‘ close doors ’ button on most lifts does not actually work .
It is there mostly to give passengers the illusion of control .
We press it but the lift control mechanisms decide when the doors should actually shut according to their pre-programmed cycles .
Human brains are finely tuned belief engines .
Millions of years of evolution have honed our grey stuff to spot causation in the world and form beliefs about what causes what .
It helps us survive when we notice that certain events always follow other events .
Such knowledge helps us reliably find food , mates and shelter .
But our brains are taking efficient shortcuts .
We filter out and ignore failures and remember and reinforce successes .
And most of the time this works .
But beliefs formed in this way can lead to mistakes .
My pressing the lift button may well be a false conclusion drawn from my experience because I have failed to spot hidden causes and alternatives to the obvious .
Maybe it really is just the lift closing the door without my intervention .
This all is related to the illusion of control psychological effect studied by Ellen Langer and others , where people are shown to believe they have some control over things they clearly do n’t : in most cases , a button does afford us control , and we would rationally expect it to , and if we ’re used to it not doing anything , we either no longer bother pressing it , or we still press it every time “ on the off - chance that one of these days it ’ll work ” .
By now you should be wondering why the hell lift makers should install the close door button in their lifts if it does n’t work appropriately .
There are a few options :
The button really does work , it ’s just set on time delay .
Suppose the elevator is set so that the doors close automatically after five seconds .
The close - door button can be set to close the doors after two or three seconds .
The button may be operating properly when you push it , but because there ’s still a delay , you do n’t realize it .
Suppose the elevator is set so that the doors close automatically after five seconds .
The close - door button can be set to close the doors after two or three seconds .
The button may be operating properly when you push it , but because there ’s still a delay , you do n’t realize it .
The button is broken .
Since a broken close - door button will not render the elevator inoperable and thus does not necessitate an emergency service call , it may remain unrepaired for weeks .
The button has been disconnected , usually because the building owner received too many complaints from passengers who had somebody slam the doors on them .
The button was never wired up in the first place .
But thinking about this more generally : how often are deceptive buttons / controls / options – deliberate false affordances – used strategically in interaction design ?
Are there any examples of products ( other than , say , children ’s toys ) deliberately designed with fake controls to make the user feel in charge even though he / she is n’t ?
Statement by the Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste ( NPA , New Anti-Capitalist Party of France ) , translated by Carmel McGlinchey , Luke Weyland and Annolies Truman for Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal
Since June 13 , the day after the rigged presidential election , millions of Iranians have gone into the streets with cries of " Down with the dictatorship ! " .
The ferocious repression has already caused tens if not hundreds of deaths .
Young people , women and the residents of the poorer areas who comprise the majority of the demonstrators have now been joined by the trade union movement .
The union of bus workers declared its solidarity , in asserting : " As long as the principle of free organisation and elections is not applied , all talk of social liberation and the rights of the workers is only a joke " .
The workers of Iran Khodro , the first car manufacturer in the country ( with 60,000 employees ) , engaged in a strike while adding their demands for salary increases and the right to strike to the demands raised in the streets .
For democratic freedoms and the demands of the workplace
The aspirations of Iranian society to lift the stifling weight of the Mullahs and to end the daily oppression of youth and women who are fighting for their rights , increasingly combines with the demands of the workers who , in Iran also , refuse to pay for the economic crisis .
As the idea of a general strike spreads , the possessing classes and the profiteers begin to dread the spectre of a new revolution .
The criminal demagoguery of Ahmadinejad and of his guardian , the " supreme guide " Khamenei , who claim to represent the " disinherited " in opposing the imperialism of the western powers , must not fool people .
But Moussavi , the " reformer " is not any more reputable .
He was the prime minister of the Islamic Republic between 1981 and 1989 , at a time where tens of thousands of opponents , in particular militant workers , left activists and campaigners for the rights of women and national minorities , were slaughtered in the regime 's prisons .
Faced with growing economical difficulties , corruption and nepotism have become increasingly untenable , which has exacerbated the competition between rival clans of the regime , to the point of creating a crisis at the highest echalons of the state .
The workers and the people have surged into the breach .
And thus even a non-democratic election has escaped all control .
Their fight is ours !
All our support goes to the women , the workers , the youth and all the demonstrators who are defying repression at the risk of their lives .
On June 26 , international day of solidarity with the workers of Iran , the [ French ] trade union organisations ( CGT , CFDT , FO , CFTC , UNSA , Solidaires ) will participate in a protest in front of the Iranian embassy in Paris ( 12 h 30 ) , in particular to demand the release of the workers imprisoned for demonstrating on May 1 in Tehran .
The New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) , which naturally supports this protest , calls for the development of solidarity initiatives with the struggle of the Iranian people , in workplaces , the city and communities for the overthrow of the dictatorship , freedom and workers ’ rights .
Depuis le 13 juin , au lendemain de l’élection présidentielle truquée , des millions d’Iraniens descendent dans la rue aux cris de « A bas la dictature ».
La répression féroce a déjà fait des dizaines si ce n’est des centaines de morts .
Les jeunes , les femmes , les habitants des quartiers populaires qui forment le gros des manifestants sont maintenant rejoints par le mouvement syndical .
L’Union des travailleurs des autobus a déclaré sa solidarité , en affirmant : « tant que le principe de la liberté d’organisation et d’élection ne sera pas appliqué , tout discours sur la libération sociale et les droits des travailleurs ne sera qu’une farce ».
Les ouvriers d’Iran Khodro , premier constructeur automobile du pays ( 60.000 salariés ) , ont engagé un mouvement de grève en ajoutant aux revendications de la rue l’augmentation des salaires et le droit de grève .
Pour les libertés démocratiques et les revendications du monde du travail
L’aspiration de la société à lever la chape de plomb étouffante du régime des mollahs et à en finir avec la répression quotidienne contre la jeunesse et les femmes qui luttent pour leurs droits , se mêle de plus en plus aux revendications propres des travailleurs qui , en Iran aussi , refusent de faire les frais de la crise .
L’idée de la grève générale se répand , les possédants et les profiteurs commencent à redouter le spectre d’une nouvelle révolution .
La démagogie criminelle d’Ahmadinejad et de son tuteur , le « guide suprême » Khamenei , qui prétendent représenter les « déshérités » en s’opposant à l’impérialisme des puissances occidentales , ne doit pas faire illusion .
Mais Moussavi , le « réformateur » , n’est pas beaucoup plus fréquentable .
Il avait été le premier ministre de la République islamique entre 1981 et 1989 , à l’époque où des dizaines de milliers d’opposants , en particulier militants ouvriers et de gauche , des droits des femmes et des minorités nationales , avaient été massacrés dans les geôles du régime .
Face aux difficultés économiques croissantes , la corruption et le népotisme sont devenus de plus en plus insupportables , ce qui a exacerbé la concurrence entre les clans rivaux du régime , jusqu’à ouvrir une crise au sommet de l’Etat .
Les travailleurs et le peuple se sont engouffrés dans la brèche .
Et même une élection non démocratique a alors échappé à tout contrôle .
Leur lutte est la nôtre !
C’est aux femmes , aux travailleurs et à la jeunesse , à tous les manifestants qui défient la répression en n’hésitant pas à risquer leurs vies , que va tout notre soutien .
Le 26 juin , dans le cadre de la journée internationale de solidarité avec les ouvriers d’Iran , les organisations syndicales ( CGT , CFDT , FO , CFTC , UNSA , Solidaires ) participeront à un rassemblement devant l’ambassade iranienne à Paris ( 12 h 30 ) , pour exiger notamment la libération des travailleurs emprisonnés pour avoir manifesté le Premier Mai à Téhéran .
Le NPA , qui soutient naturellement ce rassemblement , appelle à développer dans les entreprises , ville et quartiers le maximum d’initiatives en solidarité avec la lutte du peuple iranien , pour le renversement de la dictature , pour la liberté et les droits des travailleurs .

Excuse me , but is Scott Roeder , the man charged with killing Dr. George Tiller outside his church last Sunday , in jail , or on vacation at a Wichita hotel ?
In a call to the Associated Press over the weekend , the murder suspect complained about his living conditions and then warned of more violence against abortion providers .
“ I know there are many other similar events planned around the country as long as abortion remains legal , ” Roeder said .
When asked by the AP what he meant and if he was referring to another shooting , he refused to elaborate further .
In an understatement , Nancy Keenan president of NARAL - Pro-Choice America , said Roeder ’s comments “ continue to escalate that kind of activity , that kind of violence . ”
The Justice Department said it was investigating and has ordered increased protection for “ appropriate people and facilities last week . ”
But as yet — and despite Roeder ’s threats — the crime is apparently being treated as an isolated incident of violence , rather than part of a deadly crusade with political aims — which in this day and age is what usually gets called terrorism .
The Wichita Eagle today reported today that the suspect would likely be charged with Tiller ’s murder , as well as with aggravated assault ( for threatening two churchgoers who tried to apprehend him ) .
According to the paper , “ Wichita police said it appeared that the suspect had acted alone but that they are investigating whether he had any connection to anti-abortion groups . ”
Whether he had any connections ?
Within hours of Roeder ’s arrest , it was clear that he was up to his neck in the radical wing of the anti-abortion movement , as well as involved with the far - right anti-government group the Freemen .
On the night of the shooting the Kansas City Star ’s Judy Thomas was already reporting that the suspect was labeled a “ fanatic ” even by some other right - to - lifers , and supported the idea of “ justifiable homicide ” to prevent abortions .
He had made prison visits to the woman who shot and wounded Tiller in 1993 , and wrote a Web post declaring , “ Tiller is the concentration camp ‘ Mengele ’ of our day and needs to be stopped before he and those who protect him bring judgment upon our nation . ”
He was also arrested in 1996 with weapons and bomb - making materials in his car ( for which he received two years ’ probation ) .
Perhaps it should n’t be surprising that Roeder would have an easy time of things in Wichita , which has long been a ground zero for anti-choice activists .
In fact , the local law enforcement and justice systems seem to have made more effort to prosecute Tiller on trumped up charges than they did to protect him .
As the Wichita Eagle reports :
Tiller and his clinic have faced continuous threats and legal action .
A Wichita jury ruled in March that he was not guilty of illegal abortion on 19 criminal charges he faced for allegedly violating a state law requiring an independent second physician ’s concurring opinion before performing late - term abortions .
Immediately following the ruling in the criminal case , the Kansas Board of Healing Arts made public a similar complaint against Tiller that was originally filed in December 2008 .
Protesters blockaded Tiller ’s clinic during Operation Rescue ’s “ Summer of Mercy ” protests during the summer of 1991 , and Tiller was shot by Rachelle Shannon at his clinic in 1993 .
Tiller was wounded in both arms .
Shannon remains in prison .
The clinic was bombed in June 1986 and was severely vandalized last month .
His lawyer said wires to security cameras and outdoor lights were cut and that the vandals also cut through the roof and plugged the buildings ’ downspouts .
Rain poured through the roof and caused thousands of dollars of damage in the clinic .
Tiller reportedly asked the FBI to investigate the incident .
It ’s not clear whether the FBI took any action–but as yet , the Justice Department , too , has not dealt with Tiller ’s murder as anything but a lone incident .
On the day of the shooting , Attorney General Eric Holder called the murder “ an abhorrent act of violence , ” and said he was sending U.S. Marshals to protect other abortion providers as a “ precautionary measure . ”
The very need to take such a measure would , again , suggest an organized , violent movement–but Holder has never used anything close to the T word , either .
I ’ve often written before that both federal and state law enforcement tend to be circumspect when it comes to pursuing organized domestic far - right activity .
Can you imagine what would happen if an Arab American had shot someone , after posting screeds on an Islamic extremist web site ?
The anti-abortion movement also gets a free pass compared with environmental or animal rights activists ( or even Republican Convention protestors ) , as Will Potter notes on his excellent web site Green Is the New Red :
The FBI labels the animal rights and environmental movements as the “ number one domestic terrorism threat ” even though those activists have never harmed a human being .
At the very worst , underground groups like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front have released animals from fur farms , destroyed SUVs and set fire to empty buildings .
When animal rights activists or environmental activists are arrested , though , the government immediately sends out press releases and holds press conferences trumpeting the arrest of “ eco-terrorists ” and “ domestic terrorists . ”
In contrast , Roeder is being held in a local county jail , while the Army of God celebrates him as a hero , Operation Rescue once again scambles to distance itself from an act they helped inspire , and anti-choice Christian commentators piously decry the wicked deed in Wichita , but ca n’t pass up an opportunity to remind us that “ abortion is murder ” and “ what goes on in those clinics is institutionalized homicide . ”
And while suspected Muslim terrorists are held in total isolation for years , without access to lawyers much less the press , Scott Roeder is taking advantage of his bully pulpit to promote his cause–and complain about the discomfort of his jail cell :
In two separate calls to AP on Sunday morning , Roeder was far more talkative about his treatment at the Sedgwick County jail , complaining about “ deplorable conditions in solitary ” where he was kept during his first three days there .
Sedgwick County Sheriff Robert Hinshaw said that Roeder is receiving appropriate medical treatment .
“ It is after all a jail , but a modern state - of - the - art facility with professional staff , ” Hinshaw said .
“ While Mr. Roeder may not care for being in the Sedgwick County jail , all of our conditions and policies are designed to provide safety and security for all inmates , staff and public at large . ”
Roeder said it was freezing in his cell .
“ I started having a bad cough .
I thought I was going to have pneumonia , ” he said .
He said he called AP because he wanted to emphasize the conditions in the jail so that in the future suspects would not have to endure the same conditions .
Roeder also said he wanted the public to know he has been denied phone privileges for the past two days , and needed his sleep apnea machine .
Now , contrast this treatment with that afforded Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox , whom I ’ve written about before .
These two men have been held in solitary confinement in 6×9 cells for 37 years at Louisiana ’s Angola state prison , and denied access to the press .
There is evidence that they have been singled out for this treatment because nearly four decades ago they were active with the Black Panther Party .
But a man accused of first degree murder for killing a doctor in service of a political cause — something which has , of course , happened before — gets to use the phone ( twice ) to call the AP , complain that he ’s cold and ca n’t sleep , and while he ’s add it , warn of more murders ?
And the county sheriff ’s response is to get defensive and say that their jail is really quite nice ?
What is the matter with Kansas ?
And while we ’re at it , what ’s the matter with the Feds ?
Postscript : Someone just put me on to a post by Jennifer Pozner on the Women in Media and News blog , that points out how complicit the media is in this double standard , writing about Tiller ’s murder “ as if it were a completely unpredictable aberration , ” and asking why “ the media have not called this terrorism–even after three decades of extreme violence by anti-abortion fanatics , ” which includes “ seven murders , 17 attempted murders , three kidnappings , 152 assaults , 305 completed or attempted bombings and arsons ” … and the list goes on .

We Braved Times Square to Go to the New Flagship Krispy Kreme
And we were n’t the only ones .
Filmmaker Robert Greenwald 's documentary about sleazy unionbusting at Starbucks debuted the same day as Starbucks new Twitter campaign , so he hijacked the campaign to spread information about Starbucks ' bad labor practices .
On a blog post published at the anti-Starbucks website Brave New Films created , people were encouraged to take pictures of themselves in front of Starbucks stores holding signs targeted at the company 's " anti-labor practices . "
These users are then told to upload these photos onto Twitpic and tweet them out to their followers using the hashtags # top3 percent and #starbucks .
According to the post , these are the official hashtags that were designated by Starbucks itself for those who wanted to enter its contest .
Within hours , several people had followed these guidelines and there were dozens of Twitpics in front of stores across the country .
As of this writing , the anti-Starbucks YouTube video has amassed over 30,000 views and was featured on the front page of social news site Digg .
Greenwald said that Brave New Films is not done with its offensive against the coffee company , but he was hesitant to reveal his next steps .
In a blog posting August 26 , Microsoft announced that it is revising the licensing terms of its Security Development Lifecycle , moving parts of it to a Creative Commons license .
Security Development Lifecycle is a methodology that Microsoft developed that incorporates best security practices at every level of the development lifecycle when security is important -- such as in secure business environments or where personally identifiable information is vital .
The methodology includes a set of documentation explaining the process and how to follow it , as well as a set of software tools to help in the software development .
But there 's always been a catch : While Microsoft certainly wanted organizations to use this methodology , companies were n't allowed to create their own internal documentationbased on the methodology 's documentation without express written consent from Microsoft ( even if the documentation would be internal to the company ) .
That certainly seems a little silly ; every large company creating software creates its own internal documentation , and such documentation often includes their own adaptation of a particular software development methodology .
So if a company uses the Microsoft SDL , most likely they would produce their own documentation based on the existing SDL documentation .
But up until now that was technically illegal .
Fortunately , Microsoft realized how absurd that was , and today announced that they have modified the license .
While the tools are still proprietary , the documentation itself now has a Creative Commons license .
The short story is now that companies that based their own internal processes on this existing documentation are no longer breaking the law .
And other companies -- the ones that might have shied away from adopting the methodology because they could n't really do much with it besides read the documentation -- can now implement it into their own documentation and actually use it .
Here 's the exact text from the blog posting :
[ INDENT ]
By changing the license terms , we are now allowing people and organizations to copy , distribute and transmit the documentation to others ; this means that you can now incorporate content from the SDL documents we release under Creative Commons into your internal process documentation – subject to the terms specified by the Creative Commons license mentioned above .

For eight years , Jessica
Terry suffered from stomach pain so horrible , it brought her to her knees .
The pain , along with diarrhea , vomiting and fever , made her so sick , she lost weight and often had to miss school .
During a science class , Jessica Terry , 18 , discovered a tell - tale granuloma in her own pathology slide .
Her doctors , no matter how hard they tried , could n't figure out the cause of Jessica 's abdominal distress .
Then one day in January , Terry , 18 , figured it out on her own .
In her Advanced Placement high school science class , she was looking under the microscope at slides of her own intestinal tissue -- slides her pathologist had said were completely normal -- and spotted an area of inflamed tissue called a granuloma , a clear indication that she had Crohn 's disease .
" It 's weird I had to solve my own medical problem , " Terry told CNN affiliate KOMO in Seattle , Washington .
" There were just no answers anywhere .
... I was always sick . "
Terry , who graduated from Eastside Catholic School in Sammamish , Washington , this month , is now being treated for Crohn 's , says her science teacher , MaryMargaret Welch .
" She was pretty excited about finding the granuloma , " Welch said .
" She said , ' Ms. Welch !
Ms. Welch !
Come over here .
I think I 've got something ! ' "
Welch , who has taught the Biomedical Problems class at Eastside for 17 years , immediately went on the Internet to see whether Terry had indeed spotted a granuloma .
" I said , ' Jeez , it certainly looks like one to me , ' " Welch remembered .
" I snapped a picture of it on the microscope and e-mailed it to the pathologist .
Within 24 hours , he sent back an e-mail saying yes , this is a granuloma . "
Watch Terry describe her experience »
Although Terry was relieved to finally get a diagnosis , it was also tough for her to hear that she has such a serious disease .
There are treatments , but there is no cure for Crohn 's , a condition in which the digestive tract becomes inflamed .
It can lead to ulcers , malnutrition and other health problems .
" As I get older , the disease can get worse , " Terry told KOMO .
Crohn 's disease is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed very late , says Dr. Corey Siegel , director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Dartmouth - Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon , New Hampshire .
" Granulomas are oftentimes very hard to find and not always even present at all , " Siegel said .
" I commend Jessica for her meticulous work . "
Pathologists also sometimes miss important findings for other diseases , says Dr. Mark Graber , chief of the medical service at the Northport VA Medical Center in New York .
" This story carries a valuable lesson about how errors are found .
It 's very often by ' fresh eyes , ' just like in Jessica 's case , " he said .
" Some specialty centers , recognizing the reality of perceptual error and the power of a second independent reading , are now requiring second reviews on certain types of smears and pathology specimens . "
Welch credits Terry 's " fresh eyes " but also local pathologists who volunteered to train her and her classmates on how to view specimens under the microscope .
" We 've been lucky to have that partnership .
It allowed Jessica to think of herself as a scientist , " she said .
" The class empowered Jessica to think of herself as being a partner in her own health care . "
As for Terry 's future , she 'll start nursing school in the fall .
She 's written a book for children about Crohn 's disease , which she hopes to have published .
In the meantime , she 's grateful for her science class and for the pathologist for giving her her slides .
" This has been the highlight of my high school career , for sure , " Terry told the Sammamish Reporter newspaper .
" It 's been amazing . "
CNN 's Jennifer Pifer Bixler and Sabriya Rice contributed to this report .

A motion to dissolve Parliament and pave the way for an immediate general election has been rejected by MPs .
Plaid Cymru and the SNP tabled the motion - backed by the Conservatives and Lib Dems - saying that the government had lost authority .
SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson called for an " historic , reforming election " to rebuild trust in politics in the wake of the expenses scandals .
But Welsh Secretary Peter Hain said an early poll would " trigger instability " .
The motion was rejected by 340 votes to 268 .
' Political crisis '
The debate was scheduled before last week 's conflict within Labour over Gordon Brown 's leadership .
But the SNP said the events of recent days showed Mr Brown had " lost his grip " and reinforced the need for a general election straight away .
Mr Robertson told the Commons that arguments against dissolution were motivated by " pure naked self preservation " on the part of the Labour Party , which performed badly in the local and European elections .
Opposition parties say the public should be given their say now Parliament was in disrepute due to the actions of certain MPs , he said , and the public should have the opportunity to pass judgement on them .
He added that an election would allow all parties to put their proposals for cleaning up Parliament to the electorate and " the reform process will then have a mandate . "
Mr Robertson added that the argument against having an election in tough economic times was simply " not credible " .
" We need an election to rebuild confidence in UK economic policy , " he said .
For the Conservatives , Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague said the choice was between a " visibly divided government " or a new parliament with a " mandate approved by the people of the country and the authority that comes from demonstrable public approval in a democracy " .
He called for " the people of Britain to decide their own future " , adding : " That is what the country wants , that it what our democracy needs . "
Lib Dem MP David Heath said the " collapse in respect " for MPs made the need for an election urgent .
" We need to give the public an opportunity to back or sack every single one of us , " he said .
Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Elfyn Llwyd said the expenses scandal had turned Parliament into a " busted flush " .
He added : " If we went to the country there would be a renewal . "
But Labour
MPs dismissed calls for an immediate election , saying reforming Parliament must be a priority and any changes agreed will be put to the electorate soon anyway as an election must be held within the next year .
Mr Hain said the SNP and Plaid were " the Tories ' little helpers " in light of Conservative leader David Cameron 's calls for an immediate poll .
He added that all politicians had been sent a message at the European elections to " clean up , shape up , and come back to us when the problem is fixed " .
Labour MPs who wanted to replace Gordon Brown were warned by loyalists that such a move would lead to an immediate election , at a time when Labour has just suffered its worst national poll result in 90 years .
Among the Northern Ireland parties the DUP voted for dissolution while the SDLP and the sole Ulster Unionist , Lady Hermon , voted against .

( CNN ) -- Federal authorities indicted 24 people Wednesday on charges of selling , buying or exchanging archaeological artifacts stolen from Native American lands -- part of what Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called a crackdown on smugglers of such relics .
The artifacts include burial and ceremonial masks , decorated pottery and a buffalo - hide headdress , according to a news release from the Department of Justice .
" Let this case serve notice to anyone who is considering breaking these laws and trampling our nation 's cultural heritage that the BLM [ Bureau of Land Management ] , the Department of Justice and the federal government will track you down and bring you to justice , " said Salazar , who was in Salt Lake City , Utah , to announce the crackdown .
President Obama is " committed to a new relationship with America 's first Americans , " Salazar said , adding that Wednesday 's announcements of indictments was a show of that commitment .
Officials said the artifacts -- some stolen from grave sites -- were taken from the Four Corners area , so called because it is the intersection of four states : Utah , Colorado , Arizona and New Mexico .
The area also has a rich history of Native American culture .
The Navajo Parks and Recreation Department manages the Four Corners Monument , which attracts tourists as the only point in the United States where four states come together at one point .
Authorities recovered 256 artifacts worth about $ 335,685 , said Deputy Attorney General David Ogden .
About 150 agents assisted in an undercover investigation that tracked the suspects for more than two years , Ogden said .
They had the help of an individual who knew about the smuggling ring , officials said .
The investigation is ongoing , said Ogden .
The recovered artifacts are evidence , but at some point after the investigation those that are privately owned will be returned to their owners , said Craig Leff , a spokesperson for the Bureau of Land Management .
The suspects face charges carrying sentences ranging from one to 10 years in prison for violating the Archaeological Resources Protection Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation , Ogden said .
Break out the linguistic life jackets , folks .
We ’re about to be inundated with the overuse and abuse of the word mainstream with regard to President Obama ’s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court .
Politics is at its heart a battle for control of language and symbols .
Now that the president has nominated Judge Sotomayor , [ insert name of political party or faction here ] will seek to [ support | undercut ] that nominee through [ messaging | framing | “ truth ” ] .
Ideological control of mainstream , a word signifying ownership of the core values of a majority of Americans , is at stake .
From Scott Reed , manager of the 1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole :
The G.OP . has to make a stand .
This is what the base and social conservatives really care about , and we need to brand her a liberal with some out - of - the - mainstream positions .
From Burt Neuborne , legal director of the New York University Brennan Center for Justice :
I have reviewed Judge Sotomayor ’s judicial record , and it is undoubtedly well within the judicial mainstream .
From a list of talking points released in error by the GOP and printed in The Hill :
Republicans look forward to learning more about Judge Sotomayor ’s legal views and to determining whether her views reflect the values of mainstream America .
Glenn Greenwald at Salon.com on Judge Sotomayer ’s comments on gender and ethnicity informing judicial rulings :
It ’s possible to take that view too far to the point where it becomes troubling , and Sotomayor should ( and certainly will ) be asked about it , but the comments themselves are entirely mainstream and uncontroversial .
From David Limbaugh at Human Events :
Even though the nation is mostly conservative and “ liberal ” is still a dirty word , President Obama is moving us leftward at a breakneck pace by disguising his actions through smooth rhetoric and slick salesmanship .
Obama is a consummate practitioner of presenting his extreme leftist agenda as moderate and mainstream .
And even from George W. Bush in 2005 :
My nominee will be a fair - minded individual who represents the mainstream of American law and American values .
Imagine a political spectrum from as far left as possible to as far right as possible .
( Given the press ’s framing of what “ far left ” and “ far right ” has been for the past quarter century , left vs. right is n’t as distinct as it used to be .
But let ’s leave that for another post …)
Where is mainstream ?
Is it where the Democratic Party used to be before Bill Clinton transformed it into Centrist City ?
Is it where various progressive groups say they now populate the mainstream ?
Is it where evangelical Christians say the base of the Republican Party is ?
Is mainstream more at home with social conservatives or fiscal conservatives ?
I do n’t know .
But it will be fun watching them all attempt to remake mainstream within their own ideological images .
The Genes of Mice Reveal Viking Secrets
The house mice ( mus musculus domesticus ) are largely dependent on dense human settlement for food , so they may serve as a good indicator of human migrations and trading links .
The study by Professor Jeremy Searle , from York University , published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences in October 2008 , analyses the genes of 328 mice from 105 localities in the UK .
The difference in mitochondrial DNA shows that one distinct strain of mice from the northern and western peripheries of the British Isles probably arrived with the Norwegian Vikings .
Another strain of mice found on mainland Britain show some of the same DNA sequences as mice from Germany .
Researchers believe this might be a link to Bronze Age human migrations , beginning about 2300 BC .
Professor Searle hopes that future studies will help to learn more about other Viking migrations .
For instance , mice could resolve the dispute concerning the settlement of Iceland .
According to a version , Iceland was home to multiple Viking settlements , each with a different home base .
Other historians think that the Hebrides served as a pit stop for Vikings on their way from Norway to Iceland .
The answer may be concealed in the DNA of Icelandic and Hebridean mice .
No less interesting might be a discovery of Viking mice DNA in North America .

Picture the scene : you 're going out to eat at one of London 's hippest new restaurants .
You 've dressed up and are ready for a night of intimate fine dining – trouble is , first you 've got to find the place and unlike Covent Garden , there are no helpful tourist signs in the maze of quiet residential streets in Kilburn , Dalston or Brixton .
This is dining out with a difference – underground , " pop - up " restaurants in private homes are the latest foodie fad to hit London .
From creative cuisine in Kilburn at MsMarmiteLover 's The Underground Restaurant to nine - course vegetarian Japanese eating on slouchy sofas in Horton Jupiter 's beatnik flat , called The Secret Ingredient , in east London , guerrilla dining is at the cutting edge of eating out , provided you can find the location in the first place .
Even celebrities and famous restaurants are getting in on the act , with Jo Wood opening her home to paying guests and Mosimann 's launching a pop-up restaurant on the bank of the Thames during the Henley Regatta .
By their very nature you wo n't find any neon signs or overt advertising for these gigs – it's all done by word of mouth and the internet .
Although hot in London , these underground eateries are not new .
In the US , roving supperclubs such as The Ghetto Gourmet and Red Box Bistro have sizzling reputations and serious waiting lists .
In Cuba , paladares are as much part of the culture as cigars and mojitos .
It 's tempting to think that modern supper clubs are just glorified dinner parties , but the unstoppable American Jim Haynes proves this is a myth .
He has been running a weekly restaurant from his apartment in Paris for 30 years and has seen 130,000 people pass though his doors .

So why do people go ?
Is it the atmosphere or the sense of adventure in eating a surprise set menu in a stranger 's home ?
Is it all about the food , or nosiness ?
Or is it the illicit nature of these borderline legal set -ups ?
To find out I decided to start my own – the Savoy Truffle Supperclub .
My husband , Gav , is a professional chef .
We love having friends for dinner and they started suggesting we open our house to paying guests .
Knowing this was the start of something bigger , we decided to give it a go .
It would stretch Gav 's cooking skills and our kitchen 's capacity , while we'd share the kind of food and atmosphere we'd like to create in our own restaurant one day in the comfort and security of our own home .
There 's something both anarchic and liberating about just going for it and when you start off in an underground fashion ( no fire doors , drinks licence etc ) .
There is a huge amount of trust involved .
But , as one of the pioneers behind the zeitgeist of underground eating in Britain , MsMarmiteLover , explains , this is part of the appeal .
" In a restaurant there 's a divide between the customer and the kitchen .
I like the transparency of a home restaurant ; you can visit the kitchen , chat to the chef ... if things are busy and you need water , you can get it yourself .
It breaks down the barriers that exist in usual restaurants . "
Although we were essentially cooking for friends , we decided " selling " alcohol would put us in dodgy territory , not just legally but morally .
Alcohol is how regular restaurants make most of their profits but in the undergrounds , it 's the food and the experience that matter , not the bottom line .
Most " pop - up " restaurants are free or suggest a nominal donation to cover costs , usually somewhere between £ 15 and £ 30 .
" I always end up breaking even , " confirms Jim Haynes of the discretionary contribution he asks of his 70 or so guests each week .
This also means your guests are not formally paying , which is another difference between the mainstream and the pop-up .
Once we'd got the over the legal aspects , we moved on to converting our bijou front room into a bona fide dining room .
Stuffed with books and clutter , furniture and plants , it was hard to imagine how many tables and chairs we'd be able to squeeze in .
Lots of emails later , we 'd rounded up 14 guinea - pigs brave enough to trek to south London and try our prototype pop-up night .
Another feature of pop-up restaurants is that they are social events , where guests can interact – you could be sitting next to a stranger , and equally odd and exciting for us was the prospect of strangers coming to our house to eat .
What unites everyone is a love of food and a thirst for the new – with the incentive that they get to nose through our photo collection , check out our books and see what we keep in our bathroom cabinet .
As MsMarmiteLover explains : " It 's a little bit Come Dine With Me , a little bit MasterChef and a little bit Through The Keyhole .
It 's intimate and sociable .
Different tables can talk to each other and there are no sittings .
People arrive at 7.30 and stay as long as they like .
I do n't believe food should be rushed . "
In many ways , pop-up restaurants are a return to real eating , when dining out was a social event worth dressing up for and getting excited about , and food was about fresh , seasonal ingredients cooked well but without gimmickry .
Our restaurant would be the same , partly because we could n't fit in tables for two , so diners would have to mix and mingle on larger tables – and if they wanted to switch around , that would be fine , too .
Gav spent weeks thinking about his menu , refining it and testing out canapés and sauces in our tiny kitchen – would people be too full after a poached egg floated atop a bowl of asparagus velouté with a Parmesan crisp ?
Would it be a tragedy to blitz all those lovely green spears into a soup rather than serve them fresh ?
Yes on both counts .
I spent the build - up to the big night begging tables and chairs from friends and schlepping from shop to shop in search of just the right kind of shot glass for serving sorbet in ( a straight , cylindrical double - shot glass ) .
As the evening got closer , the pressure built up and the standards were raised .
We 'd gone from thinking we 'd squeeze people in wherever and serving food on our ramshackle plates to planning with military precision how we could move our sofa and armchair into our bedroom , as well as anything in the kitchen that was n't needed for the menu .
Our car became a dumping ground for toasters and novelty oils .
Gav borrowed plates from his restaurant so each table would have matching crockery .
By the time our guests arrived , I still had n't printed menus .
Instead I took a blackboard outside and chalked up what we would be eating while serving our diners a welcome glass of Prosecco in the garden .
I worried this was amateurish , but one guest , Amy , said being able to enjoy a relaxed aperitif in a tranquil garden and chatting to the chef and guests was a highlight .
" It was lovely to be drinking sparkly in the garden on a sunny evening .
At restaurants you are either stood on the road or more often then not you cannot get outside because all the tables are taken . "
Despite a frantic 24 hours of building tables , reducing stocks , pureeing peas and broad beans , remaking the treacle tarts – the first batch were " a bit too chewy " , according to our sous chef and friend Bob – and running to the shop four times for forgotten ingredients , the evening itself was relatively smooth .
Strangers and friends mingled , and people popped by the kitchen to see what was going on and were impressed by the relaxed atmosphere .
Although I was waitressing I still got to chat with each table ( and enjoy a slurp of red wine ) and it was hugely satisfying to be able to tell intrigued guests how much work went into the dishes and that the veg was supplied by a guest from his farm seven miles away – where else could you get provenance like that or so few food miles ?
After canapés of pork balls and apple and tarragon aioli , haddock croquettes and parmesan choux puffs , asparagus hollandaise with a poached Cotswold Legbar hen 's egg and pancetta to start , rack of lamb , pea and broad bean puree , spring greens and potato dauphinoise , then gin and tonic sorbet and treacle tart , the room was buzzing and waistlines were bulging .
" It 's surprising how much it feels like a restaurant and not just your lounge , " commented my friend Jillian .
We went out to have coffee with our guests feeling proud and elated – and already planning the Savoy Truffle Supperclub 's next pop -up night .

Chinese authorities are going to great lengths to ensure that today 's 20th anniversary of the brutal Tiananmen Square crackdown on students is not marked by protests .
Twenty years ago today the might of the world 's largest army was unleashed on several thousand students who had been protesting for more than six weeks in support of democratic change .
Tanks , armoured personnel carriers and thousands of troops crushed and shot anyone who got in their way , and to this day the Chinese government has concealed the exact death toll .
Most of the deaths were in the streets around the square where tens of thousands of workers and ordinary citizens attempted to stop the armoured columns .
Today the area is occupied by thousands of soldiers and police ready to prevent any commemoration of the historic events .
Uniformed and plain - clothed officers are patrolling the square , while heavily - armed paramilitary police carrying automatic weapons stand nearby .
There are no signs of the occasion being marked anywhere , and any people the government feared would hold memorial services or protest have been put under house arrest .
News reports coming into China about Tiananmen have been blocked , as have social networking websites like Twitter , for fear they could be used to organise protests .
Meanwhile , the United States government has called on China to release the names of all who were killed or went missing .
Novell hits on Linux revenue , but the company 's overall quarterly sales are down .
In an already tough IT environment , and with Windows 7 garnering buzz ,
Microsoft
( MSFT ) - Get Report
may have to sleep with one eye open .
One bright spot in an otherwise dampened earnings report showed that
Novell's
( NOVL )
revenue related to its Linux open - source platform -- a chief rival to Windows -- was up 25.5 % to $ 36.6 million from the same quarter a year ago .
With Microsoft and Novell currently locked in a deathmatch over the future of netbook software , this news will probably make IT watchers perk up .
Overall , though , there was far less to like about Novell 's report .
Net income still came to $ 15.6 million , or 5 cents per share , which is up from 2 cents per share from the year - ago period .
Excluding certain items -- like stock - based compensation , amortization on an acquisition , and restructuring costs -- raises the tally to $ 29.3 million , or EPS of 8 cents .
But an eyebrow - raising 32 % drop in software licensing is not a good sign .
A steep fall in training and support services sales also helped push overall revenue down from $ 235.7 million in the year ago period to $ 215.6 million this quarter .
Exchange rates complicated matters , dragging net revenues down by another $ 6 million .
Despite that , the company was able to get to its bottom line thanks to a cut in operating expenses , which fell to $ 152.7 million from $ 173.5 million .
That was due in large part to an $ 18.2 million cut in sales and marketing costs .
Revenue from maintenance and subscriptions , which makes up nearly three - quarters of sales , also rose to $ 158.3 million from $ 150.9 in a year .
" Our Linux and Identity businesses have the greatest potential to continue to expand operating margins , " CEO Ron Hovsepian said in a statement , " and we plan to attain profitability within these businesses no later than 12 - 18 months from today , barring unforeseen circumstances . "
After the earnings announcement , the company also released news of a partnership with Affiliated Computer Services .
In a statement , Novell said it will outsource a slice of its IT operations to ACS as part of a five - year contract worth $ 135 million .
ACS will also buy $ 30 million in Novell products in the first three years .
Novell was changing hands down nearly 5 % by afternoon trading .
Microsoft was down 6 cents to $ 20.39 .

The Arithmetic Flags Challenge
Let me show you a piece of code from a very simple C test program , which I call T1.C : static int foo( int i ) {
return ( i+1 ) ;
}
int main ( void ) {
int i ;
int t = 0 ;
for( i = 0 ; i < 100000000 ; i++)
t += foo( i ) ;
} This is actually a test program I 've used for about 10 years .
I compile this test program using various compilers , and use it for two different purposes : to compare the code generation between different compilers and their compiler optimization switches in order to compare competing C/C++ compilers on the same platform , and , to generate test programs for use in correctness tests and benchmarking of various emulators .
For example , this was the first piece of compiled PowerPC test code I got running back when I started developing my never ending PowerPC emulator .
I like this code because it is simple , always takes exactly the same number of instructions to execute in , and exercises many common features such as arithmetic operations , loop index incrementing and checking , function calls , memory reads and writes and store - forwarding issues , stack pushes and stack adjusts .
There are all extremely common elements of any typical C or C++ program .
I compile two versions of this code : T1FAST .
EXE is compiled with maximum compiler optimization turned on , and T1SLOW.EXE is compiled with compiler optimizations disabled , tending to generate many more memory references and thus slower code .
You would be surprised how much Windows code there is out there ships without full compiler optimizations and so it is necessary to test both variants of the code .
The full source code and the two compiled x86 Windows - compatible test programs can be downloaded here ( nx11_t1.zip ) .
Download that ZIP file if you will and try running those two executables from a Windows command prompt .
You should find that T1FAST.EXE takes about 3/10 of a second to execute on most current Windows machines , and T1SLOW.EXE will be as fast or perhaps a tenth of a second slower .
The Intel Core 2 is actually quite impressive in that it executes both versions in about the same time of under 300 milliseconds , indicating that the internal CPU pipeline is doing a lot of clever tricks to make memory accesses appear to be as fast as ordinary register operations .
On most other architectures such as Pentium III and Pentium 4 , there is a fixed extra execution time of about 100 milliseconds for the unoptimized executable , due to a slightly larger real cost in accessing memory over registers , even when that memory is known to be cached in the L1 data cache .
There is another reason why I like this simple test program .
Each iteration of the loop executes about dozen instructions ( plus or minus , depending on the compiler ) or which 6 of those instructions either use or modify the arithmetic flags , which I began describing to you last week .
On x86 , these are the 6 bits within the EFLAGS register which record the Sign flag , the Zero flag , the Carry flag , the Overflow flag , the Adjust flag , and the Parify flag , written in shorthand as SF ZF CF OF AF and PF .
The first four I listed - Sign , Zero , Carry , Overflow - are common on most CPU architectures .
On the 68000 and 68040 , they exist as the " NZVC " bits ( Negative , Zero , oVerflow , Carry ) in the Condition Codes Register , which is the Motorola equivalent of the EFLAGS register .
On PowerPC , these bits exist as five bits - Less Than , Greater Than , Equal , Overflow , and Carry - but actually convey the same information .
The other two flags - Adjust ( also known as Auxiliary Carry ) and Parity - are unique to the x86 architecture but no less important .
Windows would not boot correctly without these flags .
Any kind of " if " statement in C , C++ , Java , or other language , generally compiles into code which first executes one or more arithmetic instructions to set these condition flags , followed by a conditional branch instruction such as JE ( Jump If Equal ) .
Conditional flags are as fundamental to computer code as memory reads and writes .
One of the great challenges in developing any efficient virtual machine which emulates real legacy CPU hardware is the accurate and efficient simulation of arithmetic condition flags .
All too often I have seen otherwise good emulators slow to a crawl due to a poor implementation of the flags simulation .
I believe that this is due to most programmers , even those who develop virtual machines , not having the basic understanding of exactly how condition flags are calculated and therefore they do not know how to efficiently simulate them .
This shall be this week 's topic .
Flags -
The Emulator Litmus Test
Two of the ongoing debates in the virtual machine community center on two arguments :
Direct execution or binary translation ?
Interpretation or dynamic recompilation ?
If you have been reading this series in detail you should already have a good idea of what each of these terms mean :
Direct execution is the concept of allowing code that is in a sandbox to be executed natively by the host CPU , whether that code is inside of a virtual machine or just user - mode code in a multi- tasking protected operating system .
For example , when you run a Windows application , the CPU switches to user mode , or what is called " Ring 3 " , and executes your Windows application natively .
The hardware ( in theory at least ) catches any attempts of the sandboxed code from doing things that is not supposed to - writing beyond the end of the stack , accessing memory that does not belong to it , etc .
Direct execution is utilized when the virtual machine 's guest bytecode is the same as the bytecode of the host CPU , and is found in most " PC - on - PC " emulation products such as Microsoft 's Virtual PC 2007 and VMware Fusion .
Binary translation is the opposite of that , and covers wide range of non-native code execution mechanisms .
A Java virtual machine for example has to use binary translation since Java bytecode is not understood directly by the x86 architecture .
Within the realm of binary translation are a variety of techniques , ranging from the trivial interpretation of bytecode ( as I have discussed previously with the interpreter loop example ) , to full dynamic recompilation ( also called " Just - In - Time " compilation or " jitting " ) , and various hybrid schemes in between .
Binary translation is necessary when the guest CPU and host CPU are not identical , such as when emulating a 68040 or PowerPC Macintosh computer on a Windows PC .
In some virtual machines there may be a mixture of direct execution and binary translation techniques in use .
For example , in one older technique used by PC - on - PC virtual machines , kernel mode code ( or " Ring 0 " code ) is sandboxed via some form of binary translation such that accesses to hardware and other protected resources can be properly controlled in software , while user mode code ( that " Ring 3 " code I mentioned previously ) is allowed to execute directly and is protected by the hardware itself .
A related technique , called ring compression , directly executes both user and kernel mode code , but kernel mode code is pushed down to " Ring 1 " , which you can think of as a user mode kernel mode .
When that code in Ring 1 attempts to access a protected resource , it triggers a hardware exception which is caught by the virtual machine 's monitor ( a.k.a. " hypervisor " ) that is actually executing at Ring 0 .
Within the Ring 0 exception handler the Ring 1 instruction is usually interpreted , then direct control is given back to the next instruction in Ring 1 .
Ring compression fell out of favor recently due to its complexity - some code executes directly , but other code throws exceptions which then require it to be interpreted .
Older versions of Virtual PC , Virtual Server , VMware , and Xen all used variants of ring compression or other hybrid schemes .
Today the hot technology is " hardware virtualization " , called " Vanderpool " and " VT " by Intel and " Pacifica " and " AMD - V " by AMD .
While I agree that ring compression is an overly complex and error prone solution , I disagree with the direction that the industry has taken to move away from all forms of binary translation and go to almost purely direct execution schemes based on hardware virtualization .
If anything , I view the decision to use VT or even ring compression as a copout by the developer of the virtual machine ; an admission that they really did n't know how to solve performance issues without relying on additional hardware .
Microsoft recently dropped support of ring compression , choosing to force its VM customers to upgrade to Intel and AMD 's latest VT - enabled chips ( http://blogs.technet.com/jhoward/archive/2006/04/28/426703.aspx).
Forcing customers to buy new hardware is being spun as a " feature " when in fact it is an admission of utter failure .
If one is to ask most developers to rank various virtual machine techniques by order of performance , from fastest to slowest , they will likely give you a list similar to this :
Direct execution using VT hardware virtualization
Direct execution of ring 3 and ring compression
Direct execution of ring 3 and binary translation based jitting of ring 0
Binary translation based jitting of both user and kernel mode code
Interpretation of both user and kernel mode code
Traditionally , virtual machines are first developed as a pure interpreter .
Once that is working they are optimized using jitting .
When the guest and host architectures are the same , the virtual machine is further optimized to use one of the forms of direction execution .
People naively assume that each step up the list equates to a large performance speedup .
This is not always the case , as the performance of any virtual machine is only as good as the implementation .
Current research from both VMware and people involved with the QEMU emulator indicates that today 's VT technology from both Intel and AMD is actually slower than older ring compression or binary translation techniques !
I even confirmed this with the little test program I discussed in Part 4 of this series .
And in the Macintosh emulation world , I have seen third - party jitting - based Mac emulators get trounced by purely - interpretation based implementations written by myself .
So you might understand why I still care about discussing interpreters and why I tend to dislike sexy - sounding but purely misled efforts to move the whole world to VT .
The data just does not back up people 's assumptions .
Take the example of the QEMU virtual machine , which bills itself as a fast x86 emulator which uses jitting ( http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/about.html).
Fair enough , I would expect that to be fast .
However , QEMU also has an accelerated mode of operation that uses direct execution techniques .
This would seem to imply that the jitted mode is significantly slower enough so as to warrant a direction execution alternative .
So earlier this summer , I took my little T1.C test program and ran it on a variety of Windows virtual machines running on my Intel Core 2 - based Mac Pro to get an idea of what these slowdowns are like compared to natively running the test program .
VM and Technique T1FAST.EXE time in seconds T1SLOW.EXE time in seconds Native 0.26 0.26 VPC2007 using VT 0.27 0.27 VPC2007 using ring compression 0.27 0.27 QEMU 0.9.0 using jitting 10.5 12 Bochs 2.3.5 using interpretation
with inline ASM for flags 25 31 Bochs 2.3.5 using interpretation
with lazy flags code in C++ 34 42 My current Bochs sources using
interpretation and new flags code in C++ 14 18
Table 11 - 1 : Timings of the simple integer benchmark .
As you can see from the above data , QEMU 's dynamic recompilation is a grossly deficient implementation of jitting .
I had excepted QEMU 's slowdown to be on the order of 2 x to 5 x slower than native execution .
It was actually slower by an order of magnitude !
So what is the bottleneck ?
What is so difficult in emulating the x86 architecture that makes the jitter in QEMU drop to its knees and barely outperform an x86 interpreter ?
One significant factor , one that I consider to be the litmus test of a good virtual machine implementation , is the simulation of the arithmetic condition flags - those 6 little bits I described above .
As of two months ago , QEMU was already only about 200 % faster than Bochs 2.3.5 at running my CPU intensive test program .
As of today , I have optimized Bochs down to a point where it is barely 50 % slower than QEMU .
What did I do ?
And what are these " lazy flags " mentioned in the table ?
WARNING !
As I did last week , I will be discussing sequences of C++ code derived from the Bochs 2.3.5 source code which is covered by LGPL ( the GNU Library license ) .
If you have an allergy to GPL or to looking at open source code , I am afraid you will need to stop reading now .
There Is Lazy , And Then There Is Lazy Arithmetic condition flags are one of those ubiquitous features of any microprocessor machine language .
While most programmers quite easily understand the concept that a CMP EAX , EBX instruction sets the Zero flag when the contents of registers EAX and EBX are equal , few really understand how the flags are really set .
For example , is EAX=3 and EBX= - 47 , what bit values does CMP EAX , EBX set for the Parify flag , the Carry flag , the Overflow flag ?
In many virtual machine implementations , that question is side - stepped by the fact that simulating most arithmetic operations requires executing those exact same operations .
Huh ?
In other words , if one is simulating a PowerPC " ADDCO . " instruction ( which sets the five PowerPC arithmetic condition flags ) , the host virtual machine can simply execute a native ADD instruction .
This is true the other way around , say , trying to emulate a 68040 on PowerPC as Apple once did in its Power Macintosh computers , or emulating PowerPC on x86 as Apple does today in its current Intel - based Mac products .
Most instruction sets , x86 included , provide some means to transfer the arithmetic condition flags into a register .
On 68040 for example , one uses the MOVE CCR , D0 instruction to move the N Z V C bits into the lower 4 bits of the D0 register .
On PowerPC one uses a similar instruction called mfcr ( " Move From Condition Register " ) .
And on x86 , there are two common methods : push the flags registers to the stack and then pop the stack in to a register , using a code sequence such as PUSHF / POP AX , or , copy 5 of the arithmetic condition flags using the LAHF instruction and then read the 6th flag using SETO .
What ?
What ?
What ?
Ok , let me explain this in a way that makes sense .
Neither Intel 's IA32 nor AMD 's AMD64 instruction sets provide an instruction to directly transfer all six condition flags to a general purpose register as is commonly found on other architectures .
The shortest and most common x86 code sequence for such purposes is to use the Push Flags instruction PUSHF which pushes the flags to the stack .
A POP instruction can then store those flags in a register or in a memory location .
This is an inefficient code sequence it involves at least two memory operations ( a write to the stack followed by a read of that value just pushed to the stack ) .
The instruction PUSHF requires several clock cycles , and worse , its counterpart POPF can require several dozen clock cycles .
The worst virtual machine implementations I have seen involve using both PUSHF and POPF .
There are other techniques .
The x86 instruction set of course has conditional branch instruction which query most of those flags .
There is JZ ( Jump If Zero ) instruction , also called JE ( Jump If Equal ) , which branches if the ZF is 1 and does not branch when it is 0 .
There is JC ( Jump If Carry ) , JO ( Jump If Overflow ) , and JS ( Jump If Sign ) which are pretty self explanatory .
These instructions are sufficient to query and record the four common flags ZF CF OF SF , which in turn is sufficient to simulate the condition flags of a 68040 .
In fact , earlier versions of my Gemulator and SoftMac products did in fact use JZ and JS instructions to record the Zero and Sign flags , and JC and JO to record the Carry and Overflow flags .
The 32 - bit x86 instruction set IA32 also contains an LAHF ( " Load AH With Flags " ) instruction , which is a little weird .
It copies five of the six arithmetic flags to the AH register , which is the subset of bits 15..8 of the larger EAX register .
I have no clue why the LAHF instruction exists as it does since it is rather awkward and does not fully do the job , and AMD unfortunately removed this instruction from the 64 - bit AMD64 instruction set .
That was a terrible mistake , as it is actually a handy instruction in cases where the result of the Overflow flag is known by other means .
For example , most common arithmetic operations such as AND and XOR are defined to clear both the Carry and Overflow flags .
So for those instructions , which thankfully are quite common , one does not need the full brute force strength of a PUSHF instruction , and can rely on LAHF .
Most recent versions of Gemulator and SoftMac in fact do use LAHF to now record the Zero , Sign , and Carry flags in cases where Overflow is known to be set to zero .
What I am describing here is a technique called " lazy flags " .
In most direct execution based virtual machines , the host flags are kept in sync with the guest flags state .
There is no need to use PUSHF or LAHF or other schemes , as the state of the host CF ZF OF SF AF and PF do always reflect the state of the code being simulated .
In lazy schemes , that flags state is stored away somewhere for later retrieval , whether in a register or in memory .
When the a particular arithmetic condition flag needs to be known , that register or memory location is tested in some way in order to recreate the necessary flag .
In the case of Bochs 2.3.5 , there are two lazy flags schemes in use .
The first one I already showed to you last week for when the host CPU is also of an x86 architecture .
If you look at the Bochs source file cpu\hostasm.h , you will see that there are inline assembly versions of all of the x86 arithmetic operations , with descriptive inline function names such as asmShr16 , asmTest32 , asmXor8 , etc .
Each of these functions performs the arithmetic operation and then stores away the result of the operation , executes PUSHF and POP to read the host CPU 's EFLAGS register , and stores that flags state away in memory .
I do n't like this particular scheme , because it introduces very CPU - specific inline ASM code to what otherwise a very portable emulator , and because the PUSHF / POP code sequences is really not that efficient .
The second lazy flags mechanism that the Bochs 2.3.5 source code uses is almost the opposite of the first mechanism , where instead of using PUSHF to know the state of the flags as soon as possible , the evaluation of those flags is pushed out as long as possible .
What this portable C++ based method does is to store away 5 values for arithmetic operations - the two input values , the result , the size of the operation ( whether it be 8 - bit , 16 - bit , 32 - bit , or 64 - bit ) , and an integer which specifies which operation was performed .
If you look at the Bochs 2.3.5 source files cpu\cpu.h , cpu\lazy_flags.h , and cpu\lazy_flags.cpp , you will see this mechanism at work .
Let 's look a typical ADD operation and how it works using this very lazy flags algorithm .
We 'll look at the code for a common 32 - bit register - to - register ADD operation .
The code for that is found in the Bochs 2.3.5 source file cpu\arith32.cpp , and I show here an edited down version of the code :
void BX_CPU_C ::ADD_GdEGd( bxInstruction_c * i )
{
Bit32u op1_32 , op2_32 , sum_32 ;
unsigned nnn = i->
nnn ( ) ;
op1_32 = BX_READ_32BIT_REG( nnn ) ;
op2_32 = BX_READ_32BIT_REG(i->rm ( ) ) ;
sum_32 = op1_32 + op2_32 ;
SET_FLAGS_OSZAPC_32(op1_32 , op2_32 , sum_32 , BX_INSTR_ADD32 ) ;
BX_WRITE_32BIT_REGZ ( nnn , sum_32 ) ;
}
So what does this mysterious " SET_FLAGS_OSZAPC_32 " macro do ?
If you look back at cpu\cpu.h , the various SET_FLAGS * macros boil down to these five lines of code :
oszapc.op1##size = lf_op1 ;
oszapc.op2##size = lf_op2 ;
oszapc.result##size = lf_result ;
oszapc.instr = ins ;
lf_flags_status = BX_LF_MASK_OSZAPC ;
There is a data structure oszapc which holds the two input operands , the result , and an enumeration which specifies the x86 instruction which was just simulated .
An lf_flags_status variable holds a bitmask which corresponds to the flags bits which need to be lazily evaluated .
This scheme is thus very lazy in that this first portion never actually calculates the values of the flags .
It simple stores 5 values to memory for later use .
When the flags actually need to be evaluated , such as when simulating an x86 conditional branch instruction , there are 6 lazy evaluation functions in cpu\lazy_flags.cpp , each corresponding to one of the arithmetic condition flags .
The stripped down code for evaluating the state of the Zero flag for the above 32 - bit ADD instruction is this :
bx_bool BX_CPU_C::get_ZFLazy( void )
{
unsigned zf ;
zf = ( oszapc.result_32 == 0 ) ; lf_flags_status &= 0xff0fff ;
eflags.val32 &= ~0x40 ;
eflags.val32 |= zf <<6 ; // zf always exactly 0 or 1. return ( zf ) ;
}
What this code does is evaluate ZF , and then also propagate that state of ZF to the eflags state variable so as to avoid needing to lazily re-evaluate the ZF .
Code that actually needs the ZF does not call get_ZFLazy directly , instead if calls an inline method called get_ZF which expands out to this code :
bx_bool get_ZF ( void ) {
if ( ( lf_flags_status & 0x40 ) == 0 )
return eflags.val32 & 0x40 ) ;
else
return get_ZFLazy ( ) ;
}
So far so good , this looks fairly clean and efficient .
The majority of x86 instructions update the arithmetic flags , and so they simply need to do the 5 stores to the temporary state in oszapc and lf_flags_status .
A smaller percentage of x86 instruction ( such as conditional branches ) read the arithmetic flags , and thus call one of the get _ * F ( ) functions which in turn may end up calling one of the get_ * FLazy ( ) functions .
This appears to be efficient , and is certainly very portable to any non-x86 architecture that has a C++ compiler , but Table 11 - 1 shows it to be about 30 % slower than the Bochs inline asm technique .
As I found out , part of this slowdown is actually due to compiler differences between GCC ( which was used to build the release version of Bochs 2.3.5 ) and the VC7.1 C++ compiler in Visual Studio 2003 which I used .
In an open source project - especially one that involves Perl - most of the people just want to write code .
Nearly no one wants to do PR .
It even has a bad reputation among many open source developers .
In Padre I constantly struggle if I should spend my time adding a new feature or trying to recruit more developers .
The former works better in the short term , the latter works better in the long term .
Eventually there is a balance I try to keep .
One of the things I really miss from the perl 5 porters - the people who maintain and improve perl itself - is the communication .
In the last couple of weeks we saw lots of blog - posts and mailing lists posts - sometimes not in the nicest way - why there is no regular release of perl 5 and how a speed related bug that was fixed 18 months ago was not released in an intermediate version .
In these discussions several of the p5 p people got involved but unfortunately this is mostly defensive talk .
Not good PR .
I also got fed - up with the lack of release and asked on the p5 p list what is stopping them from releasing the next version of perl and what is so hard in the release process that they cannot do it more regularly ?
I got several related replies .
One of the them on the mailing list others on IRC .
According to those the next perl 5 release is within a small number of weeks .
That is certainly good news .
I would prefer to see a Release Candidate already that people can take for a ride but in the meantime I can point you at the three major issues around the release that need to be done :
Fix a bunch of outstanding issues .
The release must be stable .
The actual release process should be automatic .
For item no .
1 you need to talk to the perl porters or look at the topic on the # p5 p IRC channel where they point you at the list of outstanding issues Item no .
2 was addressed in an e-mail of David Golden and the thread following it .
That should be summarized in a document and the test automation system should be implemented .
For item no .
3 we first need to have a written document of what needs to be done and then we can attempt to automate it .
The document can be based on the e-mail of Nicholas Clark .
Actually I already created a pod version of that file that I hope soon will be added to the source tree of perl and then it can be fine tuned and implemented .
The interesting issue is that 2 . and 3 . need to be implemented only once and they can be reused for every future release of perl 5 .
So if you 'd like to see more frequent releases that 's where you need to help .
Luckily those , especially no.
2 , are issues that any perl hacker can get involved easily .
They only need perl coding .
I know I am not a good PR person and I hardly know anything about what 's going on in the perl 5 porters but I hope this post helped a bit .
At least it might trigger someone to write a better explanation of the situation .
Oh and a last note , if you 'd like to get involved , the description on how to deal with the Git repository can be found here

In a previous post Meeting the World Challenge , we had mentioned about She Hope Society and the remarkable work they were doing in rehabilitating the disabled in the Kashmir Valley .
In response to that article , we received a note from Diane Emerson who was headed to the Centre to volunteer for a period of 3 months starting in April .
Hailing from New Zealand and having traveled all over the world volunteering with various charities and NGOs , Diane expressed a strong interest in sharing her experience with The Better India , so that our readers could get a glimpse of working in an NGO , the ground realities in Kashmir as seen from the eyes of an impartial observer , and life as a traveling volunteer .
Here are some of her observations .
About life in Kashmir Valley :
The food is healthy and locally grown and organic .
And vegetarianism is common .
Even people who do eat meat eat it sparingly .
Children are loved by both parents , and get lots of attention since everyone eats on the floor .
I often see fathers walking with their little boys , and their girls .
And feeding their children .
Caring for children is clearly shared , because they are loved .
And there is time for them .
Drunk drivers do not exist here .
Alcohol is not sold anywhere .
So there is no alcohol - related violence , no party culture .
No drunken hooning on the roads at night , no drunks stumbling along the streets , or passed out in the gutter , or making lewd comments to the girls .
No bars to go to .
No alcoholic fathers making life miserable for their families .
No hidden alcoholic mothers .
None .
So what do people do without alcohol ?
People talk to each other .
They hang out together , and just spend time together , rather than sit at home and watch TV , or go out to the bars .
In the evenings , when so many New Zealanders and Americans are in front of their TV watching the news and getting a big dose of negativity and violence , here they talk to their neighbours and watch the light fade .
About working at the Hope Disability Centre :

Today is a CBR : Community Based Rehabilitation visit .
Sami brings hearing testing equipment and we go to a village to find disabled people who need help .
The village was Kulharna , and it had been arranged by the newspaper reporter who had stopped by a week before .
Our first stop was at a school where there were two disabled teenage boys .
The school superintendent asked me my opinion of Kashmir , and was pleased with my answers .
Yes .
I like it here .
For many reasons .
And I am finding more all the time .
When funds become available , these boys will have surgery .
In the meantime , exercises can be done to help .
About the work of the military in the region , and of one commendable army man :
Even though in most of Kashmir the actual voting turnout is only 3 or 4 % , here in our Ganderbal district the voting turnout is closer to 60 % .
I found out one of the reasons why on Friday , when Sami and I visited the top military commander in Ganderbal .
Commandant Vivik Sharma believes strongly in eliminating militancy , not just militants .
I have learned that in Kashmir the independence fighters are called militants by some ; terrorists by others .
Commandant Sharma ’s job is only to find and stop the militants .
But he does more .
Much more .
He organizes free cataract surgeries , field trips to Delhi for school children , free veterinary training for the small farmers , and locates funds to support efforts like the Hope Disability Centre .
He will be reassigned soon .
And I think he has chosen to build a cricket stadium in Ganderbal as his lasting contribution to the community .
It will be finished next month .
But he is most proud of the fact that not one of his soldiers has troubled any of the students at the all girls school right next door .
Not once in 3 years .
The Commandant General even requires his men to treat suspected militants with respect and consideration .
There was a photo of a militant giving himself up in the room we were sitting in .
The military found and took in this Pakistani militant who had come to Kashmir to help liberate the country , and asked him why he had chosen the militant path .
The Pakistani said he had heard that Muslims were not allowed to worship at the mosques , and other offenses .
So the commandant took him around Ganderbal and showed him the open mosques , and allowed him to talk to the local people about life in Ganderbal District .
And the man , who had not killed anyone , ended up joining the army .
If all the miliary commanders around the world were like this man , there would be no need for militaries at all .
Diane also brought with her a couple of laptops from New Zealand to train the disabled youth and help them attain life skills to be able to support themselves .
The program has met with tremendous popularity and Diane is flooded with more students than she can handle , so that some of the older students also take up the responsibility of teaching the newer entrants .
Follow Diane ’s intriguing journey with Hope Disability Centre and her experiences in India at her blog .
Suspected victims of drink spiking are more likely to be suffering from drugs and alcohol they have willingly consumed , according to Australian research .
Of 100 suspected drink - spiking cases reviewed in a West Australian study , none were found to involve being slipped a sedative or illicit drug .
What emerged instead was a concerning picture of excess alcohol and illegal drug use by people - usually young women - at the centre of these drink - spiking claims .
" The public 's perception that it 's a guy putting a sedative drug into a woman 's drink , at a pub or a club , we just did n't find that at all , " said Dr Mark Little , a clinical toxicologist at the Royal Perth Hospital .
" As a community , we have a bigger problem with illicit drug use and alcohol binge drinking than we do with drink spiking . "
How Inventors Can Avoid Scams , Traps and Raw Deals

June 27 , 2009
Back in March 2009 , I traveled to North Carolina to the Everyday Edisons studio to participate in the United Inventors Association filming of a 10 part mini-series that covers every stage in the patent to market process .
The series is about 5 hours in length and covers every aspect from how not to get scammed , to patents , prototypes , packaging , marketing , licensing and selling your invention for profit on your own .
The full educational mini-series is available only to inventors who join the UIA , but episode 1 , titled Avoiding Scams , Traps and Raw Deals , is available for free to everyone .
Steve Greenberg , the author of Gadget Nation and Emmy winning news reporter , conducts an interview with myself , Ron Reardon ( UIA President and the President of the National Association of Patent Practitioners ) and Louis Foreman ( of Everyday Edisons and Inventors Digest ) .

A recent McAfee service pack led to systems being rendered unbootable , according to posts on the security giant 's support forums .
The mandatory service pack for McAfee 's corporate Virus scanning product , VSE 8.7 , was designed to address minor security bugs but instead tagged windows system files as malware .
The software update was issued on 27 May and pulled on 2 June , after problems occurred .
Users were advised to keep the patch if they 'd already installed it in a low - key announcement on McAfee 's knowledge base .
Posts on McAfee 's support forum paint a different picture of PCs and server left unbootable after the update had automatically deleted Windows systems files wrongly identified as potentially malign .
Our source among the McAfee user community , who asked not to be named , described the incident as a " massive fail " by McAfee and reports that sysadmins are angry that a long awaited patch turned out to do more harm than good .
In a statement , McAfee acknowledged potential problems but said that these were rare .
It said it planned to reissue the service pack once glitches with the software were ironed out .
McAfee removed Patch 1 for McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.7i from its download servers out of precaution after a potential issue with the update was discovered .
A very small number of customers reported trouble with the patch on a limited number of computers .
Once the cause of the problem has been identified and the issue has been resolved , we will repost Patch 1 .
Customers should contact McAfee support if they have any questions regarding this issue , and check the McAfee ServicePortal for further updates .
Problems with anti-virus scanner definition updates that result in false alarms against harmless files are a well known Achilles ' heel of security software .
The issue causes more trouble in cases where system files are flagged as potentially malign .
The problems with McAfee 's enterprise security software are arguably even worse than that because they involve a service pack and not just regular definition updates .
McAfee users have every right to ask tough questions about the security giant 's quality assurance and testing regime even if , as McAfee states , only a small percentage of users ran into problems . ®

This hardcover edition features around 200 photos along with introductions by the actress Martina Gedeck and director Bryan Papciak .
Stages of Decay is a collection of photos of abandoned and deteriorating performance spaces , with a range that includes the stunning historical theaters as much as the modest auditorium in a shuttered elementary school .
It focuses on the actual stages as they become disfigured by neglect , as the decay moves from the first patches of mold to crumbling plaster , rotting curtains and collapsing roofs .
The camera 's perspective is that of a last audience member , viewing the unfolding spectacle of decrepitude .
Stages of Decay is a glimpse at what happens after the final curtain has dropped .
The project depicts nearly 200 stages in the US and Europe , photographed over more than a decade .
Many of those locations no longer exist , but they still have their place in the constellation of dead theaters .
Some have been portrayed extensively by historians or photographers .
This project , in contrast , is n't meant as a documentation as much as a celebration of these ruined spaces , as the theaters are slowly turning into the playgrounds of their own demise .

DALLAS -- NFL offensive linemen bang heads all the time .
A trio of Dallas Cowboys linemen are now professional head - bangers , too .
Leonard Davis , Marc Colombo and Cory Procter have signed a recording contract as part of a heavy metal band called Free Reign .
Their debut album for Australia 's Riot Entertainment will be released this fall .
Considering all three players weigh over 300 pounds , it only makes sense they are being referred to as " heavier than metal . "
" Free Reign is a band with massive potential , " Riot owner John Howarth said in a news release Tuesday .
" There has been an enormous buzz surrounding them since they appeared on the scene a few months ago .
Free Reign has already been flooded with endorsements .
Their marketing potential is limitless .
These guys are already huge sports stars , but they have shown they have the talent to diversify . "
Guitarist Justin Chapman is the fourth member of the group .
Their final gig of the offseason is Saturday at the House of Blues in Dallas .
Riot has also signed the group Fozzy , which includes professional wrestler Chris Jericho .
( CNN ) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel could accept a peace agreement with a " demilitarized Palestinian state " as its neighbor .
Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he would agree to peace with Palestinians .
In his first speech accepting the concept of a two - state solution for the Middle East conflict , Netanyahu set rigid conditions for moving forward .
Among them : unequivocal Palestinian recognition of Israel as the Jewish national state with Jerusalem as its capital , and full demilitarization for a Palestinian state -- no army , no rockets or missiles , no control of airspace .
" I say this in a clear voice -- if we receive a guarantee of this demilitarized unit , we will be prepared to reach agreement to a demilitarized Palestine side by side with the Jewish state , " Netanyahu said , according to a direct translation of his speech at Bar - Ilan University 's Begin - Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Ramat Gan , Israel .
Initial Palestinian reaction was negative , with Palestinian legislator Mustafa Barghouti saying Netanyahu was calling for creation of a ghetto state .
" He is proving there is no partner for peace in Israel , " Barghouti told CNN .
Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Netanyahu " left us with nothing to negotiate as he systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table . "
" He announced a series of conditions and qualifications that render a viable , independent and sovereign Palestinian state impossible , " Erakat said .
" This speech fell far short of every single one of the benchmarks required of Israel in line with international law and existing agreements , " he said , including the 2003 Roadmap for Peace .
Netanyahu 's speech , billed as a major statement on the peace process , follows President Obama 's recent high - profile speech to the Muslim world and a visit to the region by Obama 's Middle East envoy , former U.S. Sen.
George Mitchell .
Obama welcomed Netanyahu 's speech as " an important step forward " and said the president remained committed to a two - state solution that would ensure Israel 's security and provide the Palestinians " a viable state , " according to a White House statement .
Obama pledged to continue working with all parties " to see that they fulfill their obligations and responsibilities , " the statement said .
Netanyahu , of the center - right Likud party , previously refused to endorse a two - state solution .
Netanyahu sounded themes popular with his conservative followers , repeatedly referring to Israel as the Jewish national homeland and demanding recognition of that by all Arab foes , including the Palestinians , for any chance at a peace agreement .
He prompted applause with his statement that " the land of Israel is homeland to the Jewish people , and that is the basis of our right to it . "
" The Palestinian leadership must rise up and say in a very straight way that we are tired of this conflict , we will recognize the right of the Jewish people to have a national homeland in this part of the world , " Netanyahu said , according to the direct translation .
He said Jerusalem would remain the capital of Israel -- refusing to yield on a sensitive issue for Palestinians -- and that a Palestinian state would have to be fully demilitarized to ensure the safety of Israel .
Obama , in his June 4 speech in Cairo , Egypt , endorsed a two - state solution and urged compromise between " two peoples with legitimate aspirations . "
He repeated his call for both Israel and the Palestinians to fulfill all obligations under the 2003 Roadmap for Peace , including a halt to any expansion of West Bank settlements by Israel .
Obama called America 's bond with Israel " unbreakable " but said Palestinians have suffered in pursuit of a homeland .
He also called for an end to Palestinian incitement against Israel and greater security in Palestinian territories .
On Sunday , Netanyahu acknowledged the suffering on both sides from the continuing Middle East conflict , but insisted the roots of the conflict came from the Arab world 's refusal to accept Israel 's right to exist .

Tuesday , May 19 :
On “ The Hill ” at the Cheshire County Correctional Facility .
The Hill , as they call it , is working on the dairy farm , reportedly owned by the jail .
I was wrong in my original assumption .
According to the other prisoners , no milk from the farm is used at the jail , and it ’s sold at cost .
Here ’s where i gets interesting .
The farm is run by Dave Potnam , a local selectman for Westmoreland .
It appears at least on its surface to be another example of government granting monopoly privilege to the bureaucrats ’ friends and family – or themselves in this case .
I ’m left wondering what his management fee is for a farm that requires no personal investment of his own for equipment , seed stock , facilities , repairs , etc .
He gets the benefit of a paycheck – I wonder how much – without any of the risks other farmers take , while getting a never ending supply of free slave labor from the jail .
I sat down recently with Chris Wilber to recount his month long incarceration at the Cheshire County Caging Facility where he worked exclusively on The Hill .
The Prisoners assigned to work on the farm have hours that most would be hard pressed to find in the free market : 2:30 a.m. – 6:00 a.m. then 9 a. , . – 12 p.m. then 2:30 p.m. – 6 p.m .
With that daily schedule , you may be wondering when these guys are supposed to sleep .
Remember they ’re housed ina gymnasium where the lights are on from 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. , people working other shifts are coming in and out at all hours , the TV is on ; people are working out , playing cards , and talking , all in a gymnasium with no sound absorbing material .
As Wilber recounted his daily chores , I could n’t help but notice his badly stained yellow hand .
Wilber ’s job on the dairy farm is the bag washer .
After the milking device is removed , he washes the teat with a wet iodine cloth and dries them off with a separate cloth .
His hands are yellowed with iodine because the gloves are too short to keep his hands dry .
Wilber recounted his second day on the job at 2:30 a.m .
His pants , issued by the jail , were falling down because they fit poorly and did n’t have additional button holes cut to tighten them up .
Given that the only notice given to the prisoners is a call over the loudspeaker 30 minutes before starting a new work schedule , Wilber was dragging a bit adjusting to the night shift .
Potnam saw this and called Wilber a “ wannabe ghetto ass motherfucker that ’s never gonna get a real job . ”
Other laborers from The Hill describe Potnam as seemingly miserable and wanting everyone around him to be miserable too .
Potnam asked another laborer washing a cow , “ Does that feel like your mothers tit ? ” Chattel slaves in colonial America were treated with equal disdain and disrespect .
They were viewed as property to be used up and easily replaced if they became lazy or insubordinate in the eyes of their masters .
On Wilber ’s right arm was a visible bruise .
When asked about the cause , Wilber recounted being dragged by a cow that eventually kicked him in the arm .
He did n’t want to let go of the animal ’s collar for fear of punishment .
Anyone who displeases Potnam or any of the other task masters are lugged .
That means they ’re taken out in handcuffs where they may be sent to solitary confinement , have visits eliminated , goodtime – the up to 1/3 of a prisoner ’s sentence credited for good behavior – taken away , or commissary privileges removed .
Wilber says he ’s been kicked in the shoulder once and in the head on two other occasions .
The public lashings and brutality of chattel slavery is long gone , but the underlying mechanisms are still in place at the Cheshire County jail .
The best part , it ’s being done in your name
You are after all paying for this “ rehabilitation ” with your tax dollars .
In Peace ,

Lawmakers seeking to prevent a repeat of the greatest financial meltdown since the Great Depression are considering ways to impose tighter regulations on big investment banks , where trading of credit default swaps and other derivatives reached unsustainable levels , helping bring the economy to the brink of disaster in 2008 .
Although they are commonly described as a form of insurance against defaults on home mortgages , the credit default swaps sold by A.I.G. and other firms became so widespread and complex over the past decade that it became almost impossible for the banks themselves , let alone outside regulators , to sort out the real value of these popular investments or assess the risk .
The rise in trading of derivatives — sophisticated financial instruments whose value is derived from something else such as home mortgages — also underscores how far so many banks have strayed from what should be their main mission of providing lending to individuals and small businesses to help support growth in the general economy .
Critics note that derivatives trading escalated to a rapid back - and - forth exchange of paper certificates where the value often had little connection to real economic activity .
If “ Too Big to Fail ” and “ Too Connected to Fail ” have become the slogans justifying the repeated government bailouts of some major banks and insurers such as A.I.G. , these firms ’ continued resistance to tighter government restrictions might be summed up as “ Too Complex to Regulate . ”
That complexity is neither necessary nor useful , argue Robert Johnson , an EPI board member who previously served as managing director of Soros Fund Management as well as chief economist for the Senate Banking and Budget Committees ; and Sony Kapoor , a former investment banker who now heads the international think tank Re-Define ( Rethinking Development , Finance , and Environment ) .
In recent interviews , Johnson and Kapoor discuss how Wall Street uses extreme complexity as a shield to pad its profits and keep regulators guessing , and why banks need to return to the sort of activities that serve people on Main Street .
Q . The trading of derivatives and credit default swaps , which are at the core of the current economic instability , are often presented as something that is too complex for the average person to understand .
Why ?
Johnson :
They ( the banks ) make things hard to understand so they cannot be easily copied , which enables them to charge a higher profit margin .
Complexity in and of itself does n’t help them avoid regulation , but their declaration of instruments such as credit default swaps as stock when they are actually insurance contracts was a misnaming designed to avoid regulation .
Kapoor : Wall Street has a very strong incentive to make things as complex as possible .
Complexity is used as a tool to fool regulators and to avoid tax .
You set up new subsidiaries , you make new products that have n’t been addressed by regulations .
Regulators are very hard - pressed to get any information .
Q . It ’s been pretty well documented how the rise of credit default swaps contributed to the demise of some major investment banks .
How have they contributed to the pain much of the rest of the country is feeling in the form of lost jobs , lost homes , and general economic instability ?
Kapoor : Risk taking is essential to the creation of jobs and economic prosperity , but risks need to be taken by those who understand them and have the capacity to bear them .
But in pursuit of profits , the banks ended up sending the risks to nontransparent corners of the market , and to less sophisticated actors who did not understand the risk , and to entities such as pension funds that did not have the capacity to bear it .
Johnson :
There were two problems .
First , the credit default swaps were commonly treated as income , rather than as the equivalent of an insurance policy , which might have to be repaid .
And two , they were allowed to be written on third - party risks .
It was as if I were allowed to bet on whether someone else ’s house was going to burn down , which is not the way insurance usually works .
Q . At its peak , the size of the credit default swap market was $ 45 trillion .
How did it get so big ?
Johnson :
It got so big because there were no transactional costs and no regulation .
It was a completely unregulated market .
Q . What were the warning signs that should have been heeded ?
Kapoor :
When you have banks earning a 25 % return on equity in an economy growing at only 3 or 4 % , that is not just a warning bell , but a clanging fire alarm .
Everybody rationally knew it was not sustainable in the long run but as long as the music was playing , the banks were going to keep dancing .
It was not in their interest to stop , which is another reason you need regulation .
Johnson : Complexity was also a problem .
When you shock a system , complexity makes it difficult to assess the counter parties .
The other big institutions are also highly leveraged and you ca n’t assess whether they are solvent or insolvent .
They become un-analyzable .
They do n’t even know themselves .
When you have a situation where several big institutions are intertwined with each other and some are insolvent , there is a cascading effect that can make them all insolvent .
Q . What are your thoughts on the proposals put forth in the Obama administration to step up regulation ?
Johnson : I think it is a step in the right direction , but it is probably not sufficient .
The proposals for regulating over - the - counter derivatives favor the finance industry too much .
I understand they are also considering a form of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to oversee derivatives trading , which would be a move in the right direction .
Kapoor : A lot of people are saying , let ’s save the system first and then regulate .
But in my understanding , these two issues are inseparable .
Crisis came about because of a total breakdown of trust .
That issue of trust cannot be resolved by going back to business as usual .
Q . The history of Wall Street seems to be a series of financial scandals , followed by calls for stricter regulation , and then a scandal of a different sort arising a few years later .
Given the complexity on Wall Street , and bankers ’ strong interest in avoiding regulation , can we realistically expect anything to change for the better ?
What is needed to accomplish meaningful regulatory reform ?
Johnson : I would say that if you look at A Short History of Euphoria ( John Kenneth Galbraith ) , it makes the point that financial markets are treated like they are rational , and yet the history of markets is one of boom and bust and crash .
Many people prescribe remedies without accurately diagnosing the animal .
Understanding that markets do not behave rationally makes you realize that they need much greater regulation .
They need much greater capital set -asides .
Big banks should be like public utilities , where they perform a stable function .
Casinos and hedge funds ought to be separate from the banks .
In recent years , the banks used deposit insurance to get funds for their casinos .
Society has been subsidizing the funding of these institutions and their volatile , risky activities .
Kapoor : Subsequent to each crisis , the regulatory reforms that have happened have addressed the particular cause of that crisis .
None have addressed the fundamental instabilities that lie at the heart of finance .
It is remarkable not how much it crashes , but how little it crashes .
We need to increase competitiveness and reduce barriers to entry in the finance system so that we have more institutions that are not too big to fail .
We need a principle of diversity that prevents insurance firms , hedge funds , banks , a
nd Japanese housewives from engaging in all the same investing activities .
We also need reforms to bring about simplicity since the financial system left to itself will make more and more complex products designed to maximize profits and minimize regulation .
And we need more fairness : a system which in good times pays its fair share of taxes , so that in bad times , it does n’t take the economy down with it and make taxpayers , workers , and investors pay .
Finally , we need an accountable financial system where it is not good enough to say to politicians , to labor unions , and to Main Street that this is too complex and if you touch it , it will explode .
No one touched it , and it exploded anyway .
If it is too complex to understand , it is too complex for stability .

To date , most offshore wind farms proposed in the United States have been in the Northeast .
Cape Wind , a project off the shores of Cape Cod in Massachusetts , is awaiting a federal go - ahead , and similar ventures are in the offing near the coasts of Delaware , Rhode Island and New Jersey .
In the Southeast , too , “ offshore wind really represents a huge opportunity , ” said Brandon Blevins , the wind program coordinator for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy , whose recent report on renewables in the South includes offshore wind .
The Carolinas and northern Georgia have especially strong winds , he said .
Offshore wind power is expensive , and the projects have to date made more economic sense in places like the Northeast where power prices are already high .
The Northeast coast also has higher population densities , so there are more customers for the power .
And there is the small matter of hurricanes .
On the more positive side , said Mr. Blevins , the outer continental shelf extends at least 30 miles off the Southern coasts — and the relatively shallow water would make it easier to install turbines .
Off the coast , the winds blow strongly in the afternoons — a convenient time , because that is when Southerners crank up their air - conditioning .
The Southern Company , a large utility that is heavily reliant on coal , is currently applying for leases from the Minerals Management Service , a federal agency that oversees offshore wind power , to put up three towers that will collect weather data in the waters off Savannah , Ga. , according to Jason Cuevas , a company spokesman .
The Southern Company is also applying for a lease that would allow it to collect data on the wind along Florida ’s panhandle east of Penascola , Mr. Cuevas said .
South Carolina ’s energy office , along with the state - owned utility Santee Cooper and a local university , plans to put buoys off the state ’s coast to measure the weather .
The installation has been held up by choppy waves , but hopefully will go into the water in the next few weeks , said Laura Varn , a Santee Cooper spokeswoman .
And North Carolina is considering offshore wind near its Outer Banks .
Mr. Blevins said that federal energy and climate regulations would help drive development — particularly a potential national carbon emissions cap and renewable energy requirements .
As for costs , offshore wind is “ going to be cost - competitive with the new nuclear generation , ” he predicted .

Apparently , accommodationist - in - chief Andrew Brown has his own blog , and is now using it to make arguments even dumber than those appearing in his recent Guardian piece .
To wit : we athiests should be very careful about our tactics .
According to Brown , if we persist in equating acceptance of evolution with atheism , then we ’ll create a situation in which evolution can no longer be taught in the classroom .
After all , teachng atheism in the classroom is tantamount to a denigration of religion , which is illegal in American public schools :
I do n’t want here to get into a discussion about whether this [ whether atheists embrace the “ scientific worldview ” more fully than believers can ] is true .
Christianity at least does seem to require the acceptance of at least one miracle as the most important thing that ever happened in the universe and it ’s certainly reasonable for a scientist to reject this .
In any case , it ’s all part of a much bigger myth , which does far more than science can to explain the world : that of the triumph of reason , truth , and so forth over ignorance , superstition and stupidity .
Such myths are not dislodged by argument .
Already , I can hear the voices saying not all in the tones of E. L. “ But where ’s the evidence ? ” “ How can a scientist believe in miracles ? ” and so on .
But it is precisely at this point , which the new atheists consider their strongest and most unanswerable , that Ruse ’s argument takes effect .
Suppose we concede that the new atheists are right , and no true , honest scientist could be anything other than an atheist .
If that is true , the teaching of science itself becomes unconstitutional .
For it is every bit as illegal to promote atheism in American public schools as it is to promote religion .
Again , there are recent judgements from the heart of the culture wars to make this entirely clear .
. .
But the American courts have never been asked to decide whether science is the negation of religion : in fact the defenders of evolution and of science teaching in schools have gone to great lengths to ensure that the question was not asked .
The “ accommodationists ” whom Coyne so despises , have been brought out in all the court cases so far to say that that evolution and Christianity , science and religion , are perfectly compatible .
If the courts were asked to decide whether not whether ID was a religious doctrine , but whether evolution was a necessarily atheist one , and if they decided that Jerry Coyne and PZ and Dawkins and all the rest are right , then science teaching would become unconstitutional in American public schools .
They would , in short , have fucked themselves .
It ’s at times like this when I think I ’ve entered Cloud Cuckoo Land .
Does anybody seriously think that teaching evolution is a deliberate promotion of atheism ?
If so , I have n’t met any of them , and that includes P.Z. Myers and Richard Dawkins .
( Let me take that back — I ’ve met two : Brown and his compadre Michael Ruse .
Ruse once wrote that I should give my NIH grant back to the government because my research involves the unconstitutional promotion of atheism ! )
Actually , we teach evolution because it ’s a wonderful subject , explains a lot about the world , and happens to be true .
And yes , it ’s likely that teaching evolution probably promotes a critical examination of religious beliefs that may lead to rejecting faith .
But teaching geology , physics , or astronomy does that , too .
In fact , education in general leads to the rejection of faith .
( Statistics show that the more education one has , the less likely one is to be religious . )
Should we then worry about teaching physics , astronomy , or indeed , allowing people access to higher education , because those “ promote ” atheism ?
Should we constantly be looking over our shoulders because the courts may catch onto this ?
Well , American courts may be dumb , but even our benighted Supreme Court is more rational than Mr. Brown .
What Brown is really saying is that we should be worried about promoting rational values of any type , or any notion that beliefs require evidence .
He does n’t seem to realize the difference between cramming atheism down people ’s throats and teaching them to think , which may have the ancillary effect of eroding faith .
Clearly , both Ruse and Brown are willing to use any rhetorical tactic to decry atheism , no matter how mush - brained it is .
As I said in my last post about the Ruse / Brown twins , this smacks of desperation .
Rather than engage the serious arguments of scientist - atheists , they talk about our “ uncivil ” tone — and now about the horrible unforseen consequences of our supposed equation of evolution with atheism .
I repeat , so that Brown can get it : teaching evolution is NOT promoting atheism , it ’s promoting a scientific truth .
And the promotion of any scientific truth may have the ancillary effect of dispelling faith .
This is almost inevitable , for the metier of science — rationality and dependence on evidence — is in absolute and irreconcilable conflict with the with the metier of faith : superstition and dependence on revelation .
Too bad .
p.s. I look forward some day to Mr. Brown dropping the attacks on atheists and discussing , on their own merits , the assertions of the faithful .
Does he think Jesus was the Son of God , that God answers prayers , and that there is an afterlife ?
UPDATE : Over on Pharyngula , P.Z. Myers has posted his reaction to Andrew Brown ’s piece , “ In which Andrew Brown gets everything wrong . ”
It 's pure fantasy .
Robots wo n't ever actually rise up and go to war with humanity .
You know why ?
Because the robots of the future will be governed by Asimov 's three laws of robotics .
Advertisement
For those who do n't know what those are , know that sci - fi writer Isaac Asimov established three basic laws governing the programming of robots for his works , which later became almost canonical amongst other sci- fi writers , and which remain popular to this day .
Those three laws are :
1 . A robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm .
2 . A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings , except where such orders would conflict with the First Law .
3 . A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law .
Advertisement
Simple .
It 's a paper / rock / scissors sequence of programming that allows a robot to look after itself without ever inflicting harm upon a human — which will be good to know in the dark , distant future when there are robots advanced enough to require such programming !
For now , though , the closest things we have in the real world to the classic idea of a " robot " are automatic vacuum cleaners , giant arms that work on factory floors and bipedal toys wheeled out at Japanese robotics shows .
But what about video game characters ?
They 're governed by AI .
And , in many cases , incredibly complex AI , to the point where non-playable characters can behave more naturally than the robots in Asimov 's works .
So this being robot week and all , we decided to ask a few game developers what their versions of Asimov 's three laws were when coming up with gaming AI .
Jonny Ebbert , Relic , lead designer on Dawn of War 2 :
1 ) Fun before difficulty .
Always try to level the challenge appropriately at each level so that players feel good about playing .
So make your Easy A.I easy , and your Normal A.I. kind of easy .
Leave the sadism for Hard and Expert .
Advertisement
2 ) Add frailty but avoid stupidity .
A.I.s need to make mistakes for the player to exploit from time to time but they should n't look dumb doing it .
A.I 's are n't fun to play if they always trigger their abilities perfectly when they have the chance ( anyone old school enough to remember trying to Death and Decay a peon line against a Human AI ) , and they should n't always retreat at the perfect health level .
But they need to stay in the range of competency when they do make " mistakes . "
It 's a fine line to walk , but an important line .
3 ) Be a good teammate .
Try to support your teammate 's army when possible .
Help out your opponent 's base when it 's under serious attack .
Players love it when they see an A.I. that cares about how they 're doing .
They feel like they 're cooperating rather than playing next to something .
Advertisement
4 ) Cheat wherever you can .
A.I.s are handicapped .
They need to cheat from time to time if they 're going to close the gap .
5 ) Never get caught cheating .
Nothing ruins the illusion of a good A.I. like seeing how they 're cheating .

Matt Tonks , Epic , gameplay programmer on Gears of War 2 :
Simplest answer :
1 . Act smart until the player kills you .
Or , to be a bit more specific :
1 . An AI must value its own life ; take cover against threatening enemies , and avoid life - threatening situations .
Advertisement
2 . An AI should attack the most threatening enemy , unless we are threatened … in which case , see rule # 1 .
The friendly AI has a couple rules added to the top :
1 . A friendly AI should never get in the player 's way .
If you 're in the player 's way , get out of the way .
Advertisement
2 . A friendly AI should stay near its assigned squad leader ( usually the player ) .
And then the other rules :
3 . An AI must value its own life ; take cover against threatening enemies , and avoid life - threatening situations .

4 . An AI should attack the most threatening enemy , unless we are threatened … in which case , see rule # 3 .
Todd Howard , Bethesda , executive producer on Fallout 3 :
" I 'll give you one from the old Terminator games , since the new movie is coming out .
The Terminator cannot be reasoned with , can't be bargained with , and can not be stopped .
Unless of course he hits a chair , and since he can't path around it , we have him just start shooting . "
If you listen to Warner Bros ’ version of the back story behind The Hangover , this weekend ’s # 1 film and the third highest R- rated comedy opening , it sounds so very simple like a class in Hit Moviemaking 101 .
( And I ’m assured the total pay of all three lead actors does n’t even add up to the perk package that Will Ferrell had on Land of The Lost . )
So Hangover spec script is penned by the screenwriting team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore and gets to director Todd Phillips , who reads the screenplay and loves it and has a deal at the studio .
BenderSpink ’s Chris Bender then approaches Warner Bros SVP of production Greg Silverman with the script and director already in place .
Jeff Robinov , who has been / is a fan of Phillips , makes the deal .
“ It was one of those things that simply came together — a script , a director , and all the ducks were in a row , ” a WB source tells me .
Oh really ?
Well , here ’s what I first thought was the full and complete story of how The Hangover got made .
( And why was n’t any of the following mentioned in Sunday ’s New York Times story about New Line and Warner Bros ??
Now people are coming out of the woodwork to tell me there ’s still more missing info .
I ’ll keep updating .
But , for now , here ’s what I know :
It all started with Chris Bender who heard the story of how his Hollywood friend went mysteriously missing from his bachelor party in Las Vegas .
The pal ( photo , right ) was film producer Tripp Vinson ( The Guardian , The Number 23 , and now the Red Dawn remake ) who in 2002 was engaged to marry Endeavor motion picture lit agent Adriana Alberghetti .
Like always happens , the real facts do n’t quite match up with the movie .
There was no wedding scheduled that same weekend .
Instead , the bachelor party was held months earlier .
It consisted of 30 guys booked into the Hard Rock Hotel for a wild night of partying at a succession of Vegas restaurants , clubs and strip joints .
“ I remember being a drunken fool , as you ’re supposed to do at your bachelor party , and having a really good time with all my friends , ” Vinson told me .
“ But then I remember being a mess .
And when people are fucked up , crazy shit happens . ”
That ’s when Tripp went missing from his bash .
Even now , all Vinson knows is , “ I got separated from my friends , and I blacked out .
And when I was revived , I was in a strip club being threatened with a very , very large bill I was supposed to pay .
It was not a fun experience at the time , but it made for a funny story . ”
Bender thought it would make a great movie .
So he kicked the idea around with the Four Christmases writing team of Lucas and Moore who had a good working relationship with New Line .
So did Bender who produced both New Line pics Monster - In - Law and Just Friends , on which the writing pair did some uncredited work .
It turned out that New Line really wanted a Bachelor Party - set - in - Las Vegas movie , and SVP / COO Richard Brener wanted to buy the pitch for $ 750,000 .
Everyone was excited — but then New Line boss Bob Shaye threw up a roadblock : he said he ’d only buy it if the movie could be called , What Happens In Vegas .
But the phrase that relaunched Sin City proved a nightmare to purchase since so many people claimed to have come up with it .
When New Line could n’t clear the title , Shaye did n’t buy the film .
( In 2008 , 20th Century Fox used that title .
Clearly , it had better lawyers . )
The writers went off and wrote .
But by then they wanted a huge raise for the project .
New Line passed at that price ( as did every other studio ) — especially with 2 other bachelor party movies being fast - tracked at Universal .
So then the writers and BenderSpink decided to spec it out with the understanding that New Line would get first crack .
But when the spec was finished , CAA agent Gregory McKnight attached Old School director Todd Phillips to the project and slipped it to Warner Bros because Phillips had a first - look deal there .
At the time , Phillips ’ star was n’t very high : he ’d stumbled with Starsky & Hutch at Warner Bros , and been replaced as the director of Borat .
But Warner Bros nonetheless bought the spec script pre-emptively .
( My sources claim McKnight sold the script without Bender .
And it was only after Bender showed WB lawyers his email exchanges with Lucas - Moore that the studio finally agreed he ’d helped develop the concept . )
Then again , back in 2003 , the same Greg Silverman bought a pitch from Mark Perez for The Afterparty , in which a young man enjoys his Las Vegas bachelor party so much he can’t remember anything about it .
Then , as he and his fiancee make last - minute preparations for their big day , the strange characters he befriended during his lost weekend — including a chicken and a tiger — begin to make surprise appearances .
Silverman was to oversee the project .
Jamie Kennedy was attached .
Meanwhile , under Silverman ’s supervision , Phillips and Jeremy Gerelick ( The Break Up ) did a rewrite described to me as vast of The Hangover inserting the the baby , the tiger , Mike Tyson , the gangster , the cop car , and more .
( Some say the duo was “ robbed ” of a credit by the WGA arbitration . )
Bender after his armtwisting got a fee and an executive producer credit as a “ make - good ” .
New Line was left holding its dick .
And now Phillips has the sequel underway .
As for Tripp Vinson , he was n’t involved with the movie at all .
“ I was n’t even aware of it .
Once the spec went out , I became aware of it .
I know they embellished the story . ”
Nor did Warner Bros buy his life rights : he laughed when I told him a good lawyer could secure a trust fund for his kid .
As for Chris Bender , this is the 3rd time he ’s taken a real - life Hollywood producer ’s life story and put it on the big screen .
You may already know this , but Chris Bender claims American
Pie is based on his own high school experiences ( Jason Biggs plays Bender ) , and that ’s why Bender received a co-producer credit on the pic .
( However , others maintain that American Pie was based on the life of Adam Herz , the writer .
The original title was East Great Falls High , which was the high school Herz went to .
Bender helped Herz develop it . )
And Just Friends also was supposedly based on Bender ’s life and he got a producer credit on that , too .
Meanwhile , Warner Bros studio chairman Alan Horn is still trying to claim to the Los Angeles Times that all the credit for this movie goes to his studio , and to his little - liked No. 2 , Warner Bros .
Pictures Group President Jeff Robinov .
“ It was Jeff and his troops who got Todd Phillips involved [ No , that was CAA ] , allowed the movie to be R- rated [ It was always R- rated ] , and let Todd make the movie he wanted to make [ Because Robinov ca n’t do comedy to save his life , and at best it was exec Greg Silverman . ]
He clearly knew what he was doing . ”
Statements like this prove the old adage that you always know a mogul ’s lying because his lips are moving .
MUSIC NEWS - Know as one of rock 's first supergroups , David Crosby , Stephen Stills , and Graham Nash helped define the Woodstock generation through their harmonies , pointed resonant songwriting and deep commitment to political and social causes .
The trio is back touring this summer in the USA and Europe , with more dates to be added to the USA leg .
In between the late - spring North American and early summer European segments of the tour , Crosby , Stills & Nash will be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 18 in NYC , and in preparation for the tour , Rhino will release a behind - the - scenes look at the group 's early days with a collection of 12 previously unreleased demos recorded between 1968 and 1971 .
CROSBY , STILLS & NASH DEMOS is out June 2 from Rhino Records at all retail outlets ( order below ) .
MNN is thrilled to offer a first listen of three tunes !
( see after the break )
While many demos feature members performing solo , the opening cut includes all three harmonizing on the Nash - penned hit " Marrakesh Express , " recorded four months before the release of the trio 's debut in 1969 .
Crosby and Stills are heard on another song from that blockbuster album , " Long Time Gone . "
The two recorded the demo in June 1968 , just a few weeks before Nash joined the group .
Neil Young , whose arrival in 1969 launched CSN&Y , performs with Crosby and Nash on " Music Is Love , " a song the three cowrote that appeared on Crosby 's 1971 solo debut , If I Could Only Remember My Name .
Crosby lets loose with his " freak flag " on the anthemic " Almost Cut My Hair , " a track featured on the group 's 1970 # 1 album Déjà Vu. Stills performs unaccompanied on a 1968 demo of " My Love Is A Gentle Thing . "
Recorded in 1968 , the song was never released on a studio album , although a 1975 recording of the track did surface in 1991 on the boxed set CSN .

Hypertrophy - Specific
Training arose out of the research looking at both the stimuli and mechanisms for muscle cell hypertrophy .
Hypertrophy - Specific Training ( HST ) is based on physiological principles of hypertrophy first discovered in the laboratory .
These principles were then organized into a " method " of mechanically loading the muscle to induce hypertrophy .
Of course , translating these principles into applicable methods ( sets & reps & schedules ) brings in some possibility of error .
As the science continues to explore the exact mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy , this error will be whittled away .
I did n't start out knowing how muscles grew .
After all , it is a process that cannot be observed with the naked eye .
In the beginning I simply did what others were doing .
Then , I began reading muscle magazines and buying books .
Still , I was n't able to achieve the level of muscularity I saw so prominently displayed in the magazines .
For about 10 years I trained with all the popular training styles .
I made decent progress in the beginning but as time went by , I seldom saw changes in the mirror , at least not any I could get anyone else to notice .
But I continued to pursue the art .
As I entered college and graduate school , I finally had access to real research that was only just then beginning to take form .
The interest in muscle growth is fairly new in academic circles .
As I began to explore the research , it became clear to me that the routines and traditions I was exposed to as a bodybuilder were not based on physiological principles on a cellular level .
It was a " fantastic voyage " compared to the European - inspired global view of training .
At the microscopic level scientists were talking about things like " myogenic stem cells , " " growth - factors , " " mechanical loading , " " synergistic ablation , " " smeared Z- lines , " " MAPk / ERK " and many other things hidden to the naked eye .
All of these things were left out of the equation of traditional training routines .
As hypertrophy - specific research progressed in specificity it was clear that traditional training routines had stumbled across many important principles of load induced muscle hypertrophy , but because of their limited perspective ( volume and intensity ) they failed to capitalize on some critical truths exposed by research at the cellular level .
The principles of hypertrophy that HST is based on are as follows ( not an exhaustive list ) :
HST Principles
1. Mechanical Load
Mechanical Load is necessary to induce muscle hypertrophy .
This mechanism involves but is n't limited to , MAPk / ERK , satellite cells , growth factors , calcium , and number of other fairly understood factors .
It is incorrect to say " we do n't know how muscle grows in response to training . "
The whole point of the HST book is not to discuss HST , but to present the body of research explaining how hypertrophy occurs .
Then HST becomes a relatively obvious conclusion if your goal is hypertrophy .
2. Acute vs. Chronic Stimuli
In order for the loading to result in significant hypertrophy , the stimulus must be applied with sufficient frequency to create a new " environment , " as opposed to seemingly random and acute assaults on the mechanical integrity of the tissue .
The downside of taking a week of rest every time you load a muscle is that many of the acute responses to training like increased protein synthesis , prostaglandins , IGF - 1 levels , and mRNA levels all return to normal in about 36 hours .
So , you spend 2 days growing and half a week in a semi-anticatabolic state returning to normal ( some people call this recovery ) , when research shows us that recovery can take place unabated even if a the muscle is loaded again in 48 hours .
So true anabolism from loading only lasts 2 days at best once the load is removed .
The rest of the time you are simply balancing nitrogen retention without adding to it .
3. Progressive Load
Over time , the tissue adapts and becomes resistant to the damaging effects of mechanical load .
This adaptation ( resistance to the stimulus ) can happen in as little as 48 hours ( Repeated Bout Effect or Rapid Training Effect ) .
As this happens , hypertrophy will stop , though neural and metabolic adaptations can and may continue .
As opposed to hypertrophy , the foundation for the development of strength is neuromuscular in nature .
Increases in strength from resistance exercise have been attributed to several neural adaptations including altered recruitment patterns , rate coding , motor unit synchronization , reflex potentiation , prime mover antagonist activity , and prime mover agonist activity .
So , aside from incremental changes in the number of contractile filaments ( hypertrophy ) , voluntary force production ( i.e. strength ) is largely a matter of " activating " motor units .
4. Strategic Deconditioning
At this point , it is necessary to either increase the load ( Progressive load ) , or decrease the degree of conditioning to the load ( Strategic Deconditioning ) .
The muscle is sensitive not only to the absolute load , but also to the change in load ( up or down ) .
Therefore , you can get a hypertrophic effect from increasing the load from a previous load , even if the absolute load is not maximum , assuming conditioning ( resistance to exercise induced micro- damage ) is not to extensive .
There is a limit to the number of increments you can add to increase the load .
You simply reach your maximum voluntary strength eventually .
This is why Strategic Deconditioning is required for continued growth once growth has stopped ( all things remaining equal ) .
Utilizing Lactic Acid As A Stimulus For Tendon Repair / Health
Now HST incorporates a few other things such as higher reps ( for lactic acid ) to prepare the muscles and tendons for future heavy loads .
This serves as " regular maintenance " .
Without it , you increase your risk of chronic injuries and pain .
The metabolically - taxing reps enhance healing of strained tendons .
Compound Exercises
HST also suggests using compound exercises to maximize the effects of loading on as much muscle as possible per exercise .
Progressively Adjusting Reps To Accommodate Progressive Load
HST suggests that you use 2 - week blocks for each rep range .
Why ?
It has nothing to do with adaptation .
It is simply a way to accommodate the ever increasing load .
Of course , you could adjust your reps every week ( e.g. 15 , 12 , 10 , 8 , 5 , etc ) , but this is more complicated and people might not understand .
Often times , in order to communicate an idea you must simplify things , even at the expense of perfection .
If people can't understand it , they wo n't do it .
What good would that do or anybody ?
Then , over time , people figure out for themselves the other possibilities that exist within the principles of hypertrophy .
Low Volume Per Exercise ( average volume per week )
HST suggests that you limit the number of sets per exercise per workout to 1 - or - 2 .
This is based on " some " evidence that sets beyond the first " effective " set do little more than burn calories .
There is nothing wrong with burning calories , but when you get to be my age you just do n't have the exercise tolerance that you once did .
Using hormone replacement ( HRT ) therapy would of course , increase the number of sets you could do without undue stress .
Some may question the validity of HST not utilizing more than 1 - or - 2 sets per exercise .
The number of sets is set low to accommodate the frequency necessary to create an effective and consistent environment to stimulate hypertrophy .
Over the course of a week , the volume is n't that different from standard splits ( e.g. chest should tri , back bi , legs ) .
Comparing The Volume Of HST To Traditional Training Routines
Instead of doing 6 sets on bench in one workout , those sets are spread over the course of a week ( 2 on Mon , 2 on Wed , 2 on Fri ) .
Either way the muscle sees 6 sets each week , however , with HST the distribution of the loading sessions creates a consistent environment conducive to hypertrophy .
When you do all six sets at once , you put unnecessary drain on the central nervous system ( CNS ) and invite centralized overtraining symptoms and burnout .
Multiple Consecutive Eccentric Workouts
HST utilizes , when practical , eccentric workouts for 2 consecutive weeks .
This suggestion is only for exercises that can be performed in eccentric fashion without risk of injury .
Eccentric sets are performed with weight that exceeds their 5 rep max .
This is done to extend the progression in load , began at the beginning of the HST cycle , for an additional 2 weeks .
The fear of over training is no greater during these two weeks than previous weeks if volume is controlled for .
Recent research has demonstrated this .
( 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 , to name a few )
Clearly , the effects of eccentric muscle actions on muscle tissue are one of the most well researched subjects in exercise physiology .
As the research continues to explore the facets of load induced muscle hypertrophy , HST will apply the new knowledge and become even more effective .
For today , HST represents the state of the art and science of hypertrophy .
I have now used these principles myself , and have used them successfully to train competitive bodybuilders for some time .
It is not " specifically " designed for competitive track athletes , Powerlifters or Olympic lifters , although I have had many athletes from different sports apply HST to their off - season training with ground breaking results .
It is designed according to research looking specifically at muscle hypertrophy , not muscle performance .
This subject deserves a lot more attention than I am able to give it here .
I will cover the topic more thoroughly in the future , including the references that first shed light on the principles that gave rise to HST .
In the meantime , if you want to grow as fast as possible , you must apply currently know hypertrophy - specific training principles .

The authorities may succeed in quelling the street demonstrations .
But the crisis is far from over , especially as the ruling clergy quarrel among themselves
Reuters
THE roller - coaster that liberal - minded Iranians boarded as they agitated en masse against a suspect presidential poll seemed to hit the buffers on June 20th , when a banned demonstration was met with lethal force .
Millions of Iranians remain incensed by what they see as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's fraudulent victory over his main challenger , the reformist Mir Hosein Mousavi , in the election of June 12th .
But far fewer now seem ready to take the risk of venting their anger on the streets .
For all that , it may not take much to provoke another popular eruption .
A fresh spark may yet be provided by the unusually public struggle for dominance over the Islamic Republic that has erupted within the ruling clerical establishment itself .
The crisis may indeed be moving from the street to the back rooms of the mosque .
Aiming for a resolution of sorts , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , and the man who has the last say on all matters of state , issued a dramatic ultimatum in a sermon on June 19th .
Addressing a huge television audience , he dropped his customary pose of impartiality in electoral politics , siding with Mr Ahmadinejad and warning Mr Mousavi 's supporters that further street protests would lead to “ violence , blood and chaos . ”
To the surprise of many Iranians , who do not as a rule associate reformist leaders with political courage , Mr Mousavi refused to call off a demonstration that had been planned for the next day , nor did he retract his demand that the results be annulled and the election held again .
But the result was a pitifully unequal struggle between demonstrators hurling stones and tens of thousands of Revolutionary Guards and voluntary militiamen , known as the baseej , armed with truncheons , water - cannon and automatic rifles .
According to state - controlled media , a score of people have been killed .
Other reports put the figure much higher , and say that several hundred have been injured .
The government said that 40 brave baseej had been hurt .
Some residential areas in central Tehran resembled war zones .
The protesters have exalted the image of a beautiful young woman , Neda Agha Soltan , who was photographed in a demonstration in Tehran as she lay dying after being shot by an unknown assailant .
An edgy calm has now descended on the city .
Protests in Tehran and other towns , such as Isfahan , Kerman , Shiraz and Tabriz , which witnessed huge displays of public dissent after the election result was announced , have since got smaller , letting the authorities tackle the people they regard as instigators of the troubles .
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , a New York - based lobby , more than 40 journalists have been arrested since the elections and at least 450 political campaigners imprisoned , severely limiting the ability of Mr Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the lesser of the two reformist presidential candidates , who is also demanding fresh elections , to plan their next move or even communicate with their supporters .
Several senior colleagues of Muhammad Khatami , a reformist former president , have been arrested , along with at least a dozen journalists close to Mr Mousavi 's campaign , according to a website that is tracking events .
Fearing a backlash , the authorities have so far refrained from arresting Mr Moussavi or Mr Karroubi .
But they are laying the ground .
Mr Mousavi has been savaged by the pro-government media and accused of helping a banned opposition group , the People 's Mujahedin of Iran , which is particularly active in western Europe .
On June 21st the head of parliament 's judiciary committee said Mr Mousavi 's public statements constituted “ criminal acts ” .
Tehran police claim to have found evidence of co-operation between “ foreign elements ” and agitators operating from a building that was used by the Mousavi campaign .
Neither Mr Mousavi nor Mr Karroubi had much faith in the willingness of the Guardian Council , a watchdog body itself watched over by Mr Khamenei , to investigate fairly their allegations that Mr Ahmadinejad owed his landslide victory to fraud .
According to the Interior Ministry , the incumbent won 25 m votes out of 39 m cast , compared with 13 m for Mr Mousavi and a risible 300,000 for Mr Karroubi , a former speaker of parliament .
Scepticism is understandable : the council is in overall charge of running the elections , which means that it has been investigating itself .
Mr Mousavi says that the election was perverted by a multitude of procedural irregularities and by restrictions placed on his representatives ' legal right to monitor ballot boxes .
These allegations , which he put in writing , have had little effect .
On June 21st a spokesman for the Guardian Council announced that in 50 towns the number of ballots cast had exceeded the number of eligible voters .
But it was possible , he went on , that many people had voted outside their home towns .
The council may be preparing for a modest revision of the results , giving Mr Mousavi a few more votes , probably in a few days ' time .
But annulment , as Mr Khamenei made clear in his sermon , when he denied that the Islamic Republic “ goes in for betrayal in the matter of the people 's votes ” , seems out of the question .
Permitted little contact with their supporters , their precise whereabouts a matter of intense public speculation , Messrs Mousavi and Karroubi have managed at least to unnerve their opponents with their refusal to give up .
Mr Mousavi has described defenders of Mr Ahmadinejad as “ the proponents of a petrified , Taliban - style Islam ” and has dismissed the idea , first expressed by the supreme leader , that the agitation was driven by foreign enemies .
On June 24th Mr Karroubi defied a government ban by holding a wake for those who were killed in the violence four days earlier .
But it was violently broken up .
The real new fight is less visible
So the battle for the streets may inevitably be heading for victory for Mr Ahmadinejad and the ruling clerical establishment behind him .
But a titanic struggle behind the scenes , obscured by public events and often blurred by Tehran 's whirring rumour mill , may be just as crucial to the country 's future .
This pits Mr Khamenei against a wily former president who until recently was often regarded as the Islamic Republic 's second - most - powerful man , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
On the face of it , this struggle is also going the supreme leader 's way , as you would expect , since between them Mr Khamenei and his president hold the main levers of civilian and military power .
Mr Rafsanjani 's long silence since the election suggests he has been disheartened by the verbal attacks on him and by the arrest of several family members , including his daughter , a former parliamentary deputy , who has since been released .
Mr Ahmadinejad has made no secret that he longs to see Mr Rafsanjani and members of his family charged with corruption .
So complete is Mr Rafsanjani 's eclipse , at any rate for the time being , that information on his movements and intentions now consists of hearsay .
According to one account , he has been busy in the seminary town of Qom , canvassing senior clerics to back a move to sack Mr Khamenei .
Another suggests he may signal his surrender to the inevitable by attending Friday 's prayers , whereas he was conspicuously absent when Mr Khamenei gave his sermon on June 19th .
In jail or at home , Iran 's reformists must be rueing their mistakes .
It was Mr Rafsanjani , after all , who helped manoeuvre his old friend Mr Khamenei into the vacant supreme leader 's chair after the death of the revolution 's father , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , 20 years ago .
To that end , Mr Rafsanjani helped ensure the eclipse of Ayatollah Hosein Ali Montazeri , who had been Khomeini's heir apparent and who now , a fragile octogenarian , sends messages in support of Mr Mousavi 's cause .
Later , during the presidency of Mr Khatami ( 1997 - 2005 ) , reform - minded Iranians turned on Mr Rafsanjani with such venom that he failed even to win a seat in parliament in the elections of 2000 .
Have the liberals lost ?
The price of those misjudgments and divisions will be high .
Ever since the Islamic Republic was set up after the revolution of 1979 , revolutionary purists have had to tolerate another faction , culturally more liberal and latterly more open to relations with the West .
This lot is now being squelched .
Reuters
Khamenei ponders his supremacy
At what cost to Iran 's already tarnished image abroad ?
Thanks to their mobile telephones , the protesters have beamed the most gruesome images around the world .
France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , says the “ repression and violence ” is “ unacceptable ” .
Germany 's chancellor , Angela Merkel , has expressed support for “ the people in Iran who want to exercise their right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly . ”
Barack Obama , who had at first tried to stay aloof so as not to endanger his policy of detente with Iran , declared that he was “ appalled and outraged … by the threats , beatings and imprisonments ” being meted out .
The protesters , he said , were “ on the right side of history ” .
For the many people in Tehran who had hoped that Mr Obama would help usher in a bright new chapter in relations between Iran and the West , this is depressing .
Western criticism has bolstered those in Tehran whose instinct , at the first sign of trouble at home , is to seek foreign scapegoats .
At the top of the list comes Iran 's favourite bugbear , Britain .
Taking their cue from Mr Khamenei , who described Britain as “ abhorrent ” in his sermon , Iranian officials have accused Britain 's government of sinister manipulation of events .
Manuchehr Mottaki , Iran 's foreign minister , described in outlandish detail how Britain had flown in planeloads of spies ( he did not explain how they had cleared immigration ) ; he then expelled a brace of British diplomats .
Iran 's foreign - ministry spokesman has depicted two foreign - based satellite television channels , BBC Persian and the Voice of America , which have been transmitting images and comment to viewers in Iran , as part of an Israeli conspiracy to break the country up .
America 's choice
Mr Obama must now decide whether to let all this affect his efforts to engage Iran .
His aim is to persuade the country to forgo its contentious nuclear plan — or at least to modify it and throw it open to scrutiny .
Plainly , Israel 's hawkish prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , senses a chance to help kibosh an American diplomatic initiative that discomfited him from the start .
Some Iranians who cheered Mr Obama 's policy of engagement may have changed their minds .
Shirin Ebadi , a Nobel peace - prize laureate who is Iran 's best - known human - rights campaigner , has asked the European Union to freeze all political dialogue with Iran “ until the violence stops and fresh elections are held . ”
But Russia , which Mr Obama had hoped to draw into a coalition of countries tugging Iran towards respectability , is being awkwardly indulgent of Iran 's behaviour , with a foreign ministry spokesman calling the crisis an “ internal affair ” .
More predictably China has endorsed the election .
Unless Mr Khamenei dramatically changes heart or protests resume on an irresistible scale , reform - minded Iranians may again have to resign themselves to living without the limited democratic freedoms , including the right to elect a president from an albeit vetted field , that they had hoped to build on .
A political elite shorn of its reformist element may well bolster the authoritarian and militarist ways that Iranians are already seeing in embryo : baseej militiamen on every street corner ; a special court that is being set up to try arrested “ hooligans ” ; and senior military people muttering darkly about foreign threats .
In the longer term , however , many Iranian liberals think Mr Obama 's optimism will be vindicated .
The election campaign and the protests that followed have permitted Iranians to express themselves with a freedom they have not known since the revolution of 1979 .
They enjoyed the experience — and want more .
Further , the sight of infighting among leaders who were apparently united under the binding influence of Ayatollah Khomeini , has undermined the Islamic Republic 's claim to legitimacy , and still more its claim to sanctity .
“ That idol has been smashed , ” said a commentator in Tehran .
In any event , Mr Mousavi 's campaign is going on .
If he is arrested , his supporters say they will call a general strike .
At night , people around the country gather on their rooftops to shout “ Allahu Akbar ! ” ( “ God is Great ! ” ) , a call dating back to the 1979 revolution that Mr Mousavi 's people have made their own .
And many Iranians will fondly recall the post-election march on June 15th that as many as 2 m people attended .
It was impeccably well - behaved , good - humoured and entirely self - policed .
In the words of one Iranian who attended , “ Before then I had lost my faith in being Iranian .
We were becoming selfish , turning in on ourselves .
But that march seemed to change everything .
It ca n't have been a dream — can it ? ”
In April 1990 , a tin can the size of a school bus was dropped off 353 miles above the Earth ’s surface .
Its mission :
Take clear pictures of the universe without interference from the planet ’s atmosphere .
Nineteen years later , NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope has transmitted hundreds of thousands of spectacular images to astronomers back home .
From far - away stars and neighboring planets to evidence of dark matter and the precise age of the universe , these photographs have allowed us to see what once existed only in scientists ' computations .
Saturday afternoon , friend of the show Danny Hurley sent word that they were offering quite the Father 's Day gift out at Addison Airport -- flights on a B - 24 Liberator , where everyone calls shotgun .
( Pretty cool too , as only two Liberators are still flying ) .
Danny wanted to go out and shoot some photos of the circa - ' 44 bomber and the men who ponied up for the ride ; I told him sure , go ' head , sounds great -- very heartwarming .
And , sure enough , he got some awfully nice shots and stories to go with them , as among those taking part yesterday were two men treating their terminally ill stepfather , a Vietnam vet , to a spin in the sky that might just be his last .
Danny was collecting several such tales .
But when he sent along his pictures -- which you can see in this terrific slide show -- he noted that , well , he sure wishes he could 've come back with more , " but my day was cut short . "
How so ?
Well , his version of the day 's events follow after the jump .
But I ''ll provide this small hint : the Department of Homeland Security .
Which , if you 've ever met Danny , is hilarious .

So , anyway .

A heatwave warning has been issued for England and Wales , with temperatures in some areas potentially rising as high as 32C ( 90 F ) in the coming days .
The Met Office says London , the east and south - east of England will be the hottest areas , both by day and night .
Warm and humid weather is also forecast throughout the rest of the UK , with a risk of thundery showers .
The Department of Health has asked people to check on elderly friends and family who may suffer in the heat .
NHS staff have also been warned to prepare for a surge of elderly and ill patients suffering from the heat .
Hospitals could be asked to set up emergency " cool rooms " and hand out cold drinks as part of a string of measures set down in the Government 's official heatwave plan .
The Met Office said Monday has been the hottest day of the year so far , with Charlwood , in Surrey , recording a temperature of 28.4C .
Temperature threshold A heatwave is officially declared when temperatures rise above a certain threshold .
These thresholds vary by region , but the UK average is 30C by day and 15C overnight .
People with respiratory problems should stay inside during the hottest part of the day
Department of Health spokesman
Ten ways to beat the heat
Hot weather risks
The Met Office says there is a 70 % chance of these temperatures being reached in London , the South East and eastern England this week .
An official heatwave is also possible throughout the rest of England and Wales , but the likelihood is lower - for example , 60 % in the Midlands and 40 % in north - east England - where temperatures in the mid- and upper - 20s are most likely .
Helen Chivers , from the Met Office , said : " Thursday looks like it will be the hottest day of this spell . "

In southern Scotland , 22C to 23C is expected , possibly rising to 25C later in the week .
Highs of about 20C are likely in the northern isles .
In Northern Ireland , Wednesday looks set to be the hottest day , reaching 23C .
The high temperatures will be accompanied by high humidity and heavy , thundery showers , the BBC Weather Centre said , with western areas likely to see the wettest weather .
Keeping cool Various parts of England were hit by severe thunderstorms on Saturday night .
In Birmingham , a 17 - year - old boy suffered a cardiac arrest and five others were hurt in a lightning strike .
Officials had already said this summer may be warmer than the past couple of years .
With climate change , heatwaves are likely to become more common over the next few decades and the chief medical officer has warned of an increase in deaths in times of hot weather .
The Department of Health has advised people to keep their homes as cool as possible and said remembering the needs of friends , relatives and neighbours who could be at risk was essential .
Older people , especially those on medication , can often find coping with the heat particularly difficult
Age Concern " Windows should be kept shaded and closed when the temperature is hotter outside than inside .
" People with respiratory problems should stay inside during the hottest part of the day , " a DoH spokesman said .
Other advice in the government 's heatwave plan includes to drink cold drinks such as water or fruit juice regularly and avoid hot , caffeinated drinks like tea and coffee , as well as alcohol .
Help the Aged and Age Concern welcomed the advice .
A spokesman said : " Older people , especially those on medication , can often find coping with the heat particularly difficult . "
Pets ' charity
The Blue Cross warned owners that animals could also suffer in hot weather .
Chief vet Caroline Reay said : " Never leave pets in a car or enclosed warm space .
Just a few minutes , even with an open window , can be fatal to animals . "

MULTIMEDIA : Annabel Crabb on Peter Costello's life and times .
---------------------------------------------
But his decision will be a relief to Malcolm Turnbull , whose leadership has been dogged by constant rumour that Mr Costello was stalking him .
Mr Costello will serve out the remainder of the term on the backbench , where he moved after declining the leadership at the last election .
" I will continue to be involved in public policy - particularly at the international level - through my engagement on the International Advisory Board of the World Bank , '' he said .
" I would like to thank my constituents and the electors of Higgins for the privilege of representing them in seven Commonwealth Parliaments .
Three of those terms have been in Opposition and four in Government . ''
Mr Costello said many of his constituents and other Australians had urged him to continue in federal politics .
" Nevertheless my view is that it is time to pursue other interests , '' he said , adding that was his view after the coalition lost the 2007 federal election .
That loss brought to an end Mr Costello 's 11 year reign as the nation 's treasurer .
Mr Costello wished federal Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull and his deputy Julie Bishop well and " every success ' ' at the next election .
He also paid tribute to former leader Brendan Nelson .
Mr Costello , considered heir apparent to former prime minister John Howard , opted not to seek the party leadership after the 2007 election .
Mr Turnbull used parliament to praise Mr Costello 's contribution to the nation , saying he stood on the side of freedom and enterprise .
" Peter Costello for his years in this parliament - 20 years - has stood on the side freedom and enterprise , " Mr Turnbull told parliament on Monday .
" He has served our nation well , we salute him and thank him for service . "
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said it was an important day for Mr Costello .
" It should be marked appropriately , '' he told parliament , praising the former treasurer for his significant role in the formation of the G20 finance ministers group .
He also acknowledged Mr Costello 's role in addressing the Asian financial crisis , adding it had helped Australia 's relationships with its neighbours .
" They were correct decisions in the national interest . ''
Mr Rudd described Mr Costello's career in public life as " quite extraordinary ' ' and wished he and his family well for the future .
Mr Costello thanked both Mr Turnbull and Mr Rudd for their thoughts , saying he did n't think he would see the day when both sides of the parliament would say nice things about him .
" It is just possible both sides of the dispatch box are happy with the announcement I 've made , '' he said .
" It is a very nice thing to actually come here and not be quite departed and hear the kind of speeches one hears as eulogies .
In fact , I might come back tomorrow , I 'm enjoying it so much . ''

After five years of legal maneuvering and orchestrated protests from the Lobby ’s amen corner , Israel ’s point men in Washington have finally succeeded in their efforts to quash the prosecution of Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , who had been charged with committing espionage on behalf of Israel .
It is a victory that not only signals the continuation of the Lobby ’s dominance in Washington , in spite of growing popular revulsion against lobbyists in general , but also gives the Israelis a blank check to spy on their American patrons to their hearts ’ content .
The hosannas being sung by the Lobby ’s media echo chamber – the Washington Post , the neocon blogosphere , and the official conservative movement represented by National Review and the Weekly Standard – are all about " vindication . "
That is the word used by Jeffrey Goldberg , The Atlantic ‘s Israel - centric columnist , to describe the decision to drop the charges , but – as usual – his interpretation of the facts leaves much to be desired .
The statement [ . pdf ] from the prosecutors avers that the case was dropped due to the success of the " graymail " strategy pursued by the defense .
The government had to consider " the likelihood that classified information will be revealed at trial , any damage to the national security that might result from a disclosure of classified information and the likelihood the government would prevail at trial , " as well as the " changed landscape " of the case , a reference to the many rulings by judge T.S. Ellis that forced prosecutors to delay going to trial for five years .
After a long , drawn - out process of legal back - and - forth , the judge had set up the trial as a veritable three - ring circus , upholding defense subpoenas issued to such notables as Condoleezza Rice , Stephen J. Hadley , and a whole host of former and current U.S. government officials , who would have been dragged into the courtroom and closely questioned about highly classified intelligence matters .
Ellis also granted defense motions to include a wide range of classified information , including documents – the idea being to make the U.S. government spill the secrets the Israelis stole , via Rosen , Weissman , and their co-conspirator Larry Franklin , a former top analyst at the Pentagon whose specialty is Iran .
Franklin pled guilty to espionage charges in 2005 and was sentenced to 12 years in the hoosegow plus a substantial fine .
His handlers , however , have escaped , not only unscathed but hailed by the Lobby and its friends as persecuted heroes .
Yet the confession , conviction , and sentencing of Franklin stand as the perfect rebuke to the AIPACers ’ claims of " vindication . "
If no crime was committed , then why not free Franklin ?
This is precisely what his defenders have advocated , yet it wo n’t happen for the very good reason that the charges against Franklin stand , along with his confession and his punishment , as testimony to the fact that a real crime was indeed committed .
One merely has to read the indictment to see that : at one clandestine rendezvous of the Rosen - Weissman - Franklin spy cell , they moved the venue to three different restaurants in the course of a single meeting .
They were afraid – rightly , as it turned out – they were being followed , because they knew they were committing a crime .
Yet this knowledge , according to the judge in this case , was n’t enough to establish their guilt .
What government prosecutors had to prove , Ellis ruled , is that the defendants intended to harm the U.S. and its national security interests , consciously and deliberately , a uniquely narrow standard that does n’t seem to apply to any other statute on the books .
The closest is " hate crimes " legislation , which purports to read the minds of the perpetrators of violent acts and directly perceive their motives .
The Ellis doctrine , if you will , applied to laws against espionage means the subjective perceptions of the accused , not their objectively verifiable actions , are the key to determining whether or not a crime has been committed .
Did Rosen and Weissman hand over top - secret U.S. intelligence to Israeli government officials , yes or no ?
Well , yes , but … they thought they were defending the " real " interests of the U.S. by doing so , since , as we all know , U.S. and Israeli interests are always and forever identical .
From this perspective , Rosen , Weissman , and certainly Franklin were just misguided " idealists " who perhaps went a little too far , but their hearts , after all , were in the right place .
What this decision means is that espionage has been legalized , for all intents and purposes , as long as it is engaged in by Israel – and not , say , Iran , Russia , or China – and insofar as these fifth columnists - cum - lobbyists take pains to argue that they ’re doing it for our own good .
This was precisely the argument made by Franklin ’s lawyers before he made a deal with the government to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for leniency : that he handed over classified information to Rosen , Weissman , and at least two Israeli government officials , out of " patriotism , " because he thought U.S. policy was n’t pro-Israel enough .
Judge Ellis displayed his sympathy for this " misguided idealist " ploy when he commended Franklin [ . pdf ] for having the purest of motives even as he handed down the sentence .
If we look at the concerted efforts undertaken by the Israelis and their American adjunct organizations to influence U.S. policymaking , especially when it comes to the Middle East , as a covert action operation – a focused campaign involving both Israeli and American components – then it surely has to go down in the annals of spycraft as one of the most successful in history .
The consequence of this case is that Israeli agents – of whatever citizenship status – can now move freely over the boundaries between lobbying and espionage , with nary a worry about being held accountable .
Israeli spying in the U.S. is a subject the American media has not dared cover .
Except for Antiwar.com and a few other sources , coverage of the Rosen - Weissman case has been sketchy to nonexistent .
It was n’t until the Harman affair blew up in the Lobby ’s face and captured headlines for a while that anyone even remembered it : in the news business , five years is an eternity .
Yet the significance of this case and its far - reaching implications for U.S. - Israeli relations would seem to dictate a different level of coverage .
That famous four - part Fox News report on the surprising extent of Israel ’s covert activities in the U.S. underscores the dangers of granting this type of access – particularly when it seems to be almost entirely a one - way deal .
In addition , the dismissal of all charges against Rosen and Weissman means that the rest of the spooks who haunt Washington will be further emboldened .
After all , if it is okay for the Israelis to mine the corridors of power for vital U.S. secrets , then why not them ?
Whether the Justice Department will give the Chinese , say , the same sort of kid-gloves treatment as is now being afforded to Israel ’s American agents remains to be seen .
Somehow , I doubt it , yet one wonders how they ’ll go about legalizing such a glaring double - standard .
Espionage in an ordinary state is an easily recognizable crime : it involves stealing closely guarded information , which the government classifies as " top secret , " and passing it on to foreign governments , deliberately and with aforethought .
The U.S. , however , is no ordinary state .
Washington , D.C. , is the Imperial City , the capital of a world empire , where the trading of insider information is the chief industry .
With foreign lobbyists gathered at the foot of the throne , all clamoring for attention , any and every means to gain favor and influence at court is used , and then some .
The Americans , who decide the fate of nations with a single decree , find themselves invaded by supplicants whose methods are increasingly aggressive – and successful .
To be besieged by them is part of the price of empire .
As Garet Garrett warned half a century ago : " There is no security at the top of the world " – no , not even when it comes to guarding the nation ’s most closely held secrets .
We have become , as Garrett predicted , a prisoner of our own satellites : " No Empire is secure in itself , " he wrote , in 1952 , " its security is in the hands of its allies . "
In the case of our increasingly troublesome ally , Israel , this is now literally true : in dropping the charges against Rosen and Weissman – and allowing AIPAC , the organization for which they worked and which served as a cover for illegal activities , to function without registering as a foreign agent – we have handed them the keys to the safe deposit box wherein our most vital secrets lie .
The decision to drop this case was clearly made at the top , not by the local prosecutors .
Indeed , there was reportedly an energetic internal debate .
The lawyers for Rosen and Weissman , for their part , clearly credited the Obama administration for the decision to quash the case , as the Washington Post reported :
" Lawyers for Rosen and Weissman attributed the withdrawal of the case in part to the Obama administration .
‘ We are extremely grateful that this new administration … has taken seriously their obligation to evaluate cases on the merits , ’ the lawyers , Abbe D. Lowell , John Nassikas , and Baruch Weiss , said in a statement . "
While there is no direct evidence of any involvement by the White House , we have every reason to take this statement at face value .
The idea that this was a decision made solely by prosecutors , over the strenuous objections of the FBI agents on this case , is further debunked by a New York Times account , which pointedly qualified routine denials of political interference :
" Several other officials said , however , that while senior political appointees at the Justice Department did not direct subordinates to drop the case , they were heavily involved in the deliberations .
These officials said David S. Kris , the newly appointed chief of the department ’s national security division , and Dana J. Boente , the interim United States attorney in Alexandria , had conferred regularly with prosecutors and ultimately decided to accept the recommendation to abandon the case .
Attorney General Eric H. Holder was informed and raised no objections . "
Whether this case was dropped because it became a trading card in Obama ’s increasingly contentious relations with the Israelis or because it was the victim of Israel ’s increasingly aggressive intervention in American politics we ’ll leave for future historians to decide .
What is clear , at this point , is that it is now effectively legal for AIPAC and its allies to function quite openly as an intelligence - gathering entity for the Israeli state .
The line between lobbying and espionage has been erased , at least as far as Israel ’s activities in the U.S. are concerned .
I love a good conspiracy .
This one , involving Great Depression - era businessmen attempting to overthrow President Roosevelt in a military coup , just about beats them all :
In the summer of 1933 , shortly after Roosevelt ’s “ First 100 Days , ” America ’s richest businessmen were in a panic .
It was clear that Roosevelt intended to conduct a massive redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor .
Roosevelt had to be stopped at all costs .
The answer was a military coup .
It was to be secretly financed and organized by leading officers of the Morgan and Du Pont empires .
This included some of America ’s richest and most famous names of the time :
* Irenee Du Pont – Right - wing chemical industrialist and founder of the American Liberty League , the organization assigned to execute the plot .
* Grayson Murphy – Director of Goodyear , Bethlehem Steel and a group of J.P. Morgan banks .
* William Doyle – Former state commander of the American Legion and a central plotter of the coup .
* John Davis – Former Democratic presidential candidate and a senior attorney for J.P. Morgan .
* Al Smith – Roosevelt ’s bitter political foe from New York .
Smith was a former governor of New York and a codirector of the American Liberty League .
* John J. Raskob – A high - ranking Du Pont officer and a former chairman of the Democratic Party .
In later decades , Raskob would become a “ Knight of Malta , ” a Roman Catholic Religious Order with a high percentage of CIA spies , including CIA Directors William Casey , William Colby and John McCone .
* Robert Clark – One of Wall Street ’s richest bankers and stockbrokers .
* Gerald MacGuire – Bond salesman for Clark , and a former commander of the Connecticut American Legion .
MacGuire was the key recruiter to General Butler .
* Prescott Bush — Wall Street executive , US senator
The plotters attempted to recruit General Smedley Butler to lead the coup .
They selected him because he was a war hero who was popular with the troops .
The plotters felt his good reputation was important to make the troops feel confident that they were doing the right thing by overthrowing a democratically elected president .
However , this was a mistake : Butler was popular with the troops because he identified with them .
That is , he was a man of the people , not the elite .
When the plotters approached General Butler with their proposal to lead the coup , he pretended to go along with the plan at first , secretly deciding to betray it to Congress at the right moment .
( More )
It reads like a hoax , but was it ?
I ’d like to hear from history buffs regarding the veracity of this story .
I also found the story pertinent because the government is engaged in its biggest economic rescue since FDR .
If high - powered politicians and businessman were able to band together in an attempted coup then , what ’s stopping them now ?
Better surveillance , perhaps ?
A more centralized government ?
Right now , the political consequences of the Great Recession remain unknown .
However , I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to imagine extreme outcomes , especially if economic conditions linger long enough .

US cancer teen ' to get treatment '
Prosecutors said Daniel could flee from treatment again
The parents of a US teenager who ran away with his mother after refusing treatment for cancer have said he can now be given chemotherapy .
Daniel Hauser , 13 , has Hodgkin 's lymphoma and had been warned that he would die without medical attention .
But his mother , Colleen , had said her religious beliefs meant she wished to treat his cancer with natural methods .
A judge had ordered Daniel to be placed in foster care but repealed the order on condition that he receive treatment .
Mrs Hauser told a court hearing in Brown County that she now believed chemotherapy was the best option for her son , reported the Associated Press news agency .
Judge John Rodenberg said Daniel should remain with his parents but that " this course of chemotherapy has to commence and commence soon " .
These folks have had a history of changing their minds
James Olson , Brown County Prosecutor
" Danny loves his parents and they love him .
He 's a fine boy , a very pleasant young man , " he said .
" I know he should be in the custody of his parents - as long as I 'm satisfied they are going to follow the prescribed course of treatment . "
But county prosecutors objected to the withdrawal of the earlier custody order , saying they were concerned the family could pull out of treatment again .
" These folks have had a history of changing their minds , " said Brown County prosecutor James Olson .
Nationwide search Daniel underwent one round of chemotherapy in February , but stopped after that single treatment , citing religious beliefs .
He and his mother failed to attend a court hearing last Tuesday after a court - ordered X - ray showed Daniel had a tumour in his chest .
After a week - long nationwide search , the pair surfaced in California and returned to Minnesota on a charter flight .
" They wanted to get together with their family , they wanted to be home , " said Brown County Sherriff Rich Hoffmann .
He said Daniel was " immediately " given a full medical check .
Defence lawyer Jennifer Keller said she understood Mrs Hauser now intended to " abide by whatever orders the court makes " .
But she told America 's ABC News that Mrs Hauser " also wanted to put her best case forward for her son to have a chance at alternative treatment " .

" PEOPLE ARE being kept alive . "
It was one of the first things that John Ging , the director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) in Gaza told us .
It 's a pretty accurate description of the conditions in Gaza , four months after the end of Israel 's Operation Cast Lead , which left 1,400 dead , over 5,000 wounded and at least 40,000 homeless .
People are being kept alive -- and that 's about all .
Four months after the cease - fire , not a brick has been rebuilt in Gaza .
Thousands of buildings -- from the Palestinian parliament building ( heavily damaged ) and presidential residence ( obliterated ) , to the Islamic University , the American School , Al Quds Hospital ( hit with white phosphorus ) and thousands of homes , shops , factories and police stations -- stand exactly as they were on January 18 , the last day of the war .
This is not due to a lack of money or resources .
As John Ging pointed out , millions of dollars of aid has been pledged to Gaza from governments and NGOs around the world .
But Israel 's medieval siege of Gaza keeps out everything but the most subsistence level of food and medicine .
The result is that while you wo n't find mass starvation in Gaza , you wo n't find any semblance of normal existence either .
The American School in Gaza was destroyed during Israel 's onslaught ( Laura Durkay | SW )
Our delegation -- 65 American and international activists representing 10 nationalities and 18 U.S. states -- traveled to Gaza from May 30 to June 4 to witness the destruction from what Palestinians call " the last war , " and to deliver aid to some of Gaza 's children , who make up more than half of the 1.5 million residents of this tiny , besieged piece of land , less than half the size of New York City .
We chose to deliver toys , art supplies and playground equipment after hearing that Israel had turned away a UNICEF shipment of these items in March , claiming that they were not a " humanitarian necessity . "
EVERYWHERE WE went in Gaza , two things stood out to us : on the one hand , the deliberate , calculated and intentional brutality of the war and the Israeli occupation and siege ; and on the other , the incredible generosity , kindness and determination of ordinary Palestinian people .
In some places , the level of destruction was mind - numbing : Izbet Abd Rabbo , in the north , where every house has been mined and collapsed ; Abasan , so close to the border with Israel that our UNRWA guides refused to let us out of the bus ( it 's awful to see them so afraid on their own land ) ; Khoza 'a and Sufa nearby , where we walked among indistinguishable piles of rubble , each of which used to be someone 's home .
What you can do Laura Durkay has written more stories and posted photos of her trip to Gaza at her Laura on the Left Coast blog .
For more on Code Pink 's past and future delegations to Gaza and around the world , visit the Code Pink Web site .
The organization Viva Palestina U.S. is leading a convoy to Gaza this summer ; it will leave on July 4 .
See the Viva Palestina Web site for information , or telephone 773-226-2742 .
We quickly learned that although there is supposedly a cease - fire in effect , " cease - fire " is a relative term in Gaza - - and it means that Palestinians are to cease firing while Israel does what it wants .
Driving along the coast road from Rafah to Gaza City , we could clearly see Israeli gunboats on the horizon .
During the day , they harass and shoot at fishermen trying to make a living in Gaza 's waters , and at night , they sail close to shore and shell the coastline .
Shelling , machine - gun fire and drones flying overhead are a nightly occurrence .
In just one of the five nights that we were in Gaza , five refugee camps were shelled , with one person ( a mother in her 20s ) killed and six others wounded .
Even in places that were spared pulverization by tanks and F - 16s , the grinding weight of the siege is palpable .
When we arrived at Al Shifa Hospital , the largest hospital in Gaza , the first thing the director did was apologize for the stifling heat -- the hospital had no electricity , and their generators lack the capacity to run both the emergency medical equipment and the air conditioning .
The main building at Al Shifa also lacks a working elevator , since parts for every conceivable piece of machinery are impossible to obtain .
Patients ' family members must carry them up the stairs .
We were shown a room full of dialysis supplies , many of the boxes dented from rough handling by Israeli inspectors .
This is one day 's supply , we were told , and there are no reserves .
Often , the hospital receives medical supplies that are deliberately damaged or that expired while being held up at the crossings too long .
Most of the buildings at Al Shifa are crumbling and dilapidated , but one is shiny and new : a pristine oncology and radiation therapy center paid for by a Saudi prince .
But it sits empty and unused -- the material needed to run the radiation machines is not allowed in .
Because no society can possibly function on what Israel legally allows into Gaza , people have found ways to compensate -- most notably , with a booming smuggling trade that operates via the hundreds of tunnels , most 50 feet deep and up to a kilometer long , that run under the border with Egypt .
Remember the generators at Al Shifa Hospital ?
One hundred percent of the fuel to run them comes through these tunnels -- along with numerous everyday goods , from produce , bottled water and packaged foods to small appliances , computers and auto parts .
We visited the tunnels on our last day in Gaza and were shocked to discover that they are not hidden at all -- in fact , they 're quite out in the open , with people ( including many children and teenagers ) working in them in broad daylight .
The tunnels get bombed on a regular basis , but seeing how clearly visible they are , the obvious question we had was :
Why does n't Israel bomb every single one ?
It was n't until we took a minute to think like occupiers that we understood .
Bomb all the tunnels , enforce starvation , and you risk mass revolt .
Bomb just enough to keep those who work in the tunnels afraid for their lives at every moment , to keep the risk -- and by association , the prices -- high , and you have the perfect recipe for collective punishment .
I can't think of a better definition of terrorism than that .
GIVEN THE incredible privation and danger that passes for daily life in Gaza , it would n't have surprised me to find bitterness , anger , even hatred toward Americans since the U.S. government funds and arms Israel to the teeth .
But we were continually stunned by the overwhelming friendliness , hospitality and generosity shown to us by every single Gaza resident we met .
Many Gazans speak excellent English , but even those who do n't seem to know one word : " Welcome . "
I lost track of the number of people -- from the mayor of Rafah to the many incredibly dedicated members of the UNRWA staff who took us around Gaza - - who told us without affectation that we were their brothers and sisters , and assured us that we now had a home in Gaza for the rest of our lives .
This warm welcome extended right up to the representatives of the Hamas government we interacted with , who treated us like diplomats -- which , in a certain sense , we were , since no one from the U.S. government is currently taking up that role .
At the end of our over - scheduled first full day in Gaza , we were greeted with a hasty announcement : " Freshen up , we 're going to parliament ! "
In the courtyard of the bombed - out Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) building , under a huge white UNICEF tent , our grubby , sweaty and tired delegation received the closest thing Gaza has to an official state welcome , including greetings from Ahmad Bahar , the acting head of the PLC .
Now , whatever your opinion of Hamas , could you imagine the speaker of parliament in any other country in the world taking time out of his or her schedule to roll out the red carpet ( literally ! ) for a scruffy bunch of antiwar activists ?
But if a red carpet welcome from Hamas - - for our delegation of mostly women , led by Medea Benjamin , an American Jew - - was not what many of us expected , it was nothing compared to the next night , when three Hamas MPs came back to our hotel to spend an hour and a half with us discussing politics , covering everything from the legitimacy of armed resistance under international law , to the Hamas - Fatah rift , to one - state versus two - state solutions .
Or the night after that , when Huda Naim , a female member of parliament for Hamas , brought several dozen of her female party comrades to discuss women 's lives in Gaza with us -- and what fierce and fearless women they were !
" I left my house at seven this morning , and I have n't been home since , " a woman who works in the Ministry of Education told us proudly ( this was around seven at night ) .
She lives in Khan Younis and had traveled 20 kilometers to Gaza City to meet us .
I particularly remember a young woman who was on the student council at the Islamic University of Gaza .
Her brother , an 18 - year - old volunteer medic , was killed while on duty during the war .
Since his death , she has become even more determined to finish her studies and start the business they dreamed of opening together .
" They killed my brother , " she said simply , " but they can't kill our dreams . "
By the end of the trip , we started joking that we had now met with Hamas more times than Obama had -- and quite possibly ever will .
When several members of the delegation returned to Cairo a day early to stage a protest at Obama 's speech and call on him to visit Gaza ( surprise - - he did not ) , they brought with them an official letter to the U.S. Embassy from Hamas calling for a reopening of diplomatic relations .
( You can read the text of the letter here . )
On the one hand , we were honored by our new diplomatic responsibility .
But on the other , it seemed a bit ridiculous that the democratically elected government of anywhere has to depend for communication with the U.S. government on a group of activists .
Perhaps nothing sums up my Gaza experience better than the story of Mufid Amur , who I met on our last full day in Gaza .
Touring a devastated village on the road to the Sufa crossing , I stopped to take a picture of a pile of rubble ( once a home ) with a Palestinian flag perched on top .
I was approached by Mr. Amur , who spoke excellent English and was the owner of the house .
He offered to show me where he , his wife and seven children now live : two 8 - foot - by - 10 - foot tin- roofed shacks , with no plumbing or electricity and just a few mattresses on the floor -- all they were able to salvage from their destroyed home .
I had no words to offer Mr. Amur -- even apologizing on behalf of my government , which I did , seemed hollow and specious .
But his primary concern , amongst this post - apocalyptic landscape of destroyed homes , was that I should stay and have tea .
The only promise I could make to him in return was that I would not forget his name ( which , being without a pen when I heard it , I repeated over and over to myself on the way back to the bus ) , and that I would bring his story back to the U.S. -- and continue to fight to end the siege and occupation , until the day when there is justice in Palestine .
The July / August issue of Dwell brings us this beautiful desert home in Pioneertown , California ( not too far from Three Junipers , actually ) .
The home was designed by architect Lloyd Russell for Jim Austin , an entrepreneur who wanted something simple .
The functional home of 1,600 square feet is what Austin calls , “ the ultimate desert structure . ”
It ’s built with recycled and durable materials , as well as a prominent steel canopy that shelters and shades the home .
In the desert , there ’s wind and sun , and the canopy is an obvious solution to use both elements to keep the temperature down inside the house .
When the sun hits the canopy , some of that heat is reflected back into the sky while the rest is absorbed by the canopy .
And since there ’s a wind buffer , the design creates a cooling mechanism to keep the house relatively shaded and cool .
Jim Austin's home sits on a ten - acre parcel of land called Rimrock Ranch .
With a modest combination of windows , weathered steel , and concrete , it seems to suit the desert perfectly .
The roll up garage - style door is a nice touch , too .
These are showing up all over the place ( see Logical Homes and Buzz Lofts ) .

To the grieving minister of Culture … .
The Constitutionnal Council , highest jurisdiction in France gave its decision concerning the HADOPI “ three strikes ” law , final stage before the promulgation of the law .
It decided that presumption of innocence is more important than the idiotic schemes from the entertainment industries to artificially prolong their obsolete models .
All sanctioning power ( ie. disconnecting internet users ) has been removed from the HADOPI .
” This is a great victory for citizens who proved they can altogether act to protect their Freedom .
HADOPI ’s ‘ three strikes ’ is finally buried .
All we have now is a big tax - sponsored spam machine for the entertainment industries .
But this is not the end of Sarkozy ’s will to control the Internet .
The next law , LOPPSI , is already on tracks and will be about filtering the content on the Internet .
Citizens must celebrate this great victory but remain watchful … ” declares Jérémie Zimmermann , cheerfully .
Mercedes - Benz A - Class - Click above for high - res image gallery
According to a report from AutoWeek.nl , Mercedes - Benz is taking a long , hard look at a new three - cylinder engine for its upcoming range of small cars and hybrids .
Daimler already offers a 1.0 - liter three - banger in the diminutive Smart ForTwo , and this new powerplant would likely be destined for the engine bay of both the next - gen Smart and Mercedes ' A- , B - and C - Class vehicles .
In addition to the three - cylinder engine , Thomas Weber , director of group research and car development at Mercedes - Benz , says the German automaker plans to offer a hybrid powertrain option on each of its models – from minicars like the Smart to its line of large luxury sedans and commercial vans .
To make that goal a reality , M - B is working to reduce the weight of its hybrid drivetrain by 10 % .
The last interesting little nugget from this report is that Mercedes is looking for a partner to help develop this small engine family .
We can't help but recall rumors from last month indicating that BMW was working on its own new three - cylinder engine architecture
Mahatma Gandhi & Talking of Eternal Things
In St. Pauls second Epistle to the Corinthians , he tells the community to remember that “ the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal . ”
When this idea is delivered from the pulpit of Christian churches today , preachers usually discuss how it refers to God ’s grace , the Holy Spirit , or the kingdom of Heaven .
The problem is that we tend to think of all these things as God ’s alone or God ’s gifts to us .
They come from the outside and thus we do n’t consider ourselves as co-creators of eternal things , along with the Father .
But as Sons and Daughters of God , we are all inheritors and builders of His kingdom , grace , and spirit of eternal things that are more magical than Harry Potter ’s wand .
India ’s Mahatma Gandhi once delivered an adage that is probably as well known as St. Paul ’s , and that is : “ Live as if you were to die tomorrow .
Learn as if you were to live forever . ”
It is by living intensely and learning joyfully that we grab the reigns of our eternal natures in Christ .
Human experience and knowledge are not temporal : we cannot truly see the feelings associated with a beautiful sunrise , a first kiss , or the birth of a child , any more than we can see the thoughts connected with learning a new language , tying a slip knot , or mastering differential equations — they are eternal .
This life will one day end .
But the harvest of the heart and mind is with you always .
After the Parades and the Picnics Editor ’s Note : Memorial Day in the United States – and similar days of remembrance in other countries – can be a moment of mixed reflections , honoring the sacrifice of soldiers who died in the service of their countries and lamenting that failures of politicians and journalists so often contributed to the deaths .
In this guest essay , pastor Johann Christoph Arnold comments on the loss of life and the option of peace : Everybody loves a long weekend .
But this year 's Memorial Day ought to be a lot more meaningful to all of us .
We need to see it as a chance to pray for lasting peace and for our President , that he may lead our country to a new vision .
Email
Printer friendly Otherwise , our future will be marked by continuous open - ended global warfare , and we will have many more deaths to commemorate with each passing Memorial Day .
Today we should not only remember the dead , but celebrate life .
We need to think about what Memorial Day really means -- what the life of every deceased soldier means to his or her family , and to us .
These men and women were people like you and me .
They loved their country and they loved their families .
They had hopes , dreams and ambitions .
They lived -- and were willing to die -- for a cause in which they truly believed .
I believe all war is wrong -- and most people do .
Who is n't for peace ?
As the old saying goes , " All war is civil war , because all men are brothers . "
But I also know that many of those who die in warfare sacrifice themselves to save others .
Would we have the same courage ?
Families who have lost loved ones in combat should be comforted to know that even though they are no longer with us , their lives can still serve a greater purpose .
No person dies in vain ; every death carries a valuable lesson for the living .
Children need to learn about the importance of human life , and every life story has something to teach them .
This is true education .
We need to channel our energies into positive efforts that will bring people together .
Let 's become better role models for our children .
To do this we must put aside all our fears , frustrations and anger .
We must recognize that we have relied too much on our own knowledge and skills to solve our daily problems .
We have forgotten God and lost our sense of community .
In this light , Memorial Day ought to be a time to visit our neighbors , local veterans , and nursing home residents .
Too often , we do n't even know who our neighbors are .
Everyone needs someone to talk to .
By sharing with others , we will find out that we have much in common .
When the speeches and parades are over , let 's also take time to stop by the local cemetery to stand beside those who are still mourning .
Let 's grieve with them .
People are often reluctant to open up and share their needs with others .
Yet only by allowing others to help carry their burdens will they find healing .
Then the vision of freedom for which so many brave men and women died in past wars will become real .
Wherever people find one another and have community together , the peace that we all long for will be found .
Let 's pray for those that have not yet found this peace .
Alfredo Molano , a Colombian exile in Spain , once wrote , " The true end of a war is the rebirth of life -- the end of fear , the right to die peacefully in one 's own bed , and the return of laughter . "
Some of my best friends are veterans , and I have had to think of them in light of these words .
I have seen the scars they continued to carry long after the fighting was over -- in some cases right up to the present .
These are wounds that only time and prayer can heal .
Fortunately , many have found healing -- some by reconciling with former enemies and others by speaking out about their experiences and educating a new generation about the futility and evil of war .
The result of these efforts is a strong faith and a deep peace .
Through their work they have become an inspiration and role model to many children .
They are taking part , as Molano says , in the " rebirth of life . "
These veterans are the real heroes of today 's celebration .
I 'm thankful for each one .

Great post , Chris. in retrospect , wonder why we did n’t address it before .
I have several bikes and it is my usual mode of transport for spring / summer .
Fall and winter are , IMHO , often unpleasant and somewhat unsafe times to ride in NE .
Cape Cod is completing a Cape - long bike trail that will eventually let one bike the entire length .
If they only had public transportation to get you here with your bike …
I would find it helpful if people would post their personal experiences with specific bikes , electric add - ons , accessories , etc. , with links .
I own a 14 y.o.
Giant hybrid , a 14 y.o .
Trek mountain , and a 2006 Dahon P6 folding bike , a great way to throw a bike in your trunk and travel around your destination if you have to drive to get there .
You can also carry it in a backpack holder on public transportation .
http://WWW.dahon.com.
They do n’t make this model anymore but they have numerous others .
They are expensive new but there is always Ebay .
There are other brands though they are the premier folder and others are heavier .
My impression is that it may be worth buying a newer bike that is lighter , has shocks , etc. but that is just speculation .
My bikes are old , clunky , but sturdy .

唯一見つけたショップインでも、売っている時といない時がありました。
カミツレ花エキスやラベンダー、カモミールの香りがするDUOザクレンジングバームホワイトは＠コスメ評価も6.0とかなり高評価。（ステマだったら普通こんなに多くの口コミは集まりません。）
マツエクでも使えるのはありがたいですよね。
アットコスメの通販サイトやロフト,アインズ＆トルペ,ショップイン,イオンなどの店舗で買ってしまうと半額割引がなく、定価購入になってしまうので損してしまいますのでご注意を！
ルミネ池袋店の@cosmeストアでは定価の3,888円で販売しているにも関わらず、赤いduoとduoホワイトは売り切れ在庫切れの状態になっているほど人気でした。
東急ハンズ一部店舗やドンキホーテではそもそもの取り扱いがありません。

敏感肌でも使えるクレンジングバームというコンセプトでこれからヒットしそうですね。
オールインワンのカナデルプレミアホワイトとDUOクレンジングバームの併用
同じプレミアアンチエイジング社のオールインワンコスメCANADELプレミアホワイトとCANADELプレミアリフトも併せて使っています。
こっくりとしたクリーム状なのに馴染みがよく、ベタつかないので使いやすくてお気に入りです。
他のオールインワンだと保湿力とか物足りない感があったのですが、カナデルはさすが！のクオリティー。しっとり感は今まで使ってきたアイテムの中で一番いいような気がします。
duoクレンジングのオールインワン/カナデルを使ってみた
duoデュオザホワイトクレイクレンズ（洗顔料）とduoデュオザ薬用ホワイトレスキュー（泡状美白美容液）が優秀
2020年新発売のduoザダブルクレイクレンズは、4種類の天然クレイと、うるおいのあるマンナンボールが色むらの元となる皮脂よごれや角質をオフしてくれる洗顔料。
デュオクレンジング自体が、W洗顔不要だったので夜のメイク落としで洗顔料は使っていませんでしたが、朝の洗顔のときに重宝して使えます。
30代に差し掛かるとどんどんと目立ってくる色むら。またこれが老け見えの原因で、すっぴんの時でもコンシーラーしたいくらいなんですが、ホワイトを使うとマシになる気がします。
ホワイトクレイクレンズは、パッケージもホワイトと同じ色で、一緒に使うと相性がいいのかな、と思います。
そして、ついに美白美容液・薬用ホワイトレスキューも出ました！待ってました〜^ ^
duoコスメお得意のブースター効果もあるので、洗顔後すぐの肌に馴染ませます。
なんで炭酸泡状なんだろう？と思ったのですが、より角質層深くに浸透させるためだそう。
ラベンダーのようなリラックスできる香りと、しっとり潤う仕上がりで、紫外線量の多くなる季節に向けて毎日使っています。
duoクレンジングホワイトと、ホワイトクレイクレンズと一緒に使うと、効果倍増でいい感じです＾＾
メイク系一番人気はduoザヌードパウダー
duoは半額モニターのあるクレンジングだけでなく、メイク系アイテムも充実しています。
2020年春の全体売上断トツの1位はヌードパウダー。3位にセラムBBもランクインしており、クレンジング以外の人気も高いことがわかります。
あまり知られていませんが、ヌードパウダーのように店舗に売られていない人気アイテムも多いです。

実際にわたしも3つのクレンジングバームを持っていますが、その日の肌状態に合わせて使い分けしています。そうすると、肌の調子がいいこと、いいこと！
毎日同じお気に入りのクレンジングを使うのもアリですが、使い分けることで、自分の肌と向き合う時間が作れます。

紫外線量が1年のうちで一番多くなるこれからの時期は、ホワイトを重宝しています。
冷房などが原因によって知らず知らずのうちに冷えてしまうと、どんよりしてしまいますよね。
余分なものは溜め込まずに、その日のうちにしっかり落とす！！が鉄則です。
楽天amazonロフトなどDUOホワイトは店舗では半額割引で取扱い無し
東京銀座や渋谷、新宿池袋などのロフトやプラザ、アインズアンドトルぺなどのバラエティショップ・店舗で価格をチェックすると3600円(税別)でした。楽天、amazonもしかり。
プレミアアンチエイジングのDUO公式通販サイトがいかに安いかがわかります。
「 もう店舗で定価で買っちゃったよー！！泣」という方でも通販サイトでの初回購入であれば半額割引が適用されます。
意外なのですが、ドンキホーテなどのディスカウントストアやマツキヨ、ツルハドラッグ、ウエルシアなどの大手薬局では売っていませんでした。
duoクレンジングのコスパは悪い!?フォンダントバームやルルルン、バニラコと比較
Duoザクレンジングバームは高いからコスパが悪いという嘘口コミも見かけます。
でも巷でよく見かけるプチプラのルルルンやフォンダントバーム、韓国コスメのバニラコは値段相応で、ダブル洗顔はしないと心もとない感じでした。
プチプラクレンジングは価格を抑えるために、成分などいろんなものを犠牲にして無理やり商品化しているものも多くありますが、duoは成分にこだわって作られているので使っていても安心感があります。
そもそもダブル洗顔不要なので、色々買う手間が省けて洗顔料代が浮くと考えればコスパが良いですよね。
Duoクレンジングバームは1個90gで約1ヶ月分ですが、すごく伸びのいいテクスチャーなので思ったより消費しません。（体感的には1カ月半は十分持ちそうな感じ）
最初は固い状態なのでコスパが悪そうに見えても、肌になじませると溶けて伸びていくため意外と1ヶ月以上持つんですよね。
詰まりに！duoザクレンジングバームの使い方
Duoクレンジングバームは容器から取り出した時は固形状態になっています。
最初は固形状態で不安に思ってしまうかもしれませんが、肌になじませると溶けるようにとろけていくのが大きな特徴です。
トロントロンの滑らかなオイル状に簡単に変わるので、摩擦も起きません。
とろけたバームには洗浄成分と一緒にビタミンCやナノコラーゲンなどの31種類の美容成分が配合されており、しっかりメイクを落としながら美容成分を与え洗い上がりにも潤いを残してくれます。
Duoクレンジングバームはスクラブ効果があるので、マイルドに毛穴汚れも落としてくれます。
duoクレンジングでマッサージ！毛穴汚れを落とすスクラブ効果あり
Duoクレンジングはメイク落としだけでなく、洗顔・角質、毛穴ケア、マッサージにも利用できます。
バームの中に目には見えない小さなカプセルが配合されており、そのカプセル自体がスクラブ効果を担っているので毎日のメイク落としで一緒に角質ケアできるのも嬉しいポイント。
角質ケアってしている人としていない人で最も差が出るお手入れです。
分厚い角質をケアせずにそのままにしておくと、光の反射の関係でキメが曇って見えて冴えない印象になることをご存知ですか？透明感がある方は、絶対に角質ケアを怠っていません。
デリケートだからスクラブやピーリングは使えないし、優しいこんにゃくスクラブじゃ効果がない・・・と思っている方でも、duoクレンジングなら毎日のクレンジングで無理なく自然に角質ケアできます。
★duoクレンジングバームはダブル洗顔不要。
duoザクレンジングバームはダブル洗顔不要なので、夜疲れていてもメイクを落とすだけで綺麗なすっぴんでなれるのでいいですね。
クレンジング→洗顔料を泡立てて洗顔っていう流れだと、とにかくまあ面倒くさい。
一度ダブル洗顔不要の楽さを知ってしまうと、もうそれ以外のクレンジングは使えません。
そもそも、メイクを落とした後に洗顔料でまた顔を洗うと、余分な皮脂まで取ってしまうことが多いですよね？
一時期、洗顔料を使わな い ” 水洗顔のみ ” ブームも流行ったくらい、洗いすぎることで、失われた皮脂を出そうとして顔表面はテカるのに、内側は乾いている体質になってしまいます。
ほどほどに洗う、でも汚れはしっかり落とす、必要な皮脂は残す！
これが美肌を作るための洗顔の絶対条件です。
★濡れた手はNGなのでお風呂では使えません。
ちなみに、duoクレンジングバームは濡れた手では使えません。
乾いた手と乾いた顔でメイクを落とすことで真価を発揮するので、お風呂の前にメイクオフしてくださいね。
duoザクレンジングバームを愛用している芸能人多数！
芸能人の中でも渡辺美奈代さんや釈由美子さんなど愛用している方が多いよう。
ミスユニバースの方なども愛用しているようです。
美肌の基本は ” 与えることよりも落とすこと ” 。
クレンジングにこだわっているから美肌を保てているのですね。
【カミツレ】シミくすみ対策DUOクレンジングバームホワイトの成分/マツエクOK
モロッコ産天然クレイ『ガスール』と先進ブライトケア成分のDUOホワイトは、ブライトアップ効果もあるクレンジング。
バームの基本となるクリアカプセルに、吸着力に優れたモロッコの天然クレイ『ガスール』をプラスしています。
『ガスール』は古くから石鹸やパックなどの美容に使われ世界中の女性に愛用されており、マグネシウムやナトリウム、カルシウムなど肌に重要な天然ミネラル成分が豊富で高い吸着力を誇る成分です。
超微粒子の天然クレイはメイクを落とす際にシミ・くすみの元になる古い角質や酸化皮脂、また黒ずみや汚れなどの老廃物を優しく吸着していきます。
ローマカミツレ、ベルガモット、ラベンダーなどをブレンドした女性らしいカミツレ花精油の香りがうっすら香り、クレンジングしながら癒される・・
疲れて老けた印象に見せてしまう色ムラに着目し、どんよりの原因にアプローチする成分を美容液レベルに贅沢に配合しているので、継続して使用するとお肌に透明感が生まれ、ワントーン明るくなります。
シアノアクリレート系の成分を配合したまつエクだったら問題なく使えます。

I love electronic music .
Recently , I put up a list of 10 Masters of Electronic Music that you just have to hear which , while it was extremely well received , earned me a few awesome pointers from readers as to what kind of electronic music I should be listening to : Trance .
So I 've compiled a list here of videos for twenty three of the songs that were suggested to me by readers all over the world .
Some of these you may recognize , while others might become new favorites .
Either way , take a look , have a listen , and experience these awesome Trance tracks here in this definitive online collection .
There are two broad ways of approach to scientific knowledge .
One , known as empiricism , is the approach that emphasises experience and the facts that result from observation and experimentation .
The other , known as rationalism , stresses reason and the theories that result from logical inference .
The empiricist collects facts ; the rationalist co-ordinates and arranges them .
Theories and facts are required in the construction of knowledge .
In sociological inquiry both are significant .
A theory unsubstantiated by hard , solid facts are nothing more than an opinion .
Facts , by themselves , in their isolated character , are meaningless and useless .
As Immanuel Kant said , " theories without facts are empty and facts without theories are blind " .
All modern sciences , therefore , avail themselves of both empirical and rational resources .
Sociology is not an exception .
Arsène Wenger has opened the door to Emmanuel Adebayor leaving Arsenal this summer by stating he would have no problem in selling a player to Chelsea or any other big four rival .
Adebayor , who has endured a turbulent season after he came , in Wenger 's words , " close to leaving the club " last summer , has emerged as a possible target for Chelsea .
Roman ­Abramovich , Chelsea 's owner , admires the Togo striker and so does Carlo Ancelotti , the Milan manager , whom Chelsea hope to install as Guus Hiddink 's successor .
Ancelotti thought he had a deal to take Adebayor to San Siro last summer only for Silvio Berlusconi , the Milan owner , to step in at the last moment and insist that the club sign Ronaldinho from Barcelona .
Wenger said that Adebayor remained a part of his plans but , while he has argued passionately that players such as Cesc Fábregas and Robin van Persie are going nowhere , his stance over Adebayor sounded less convincing .
" I do n't want to go especially into any individual assessment of who we want to keep and who not , at the moment , and normally Adebayor is part of our plans for the future , " he said .
" If I feel that a player should go , or could go , why not sell him to one of the other top four ? "
It was put to Wenger that the top clubs rarely sold to their domestic rivals .
" Yes , of course , it 's unusual , " he said .
" But we sold [ Ashley ] Cole to Chelsea and we bought [ William ] Gallas [ from Stamford Bridge ] so you can never say I never do it because I 've already done it . "
Adebayor sent out mixed messages at the end of last season when , after scoring 30 goals in all competitions , he became one of the hottest properties onthe market .
He said he would be " delighted " to play for Barcelona who , together with Milan , led the chase for his signature but he also stressed that he was " very happy " at Arsenal and would return to them for pre-season training .
When he did and duly turned out for the Premier League club , he felt the wrath of supporters .
" I believe he was disturbed at the start by a little bit of bad feelings from the fans because he was close to leaving the club and it unsettled him a little bit , " said Wenger as he assessed Adebayor 's contribution this season , in which he has scored 16 goals .
" And after , he had a big [ hamstring ] injury [ that kept him out for two months from early February ] .
He looks now in training very , very sharp and back to his best . "
Wenger was asked whether he wished he had sold Adebayor last summer , when his value was at its peak .
He had opted to keep Thierry Henry for one more season in the summer of 2006 and the France international went on to have an indifferent campaign before he completed his long - mooted move to Barcelona .
" In this path , you are always in avery delicate position for two reasons , " Wenger replied .
" First , I can not tell you all the truth , what happened behind the scenes and secondly , when youwant to keep the players , you keep the players .
You do not really look athow much money you get .
On the other hand , people say you do not want tospend and when you have the goodplayer , you sell him .
We are in a position where we have ... when I look in training today , the quality of our offensive sector is very strong . "
Adebayor can point to three separate injury lay - offs as mitigation for his inconsistent season , together with his being asked on occasion to play as a lone striker .
Mindful perhaps of his PR errors last summer , he came out strongly to stress his commitment after the Champions League semi-final exit against Manchester United last week .
But many supporters remain unconvinced .
Having jeered him at intervals during the season , some booed his introduction as a second - half substitute in the Premier League defeat against ­Chelsea last Sunday .
Adebayor is aware that Ancelotti covets him , just as he would acknowledge the difficulties of a move across London to Chelsea .
A parting of the ways with Arsenal , however , seems increasingly likely , although Wenger , who is tracking the Blackburn Rovers striker Roque Santa Cruz , sounded a note of caution .
" No matter how much money you have ... you will see Manchester City now , for example , will be in the market ... the number of players available who make a difference is not as big as people imagine , " he said .
I 'm not gay , but I feel that people are people , no matter what their sexual orientation is .
Gay men and women often live in domestic partnerships , because they can't get married .
Straight folks also live in domestic partnerships for whatever reason .
If the term " domestic partnerships " covers homosexual , heterosexual , and transgendered people , why is there such inequality ?
Â
Health insurance benefits should be available to everyone who is supported by an employer who offers those benefits to married men and women .
Domestic partners are often thought of as men and women who live together without being married ; however , the term also includes homosexual partners .
Gay people have had to fight for every inch of their civil rights as human beings .
We , who are heterosexuals do n't think twice about the benefits we have .
Heterosexual men and women can fall in love , get married and live happily ever after ; however , men and women of the same sexual orientation cannot validate their love in the eyes of the law in most states .
Currently Massachusetts and Connecticut are the only states that recognize gay marriage .
With the benefit of marriage you have other benefits as well .
For instance , when you are married you and your spouse can be covered by group health insurance by your employer .
Is it just as easy for domestic partners to have access to those same health insurance benefits ?
It really depends on the benevolence of the employer .
What is commonly accepted for married heterosexual couples is not accepted for homosexual couples in a civil union , or domestic partnership .
Some states , such as New York and California have become more enlightened than some other states .
Even with Proposition 8 , California still is far ahead of some other states .
Homosexual domestic partnerships are accepted in the same fashion that heterosexual domestic partnerships are .
The words " Domestic Partnership " include hetero and homosexual partnerships .
All states do not see eye to eye about the subject of homosexual marriage , civil unions and domestic partnerships .
If you are homosexual , and you marry in Massachusetts or Connecticut and you move to Georgia , Alabama , or some other state you wo n't be married in those other states .
Why is it that marriage of a man and woman is legal in all states , so that if you are married in Massachusetts you are married in all states , but the same is not true if you are homosexual and married ?
Why do n't all state legislatures ' half - way , at least , agree that homosexual people are human too , and should not be penalized for being who they are ?
It truly does depend on the benevolence of an employer in some states whether men and women in domestic partnerships are deserving of health care benefits .
Our country , the United States of America , is not united in any way , shape or form .
The United States is the only country in the world that does not have universal health care .
This means that if you are denied health insurance benefits you cannot have access to medical care if you do n't have health insurance .
Yes , you can go to a doctor 's office and pay $ 100 or more for a visit .
You can go to an emergency department of your local hospital and be seen .
If you do n't have the money to pay for that visit your health care expenses will go into collection and your credit will be ruined , so that you could never buy a car or a house on credit .
People who are married do have their problems with health insurance .
They may not be able to afford the premiums , but at least they are n't discriminated against because they are part of a domestic partnership .
Straight people in domestic partnerships sometimes have problems getting health insurance also , because they are not united in marriage .
If two people have are living together as domestic partners , why can't they be eligible for insurance ?
Marriage does n't guarantee stability , so why can't domestic partnerships be considered just as stable as a married partnership ?
Today , more people live together as domestic partners , and they have families just like married people do .
Why are n't they eligible for health insurance everywhere ?
Domestic partnerships are gaining ground , though .
If an employer accepts domestic partners they do n't exclude homosexuals , for the most part .
However , some states still do separate gay and straight domestic partnerships , and allow for gay partners to have access to health care , and not the straight couples .
Why should it matter how one has sex to be eligible for health insurance ?
Yesterday , we installed seven large , lead - framed photographs at LACMA that constitute Hiroshi Sugimoto ’s powerful Henry VIII and His Six Wives “ portraits . ”
When you first enter the dark gallery , you might be confused by what these pictures are — whether they depict actors dressed as Henry and his wives or whether they ’re amazingly photorealistic paintings .
They are , in fact , photographs of waxworks made by the legendary Madame Tussaud .
For each , Sugimoto placed a black velvet cloth behind them and used a 3 / 4 turned and cropped framing of the “ figures ” akin to the first portrait photographers in the mid-nineteenth century .
In so doing , Sugimoto breathes photographic life into the layers of simulation and equivalence of his historic subjects .

SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) -- The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting Monday after world leaders reacted with outrage to North Korea 's latest nuclear test .
This screen grab from North Korean television on April 9 shows leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang .
North Korea earlier said it had tested the weapon in an underground explosion , provoking an angry response from the world 's governments .
It had threatened to conduct the test if the U.N. Security Council did not apologize for imposing sanctions on North Korea after it tested a rocket April 5 .
The secretive communist state also apparently test - fired a short - range missile Monday , the White House said .
The Security Council called on its members to discuss the reported test Monday at 4 p.m. ET .
Watch how the test may have taken world by surprise »
The United States and many other countries denounced the test .
Even China , North Korea 's strongest ally , said it opposed the test .
The White House -- which less than three weeks ago announced a new diplomatic effort to restart stalled talks with North Korea about its nuclear program -- said the test was in " blatant defiance " of the Security Council .
" North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community , " the White House said .
" The danger posed by North Korea 's threatening activities warrants action by the international community . "
While the test was not a surprise , Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said it showed Pyongyang was becoming " increasingly belligerent . "
North Korea announced its underground nuclear test a little more than an hour after the U.S. Geological Survey reported a magnitude 4.7 seismic disturbance at the site of North Korea 's first nuclear test .
There was no immediate information on the yield of the weapon used in Monday 's test .
The Russian Defense Ministry said the explosion was between 10 to 20 kilotons .
The U.S. State Department said it was analyzing the data .
Mullen said it would take a couple of days to verify the reported test , but he added , " there 's no indication that it was n't as they say . "
The North 's state - run Korean Central News Agency would say only that the latest test was safely conducted " on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control . "
Watch more analysis on test »
U.S. intelligence estimated the first North Korean test , in October 2006 , produced an explosion equal to less than 1,000 tons of TNT .
The low yield was a fraction of the size of the bombs the United States dropped on Japan at the end of World War II .
Intelligence analysts had predicted North Korea would conduct a second rocket or nuclear test .
The North threatened to do so after the Security Council voted unanimously to condemn its April launch as a violation of a 2006 resolution that bans North Korea 's ballistic missile activity .
Watch how Pyongyang has used nuclear tests to gain concessions »
North Korea insisted the rocket was a communications satellite .
It retaliated by threatening to walk away from the six - party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons .
The talks -- involving China , Japan , North Korea , Russia , South Korea and the United States -- are intended to persuade North Korea to scrap its nuclear program .
The North also expelled international inspectors from its nuclear sites , announced plans to restart the reactor that produces plutonium for its nuclear weapons , and threatened to launch more rockets and another nuclear device .
Monday 's test was conducted " as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self - defense in every way , " the North Korean news agency said .
" They think this will enhance and embolden their diplomatic capability to deal with the other countries , " said Han Sung Joo , former South Korean ambassador to the United States .
" Of course , it may be working the other way .
But from their point of view , this is their lifeline , which they want to maintain . "
China 's government " expresses firm opposition " to the test , in which North Korea " disregarded the opposition of the international community , " according to a statement from China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
North Korea 's latest move could clear the way for the United States and the other members of the six - party talks , minus North Korea , to impose new punitive measures against a country desperate for food and energy assistance .
For now , however , the North 's nuclear arms program is not a major security threat , analysts say .
The country has yet to build an effective bomb or develop an effective delivery system to a target country .
Watch South Korea 's reaction to the nuclear test »
Last year , North Korea acknowledged producing roughly 88 pounds ( 40 kilograms ) of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs .
But analysts say North Korea is years from having a weapon it can put atop a long - range missile like those in the U.S. , Chinese or Russian arsenals .
" I know a lot of people may think , ' Oh no , a nuclear test .
Does that mean war , conflict in the Korean Peninsula ? ' " said Jim Walsh , an international security analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" The answer is ' no . ' "
CNN 's Sohn Jie-ae , Jaime Florcruz , Matthew Chance and Morgan Neill contributed to this report .

Saturn is easy to find because it is the brightest star or planet high in the southern sky .
Here it is depicted around 9:30 p.m. local time on May 10 from Phoenix , Arizona .
The view varies slightly by location .
Just look high in the sky toward the south anytime in the evening from dusk onward .
If you yet have n't done so , now is the time to get a look at Saturn and its rings through a telescope .
In August , the rings will disappear for a while .
You can find Saturn now high in the south at dusk , about 15 - degrees to the east of the star Regulus , the brightest star of Leo , the Lion .
( Your clenched fist held at arm 's length measures roughly 10 - degrees . )
Fading slightly from magnitude 0.7 to 0.9 , Saturn still outshines Regulus .
( On this scale , larger numbers represent dimmer objects . )
Compare Saturn 's steady yellow light to the twinkling blue - white light of Regulus .
Even now , the rings of Saturn appear no more than as a " bright bar " which bisects the planet 's disk , a far cry from the big loops they presented back in April 7 , 2003 when the rings were tilted 27 degrees .
However , Saturn remains the telescopic showpiece of our evening sky .
In small telescopes , they sometimes surprise even veteran observers with their chilling beauty even though it 's expected .
Any telescope magnifying more than 30 - power will show them .
Say good - bye
From May 11 through 17 , the ring system will appear at its maximum tilt in the evening sky during 2009 : 4.15 - degrees from edgewise with its south face visible .
As the weeks pass , the bright bar will appear to get progressively thinner as the rings close to our line of sight .
Finally , on Aug 10 , the rings will seem to vanish .
Why ?
The sun will no longer be shining on the south side of the rings ; it will be shining on the north side .
With nothing to illuminate them , the south side of the rings – that 's the side that will be ever so slightly tilted toward Earth – will be all but impossible to observe , except perhaps in the very largest of telescopes .
On Sep. 4 , the rings will turn edge - on to the Earth .
Saturn will transition from the evening to the morning sky a couple of weeks later .
By mid-October you 'll have to get up just before sunrise to view it , low in the eastern morning sky .
By then , the rings will again be back in view as a thin line of light .
The rings open to as much as 4.9 - degrees by the end of this year , but in the early morning sky .
Galileo was baffled
What we are seeing with Saturn now is likely what Galileo Galilei was seeing when he viewed Saturn with his crude telescope back in the year 1612 .
In that year , Saturn 's rings were also nearly edgewise , as they are now .
What Galileo saw through his crude telescope left him completely baffled , as Saturn appeared to him not to have rings but rather two smaller bodies flanking it on either side .
He could n't make them out clearly and thought that Saturn was a triple body : two small orbs on either side of a large one .
Later , when the rings turned edgewise to Earth and the two companions disappeared , Galileo invoked an ancient myth when he wrote , “ Has Saturn swallowed his children ? ” Galileo lamented that his mind was too weak to comprehend this strange phenomenon .
Huygens solves the mystery
Actually , it was Galileo 's telescope that was too weak ; a better telescope would have revealed Saturn 's companions as rings .
It was not until a young Dutch mathematician , Christiaan Huygens ( 1629-1695 ) utilized a much better telescope and finally saw the rings for what they really were on the night of March 25 , 1655 .
Huygens also glimpsed a tiny star , which after a few days of observation he deduced to be a satellite of Saturn ( which today we call Titan ) .
In order to stake his claim that he was the first to discover that Saturn was encircled by a ring , he published a mysterious code if he needed to provide proof later on .
Here was the code :
aaaaaaa ccccc d eeeee g h iiiiiii llll mm nnnnnnnnn oooo pp q rr ttttt uuuuu .
The code itself was simple .
In alphabetical order Huygens assembled all the letters of a Latin sentence which , when deciphered read :
" Annulo cingitur tenui , plano nusquam cohaerente , ad eclipticam inclinato . "
In English , this translates into :
" It ( Saturn ) is girdled by a thin flat ring , nowhere touching , inclined to the ecliptic . "
If he wrote the Latin sentence intelligibly , all the letters would be used with none left over .
Saturn up close
In honor of his discovery of Saturn 's rings and of Titan , In 1997 NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) launched the Cassini–Huygens robotic spacecraft mission which currently is studying the planet Saturn and its moons .
The NASA Cassini orbiter , is named for the Italian - French astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini , and the ESA Huygens probe , was named for Christiaan Huygens .
On Dec. 25 , 2004 the Huygens probe separated from the orbiter , and it reached Saturn 's moon Titan on Jan. 14 , 2005 where it made an atmospheric descent to the surface and relayed scientific information .
Recently , Cassini beamed back another batch of brilliiant images of Saturn 's rings , giving us a view from there that we can't get from here .

Apple : Up 69 % so far this year .
Today ’s iPhone announcements – the price cut on the older model and new features for the latest iteration – show this stock ’s growth is very much for real , Cramer said .
Google : Up 43 % so far .
The Internet , where Google is the dominant player , is taking over as the place to advertise , elbowing out print .
This longer - term trend is just one reason why many analysts are expecting a great next quarter .
Amazon.com : Up 68 % .
As soon as gas prices hit $ 4 , consumers decided that online shopping was the better option .
Hence , the solid quarterly numbers .
Amazon took share , Cramer said , and never looked back .
Research in Motion :
Up a whopping 102 % in 2009 , thanks to new products and good sales .
Investors might have missed at least part of this run because of a 2008 earnings miss , Cramer said , but they jumped back in last quarter , which was better than expected .
Baidu.com : Cramer called BIDU the most legitimate Chinese play in the Nasdaq , and that country ’s on fire right now .
No wonder the stock is up 133 % this year .
Cisco Systems : Up 22 % .
The never - soft - spoken CEO John Chambers declared that business had bottomed , and the stock took off .
Adobe Systems :
Talk about brand equity .
People know and love Adobe ’s products , and that probably played a role in the stock ’s 37 % jump , something that was long - awaited after the beating ADBE took .
Express Scripts :
Health care may be hated , thanks to President Obama ’s overhaul plans , but Express Scripts is not .
Wall Street seems to favor this cost cutter , which accounts for the stock ’s 17 % gain year - to - date .
Joy Global : Chinese demand for minerals is driving this mining - equipment maker .
The US can play catch - up all it wants .
Joy Global does n’t need American business to thrive – the stock ’s up 74 % this year .
Sure , you could focus on Oracle , adding a “ mere ” 18 % this year , Microsoft a “ disappointing ” 13 % and Intel a “ measly ” 8 % .
But ignoring these other – huge – moves would be a mistake .
Cramer thinks this could be one of the strongest bull markets ever .
So again , if you ’re wondering if this is just a mini-rally smack in the middle of a bear market – shut up .
Cramer ’s charitable trust owns Cisco Systems and Qualcomm .

Was bewirkt eine Stimmenthaltung , was eine ungültige Stimme ?
Stimmenthaltung und ungültige Stimme = Nichtwahl
Eine Stimmenthaltung und die Abgabe einer ungültigen Stimme haben beide den gleichen Einfluss auf das Wahlergebnis – nämlich keinen .
Nur in einem Ausnahmefall – der Abgeordnetenhauswahl in Berlin ( bis 2004 auch bei der Landtagswahl im Saarland ) – gilt für die Berechnung der Fünf - Prozent - Hürde die Zahl der abgegebenen statt der gültigen Stimmen , so dass ungültige Stimmen hier einen marginalen Einfluss haben können .
Im Übrigen zählen sowohl für die Sitzzuteilung als auch für die Prozentangaben im Wahlergebnis stets nur die gültigen Stimmen .
Einfluss auf Statistik
In der amtlichen Wahlstatistik werden ungültige Stimmen explizit aufgeführt – mehr aber auch nicht .
Es wird nicht festgehalten , warum die Stimmen ungültig sind : Ob dem Wähler etwa die Stimmabgabe zu kompliziert war und er aus Unkenntnis keine gültige Stimme abgegeben hat oder er sich bewusst enthalten bzw .
gar Protest ausdrücken wollte .
Zur Begründung der ungültigen Stimmabgabe oder der Wahlenthaltung gibt es auch kein Feld auf dem Stimmzettel .
Erklärungen oder Sprüche auf dem Stimmzettel sehen nur die Wahlhelfer vor Ort .
Häufig wird die Wahlbeteiligung als Gradmesser für die Zufriedenheit der Bürger mit dem politischen System angesehen .
Die Wahlbeteiligung setzt sich aber aus den gültigen und ungültigen Stimmen zusammen .
Wer nicht zu einer höheren Wahlbeteiligung beitragen will , sollte also zu Hause bleiben .
Keine Mindestwahlbeteiligung
Es gibt bei Wahlen in Deutschland keine Mindestbeteiligung , die erreicht werden muss , damit die Wahl gültig ist .
Selbst wenn 99 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten zu Hause bleiben , wird das Parlament entsprechend dem Stimmergebnis des übrigen Prozents der Wahlberechtigten zusammengesetzt .
( Sofern das politische System nicht längst vor Erreichen solcher Zustände in einer Revolution umgestürzt wird . )
Im Parlament sitzen auch nicht weniger Abgeordnete , wenn weniger Menschen zur Wahl gehen .
Wer nicht wählt , wählt die Großen
Auch wenn immer gesagt wird , wer nicht wähle , wähle extrem – von der Nichtwahl profitieren rechnerisch gesehen alle Parteien , die man nicht gewählt hätte , und zwar proportional zu ihrem Stimmenanteil .
Wenn beispielsweise ein SPD - Wähler einmal nicht wählt , dann dürfte davon am meisten die CDU profitieren , und umgekehrt .
Am stärksten schadet man natürlich der Partei , die man gewählt hätte , wäre man zur Wahl gegangen .
Hinsichtlich der kleinen Parteien – und damit auch der extremen – gibt es noch den Zusatzeffekt , dass man durch Wahlenthaltung oder Ungültigwählen die Fünfprozenthürde ein Stück weit absinken lässt , so dass sie leichter zu überspringen ist .
Dieser Effekt ist aber vergleichsweise gering .
Staatliche Parteienfinanzierung – 2013 erstmals Auswirkung durch Nichtwahl
Für jede Stimme erhalten die Parteien Geld aus der staatlichen Parteienfinanzierung .
Für eine Wählerstimme gibt es maximal 0,85 EUR pro Jahr der Legislaturperiode .
Allerdings ist der Betrag der staatlichen Parteienfinanzierung auf eine absolute Obergrenze limitiert .
Diese Grenze wurde in den vergangenen Jahren regelmäßig deutlich überschritten , weshalb nicht abgegebene oder ungültige Stimmen in der Summe nichts änderten .
Sie bewirkten nur , dass weniger stark gekürzt werden muss , womit mehr Geld für andere Wahlen und für Zuschüsse zu Mitgliedsbeiträgen und Spenden übrig blieben .
Bei der im Februar 2014 vorgenommenen
Festsetzung der staatlichen Mittel für das Jahr 2013 lag die Gesamtsumme der sich für die Parteien ergebenden Finanzierungsmittel mit 153,5 Mio. EUR erstmals knapp unterhalb der Obergrenze dieses Jahres ( 154,1 Mio EUR ) .
Eine bei der Landtags - , Bundestags - oder Europawahl in den Jahren 2009 - 2013 nicht abgegebene Stimme hat also tatsächlich das Volumen der staatlichen Parteienfinanzierung im Jahr 2014 verringert .
Bei den seitdem vorgenommenen Festsetzungen der staatlichen Mittel für das Jahre ab 2014 lagen Ansprüche der Parteien aber wieder über der absoluten Obergrenze .
Eine Stimmabgabe an eine Kleinstpartei , deren Erstattungsbetrag wegen zu geringer eigener Einnahmen gedeckelt ist , reduziert die Gesamtsumme seit einer Gesetzesänderung im Jahr 2011 nicht mehr .
Die anderen Parteien erhalten dann von der Gesamtsumme entsprechend mehr .
Gegenbeispiel : Saarland 1952
Nur in den seltensten Einzelfällen ist in der Abgabe ungültiger Stimmen eindeutig Protest erkennbar : Bei der Landtagswahl im Saarland 1952 waren 24,5 % der Stimmen ungültig .
Die hohe Zahl der ungültigen Stimmen erklärt sich mit dem Verbot der Demokratischen Partei Saar ( DPS ) , die eine Wiedervereinigung des Saarlandes mit Deutschland forderte .
Ungültige Stimmabgabe
Für die Bundestagswahl definiert das Bundeswahlgesetz in § 39 ungültige Stimmen so :
(1) Ungültig sind Stimmen , wenn der Stimmzettel nicht amtlich hergestellt ist , keine Kennzeichnung enthält , für einen anderen Wahlkreis gültig ist , den Willen des Wählers nicht zweifelsfrei erkennen läßt , einen Zusatz oder Vorbehalt enthält .
In den Fällen der Nummern 1 und 2 sind beide Stimmen ungültig ; im Fall der Nummer 3 ist nur die Erststimme ungültig , wenn der Stimmzettel für einen anderen Wahlkreis in demselben Land gültig ist .
Bei der Briefwahl sind außerdem beide Stimmen ungültig , wenn der Stimmzettel nicht in einem amtlichen Stimmzettelumschlag oder in einem Stimmzettelumschlag abgegeben worden ist , der offensichtlich in einer das Wahlgeheimnis gefährdenden
Weise von den übrigen abweicht oder einen deutlich fühlbaren Gegenstand enthält , jedoch eine Zurückweisung gemäß Absatz 4 Nr. 7 oder 8 nicht erfolgt ist .
Enthält der Stimmzettel nur eine Stimmabgabe , so ist die nicht abgegebene Stimme ungültig .
( 2 ) Mehrere in einem Stimmzettelumschlag enthaltene Stimmzettel gelten als ein Stimmzettel , wenn sie gleich lauten oder nur einer von ihnen gekennzeichnet ist ; sonst zählen sie als ein Stimmzettel mit zwei ungültigen Stimmen .
( 3 ) Ist der Stimmzettelumschlag leer abgegeben worden , so gelten beide Stimmen als ungültig . [… ]
Beispiele :
Wie gebe ich sicher eine ungültige Stimme ab ?
Geben Sie mehr Stimmen ab , als erlaubt sind .
Kreuzen Sie mehrere Parteien bzw. mehrere Wahlkreiskandidaten an . Der Wille des Wählers lässt sich dann nicht mehr zweifelsfrei erkennen – die Stimme ist ungültig .
Streichen Sie die Wahlvorschläge auf dem Stimmzettel quer durch oder schreiben Sie „ ungültiger Stimmzettel “ auf den Stimmzettel .
Schreiben Sie etwa Ihren Namen und Ihre Telefonnummer sauber und lesbar auf die Vorderseite des Stimmzettels .
Damit ist automatisch der ganze Stimmzettel ungültig .
Auf der Rückseite des Stimmzettels können Sie ausführlich Ihre Beweggründe für Ihre Stimmabgabe darlegen , dies erleichtert die Zuordnung als ungültige Stimme .
Gelesen wird das ganze wahrscheinlich nicht , die Wahlhelfer wollen die Auszählung schnell beenden und dann nach Hause .
Achtung : Zweistimmenwahlrecht !
Bei der Bundestagswahl und einigen Landtagswahlen haben Sie zwei Stimmen auf einem Stimmzettel .
Sie können daher eine Stimme gültig abgeben und die andere ungültig machen ( etwa wie vorgehend unter Nr. 1 ) .
Eine Stimmenthaltung bei einer Stimme wird in solch einem Fall automatisch als ungültige Stimme gewertet .
Elektronische
Wahl – explizit ungültig wählen
Bei elektronischen
Wahlen gab es neben der Möglichkeit , eine Partei oder einen Kandidaten zu wählen , auch die explizite Möglichkeit , ungültig zu wählen .
Dies erforderte der Grundsatz der Gleichheit und Freiheit der Wahl .
Da der Wähler bei einer normalen

I ’ve heard from several nonprofits lately who are only sending their 4 - 8 page print newsletters to their supporters twice a year .
They wish they were sending it more often , but they just ca n’t make it happen because of time or budget constraints .
My response :
What ’s the point ?
Updating your supporters twice a year on your work is not often enough to keep them engaged in what you do and top of mind when they consider contributing time or money .
And each edition of a print newsletter typically costs thousands to print and mail , not including staff time .
I really question whether the newsletter is even worth doing at all if you can only do it twice a year .
Instead of spending all that money to contact your supporters just twice , with questionable impact , you might want to try switching over to postcards .
Naturally , every situation is different , but in many cases , a full - color postcard will cost about 1/3 of what a typical 4 - page color newsletter will cost to print and mail to your list .
That means you could contact your supporters six times a year , instead of two , for the same money .
And the best part is that postcards are much more likely to be read , because they fit right in with the way we all sort and read our mail today .
In the few seconds we each give a piece of mail in the pile , a postcard can grab our hearts with a great photo ( that graphic side is really important ) , deliver the key point we need to know , and motivate us to take the next step .
What might these six postcards focus on ?
Here is one possible line - up :
1. Connecting a Donor to a Result .
One one side , include a photo of one of your donors — let ’s call her Alice — ideally in a setting related to an accomplishment of your organization .
On the text side , in three sentences , explain how Alice ’s donation helped bring about this great result .
Then ask your supporters to join Alice by joining a monthly giving program .
Tell them where to find the sign - up page on your website .
2. Encouraging Event Registration .
Promote an upcoming event , emphasizing what attendees will get out of it , and tell people how to RSVP .
On the front side , include an image that represents your event theme or the good work that will come from the money you raise .
3. Urging Print Supporters to Move Online .
Tell them about all the great stuff they are missing if they are n’t going to your website , reading your blog , and subscribing to your e-newsletter .
Make your online offerings can ’t - miss !
On the other side , use a funny cartoon or graphic or a screen capture of something really cool on your website .
Or include a photo of your executive director in an “ I ’m blogging this ” t- shirt .
Here ’s a little more on this from Elizabeth Turnbull .
4. Thanking Your Donors .
Reproduce a thank you note from someone your organization has helped on one side and on the other , give us a little bit of the back story on the person .
Reinforce that it ’s the donors to your organization who really deserve the thanks .
Ask supporters to sign up for your monthly giving program or to take some other action in support of your cause .
5. Empowering Your Supporters .
What can your supporters do on their own , in their own day to day lives , to further your mission and support your cause ?
Give them a quick lesson in how to do something on one side , with a picture of someone doing it on the front .
6. Asking Them to Join You and Others .
Are you planning a rally ?
Do you need calls made to legislators or letters sent to editors ?
State you need them to do , explain the difference it will make , and show your supporters how to join with you and others in making it happen .
Are you using postcards to market your nonprofit ?

It may not be hidden under a mattress but many Australian taxpayers would be unaware they are part - owners in a major stash of pornography .
The erotica collection held by the Government - funded National Film and Sound Archive includes 108 films ranging from soft to hard - core pornography , according to a media report .
Many of the works have been donated by pornography makers over decades with the Archive only paying for one of a list of works obtained under a freedom - of - information request .
Titles held by the archive include , , , , , and s , according to the report .
Archive senior curator Graham Shirley reportedly defended the collection , which he said was a legitimate contribution to Australian cultural history .
It is believed the erotica collection includes films dating back 80 years , documentaries , silent films and some that would now be considered art movies as much as pornography .
The Archive has more than one million images and sound recordings in its collection dating back to 1890 .
Apple 's security culture
The level of secrecy in Apple 's corporate culture is " super paranoid , " say people with experience in the company .
The issue has come into particular focus with news of a liver transplant performed on CEO Steve Jobs , which despite its relevance to workers and investors has been kept outside of public knowledge for two months .
A senior official , typically said to be more open to talking with the media , has refused to disclose anything to the New York Times .
" Just ca n't do it .
Too sensitive , " he says .
The company is also said to impose intense security barriers on workers handling secret projects , such as multiple badge - triggered security doors , followed by number pads for offices .
One former worker observes that workspaces are often monitored by cameras , and that at an extreme level , testers can be forced to cover up products with black cloaks while working .
The cloaks can be removed as necessary , but a red light must be turned on as a warning .
Many employees are known to be as surprised as the public at new product announcements , such as that for the original iPod .
Managers in the company are meanwhile claimed to perpetuate misinformation campaigns , either by denying an interest in concepts secretly being worked on ( such as the iPod shuffle ) or spreading false facts .
Worldwide marketing chief Philip Schiller , for instance , is claimed by another ex-worker to have held several internal meetings in which he deliberately lied about the pricing or features of a product .
Such tactics let the company narrow down leaks , after which the responsible people are typically fired .
The motivation for the security , says former Apple marketing adviser Regis McKenna , stems from the era of the original Macintosh .
Sony and Microsoft discovered the product before it had even launched , and Apple has since attempted to restrict information in a bid to maintain surprise .
The policy also reflects Jobs ' attitude , McKenna adds .
" But what most people do n't understand is that Steve has always been very personal about his life .
He has always kept things close to the vest since I 've known him , and only confided in relatively few people . "
The company may be forced to become more open , at least in regards to Jobs , if an SEC probe turns against Apple 's favor .
American businesses are required to disclose information material to investors , and some have accused the company of deliberately concealing the gravity of Jobs ' recent medical problems .
An official explanation of them involving a " hormonal imbalance " could be contradicted by Jobs ' need for a transplant .
Remember the old Ravage transformer ?
He was the one that could change from a cassette tape into a panther .
Back in the 80’s , cassette tapes were the most widely used technology in the music industry .
But now , in the age of MP3s , what can an old transformer change into to stay relevant ?
A 2gig USB drive of course .

A week - long heatwave is forecast for much of the UK .
How can one keep cool and carry on when the mercury is rising ?
After two less - than - dazzling summers , the sun is back .
Temperatures in parts of the UK this week are expected to top 30° Celsius , prompting the Met Office to issue its first ever heatwave warning .
But the effects of soaring temperatures can be countered .
With some help from the NHS ' Heatwave Plan , here are 10 suggestions - some eminently practical , others a little more ambitious - to help you keep a cool head while all around you are losing theirs .
1 . PAINT YOUR HOUSE WHITE
In many parts of the Mediterranean houses are whitewashed The NHS 's heatwave plan for England suggests using " pale , reflective external paints " to keep your house cool .
It 's something you can see in many of the hottest parts of the world .
Go to areas of Greece or north Africa and whitewashed villages are the norm .
And there 's science behind this .
" It will certainly help , " says physicist Prof Robin Marshall .
" If you make the roof of your house white you will bounce a lot of heat back into the atmosphere . "
Of course , keeping your house white may not be totally straightforward .
In a dry , pollution free area of the Med you may be OK .
If your house is in London , Leeds or Liverpool , you might find it soon loses its reflective qualities .
And titanium oxide paint , which provides the brightest white , may cost a bit .
" Metallic paints are better - they reflect further out into the near infra-red range , " says Prof Mark Dickinson , of Manchester University 's Photon Science Institute .
2 . KEEP OUT OF THE SUN Keep out of the sun between 11 am and 3 pm .
If you go outside , walk or sit in the shade , apply sunscreen regularly and wear a hat .
( To produce vitamin D , which is all important if you want to maintain functioning organs , the body only needs 10 minutes ' exposure without sunscreen once or twice a day .
And it breaks down if you stay too long in the sun . )
3 . CHANGE YOUR DRESS
This Tuareg man seems to believe dark colours are best
The NHS advice says : " Wear light , loosefitting cotton clothes . "
So if white houses keep you cool , then white clothes must also be the best for keeping cool ?
It 's perhaps not quite as simple as that .
If you go to some of the hottest places in the world , people often wear dark colours .
You can find Tuareg tribesmen resplendent in navy blue robes , and Chinese peasants toiling in black .
" I look at what people do who have got experience living in hot sunny climates , " says Prof Marshall .
" They wear black clothing .
" If you can stay out of the sun it will radiate heat off much better .
But if you are in the sun it would be nice to have something on that is white . "
While this Tuareg man prefers white Richard Trillo , author of the Rough Guides to Kenya and West Africa , knows a thing or two about dressing to stay cool .
He advocates loose cotton trousers , where shorts are not an option .
But there are other things to bear in mind as well .
" Do n't carry anything in your pockets .
I find even a credit card in my pocket is noticeably uncomfortable .
It is covering up a bit of skin surface .
" If you can bear to have a short haircut , do so , it makes you so much more comfortable . "
4 . SHUT SOME WINDOWS
Shut windows exposed to the sun , and draw blinds or curtains against the light .
Open these at night , or once the sun has moved off , to let in cooler air .
5 . TREES AND PLANTS
Trees offer shade and other benefits " Trees , plants and green spaces act as natural air conditioners , provide shade and absorb carbon dioxide , " says the NHS 's plan .
If you 're in a warmer part of the British Isles , pop a palm tree in front of your house and it will soon be blocking out the sun .
And there 's a chance you 'll be contributing to a wider effort .
Trees pump out moisture .
6 . BOWLS OF WATER
You can get the same effect in the house , not just with plants , but by leaving bowls of water around .
" Evaporation helps cool the air , " says the plan .
Of course , if humidity is not your thing , you may want to ignore this advice .
7 . DRINK WELL Keep hydrated with cold drinks , and eat foods with high water content such as fruit and salad .
A chilled lager or iced tea may seem refreshing , but avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages .
8 . INSULATION Insulate lofts and cavity walls - this helps keep the heat out when the weather is hot , and in when the mercury drops .
This may be more practical than painting your house white , says Prof Dickinson .
" It all depends on what your house is made of .
If it 's good at keeping heat in , it 's good at keeping heat out . "
9 . SASH WINDOWS
Not one from the NHS , but one that would please the Victorians , is proper use of your sash windows .
The simple fact is that many of those who own homes with sash windows do n't open them in the right way .
We should be leaving equal gaps at the top and bottom of the window .
The theory , explored by researchers at Imperial College London , is that cool comes in through the lower opening and warm air is pushed out through the top .
10 . RELAX Avoid over - doing physical exertion .
Reaching for a cold drink ought to raise enough of a sweat as it is .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Some of the best ways to stay cool seem counter - intuitive .
Drinking hot tea , getting a good dose of chilli heat and wearing a vest under a shirt are all effective ways of staying cool , because they make us sweat .
Sweat is our bodies natural defence against over heating .
The sweat cools us down , no matter how unpleasant that may be , without it we 'd die .
Wearing a vest utilises the sweat response to the best effect , and something I learnt from a Greek barman , it wicks the sweat away from the body , gets nice and cool as you move around and stops nasty sweatspots from appearing on your shirt .
Luke , London
If you 're at home or pottering about in the garden or you 're in any situation where your personal appearance is n't too important , wetting a t - shirt , wringing it out and putting it on will cool you for as long as the shirt remains damp .
The principle of air conditioning means that the coolness of the wet t- shirt will help to conduct heat away from your torso through evaporation .
Ladies who do n't wear bras should exercise some consideration when applying this method .
Rob White , Nr Portsmouth UK
Points one to ten very useful , another good tip is to leave the loft hatch open where possible this seems to help with the hot air rising .
Kim Sussex , Andover Can I add number 11 ?
Come to Edinburgh .
Heatwave ... what heatwave ?
We 've had fog in the morning , if it burns off by mid afternoon we might see a bit of sun , then the fog returns in the evening and it's not exactly heatwave temperatures , more like 19 - 22C !
Lesley , Edinburgh , Scotland
When excessively hot try the two t- shirt method .
Start with two t- shirts in tepid water .
Wear one , as it dries it will remove latent heat from the body .
When it has dried off , change shirts don the wet one and put the dry one in the tepid water .
Repeat as necessary .
We use this method in - house only .
Brian Lloyd , Saskatoon Canada Before air conditioning the people who lived in our house would sprinkle water on their sheets before going to bed .
This kept them cool to go to sleep and the house cooled itself before morning .
Helen Rekerdre , Dallas , Texas , USA Buy an electric FAN .....
Junaid , Lahore , Pakistan
A cool or cold drink is not always the best option , my wise old dad , who served much of the Second World War in North Africa always advises a hot cup of tea , and going to hot countries you 'll find that 's what people drink .
In hot weather a hot cuppa and a good strong curry !
There is a logic to this , both make you sweat , sweat on the skin will pick up any breeze there is and cool you down !

After the polls close on Election Day , the task of counting the votes begins .
Each city and state use a different method to collect and tabulate ballots .
Some are electronic , others paper - based .
But the process of counting votes is generally the same no matter where you live and vote .
Preparations
As soon as the last voter has voted , the election judge at each polling place makes sure poll workers have sealed all of the ballot boxes and then sends the sealed ballot boxes to a central vote - counting facility .
This is usually a government office , like a city hall or county courthouse .
If digital voting machines are used , the election judge will send the media on which the votes are recorded to the counting facility .
The ballot boxes or computer media are usually transported to the counting facility by sworn law enforcement officers .
At the central counting facility , certified observers representing the political parties or candidates watch the actual vote counting to make sure the count is fair .
Paper Ballots
In areas where paper ballots are still used , election officials manually read each ballot and add up the number of votes in each race .
Sometimes two or more election officials read each ballot to ensure accuracy .
Since these ballots are filled out manually , the voter 's intention can sometimes be unclear .
In these cases , the election judge either decides how the voter intended to vote or declares that the ballot in question will not be counted .
The most common problem with manual vote - counting is , of course , human error .
This can also be an issue with punch - card ballots , as you 'll see .
Punch Cards
Where punch - card ballots are used , election officials open each ballot box , manually count the number of ballots cast , and run the ballots through a mechanical punch card reader .
The software in the card reader records the votes in each race and prints out totals .
If the total number of ballot cards read by the card reader does not match the manual count , the election judge can order the ballots recounted .
Problems can occur when the ballot cards stick together while being run through the card reader , the reader malfunctions , or the voter has damaged the ballot .
In extreme cases , the election judge can order the ballots to be read manually .
Punch card ballots and their infamous " hanging chads " led to the controversial vote count in Florida during the 2000 presidential election .
Mail - In Ballots

Nine states and the District of Columbia now offer universal “ vote by mail ” systems in which the states mail ballots to all registered voters .﻿﻿
In most other states , voters are required to request an absentee ballot .
In the 2016 election , almost 25 % ( 33 million ) of all votes were cast using either universal mail or absentee ballots .﻿﻿
An estimated 80 million mail - in ballots are expected to be counted in the 2020 presidential election .﻿﻿
Vote - by - mail has proven extremely popular with voters because of its convenience and recently its potential for avoiding the COVID - 19 pandemic health risks associated with large crowds at in - person polling places .
Despite claims that the use of mail - in ballots increases fraudulent voting , several anti-fraud protections are built into the process .
Once local election officials receive the mailed ballot , they check to voter ’s name to ensure the person is registered to vote and is casting their ballot from their registered address .
Once those facts are confirmed , the sealed ballot is removed from the outside envelope containing the voter signature to ensure that the voter ’s preferences remain confidential .
On Election Day — but never before — state election officials count the mail - in ballots .
The results of the mail - in votes are then added to the number of votes cast in persons .
People who attempt to defraud the mail - in voting system can be charged with election fraud and face fines , prison time , or both .
According to Ellen Weintraub , commissioner of the Federal Election Commission , “ There is simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud . ” ﻿﻿
Digital Ballots
With the newer , fully computerized voting systems , including optical scan and direct - recording electronic systems , the vote totals may be transmitted automatically to the central counting facility .
In some cases , these devices record their votes on removable media , such as hard disks or cassettes , which are transported to the central counting facility for counting .
According to the Pew Research Center , nearly half of all Americans use optical - scan voting systems , and about a quarter use direct - recording voting machines .﻿﻿
Like any electronic device , these voting machines are vulnerable to hacking , at least in theory , experts say .﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
Recounts and Other Issues
Whenever the results of an election are very close , or problems have occurred with the voting equipment , one or more of the candidates often demand a recount of the votes .
Some state laws call for mandatory recounts in any close election .
The recounts may be done by a manual hand - count of ballots or by the same type of machines used to make the original count .
Recounts do sometimes change the outcome of an election .
In almost all elections , some votes are lost or incorrectly counted due to voter mistakes , faulty voting equipment , or errors by election officials .
From local elections to presidential elections , officials are constantly working to improve the voting process , with the goal of making sure that every vote is counted and counted correctly .
Of course , there remains one absolutely certain way to make sure your vote will not be counted : do n't vote .
Effect of 2016 Russian Interference on Future Vote Counting
Since Special Counsel Robert Mueller issued his Report on the Investigation Into the Russia Interference in The 2016 Presidential Election in March 2019 , ﻿﻿ the U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation intended to reform the voting process and protect future elections .
While the Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced two similar bipartisan bills on election security , they have yet to be debated by the full Senate .
In addition , several states have announced plans to replace their current voting machines and computerized vote - counting systems with more modern and hacker - proof equipment before the 2020 presidential election .﻿﻿
According to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice , local election officials in 254 jurisdictions across 37 states plan to purchase new voting equipment in the “ near future . ” ﻿﻿
Election officials in 31 of the 37 states hope to replace their equipment before the 2020 election .﻿﻿
In 2002 , Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act allocating funds to help states strengthen their election security .﻿﻿
The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2018 included $ 380 million to help states beef up election security , and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 authorized an additional $ 425 million for this purpose .﻿﻿
Well , this is interesting .
We already have a Mono item ruffling some feathers on OSNews today , but here we have the apparent news that Tomboy has become a default part of GNOME on Squeeze , the next release of Debian .
Wait , what now ?
Update : I ’ve updated the article with Fedora ’s position in all this .
Read on !
Update II : Josselin Mouette replies .
The matter is all a bit confusing , but from what I understand now , Josselin Mouette has made Tomboy a dependency for GNOME on Debian Squeeze , which means that Mono is now part of GNOME for Debian Squeeze as well .
This seems rather odd , because Debian never seemed to be too keen on including Mono .
The news got out via a blog post by Debian maintainer Robert Millan , who maintains the Gnote package for Debian – Gnote is a non-Mono replacement for Tomboy written in C ++.
He writes that he is not particularly happy with this move , because he believes that a note taking application should n’t be part of the default selection anyway , especially not one which drags 50 MB of dependencies onto the first CD .
What makes this story so confusing is that Josselin Mouette points to bug # 532355 as rationale for the inclusion of Tomboy .
This bug advocates Gnote as an alternative for Tomboy ; Tomboy was , up until now , a “ recommended ” , but optional , package .
Gnote was promoted as an alternative since Tomboy ’s architecture support is limited , a problem Gnote does n’t have .
And here comes what confuses me : Mouette claims that because we have Gnote now as an alternative to Tomboy , Tomboy can become a dependency because Gnote can come into play on architectures Mono does n’t support .
In addition , Gnote can serve as an alternative for people who do n’t want Tomboy because of the 50 MB issue .
Which makes me wonder : why not just go for Gnote altogether ?
I ’m sure this wo n’t be the last time we hear of this .
Update
Indeed , this was n’t the last we heard from this .
Fedora Project leader Paul W. Frields expressed his concern over Mono .
“ We do have some serious concerns about Mono and we ’ll continue to look at it with our legal counsel to see what if any steps are needed on our part , ” Frields said .
It could be the case that Mono will be excluded from the repositories for Fedora 12 .
The reason for this is that Gnote will replace Tomboy in Fedora 12 .
CANNES , France ( Reuters ) - Danish director Lars von
Trier elicited derisive laughter , gasps of disbelief , a smattering of applause and loud boos on Sunday as the credits rolled on his drama “ Antichrist ” at the Cannes film festival .
The film , starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple seeking to overcome the grief of losing their only child , has quickly become the most talked - about at this year ’s festival , which ends on May 24 .
Cannes ’ notoriously picky critics and press often react audibly to films during screenings , but Sunday evening ’s viewing was unusually demonstrative .
Jeers and laughter broke out during scenes ranging from a talking fox to graphically - portrayed sexual mutilation .
Many viewers in the large Debussy cinema also appeared to take objection to von Trier ’s decision to dedicate his film to the revered Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky .
Applause from a handful of viewers was drowned out by booing at the end .
Antichrist opens with a heavily stylized , black - and - white , slow - motion portrayal of the child ’s accidental death set to soaring music by Handel .
Dafoe ’s character , who is a therapist , tries to help his wife deal with her grief and encourages her to come off heavy medication that sedates her for weeks after the death .
They decide to go to an isolated wooden cabin in an unspecified forest to recover , but the woman Gainsbourg portrays loses control of her senses .
The abuse she submits herself and her husband to drew shocked gasps from the audience .
The reaction suggested that von Trier , who won the top prize in Cannes with “ Dancer in the Dark ” in 2000 , could be in for a rough ride from reviewers and journalists on Monday .
One U.S. critic said he and others found the film “ offensive , ” and questioned why it was included in the main competition of 20 films in Cannes .
In production notes for Antichrist , the 53 - year - old director said that the movie was a “ kind of therapy ” for depression he was suffering from two years ago .
“ I can offer no excuse for ‘ Antichrist ’ ... other than my absolute belief in the film -- the most important film of my entire career ! ”

Security forces surrounded the hijacked plane A gunman who hijacked a passenger plane in Montego Bay , Jamaica , has surrendered after police and soldiers boarded the jet , say officials .
Six crew members held hostage by the man were released unharmed .
More than 150 passengers were on board when the man forced his way onto the Canada - bound plane demanding passage to Cuba , but were released within hours .
The hijacker , believed to be a 20 - year - old local man , was described by the authorities as " troubled " .
Jamaican Information Minister Daryl Vaz told the BBC the incident had ended " without any injuries or harm " .
He said the authorities had been " getting nowhere with the negotiations " with the hijacker .
" Police and military went on the plane and captured him , " he said .
Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding flew in to Montego Bay and offered support to the passengers .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , currently in Jamaica on a one - day visit following the recent Summit of the Americas in Trinidad , telephoned Mr Golding to congratulate him " for the successful resolution " , his spokesman said .
' No - one hurt '
The aircraft was bound for Halifax , Nova Scotia , but was due to stop in Santa Clara in Cuba on the way .

The gunman reportedly checked in for the flight then forced his way past checkpoints and went on board around 2230 local time ( 0330 GMT ) , brandishing a firearm .
He is said to have robbed passengers , most of whom were released after half an hour .
Police and security services closed and cordoned off the airport and surrounded the plane as the situation developed .
The charter airline that owns the Boeing 737 plane , CanJet , said 182 people , including 174 passengers , were due to travel on the flight .
But reports said only 159 passengers had been on board when the incident began .
CanJet 's Vice - President and General Manager , Ken Woodside , told an earlier news conference that a shot may have been fired outside the aircraft , but no - one was hit .
Two of the passengers were held for several hours before being released , according to reports .
Most passengers , all of whom are Canadian , were taken to a local hospital , some of them suffering from shock .
The parents of Christian Gosselin , a passenger on the flight , said he had telephoned them and appeared " very shaken up and calm at the same time " .
" Passengers were asked to give out all their money , " Mr Gosselin 's father , Alphonse , told Canada 's CBC news channel .
" [ Christian ] told his girlfriend to hide their passports in her back pocket , and also their credit cards , " he said .
Mr Vaz told the BBC the authorities had not yet been able to establish how the armed man managed to pass security .
He said an investigation had been started and would be " pursued vigorously " so the authorities could identity security breaches .
Mr Vaz has described the hijacker as a " mentally challenged youngster " who was demanding to be flown to Cuba .
Correspondents say security at Montego Bay 's Sangster International Airport is normally very good .
The airport , one of the most modern in the Caribbean , handles about four million passengers a year .

Anti-choice groups across the nation are busy insisting that since they did n't personally pull the trigger , their protests , harassment , and hate speech are not to blame for the murder of Kansas abortion provider Dr. George Tiller .

Anti-choice groups across the nation are busy insisting
that since they did n’t personally pull the trigger , their protests ,
harassment , and hate speech are not to blame for the murder of Kansas abortion provider Dr. George Tiller .
Yet some anti-choice
activists — even now — seem only too happy to aid and abet the crazy ones who will resort to violence .
Or else why , three days after the
assassination of a medical doctor who provides late - term abortions , did
Jill Stanek post on her blog photographs
of the clinic of Dr. LeRoy Carhart , another physician who provides
late - term abortions and who has said he is willing to take over providing
services at Dr. Tiller ’s clinic ?
By way of introduction , Stanek writes , " Let ’s take a station break to
view photos of Carhart ’s " nondescript building , " taken in March 2009 on
the day it reopened following refurbishment after a fire ( NOT blamed on
pro-lifers ) .
It was almost immediately shut down because Carhart
reopened without getting an occupancy permit , as I previously reported , and was running his electricity off a generator … "
She and her readers just want " to take a look . "
Why ?
She wants to prove her point that it ’s a dingy building ?
Over Carhart ’s safety , and the safety of his staff and patients ?
Combine
that with Operation Rescue senior policy advisor Cheryl Sullenger ’s
admission , just reported by McClatchey , that she provided information to suspect Scott Roeder about
Tiller ’s planned court appearances when Tiller was tried for performing illegal
abortions .
( Sullenger ’s name and the Operation Rescue phone number were found on a
note in the dashboard of Roeder ’s car . ) " [ Sullenberger ] said Roeder ’s interest was in court hearings involving Tiller .
‘He
would call and say , " When does court start ?
When ’s the next hearing ? " ’
Sullenger said .
‘ I was polite enough to give him the information .
I had
no reason not to .
Who knew ?
Who knew , you know what I mean ? ’ ”
Who knew ?
When Tiller was on trial in mid-March of this year , local police had — thirteen years ago — found materials
to make a bomb in Roeder ’s vehicle .
On Operation Rescue ’s own website ,
in a page dating back to 2007 , a person identifying as Scott Roeder had
posted a comment saying , " Bleass [ sic ] everyone for attending and
praying in May to bring justice to Tiller and the closing of his death
camp .
Sometime soon , would it be feasible to organize as many people as
possible to attend Tillers church ( inside , not just outside ) to have
much more of a presence and possibly ask questions of the Pastor ,
Deacons , Elders and members while there ?
Does n’t seem like it would
hurt anything but bring more attention to Tiller . "
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .
SUBSCRIBE
In other words , Roeder had a clear history of intention to commit
violence and an avowed commitment to " bring[ing ] justice to Tiller and
the closing of his death camp . "
And Sullenger was still " politely "
handing him information about Tiller ’s whereabouts ?
Just as Jill
Stanek is now still posting photographs of Dr. Carhart ’s clinic ?
As if they needed reminding , the antis now know exactly how low their brethren can stoop .
Should they really be giving them more ammunition ?
What does the so - called pro-life community say about the posting of these pictures now ?
If another act of violence is committed , will they disavow that ?
UPDATE 6/04/2009 4:00 pm ET : Rachel Maddow discussed Roeder ’s connection to Operation Rescue on her show last night .

PostgreSQL is one of the world 's leading Open Source databases and it provides enormous flexibility as well as extensibility .
One of the key features of PostgreSQL is that users can define their own procedures and functions in basically any known programming language .
With the means of functions it is possible to write basically any server side codes easily .
Now , all this extensibility is basically not new .
What does it all have to do with scaling and then ?
Well , imagine a world where the data in your database and enormous computing power are tightly integrated .
Imagine a world where data inside your database has direct access to hundreds of FPUs .
Welcome to the world of CUDA , NVIDIA 's way of making the power of graphics cards available to normal , high - performance applications .
When it comes to complex computations databases might very well turn out to be a bottleneck .
Depending on your application it might easily happen that adding more CPU power does not improve the overall performance of your system – the reason for that is simply that bringing data from your database to those units which actually do the computations is ways too slow ( maybe because of remote calls and so on ) .
Especially when data is flowing over a network , copying a lot of data might be limited by network latency or simply bandwidth .
What if this bottleneck could be avoided ?
Basically a CUDA program is simple a C program with some small extensions .
The CUDA subsystem transforms your CUDA program to normal C code which can then be compiled and linked nicely with existing code .
This also means that CUDA code can basically be used to work inside a PostgreSQL stored procedure easily .
The advantages of this mechanism are obvious : GPUs can do matrix and FPU related operations hundreds of times faster than any CPUthe GPU is used inside the database and thus no data has to be transported over slow linesbasically any NVIDIA graphics card can be usedyou get enormous computing power for virtually zero costyou can even build functional indexes on top of CUDA stored proceduresnot so many boxes are needed because one box is ways fasterHow to make this all work now ?
The goal for this simplistic example is to generate a set of random number on the CPU , copy it to the GPU and make the code callable from PostgreSQL .
Here is the function to generate random numbers and to copy them to the GPU :/* implement random generator and copy to CUDA */nn_precision*generate_random_numbers ( int number_of_values)nn_precision * cuda_float_p ;/* allocate host memory and CUDA memory */ nn_precision * host_p = ( nn_precision *)pg_palloc(sizeof( nn_precision ) * number_of_values ) ; CUDATOOLS_SAFE_CALL (
cudaMalloc ( ( void ** ) &cuda_float_p , sizeof( nn_precision ) * number_of_values ) ) ;/* create random numbers */ for ( int i = 0 ; i < number_of_values ; i++) host_p[i ] = ( nn_precision ) drand48 ( ) ;/* copy data to CUDA and return pointer to CUDA structure */ CUDATOOLS_SAFE_CALL ( cudaMemcpy( cuda_float_p , host_p , sizeof( nn_precision ) * number_of_values , cudaMemcpyHostToDevice ) ) ; return cuda_float_p
; Now we can go and call this function from a PostgreSQL stored procedure :
This code then now be nicely compiled just like any other PostgreSQL C extension .
The test random function can be called just like this :
Of course this is a just brief introduction to see how things can practically be done .
A more realistic application will need more thinking and can be integrated into the database even more closely .
UPDATED EXCLUSIVE :
Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday said he is concerned about U.S. forces withdrawing from Iraqi cities within 24 hours .
Mr. Cheney told The Washington Times ’ “ America ’s Morning News ” radio show that he is a strong believer in Gen. Ray Odierno , commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , and that the general is doing what needs to be done .
“ But what he says concerns me : That there is still a continuing problem .
One might speculate that insurgents are waiting as soon as they get an opportunity to launch more attacks . ”
More than 250 people have died in Iraq during the past week in attacks and bombings , which appear designed to shake the government ’s confidence and reignite sectarian fighting .
Much of the violence is in northeastern Baghdad , where hostile acts have occurred about once every other day .
TWT RELATED ARTICLES :

“ I hope the Iraqis can deal with it , ” Mr. Cheney said .
“ At some point they have to stand on their own , but I would not want to see the U.S. waste all the tremendous sacrifice that has gotten us to this point . ”
On Monday , several police officers reportedly were killed trying to defuse bombs , one under a car and another under a bridge .
In anticipation of more violence , the Iraqi government has banned motorcycles in Baghdad and has increased ID checks and checkpoint security .
Gen. David H. Petraeus , commander of the U.S. Central Command , also has expressed concern about the recent bombings but said the average is about 10 to 15 a day , compared with 160 in June 2007 .
The United States now has roughly 130,000 military troops in Iraq who will remain outside major cities to train Iraqi police and provide protection for remaining allied forces .
The Pentagon wants to reduce the number to 50,000 by the end of next summer and have all U.S. forces out of the country by the end of 2011 .
Iraqi Gen .
Abud Kambar al - Malliki warned militias earlier this month that his forces are ready to fight “ if you attack our citizens . ”
Gen. Odierno said Sunday on CNN ’s “ State of the Union ” that Iraqi forces are ready .
“ They ’ve been working toward this for a long time , ” he said , “ and security remains good .
We ’ve seen constant improvement in the security force ; we ’ve seen constant improvement in governance .
And I believe this is the time for us to move out of the cities and for them to take ultimate responsibility . ”
Iraqis began celebrating Monday , ahead of the transition Tuesday , which the Iraqi government has declared National Sovereignty Day , a public holiday .
Mr. Cheney said the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon ’s recent elections and Iranians challenging the recent election results in which incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected proves the Bush - Cheney doctrine has had a “ significant impact throughout the Middle East . ”
“ The young men and women on the streets of Tehran is proof positive of the universal desire of people to be free , which President Bush talked about , ” he said .
“ It ’s been a remarkable development .
I hope ultimately they ’re successful . ”
Mr. Cheney said President Obama is learning a difficult lesson in responding to the post-election violence .
The Iranian government says dozens have been killed in the street marches to demand a vote recount .
Protesters say as many as 200 have been killed .
“ Any time you have a brand - new administration , it has to find its balance , ” he said .
“ The lesson that comes out of this is governing is far different than campaigning … .
If you ’re the one sitting in the chair in the Oval Office , it ’s a lot tougher than looking in from the outside . ”

Rocket stoves are used for cooking , heating water , and space heating –the primary advantages of one is that they use much less fuel than a traditional
open wood fire , they ’re easy to make cheaply , and produce much less pollution !
The rocket stove burns fuel very efficiently by operating at a very high temperature and by making sure that there is a good air draft into the fire , controlled use of fuel , complete combustion of volatiles , and efficient use of the resulting heat .
It has been used for
cooking purposes in many hastily constructed and therefore poorly equipped camps and bases in third - world countries ( notably the Rwandan refugee camps ) and for space heating and water heating .
Try making one yourself , it ’s cheap and wo n’t take long at all :

Greed was calculated by comparing average incomes with the total number of inhabitants living beneath the poverty line .
Envy was calculated using the total number of thefts – robbery , burglary , larceny and stolen cars .
Wrath was calculated by comparing the total number of violent crimes – murder , assault and rape – reported to the FBI per capita .
Lust was calculated by compiling the number of sexually transmitted diseases – HIV , AIDS , syphilis , chlamydia and gonorrhea – reported per capita .
Gluttony was calculated by counting the number of fast food restaurants per capita .
Sloth was calculated by comparing expenditures on arts , entertainment and recreation with the rate of employment .

" The Lebanese people voted Sunday and Iran 's mullahs lost , " said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
The U.S. - supported " March 14 " coalition boosted its parliamentary majority by one seat , and Hezbollah — the terrorist " Party of God " underwritten and armed by Tehran — lost a seat .
This shows why President Obama should follow the example of George W. Bush by making the promotion of democracy a priority as he reaches out to the Muslim world .
It 's tempting to read too much into the results of the Lebanese election , said Thomas Friedman in The New York Times , but it was encouraging to see " moderates stand their ground and win somewhere — with ballots , not bullets , no less . "
And judging by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah 's strikingly conciliatory concession speech , even Iran 's puppet knows " there is a power in all those people , all the little old ladies , who voted against " the vision of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and for the vision of President Obama .
" All of this will reinforce the standing of Mr. Obama , " said The Washington Post in an editorial , whose closely watched speech in Cairo last week " was aimed at swaying opinion in Muslim countries away from extremists " like Nasrallah , Ahmadinejad , and Osama bin Laden .
But this should also challenge Obama 's view that " elections alone do not make true democracy , " as he put it in Cairo .
Let 's hope that this vote serves as a reminder of their value .
During the E3 convention on the show floor , the PlayStation Lifestyle staff sat down with Quantic Dream , developer of Heavy Rain for an interview and a short playthrough of the E3 2009 demo .
The developer reiterates that Heavy Rain is a mature game and deals with extremely mature elements .
An interesting piece of information discussed in the interview was the fact that every character in the game , and all their choresponding movements , were motion captured by actual actors .
Even the crowd characters were given just as much dedication to detail as the main characters .
In other words , no two characters will be alike , regardless of their importance in the game .
Even though a checkpoint system is in place , Quantic Dream urges players to continue through the game to understand the consequences of their actions .
Heavy Rain is expected to hit store shelves Q1 2010 .

Would you like to join me in working on answering / clarifying SCO 's handiwork ?
If so , let 's get started .
To those who are accustomed to old - fashioned journalism , this means this article is the beginning of a group work , one which will keep changing massively for a couple of days , or until you see me post an update notice that we 're finished with the article .
I am republishing the transcript here in full , so we can interject corrected information throughout .
As I see your comments , I 'll copy and paste in your additional finds .
Or just email me , if you prefer .
Please provide urls for proof of any statements you make , as appropriate .
Courts care about evidence , not opinions .
That 's why SCO included 118 footnotes .
I doubt the judge will look up all 118 footnotes , because he may not have the time , and even if he did , he wo n't know where to find countervailing information , at least until IBM and Novell and the US Trustee respond , which I expect they will .
But let 's do it for ourselves , for the fun of it , particularly because SCO has regurgitated almost all of its failed arguments from the IBM and Novell Utah cases in this one filing , so it 'll be a way to capture the last six years of that litigation and put it all in one place .
Then when someone asks you for an overview , you can point them here .
To make it very clear when Groklaw is commenting on the text , I 'll put our responses in colored text .
And for those who are color - blind , look for the material between the rows of stars .
I have some remarks already inserted in the text , but there will be a lot more .
This is one of the moments when I wish Google 's Wave was already available and part of Geeklog !
How perfectly it would handle this task , and you all could join in , instead of me having to search for your input myself .
But while I live in hope on that score , we can still get the job done .
If you vaguely remember some document filed in one of the many SCO litigations , you may find this page particularly helpful in finding all the major Timeline pages on Groklaw , the Timelines being our lists of documents filed in each litigation .
It also has the link to the massive collection of exhibits that IBM filed in support of its many summary judgment motions .
Also the search app can help you .
Do n't forget the ArchiveExplorer , particularly if you are looking for something on a Groklaw static page , and the simple chronological list , Archives , which you can also search by keyword .
I find that helpful , particularly when I remember the general time frame something happened .
And if all else fails , at least leave a comment telling us what you recall , and someone else will build on your work and someone will surely find it .

INTRODUCTION

* Will * rehabilitate SCO ?
Or * might *?
Here are the three issues SCO listed in its appeal in SCO v. Novell : ( 1 ) SCO 's predecessor - in - interest , The Santa Cruz Operation , Inc. ( " Santa Cruz " ) , purchased the UNIX operating system business from Novell under an Asset Purchase Agreement ( " APA " ) .
Did the district court err in concluding , as a matter of law , that Santa Cruz did not obtain the copyrights to the UNIX and UnixWare source code under the APA , but only an implied license ?
( 2 ) Did the district court err in concluding , as a matter of law , that if the APA did not itself transfer the copyrights , then SCO is not entitled to specific performance , requiring the transfer of the copyrights now ?
( 3 ) Did the district court err in concluding , as a matter of law , that Novell has the right under the APA to force SCO to waive legal claims against IBM for its breach of Software and Sublicensing Agreements that Novell had sold to Santa Cruz under the APA ? ( 4 ) Did the district court err in concluding that if Novell has the right under the APA to waive SCO 's rights against IBM , then Novell did not have to comply with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in exercising that right ?
( 5 ) Did the district court err in concluding , as a matter of law , that Novell retained an interest in royalties from SCO 's 2003 agreement with Sun Microsystems ( " Sun " ) and other post - APA contracts related to SVRX technology ?
Suppose the court were to rule that the district court judge did err , let 's say on all the issues on appeal .
Then what ?
Likely they would sent it back to Utah District Court for a jury to decide it .
Let 's say they find that SCO does n't have to pay Novell royalties on the Sun deal .
Would that rehabilitate SCO ?
OK .
I agree .
It would reduce their liabilities , but it would not rehabilitate SCO .
What about if the jury found that Novell lacked the right to compel SCO to waive .
Would that rehabilitate SCO financially ?
How could it ?
It merely would give SCO the right to go forward in litigation without Novell 's ability to block .
So , really it 's only if SCO can get both the appeals court to send it back to a jury AND get the jury to rule that the copyrights did pass from Novell to SCO in 1995 AND then successfully sue IBM and others for infringed copyrights that it can get any money from the litigation at all .
I consider that virtually impossible as far as IBM goes , because after all the motion practice , SCO did n't show any specific infringement in Linux .
Remember the Magistrate Judge 's famous question to SCO , " Is that all you 've got ? "
So here we see SCO assuming a better than the best - case scenario , against all reason , as far as I 'm concerned , since we already know what SCO put on its list , and there 's nothing there to get a fortune from .
I doubt there is anyone on the planet who is n't directly involved in the case who has followed it any closer than I have , and that 's what I 've been seeing .
And here 's what SCO told the appeals court was the reason why it needed the court to expedite the case : 3 . In addition , SCO is currently involved in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in Delaware and recently filed a proposed reorganization plan .
The Bankruptcy Court will address the plan during the next few months .
A significant aspect of that plan is designed to protect SCO and keep it operating as a going concern until this appeal is resolved .
Accordingly , the sooner this appeal is resolved , the sooner the four related cases can proceed in an orderly and expeditious manner and the sooner SCO will be able to execute its plan to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings .
And here we are in bankruptcy court , with no such plan on the table at all .
Naughty , naughty .
***************************
Against this backdrop , the Motions can be seen for what they are -- ploys by IBM and Novell to avoid responsibility for their actions against the estate on the pretense that they are now acting in its interests .

Even if that were so -- and in the case of Novell a court has already ruled Novell was not guilty of slander of title against SCO , despite SCO 's claims -- what about the US Trustee 's Office ?
It filed first , ahead of IBM and Novell to convert SCO to Chapter 7 .
*****************************
As of their last quarterly filings , IBM , currently listed as No. 14 among the Fortune 500 , is a global company with a market capitalization of $ 128 billion and Novell is a global company with a market capitalization of approximately $ 1.42 billion .
It strains credulity for such behemoths to argue that Novell 's $ 3.5 million judgment against SCO -- and not their desire to neutralize the threat that SCO 's rights pose to their interests and to avoid billions of dollars in
1
***************************
Might that be explained by looking at the list of the 20 largest creditors , a list which does n't include , by SCO 's counting , either IBM or Novell ?
It 's folks like SCO 's lawyers , their trial experts , Canopy Group , Sun Microsystems , Microsoft Licensing , and Amici , the document production company Boies uses .
Also look at the amounts for those who are not insiders of some type .
The amounts are relatively low , low enough that they may not feel it 's cost effective to try to get money from SCO , particularly if they 've been watching this long song and dance .
It 's the same reason , or one of them , why I have n't sued them myself , the absolute unlikelihood of there being anything to collect .
Litigation of any kind has to pay , or it's not worth doing .
**********************
Instead , the Debtors expect that several have asked or will ask the Court to deny the Motion .
******************************
Again , look at the list .
***********************************
SCO 's claims against IBM and Novell stem from their concerted efforts to promote the Linux operating system at the expense of SCO 's core asset , the UNIX operating system and intellectual property .
SCO 's claims are supported by evidence that IBM contributed valuable UNIX - derived technology to Linux development in order to transform Linux from a hobbyist 's program into a viable competitor .
SCO 's claims are supported by such IBM admissions as Linux is " Derived from UNIX " and that " UNIX was a pre-write of Linux , " and by credible and extensive expert testimony that Linux is indeed a derivative of UNIX under the Copyright Act .
****************************
SCO does n't mention it here , but some expert testimony , particularly with respect to methods and concepts , will not be part of the SCO v. IBM trial .
It was specifically excluded by the Magistrate Judge , as a sanction for trying to " litigate by ambush " by trying to introduce new evidence by expert reports for the first time , after discovery was closed .
Here 's IBM 's successful motion on the point .
SCO is consequently restricted to whatever it had put on the table by the court deadline for SCO to tell the court and IBM all allegedly misused materials .
So a fair amount of what SCO is talking about , testimony from three of SCO 's eight experts , is no longer part of the case , and it wo n't be , no matter what the appeals court rules in the Novell case .
Here 's who the three are , so you will have that knowledge to guide you as you read this new SCO document , from IBM 's motion : Despite this , three of SCO 's May 19 , 2006 expert reports , those of Drs. Cargill and Ivie and Mr. Rochkind , significantly exceed the scope of the Final Disclosures -- indeed , Dr. Cargill 's report effectively seeks to reinvent the case , introducing both new categories of allegedly misused material and a new theory of recovery which relates to them .
The Rochkind and Ivie Reports also exceed the Final Disclosures , adding material never before disclosed by SCO .
So when SCO quotes from these three ( note footnote 100 ) , it means absolutely nothing as far as SCO 's hopes at trial are concerned .
********************************
By seeking to liquidate SCO before the Tenth Circuit decides critical issues underlying SCO 's claims , SCO and Novell seek to avoid responsibility for their actions in support of Linux -- precisely the actions that damaged SCO 's business to the point of bankruptcy .
************************
What sent SCO into bankruptcy was its own decision to sue Novell for " slander of title " , a claim they had almost no chance of winning , and they did n't prevail , and in the course of all that , they ended up owing Novell quite a lot , and that is what propelled them into bankruptcy , not any support of Linux on the part of IBM or Novell .
Boies Schiller got a cool million as a retainer in 2003 , under the terms laid out in this letter , plus at the time it was contemplated that there would also be shares given to the firm .
It was touted as a contingency arrangement primarily , however .
Some months later , SCO agreed to pay them another $ 1.6 million in licensing fees , presumably from the investment deals .
That letter said Boies would also get SCO shares , but that was later changed , and instead there was a lump sum payment of $ 12.6 million for work already done , and for the future , up through appeals , they were paid another $ 12 million .
This does n't cover expenses or experts fees , which Boies had warned in the retainer letter could come to a million or more .
Expenses have been amazing also .
Boies Schiller billed SCO in just the year prior to the bankruptcy for $ 887,523.55 , according to Stuart Singer 's Declaration , when Boies Schiller asked the bankruptcy court to let it be SCO 's special litigation counsel .
And on the list of creditors , SCO is shown owing Boies Schiller $ 287,256.39 for expenses .
So that 's another million and then some right there , and that 's after the cap on legal fees .
And if there were a victory or settlement on favorable terms , Boies Schiller gets a contingency fee , at least 33 percent up to $ 350 million .
If the award is more , the fee goes up too .
As Darl McBride described the arrangement in a November 18 , 2003 teleconference :
And if we have a license fee , as we succeed then the Boies firm will succeed .
As we have success in the courtroom , the Boies firm will also share in that success ....
We 've had some licensing events occur , and we 've shared that with David .
We 've had some successful events to get some money in here , we 've shared that with David .
That 's going to help us go out and fight this next battle , OK ?
So we went out and said we 're setting up for the long haul here , we 've raised $ 50 million , we did n't raise $ 50 million to get CD interest sitting over in the bank .
We 've brought this money in . . . now in this case we 're able to -- David 's coming in at a partnership level , he 's coming in , he 's taking stock for the most part .
He 's coming in with his firm and we 're going after this in a very strong partnership way .
So we could n't be more pleased with getting him on board with this strong partnership arrangement .
Later , the stock arrangement ended , replaced by cash , which SCO said in 2004 came to $ 31 million , but the payments for the PIPE deals and the licensing , however much that came to , was Boies Schiller 's to keep , I suppose .
The Singer Declaration tells us on page 2 that the capped legal fee does n't cover the Swiss arbitration , but on the next page , it says the firm agreed to charge just 50 percent of its normal fees , but SCO was responsible for expenses .
Like flying to Paris , I would think .
It also separately had to pay Hatch , Dodge and Dorsey and Whitney .
What I 've always wondered about is whether the firm had to pay back any of the money it presumably was paid regarding the $ 50 million Baystar deal when Baystar backed out , or if it got to keep it .
Did they get paid ?
I do n't know .
The thing is , it 's not clear to me .
I tried to trace it all carefully in 2007 , but I ran into a wall , beyond which the public can't go , or at least I could n't figure out how , so without complete information , I can only guess and wonder .
But for sure , from what is public , we know SCO paid out millions to lawyers .
At that July 2004 teleconference , Bert Young said this about SCO 's financial state at the time , " Finally our cash and available for - sale securities were 43 million as of July 31 , 2004 . "
Now , in June of 2009 , SCO is essentially broke , I gather .
That 's millions in legal fees and expenses prior to the bankruptcy , but the bleeding did n't stop then .
Just one of SCO 's law firms , Berger Singerman , has billed SCO [ PDF ] for the last 20 months a total of $ 308,278.91
That 's just one firm .
Who can forget Mesirow Financial Consulting 's bill for a half a million in December of 2007 , for two and a half months ' work ?
Some of that was in connection with the withdrawn York deal , of course .
It 's hard to avoid the conclusion , in short , that SCO litigated itself into bankruptcy , pure and simple .
*******************************
IBM has profited from its transformation of Linux to the tune of billions of dollars in quarterly revenues and profits and from the sale of hardware , software , and services as part of integrated " Linux solutions , " where Linux -- an open - source program -- is included in the solution at little or even no cost to the customer .
**************************
It 's worth mentioning that until SCO sued IBM , it was a Linux company .
And it partnered with IBM , and was sponsored by IBM .
IBM surely had no reason to imagine that helping Linux would harm SCO , then called Caldera , in any way .
SCO partnered with IBM even up to the time of the UnitedLinux project , a version of which was released after the litigation began , and with SCO patches to the vanilla Linux kernel , by the way , so that SCO distributed under the GPL the four items it was suing IBM about .
If IBM has profited from " transforming " Linux , SCO could have benefited directly from those improvements , too , being at the time a Linux vendor .
In fact , it did benefit , in that IBM 's file system , JFS , the one SCO sued IBM over , was included in UnitedLinux , which SCO distributed evan after it sued IBM .
Note the date on the press release , more than a month after the litigation began .
*********************
As described in detail in the Appendix hereto , IBM set out to transform Linux into an enterprise - grade operating system to gain a competitive advantage and currently bases its core business model on its Linux solution .
Similarly , Novell is a self - proclaimed " ardent supporter of Linux " and owns one of the major Linux distributors in the
2
SCO represents a daunting threat to IBM and Novell , even setting aside the billions of dollars that SCO stands to recover directly if it prevails in court .
Since SCO claims copyrights and contractual rights in UNIX and has amassed credible evidence that Linux is an unauthorized derivative of UNIX , SCO represents a threat to the very lifeblood of the Linux - based business model IBM and Novell have adopted .
If SCO establishes those rights in court , SCO also would have profitable claims in countless Linux distributions to customers who could then potentially seek indemnification from IBM and Novell .
The Tenth Circuit has thus far handled the pending appeal on an expedited basis , setting a date for oral argument only days after SCO 's initial brief was filed , and by all indications will issue a decision promptly .
Judge Michael McConnell , one of the panel members deciding the appeal , has announced that he will retire from the bench on August 31 , 2009 , making it highly probable that a decision will issue by that date .
In light of the likelihood of SCO 's rehabilitation if it prevails on even one of the three issues on which the panel is set to rule and since the company stand to proceed on its significant claims against IBM and Novell with a reversal , there is simply nothing to be gained and everything to lose by converting these cases before the Tenth Circuit issues its decision .
BACKGROUND
On May 5 , 2009 , the United States trustee filed a motion to dismiss these cases or to convert them to cases under Chapter 7 .
On May 11 , 2009 , five days after SCO 's appeal to the Tenth Circuit was argued , both IBM and Novell filed their own motions .

The Debtors have tried to avoid involving the Court in the merits of the competing claims of these parties , but can no longer do so in light of the terminal nature of the relief the Movants now see .
When considering whether the Movants have established " cause , " the Court will need to evaluate whether the cash lost by the Debtors during their stay in Chapter 11 can be considered " substantial " in light of their other assets , including the claims for damages against IBM , Novell , and others .
The litigation claims are also relevant to the question of whether there is a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
See , e.g. , In re Original IFPC Shareholders , Inc. , 317 B.R. 738 , 742-43 ( Bankr . N.D. Ill. 2004 ) ( weighting the strength of a debtor 's litigation claims in deciding whether the debtor had a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation ) .
Moreover , it is imperative that the Court understand the ramifications of a ruling that would put the Debtors out of business .
Such consideration is implicit in the discretion afforded to bankruptcy courts to decide : First , whether " unusual circumstances " exist notwithstanding a finding of " cause " to avoid granting dismissal or conversion ; and second , even if the Court did not find unusual circumstances , to decide which among the three ( or four ) forms of relief provided for under section 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the Bankruptcy Code the Court should choose .
Id. at 753-54 .
***********************************
I can't believe SCO has cited this case , IFPC [ PDF ] .
They surely must not have read it all the way through , because the court ruled that a speculative lawsuit was n't enough to pin a bankrupt 's hopes on .
On a record like that , the court here dismissed IFPC from Chapter 11 , since it had no reasonable plan .
And by my reading IFPC was in better shape than SCO , in that it had investors willing to pony up some real money .
Here 's an excerpt from the decision :
The procedural history of this matter is relatively straightforward .
The debtor - in - possession , Original IFPC Shareholders , Inc. ( " IFPC " ) , incorporated under Illinois law in 1995 for the sole purpose of prosecuting a trade - secret - misappropriation claim against AT&T Wireless Devices , Inc. ( " AT&T " ) and Hughes Network Systems , Inc. in the Circuit Court of DuPage County , Illinois ( Case No. 93 CH 1065 ) .
The decade - old claim became one of two bankruptcy - estate assets after IFPC filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on April 7 , 2004 .
By that time two state court judgments had been entered in favor of the defendants .
The first judgment resulting from a bench trial was reversed on appeal after the Appellate Court of Illinois found that the plaintiff had a right to trial by jury .
The second trial was by jury ; it produced the same result after a six - week trial in 2003 , a verdict in favor of the defendants .
By means of its July 6 , 2004 Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization , IFPC intends to use the second estate asset , a bank account worth approximately $ 17,000 , and expected post-petition investments of approximately $ 1,750,000 ( given priority repayment status under the plan ) to finance both an appeal seeking a third trial and the third trial , should the second adverse verdict get reversed on appeal .
The proceeds from an IFPC triumph in a third trial would fund 100 % payment of all allowed prepetition and postpetition claims plus interest under the proposed plan , with equity security holders retaining their ownership interests in the debtor corporation .
IFPC totaled the nonpriority unsecured claims in this case at $ 14,828,444 , an amount which can be broken down into three groups : 1 ) a group of investors holding a " Promissory Note and Equity Interest ; " 1 2 ) a group of professionals providing legal , expert - witness , and other litigation - support services for the trial of the trade secret claim ; 2 and 3 ) AT&T's and Hughes ' contingent , unliquidated , and disputed claims for costs as prevailing defendants in the state court litigation - claims which will ultimately be valid only if IFPC continues to lose in state court .
The listings for the first group do not reveal whether one portion of each scheduled dollar amount is attributable to a promissory note and the other portion to an equity interest or , alternatively , whether each dollar represents both types of interests .
The U.S. Trustee filed a " Motion to Convert or Dismiss Case " pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1112 ( b ) , arguing that IFPC did not file this Chapter 11 case in good faith , that it has no real need for business - reorganization bankruptcy relief , that its plan is both unconfirmable and unfeasible , and that the true creditor body ( as opposed to shareholders ) will not be well served by continued prosecution of the trade - secret - misappropriation claim in state court .
...
In this case , the debtor IFPC has continued to incur post-petition quarterly U.S. Trustee fees and administrative costs , primarily for legal representation in this bankruptcy case , and will continue to incur costs of up to $ 1,750,000 for legal representation in the state court litigation ( assuming it wins the first of at least two rounds ) if IFPC concurrently remains in Chapter 11 .
It is undisputed that IFPC sells no goods or services to produce a cash flow to raise this amount ; IFPC would be required to gather post-petition investors to either lend this amount and / or buy additional stock .
The U.S. Trustee , furthermore , has established the continuing loss element of § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) : IFPC has an ongoing negative cash flow resulting in a net decrease in value and no definite source of income .
See In re Citi-Toledo Partners , 170 B.R. 602 , 606-07 ( Bankr . N.D. Ohio 1994 ) ; 7 King et al. , supra , ¶ 1112.04 [ 5 ] [ a ] [ I ] , at 1112 - 31 .
The second  standard under section 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) is not the technical one of whether the debtor can confirm a plan , but , rather , whether the debtors business prospects justify continuance of the reorganization effort . 
7 King et al. , supra , ¶ 1112.04 [ 5 ] [a ] [ ii ] , at 1112 - 33 .
In a traditional Chapter 11 case , the second element , whether the debtor has a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation ,  would not turn on the anticipated future outcome of a single lawsuit , because cash flow from another valuable activity would provide the means for paying at least a portion of pre-petition debt from post - confirmation profits .
In this unusual case , however , the reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation  test must be conflated with the anticipated future outcome of a single lawsuit .
This would be a difficult task were the cause of action at the discovery stage , having never been tried once .
In this case , however , two neutral triers of fact , a judge and a jury , have independently evaluated the debtors claim on the merits and found its primary asset to be worth zero .
While the third time might indeed be a charm ( assuming that the appellate court or trial court first orders a new trial ) , this information is simply too much to ignore and must be given substantial weight in an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances under both subsections 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) and ( b ) ( 2 ) .
Aside from the unwieldy task of acquiring and then taking a third bite at the apple , the debtor has no other business plan that would reverse the negative cash flow .
Cf. Quarles v. U.S. Trustee , 194 B.R. 94 , 98 ( W.D. Va. ) , affirmed , Quarles v. Miller , 86 F.3d 55 ( 4th Cir. 1996 ) .
Its premise that outcomes in pending litigation favorable to him will cure [ its ] financial ills is pure speculation .
Id. at 96 -97 ; see also Matter of Imperial Heights Apartments , 18 B.R. 858 , 863-64 ( Bankr . S.D. Ohio 1982 ) ; In re Citi-Toledo Partners , 170 B.R. 602 , 606-07 ( Bankr . N.D. Ohio 1994 ) ; In re N.R. Guaranteed Retirement , 112 B.R. 263 , 278-79 ( Bankr . N.D. Ill. 1990 ) , 3 affirmed , 119 B.R. 149 ( N.D. Ill. 1990 ) .
 When visionary schemes for rehabilitation entail significant risk to creditors without any reasonable probability that the debtor can successfully rehabilitate , conversion or dismissal is generally in order .
In re Great American Pyramid Joint Venture , 144 B.R. 780 , 790-91 ( Bankr . W.D. Tenn. 1992 ) ....
The Court concludes that cause for conversion or dismissal has been established under § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) ....
On either account , it is significant that the debtor has no marketable goods or services and no other types of income - producing investments that would sustain payments to pre-petition and post-petition creditors if any one of its uphill litigation battles does not resolve in its favor .
See 7 King et al. , supra , § 1112.04 [ 5 ] [ b ] [ ii ] , at 1112 - 35 .
As discussed , the two prior losses against AT&T and Hughes indicate at the very least that the evidence is not overwhelmingly in IFPC 's favor , and other than the cause of action , no means of satisfying claims ( aside from liquidating the bank account ) are available ....
Also , " [ a ]
Chapter 11 case can be dismissed at any time .
Creditors need not wait until a debtor proposes a plan or until the debtor 's exclusive right to file a plan has expired .
. . .
The very purpose of § 1112 ( b ) is to cut short this plan and confirmation process where it is pointless . "
Matter of Woodbrook Associates , 19 F.3d 312 , 317 , 320 n.9 ( 7th Cir. 1994 ) ; see Citi-Toledo , 170 B.R. at 606 ; Great American Pyramid , 144 B.R. at 792 ; 7 King et al. , supra , ¶¶ 1112.04 [ 4 ] [c ] , at 1112 - 29 .
3 . Conclusion
As an alternative to its ruling under § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) , the Court finds that the U.S. Trustee has established grounds for dismissal or conversion under § 1112 ( b ) ( 2 ) , as the debtor - in - possession is unable to effectuate its Chapter 11 plan .
And get a load of footnotes 4 and 5 : 4 " However honest in its efforts the debtor may be , and however sincere its motives , the District Court is not bound to clog its docket with visionary or impracticable schemes for resuscitation . "
Tennessee Pub. Co. v. American Nat. Bank , 299 U.S. 18 , 22 , 57 S.Ct. 85 , 87 ( 1936 ) .

A reorganization plan under chapter 11 must be more than a nebulous speculative venture and must have a realistic chance of success which would lead to rehabilitation , and if outside financing is needed , it must be clearly in sight .
In re K.C. Marsh Co. , Inc. , 12 B.R. 401 ( Bankr . D. Mass. 1981 ) .
The Bankruptcy Code does not guarantee successful reorganization , nor does it provide a framework within which the debtor may indefinitely operate ; rather , it only provides a breathing period for the debtor to seek to reorganize .
In re Jones , 115 B.R. 351 ( Bankr . N.D. Fla. 1990 ) .
That 's enough to show you why I am astounded SCO cites the case .
And I 'm sure the US Trustee is very glad they did .
They 'll like the section on good faith filing , too , I suspect .
Did you notice that in describing the background of the case , the court said that IFPC had been successful in getting its appeal granted , when it asked for a jury trial instead of a bench trial ?
That is exactly what SCO wants , but IFPC lost before the jury too .
And it still wanted to continue , and the cost of doing so was prejudicing the rights of the true creditors , as opposed to the shareholders .
And IFPC had investors willing to fund the litigation adventure .
Like I say , I can't believe SCO would want to put this case on the record .

ARGUMENT
A. " Cause Does Not Exist Under Section 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) .
4
I. There Has Been No " Substantial " Diminution of the Estate
The primary component of the aggregate net operating loss consists of bankruptcy and related reorganization expenses of $ 2,305,000 -- over 50 % of the aggregate net operating loss .
Litigation expenses related to the multiple - day trial in the Novell case came to $ 1,491,000 -- or about 34 % of the aggregate net operating loss .
Together , legal issues in and out of bankruptcy account for over 84 % of the Debtors ' aggregate net operating loss .
The other 15 % -- $ 561,000 -- are true losses from business operations .
That figure over 19 months equates to an operating loss of just over $ 29,500 a month .
Isolating the pure UNIX / OpenServer products business , the MORs confirm Mr. McBride 's assertion that the Debtors have recently run at or near break - even .
The $ 3.5 million cash erosion in those 19 months , due primarily to the high cost of litigation and restructuring is of concern .
When averaged over that time period , the rate of cash burn is around $ 184,000 a month .
The MORs show that the greatest portion of that cash erosion occurred when the Debtors employed a team of lawyers and investment brokers to try to accomplish an early and profitable exit from Chapter 11 with the York deal .
That aborted effort
5
**********************
Wait a sec .
The York deal was n't the only one .
There were three aborted attempts to file a plan .
They were all costly .
I 'll let the US Trustee 's Office tell it like it is : 15 .
Additionally , not only is there no reasonable chance of " rehabilitation " in these cases , the Debtors have tried  and failed  to liquidate their business in chapter 11 .
In the fall of 2007 , the Debtors filed a motion seeking approval of emergency sale and bidding procedures and , later , the Debtors filed a copy of their proposed asset purchase agreement with York Capital Management , Inc .
The sale process with York failed to move forward .
Next , in or about February , 2008 , the Debtors proposed that Stephen Norris Capital Partners , LLC ( " SNCP " ) would fund a " 100 percent " plan that would make allowed , general unsecured claims whole .
Like the York deal , the SNCP deal never materialized .
Most recently , in January 2009 the Debtors again initiated a sale / plan process that was abandoned .
In sum , there have been three unsuccessful attempts by the Debtors over the span of nearly two years to bring these cases to closure .
*****************************
Although the Debtors thus have experienced continuing losses , the losses are not substantial .
" Courts must evaluate losses on a case - by - case basis .
Small losses over an extended period may be acceptable , whereas large losses in a short period may indicate that rehabilitation is not likely . "
In re AdBrite Corp. , 290 B.R. 209 , 215 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 2003 ) .
Moreover , " a court must make a full evaluation of the present condition of the estate , not merely look at the debtor 's financial statements . "
Id .
" Negative cash flow and an inability to pay current expenses as they come due can satisfy the continuing loss or diminution of the estate for purposes of § 1112 ( b ) . "
*************
Here 's AdBrite [ PDF ] for you to compare with how they represent it throughout .
Here 's what it says more fully on this point : A Chapter 11 case may be converted or dismissed under § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) for continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
The purpose of this ground is " to prevent the debtor - in - possession from gambling on the enterprise at the creditors ' expense when there is no hope of rehabilitation . "
United States Trustee v. GPA Technical Consultants , Inc. ( In re GPA Technical Consultants , Inc. ) , 106 B.R. 139 , 141 ( Bankr . S.D. Ohio 1989 ) .
Section 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) was written in the conjunctive ; the movant must prove not only a continuing loss to or diminution of the estate , but also must prove that there is no likelihood of rehabilitation .
Lizeric , 188 B.R. at 503 .
To determine whether there is a continuing loss to or diminution of the estate , a court must make a full evaluation of the present condition of the estate , not merely look at the debtor 's financial statements .
In re Moore Construction , Inc. , 206 B.R. 436 , 437-38 ( Bankr . N.D. Tex. 1997 ) .
A continuing loss or diminution of the estate may be tolerated where reorganization is feasible and the pattern of unprofitable operations can be reversed as a result of a successful reorganization .
The debtor , however , should not continue in control of the business beyond a point at which reorganization no longer remains realistic .
The courts must evaluate losses on a case - by - case basis .
Small losses over an extended period may be acceptable , whereas large losses in a short period may indicate that rehabilitation is not likely .
In re Photo Promotion Assocs. , 47 B.R. 454 , 458-59 ( S.D.N.Y. 1985 ) .
In addition to the amount and the nature of the losses , there is a temporal quality to the determination .
At the early stages of the case , to prove an absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation , the movant must show that there is no more than a " hopeless and unrealistic prospect " of rehabilitation .
In re Economy Cab & Tool Co. , Inc. , 44 B.R. 721 , 724 ( Bankr . D. Minn. 1984 ) . Section 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) codifies a two - prong test : continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
In re Denrose Diamond , 49 B.R. 754 , 756 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 1985 ) ....
Conversion is not warranted despite the existence of short - term postpetition operating losses where there exists a realistic possibility of rehabilitation .
However , " a positive cash flow will not guard against conversion when it masks a static enterprise whose financial statements do not account for costs necessary to doing business . "
Id. ; see also In re Nugelt , Inc. , 142 B.R. 661 , 667 ( Bankr . D. Del. 1992 ) ( debtors shareholders and insiders using property of the estate to fund postpetition expenses constituted a continuing loss to or diminution of the estate ) .
With respect to the second prong of § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) , rehabilitation does not mean the same thing as reorganization for purposes of Chapter 11 because a reorganization may include an orderly or complete liquidation .
In re Rundlett , 136 B.R. 376 , 380 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 1992 ) .
In this context , rehabilitation means to put back in good condition and reestablish on a sound basis .
Lizeric , 188 B.R. at 503 ; In re Kanterman , 88 B.R. 26 , 29 ( S.D.N.Y. 1988 ) .
It signifies that the debtor will be reestablished on a secured financial basis , which implies establishing a cash flow from which its current obligations can be met .
Rundlett , 136 B.R. at 380 .
Courts have held that the occurrence of short - term postpetition losses is not grounds to convert or dismiss a bankruptcy case where financial viability is reasonably likely in the near future .
See , e.g. , In re Garland Corp. , 6 B.R. 456 , 460 ( 1st Cir. BAP 1980 ) .
A court may convert or dismiss a Chapter 11 case under § 1112 ( b ) ( 2 ) for the " inability to effectuate a plan . "
" Inability to effectuate a plan " means that the debtor lacks the ability to formulate a plan or to carry one out .
In re Dark Horse Tavern , 189 B.R. 576 , 582 ( N.D.N.Y . 1995 ) .
Pursuant to § 1112 ( b ) ( 3 ) , the court may convert or dismiss a Chapter 11 case for " unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors . "
The key words are " unreasonable " and " prejudicial . "
Not all delays are unreasonable , and not all unreasonable delays are prejudicial .
In re Sphere Holding Corp. , 162 B.R. 639 , 643 ( E.D.N.Y .
1994 ) (  In determining whether a debtors delay has been unreasonable , a bankruptcy court must take into consideration the context of the delay . ) .
Decisions under § 1112 ( b) ( 3 ) generally focus on the time taken by the debtor to submit a confirmable plan .
I 've emphasized the parts you need to have clearly in mind to understand the points being made .
In re Gateway Access Solutions , Inc. , 374 B.R. at 215 ( " Negative cash flow is considered by courts to be evidence of continuing losses required by section 1112 ( b ) ( I ) " ( quoting In re Galvin , 49 B.R. 665 , 669 ( Bankr . D. N.D. 1985 ) ( emphasis added ) .
A bankruptcy court " has wide discretion to determine if cause exists and how to ultimately adjudicate the case . "
In re 1031 Tax Group , LLC , 374 B.R. 78 , 93 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 2007 ) .
And , as the court in Gateway explained , such findings do not ipso facto satisfy the continuing loss standard under § 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) .
***********************
Here 's Gateway [ PDF ] , so you can compare it with how SCO characterizes it throughout .
*************************
The word " substantial " implicitly begs the question : Substantial compared to what ?
Compared to the Debtors ' losses before bankruptcy , these losses are hardly substantial .
SCO had only one profitable quarter of operations -- the quarter ended April 30 , 2003 .
The profit resulted principally from SCOsource licensing activity with Sun Microsystems and Microsoft Corporation , licensing activity that then was undermined by Novell claiming it owned the UNIX copyrights , which is one of the issues before the Tenth Circuit on appeal .
For the fiscal years ended October 31 , 2002 , through September 2007 , SCO generated cumulative net
6
Cumulative losses generated by SCOsource and SCO 's litigation efforts for those periods was $ 39.6 million , with cash used in operations of $ 29.6 million .
Cumulative losses from operation from SCO 's UNIX and mobility businesses for those periods was $ 43.8 million and cash used in operations was $ 26.1 million , representing a monthly burn rate of $ 368,000 over the 71 - month period .
As a result of the bankruptcy , management has reduced R&D efforts on its UNIX and mobility businesses , limiting new product enhancements and development ; reduced staffing levels to match to the declining revenue streams ; and thereby improved the monthly cash burn rate from $ 368,000 to approximately $ 29,500 .
Compared to a market basket of other software companies , again these losses are hardly substantial .
It is not uncommon for software companies to rack up large operating losses and then get purchased for substantial sums of money .
For example , JBoss reported revenues for 2006 of $ 16 million and a net loss of $ 22 million .
Red Hat acquired JBoss in 2006 for $ 420 million .
Similarly , in 2003 , SuSE was purchased by Novell ( with assistance from IBM ) for $ 210 million after racking up losses in the tens of millions of dollars .
Compared to the improvement in the liabilities side of the Debtors ' balance sheet , the losses are not substantial .
When these cases commenced , the Debtors ' liabilities included claims asserted by Novell of approximately $ 40 million , by the IPO class action claimants of $ 59 million , and by SuSE of ( apparently , based on its proof of claim ) $ 1.3 million .
But since then
7
The Debtors below explain how their assets include claims worth billions of dollars .
See I_A_3 - 5 , below .
Compared to the Debtors ' assets , the losses occasioned in order to preserve these litigation assets are de minimis , not substantial .
2. There Is a Reasonable Likelihood of Rehabilitation .
8
Similarly , in In re Court Living Corp. , the Southern District of New York affirmed a bankruptcy court 's denial of a creditor 's motion to convert because the debtor - a real estate corporation that owned decrepit property - argued that its prospects of rehabilitation were " linked to another debtor in another bankruptcy action " first successfully emerging from bankruptcy and renovating its adjacent property .
1996 WL 527333 ( S.D.N.Y. 1996 ) .
The court concluded that " this is not a situation where the debtor is gambling on the enterprise at the creditors ' expense when there is no hope of rehabilitation " and denied a for - cause conversion under section 1112 ( b ) ( l ) pending the resolution of the third - party owner 's plan to repair his property .
Id. at * 4 .
The three holdings underlying the district court 's order regarding SCO 's ownership of the UNIX intellectual property on which the Tenth Circuit will imminently rule is undeniably the hurdle blocking the rehabilitation of SCO 's business .
To be sure , that is why IBM and Novell
9
In addition , a reversal will permit SCO to move forward and present a compelling case to a jury .
SCO will be able to present the overwhelmingly favorable extrinsic evidence that the district court disregarded on summary judgment , which includes admissions from Novell 's then - Chief Executive Officer and its lead negotiator that the copyrights were in fact transferred to SCO 's predecessor and that SCO owns all rights in the agreements underlying its contract claims against IBM .
See Part I.A.4 , below .
On the other hand , Novell will have almost nothing to say to a jury , since its position has rested squarely on the lack of ambiguity in the contract language and a reversal would necessarily mean that the Tenth Circuit found the language ambiguous .
Even a partial reversal by the Tenth Circuit will likely have a rehabilitative effect on SCO .
First , if the Tenth Circuit reverses the district court 's ruling regarding Novell 's royalty rights , Novell 's judgment of approximately $ 3.5 million against SCO will be vacated .
This fact alone will result in rehabilitation , because SCO will have sufficient cash to pay all remaining creditors and to continue its business without fear of imminent shutdown by a judgment creditor .
10
The Movants do not even address the results of a reversal of Novell 's money judgment , much less establish the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation following the reversal .
Instead , they rely on inapposite cases such as In re Gateway Access Solutions , Inc. , 31A B.R. 556 ( Bankr . M.D. Pa. 2007 ) .
Gateway Access Solutions was a company that owned " FCC licenses and leases to operate wireless broadband services . "
Id. at 559 .
Its management team consisted of one part - time owner - director - employee , Dr. Poler , and an ' " acting president , ' who is ill and was unable to appear at the conversion hearing , either in person or telephonically . "
Id. at 565 .
Dr. Poler worked " no less than six or seven days a week putting in more than eight hours on those days as an anesthesiologist , and then comes home and works another forty plus hours on rehabilitating the debtor . "
Id .
Management had no time to produce business models or projections to present to the court to establish the likelihood of rehabilitation .
Id .
Moreover , the debtor produced " very few details " about its future business prospects at the trial of the conversion motion .
Id. at 562 .
And the debtor called no witnesses other than Dr. Poler nor
11
Unlike the situation in Gateway , the Debtors in these cases will provide business models and projections .
They will produce witnesses who will testify to facts , and not visionary schemes , that will establish that the Debtors have a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
The Debtors will do this even though the burden is on the Movants to prove the opposite .
See AdBrite , 290 B.R. at 215 ( " Section 1112 ( b ) ( l ) was written in the conjunctive ; the movant must prove not only continuing loss to or diminution of the estate , but also must prove that there is no likelihood of rehabilitation . " )
( citing In re Lizeric Realty Corp. , 188 B.R. 499 , 503 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 1995 ) ( emphasis added ) ; see also Loop Corp. v. United States Trustee , 290 B.R. 108 , 112 ( D.Minn. 2003 ) .
************************
Regarding what movants must establish , here 's what AdBrite actually says : Under § 1112 ( b ) , the burden is on the movant to establish cause .
Loop Corp. v. United States Trustee , No. CIV .
02-793 , 2003 WL 262413 , at * 3 ( D. Minn. Feb. 5 , 2003 ) ; In re Lizeric Realty Corp. , 188 B.R. 499 , 503 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 1995 ) .
A Chapter 11 case may be converted or dismissed under § 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) for continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
The purpose of this ground is " to prevent the debtor - in - possession from gambling on the enterprise at the creditors ' expense when there is no hope of rehabilitation . "
United States Trustee v. GPA Technical Consultants , Inc. ( In re GPA Technical Consultants , Inc. ) , 106 B.R. 139 , 141 ( Bankr . S.D. Ohio 1989 ) .
Section 1112 ( b ) ( 1 ) was written in the conjunctive ; the movant must prove not only a continuing loss to or diminution of the estate , but also must prove that there is no likelihood of rehabilitation .
Lizeric , 188 B.R. at 503 ....
A finding of cause is not limited to the grounds stated in § 1112 ( b ) .
See 11 U.S.C. § 102(3 ) ( in construing the Bankruptcy Code , the terms " includes " and " including " are not limiting ) ;
In re Gonic Realty Trust , 909 F.2d 624 , 626 ( 1st Cir. 1990 ) ( " in determining ' cause ' for dismissal the court may consider other factors as they arise ...
Additional factors upon which Courts have based decisions to convert or dismiss include : 1 . The failure to file required operating reports .
See In re Berryhill , 127 B.R. 427 , 433 ( Bankr . N.D. Ind. 1991 ) ( the failure to file operating reports in itself constitutes cause for dismissal ) ; 2 . Filing materially inaccurate operating reports .
See In re Continental Holdings , Inc. , 170 B.R. 919 , 929 ( Bankr . N.D. Ohio 1994 ) ( timely and accurate financial disclosure is the life blood of the Chapter 11 process  ) ; 3 . A debtor - in - possession 's dereliction of its fiduciary duty to creditors .
When a corporation files for protection under Chapter 11 , the officers and managing employees have a fiduciary duty to creditors and shareholders .
This creates an " obligation to treat all parties , not merely the shareholders , fairly .
" Commodity Futures Trading Commn v. Weintraub , 471 U.S. 343 , 355-56 , 105 S. Ct. 1986 ( 1985 ) ; see also In re Hampton Hotel Investors , L.P. , 270 B.R. 346 , 358 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 2001 ) ... ; 4 . Lack of good faith in filing the petition or proposing a plan .
See In re Copy Crafters Quickprint , Inc. , 92 B.R. 973 , 985 ( Bankr . N.D.N.Y. 1988 ) ;... 7 . Inability to effectuate confirmation .
See Larmar Estates , 6 B.R. at 936 ; 8 . A defunct debtor incapable of reorganizing .
In re Westerleigh Development Corp. , 141 B.R. 38 , 41 ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. 1992 ) ( nothing to reorganize where debtors business is defunct ) ; ...
In addition to a lack of good faith in filing the petition or proposing a plan , " bad faith " can be grounds for dismissing or converting a case in which the debtor has acted fraudulently .
Generally , a determination of a lack of good faith involves finding an intent to abuse the judicial process and the purposes of the reorganization process .
An oft - cited list of indicia of " bad faith " has developed in the case law .
These factors include : 1 . The prepetition conduct of the debtor has been improper ;
2 . There are few debts to non-moving creditors ;
3 . The petition was filed on the eve of foreclosure ;
4 . The foreclosed property is the sole or major asset of the debtor ;
5 . The debtor has no ongoing business or employees ;
6 . There is no possibility of reorganization ;
7 . The debtor 's income is not sufficient to operate ; and
8 . The debtor filed solely to create the automatic stay .
Here 's the Loop decision [ PDF ] also referenced .
***********************
Second , if the Tenth Circuit reverses the district court 's ruling that Novell owns UNIX copyrights , that reversal is sure to attract customers and investors who are on the sidelines awaiting the Tenth Circuit 's decision .
SCO reasonably expects the following favorable results from that reversal :
Revenues from OpenServer and UnixWare products will rise when the reversal removes the cloud over SCO 's ownership of those UNIX derivatives .
In light of the advantages ( discussed below ) that SCO would enjoy at a trial on this issue , there will be a substantial market for SCOsource agreements among Linux users wishing a release of claims SCO might bring based on the copyrights .
SCO 's legal claims predicated on its ownership of the copyrights will significantly increase in value .
12
Novell
Moreover , based on the foregoing results , SCO also reasonably expects that other assets of the company will increase in value .
SCO reasonably expects that the value of its legal claims not predicated on ownership of the copyrights
will increase , because the market will understand that SCO will survive as a going concern to prosecute those claims .
Similarly , SCO reasonably believes that sales of SCO 's Virtualization and Mobility products , which are based on a separate , non-UNIX technology will also increase when the market understands that SCO will thus survive .
For SCO customers with virtualized versions of SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare using Hyper - V or VMware , SCO UNIX will support the latest computer system hardware .
That
13
With regard to SCO 's Mobility Products , SCO recently developed , under the direction of FranklinCovey , worldwide leaders in time management , FCmobilelife Tasks by FranklinCovey .
FC
Tasks is an easy - to - use , feature - rich task management tool that incorporates proven planning methodology to quickly manage daily , personal , and professional tasks from an iPhone and iPod Touch .
The FC Tasks application , having sold over 5,000 units in a matter of weeks , is consistently in the top 20 paid productivity applications on the Apple App Store and currently resides at number 14 .
A BlackBerry version is nearing completion as well and will be available on the new BlackBerry App World mobile store .
SCO 's mobile strategy is to be a technology partner to create applications that SCO 's business partners then market to their customer bases .
The first such partnership , FranklinCovey , has produced two applications so far : FCmobilelife and FC Tasks for the iPhone , and two more iPhone applications are planned this year .
FranklinCovey is marketing the solutions heavily in e-mail and web campaigns , in print catalogs to the point that FC Tasks is the cover of the current catalog , and in retail .
The mobile clients on the iPhone function as standalone applications and will also synchronize with FCmobilelife in the future providing additional annuity subscription revenue for FCmobilelife .
SCO is , therefore , on the threshold of a break - out performance if it can get out of bankruptcy .
Conversion to Chapter 7 is hardly the preferred method of doing so .
14
Third
Of course , if the Tenth Circuit reverses on two or all three of the issues on appeal , the foregoing positive effects on SCO 's assets will synergize to further benefit the company .
The Movants do not offer any analysis of the effects a reversal would have on SCO 's likelihood of rehabilitation , much less establish an absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation should the Tenth Circuit reverse .
The Movants cannot meet their burden without showing that SCO is more likely than not to lose on appeal .
On the other hand , though it does not bear the burden of proof , SCO will show that even a partial reversal on appeal would result in a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
The appeal thus represents three independent chances for rehabilitation .
In addition , neutral observers who have actually assessed the strength of the appealed - from decision agree that SCO stands to prevail on appeal .
In an article entitled " Did SCO Get Linux - Mob Justice ? , " a former lawyer who writes for Fortune Magazine observed : " Once in a while a judicial ruling comes down that 's so wrong at such a basic level that you 're just left scratching your head . "
***********************
SCO avoids quoting from the reasons why Mr. Parloff thought the ruling was in error , reasons that some , including me , find mistaken .
Here 's some rebuttal Groklaw presented .
For example , Parloff thought Judge Kimball did n't consider Amendment 2 , but he did , and I showed in the article that he did by quoting from the ruling , and then there was another big Parloff misunderstanding : I think it 's clear that Judge Kimball * did* consider Amendment 2 , in some detail , and he ruled that it was n't a copyright transfer document , for all the reasons he enumerates .
Whether his reasons will be convincing to the appeals court judges is the issue .
But do you see why I think Roger Parloff 's analysis of Judge Kimball 's ruling ran off the tracks ?
His argument , aside from asserting ambiguity , was that determining witness credibility was n't the judge 's role in a summary judgment setting .
But he missed that the real issue lay elsewhere , namely , could anyone consider the witness testimony in the first place ?
That is what the appeals court is looking at , and it's what Kimball looked at , not who decides credibility issues .
Kimball mentioned in passing that the witnesses were not credible to him , so that even if he were allowed to consider their testimony , he would still rule as he had , but he did n't decide the issue based on credibility , so it does n't matter whether the California statute gives him or a jury the role of deciding credibility .
Instead , Kimball analyzed whether or not their testimony could be considered by * anybody * , and he ruled that it could not ....
That 's not even the elephant in the room , to me .
The elephant in the room is this : if the contract is ambiguous , as SCO requires it to be to introduce its witnesses , how is it possible that there was a copyright transfer ?
A copyright transfer document has to be unambiguous in order to meet 204 ( a ) .
If it 's not clearly intended to be a transfer , then the copyrights stay where they were .
So let 's say SCO got the case remanded to Utah for a jury trial on the basis that the contract is ambiguous .
Then what ?
If the jury finds it ambiguous , too , and struggles to figure out its meaning , then it's not likely they'd also find that it was a clear copyright transfer document , I do n't think .
And SCO needs both .
It 's not impossible , but SCO 's argument seems to be so delicate , it 's like brain surgery , where 1/8th of an inch too far , and you ruin everything .
No doubt that is why Boies Schiller sent Mr. Singer .
Update :
The more I think about this , the more clearly I see that SCO is in a logic pickle .
Here 's why :
They claim that the APA is clear , but that Amendment 2 presented ambiguity , since it alters the APA .
Yet , they say it is Amendment 2 that officially transferred the copyrights .
They have a lot of witnesses about the APA and its intent , as seen by a group of executives , paralegals and such , none of whom was there for the actual drafting in the end , could n't testify about copyrights as far as the legal drafting was concerned , and none of whom knew one thing about Amendment 2 , which happened almost a year later , without their participation at all .
Do n't you see how fatal that is ?
SCO has only one witness regarding the Amendment 2 drafting , with blanks in his recollection .
Novell has at least four witnesses with direct involvement and total recall , plus saved drafts .
Since SCO now claims it was Amendment 2 that did the copyright transfer , they need witnesses about * Amendment 2 * , not the APA .
They have only Sabbath for that , as far as direct involvement , who could n't recall copyright discussions and who contradicts not only four witnesses of Novell 's ( Amadia , Braham , David Bradford , and Jim Tolenen ) , but the witnesses ' saved draft documents to boot .
Comments to Mr. Parloff 's article clearly pointed out these and other errors , but the article , originally available on Mr. Parloff 's blog [ link broken ] was moved at some point , and the comments disappeared .
You can still read them on Wayback though , if you 'd like to dig a bit more deeply .
I think you 'll understand why SCO did n't quote from the article and why the comments disappeared .
****************************************
Similarly , the online publication Managing L'unix observed : " Since [ Judge ] Kimball 's decision to decide on disputed
15
*************************
Mr. Murphy has been supportive of SCO since the beginning , and he is the one who wrote , when the decision came down , that he would have gladly bet it never could have happened .
But it did .
What does that tell you ?
He shows that he is definitely not a lawyer when he wrote this , huh ?
SCO and knowing what I do n't know on August 20 , 2007 : With respect to the SCO case , for example , I m convinced that I know who did what to whom and when with respect to the core contractual breach allegations and had , correspondingly , dismissed this whole Novell copyright business as utterly beside the point .
Oops .
Or maybe not , because the judgement has nothing to do with the validity of SCOs core charges but does raise questions to which I havent got an answer .
When AT&T sold USL to Novell they transfered everything - and Novell did the same when it sold everything to SCO , which sold everything to Caldera , which became the new SCO .
But lawyers love boilerplate and its hard to believe that all of the agreements got rewritten at each stage , so if the Judges decision holds up - then if one agreement in this chain of transfers impossibly separated copyright from intellectual property , can we ask whether the same split is implicit in the earlier or later transfers ?
Im not a lawyer and I dont understand how that could happen or what it would mean - but its suddenly become interesting because if its possible to argue that the same split is implicit in either earlier or later transactions , a lot of very important deals , including Suns 1993 royalty buyout from Novell would have to be revisited .
Most importantly , if the split is arguably present in the original transaction , wouldnt the new AT&T be compelled to review SCOs allegations with a view to settling or joining the lawsuit - against both Novell and IBM ?
Oops indeed .
He is not a lawyer , and you see that not only in his statement of fact that he is not , but also in that he never considered it possible that SCO would lose .
There is n't a lawyer in the world who does n't carefully consider all options , likely or not , and the rest of the spinach he places on the plate are utterly wrong , legally , so I think we can simply assume that when it comes to the law , as he himself acknowledges , he really does n't know much about it .
So his opinion that the judgment was flawed is itself flawed , would n't you think ?
Where are all the lawyers out there who spoke out to condemn this ruling ?
I can't find any , and apparently neither could SCO .
As for journalists , their coverage of this SCO story has been abysmal , with only a few exceptions , since they all thought SCO would prevail , and they were dead wrong .
Here 's an article showing all the media coverage immediately after the August 10 ruling by Judge Kimball .
It 's laughable .
The fact that SCO uses some of it as " proof " that the ruling was flawed demonstrates , to me , that they are desperate and standing alone , legally .
It also indicates to me that they are continuing to smear Groklaw .
All we did , by the way , is report on the litigation to the best of our ability , which as an American citizen I am allowed to do , and we called it right .
That 's all we did .
For that we have been attacked , stalked , threatened , even receiving death threats , and harassed .
Incidentally , if you notice any dead links on that page , please let me know .
********************************
The Movants also cannot meet their burden by showing that the Tenth Circuit decision may be issued too late to result in a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation .
The Tenth Circuit has thus far handled the pending appeal on an expedited basis , setting a date for oral argument only days after SCO 's initial brief was filed , and by all indications , will issue a decision promptly .
A member of the panel hearing the appeal will leave the bench on August 31 , 2009 , thus making it highly probable a decision will issue by that date .
In light of the fact that SCO can be rehabilitated by prevailing on even one of the issues on appeal and that the company could then pursue its valuable claims against IBM and Novell to the benefit of the estate , there is simply nothing to lose and everything to gain by waiting for the Tenth Circuit 's decision .
3 . The Nature of SCO 's Claims Against IBM and Novell . 
UNIX is a computer software operating system .
Operating systems serve as the link between computer hardware and the various software programs ( " applications " ) that run on the computer .
Operating systems allow multiple software programs to run at the same time and
16
In the business computing environment for the Fortune 1000 and other large corporations ( called the " Enterprise " environment ) , UNIX is widely used .
In contrast , before IBM wrongfully transformed Linux into a competitive operating system as detailed in the Appendix hereto , Fortune 1000 companies were not using Linux for mission critical applications , such as wire transfers and satellite control systems .
Linux , as an operating system , simply was not capable of performing such high - level enterprise computing before IBM 's improper contributions .
17
In consideration for the competitive head - start provided to licensees by the UNIX source code that was the foundation for their UNIX flavors , AT&T 's Software and Sublicensing Agreements required licensees to keep their flavors confidential , the same as the UNIX code itself .
*********************
Not exactly .
For example , AT&T sent out a 1985 newsletter stating the exact opposite : Section 2.01 -
The last sentence was added to assure licensees that AT&T will claim no ownership in the software that they developed -- only the portion of the software developed by AT&T .
In addition , IBM negotiated for itself a side letter in that same year , 1985 , the year IBM first licensed UNIX from AT&T , and it said the same thing : 2 . Regarding Section 2.01 , we agree that modifications and derivative works prepared by or for you are owned by you .
However , ownership of any portion or portions of SOFTWARE PRODUCTS included in any such modification or derivative work remains with us .
In any case , the license agreement included this loosening of even the confidentiality of the AT&T code , if trade secrets were revealed by others : 7.06 ( a ) LICENSEE agrees that it shall hold all parts of the SOFTWARE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement in confidence for AT&T .
LICENSEE further agrees that it shall not make any disclosure of any or all of such SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ( including methods or concepts utilized therein ) to anyone , except to employees of LICENSEE to whom such disclosure is necessary to the use for which rights are granted hereunder .
LICENSEE shall appropriately notify each employee to whom any such disclosure is made that such disclosure is made in confidence and shall be kept in confidence by such employee .
If information relating to a SOFTWARE PRODUCT subject to this Agreement at any time becomes available without restriction to the general public by acts not attributable to LICENSEE or its employees , LICENSEE'S obligations under this section shall not apply to such information after such time .
Anyway , SCO dropped its claim that IBM misappropriated trade secrets .
**********************************
Yet , in early 2000 , as part of its new " Linux Strategy " aimed at transforming Linux from an " open source " program developed by a community of volunteers into a viable business alternative , IBM started publicly disclosing valuable source code and other intellectual property from AIX and Dynix - in plain violation of its Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
Since AIX was derived from UNIX , the AIX source code that IBM dumped wholesale into Linux contained hundreds of thousands of lines of source code derived from UNIX .
*****************************
The problem , as IBM 's attorney David Marriott pointed out at a hearing in 2006 , is that SCO has n't been able to tie any donated code to anything SCO owns .
Talk about your missing link .
************************************
In early 2000 ,
18
***********************
Then SCO has only itself to blame , because a Caldera employee contributed code to JFS .
So not only did Caldera / SCO release JFS in UnitedLinux under the GPL , as well as in Skunkworks , its own employee helped to develop the code for Linux .
In a UnitedLinux whitepaper [ PDF ]
Caldera put on its website , we see that they knew JFS was in UnitedLinux , and where it came from : The Journaled File System ( JFS ) is a full 64 - bit file system .
All of the appropriate file system structure fields are 64 - bits in size .
This allows JFS to support both large files and partitions .
JFS was developed by IBM under the GPL license and is ported from its AIX systems .
JFS provides a log - based , byte - level file system that was developed for transaction - oriented , high performance systems .
Scalable and robust , its advantage over non-journaled file systems is its quick restart capability .
JFS can restore a file system to a consistent state in a matter of seconds or minutes .
******************************
By 2003 IBM had committed vast resources to its Linux Strategy , and Novell had become a self - proclaimed " ardent supporter of Linux . "
That year , after SCO brought suit against IBM in March , Novell announced the purchase of SuSE - a leading distributor of Linux - with a $ 50 million investment by IBM .
In March 2003 , SCO sued IBM for breach of IBM's Software and Sublicensing Agreements , copyright infringement based on IBM 's continued distribution of AIX and Dynix after SCO terminated those Agreements for breach , and unfair competition in connection with a joint venture named Project Monterey .
*******************************
When SCO first filed its lawsuit , analysts reacted to it like this , as published in this CNET article by Stephen Shankland on March 6 , 2009 , SCO sues Big Blue over Unix , Linux : Analysts saw the move as a desperate one for SCO , a company that has n't been profitable in its current incarnation .
" It 's a fairly end - of - life move for the stockholders and managers of that company , " said Jonathan Eunice , an Illuminata analyst .
" Really what beat SCO is not any problem with what IBM did ; it's what the market decided .
This is a way of salvaging value out of the SCO franchise they can't get by winning in the marketplace . "
*****************************
Novell then came to IBM 's defense , announcing to the world that it - and not SCO - owned the UNIX copyrights upon which SCO 's claims against IBM were partly predicated , and that Novell also had the unfettered right to waive IBM 's violations of its Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
In 2004 , based on such conduct by Novell , as well as its distribution of SuSE - Linux products , SCO sued Novell for slander of title , breach of contract , unfair competition , and copyright infringement .
19
4. The Strength of SCO 's Claims Against Novell .
Slander of Title .
Nine days later , after SCO had faxed a copy of Amendment No. 2 to the APA to Mr. Messman , Novell immediately issued a press release , admitting :
Amendment # 2 to the 1995 SCO - Novell Asset Purchase Agreement was sent to Novell last night by SCO .
To Novell 's knowledge , this amendment is not present in Novell 's files .
The
20
amendment appears to support SCO 's claims that ownership of certain copyrights for UNIX did transfer to SCO in 1996.33
***********************
Actually by midmorning , according to my research , the stock was up , not down , after Novell 's statement : According to what I 've found , as I 'll show you , Novell put out a press release early in the morning , apparently even before the market opened , and yet IDG reported that same day that the stock at mid-morning was trading * up* by 3.33 % .
By the end of the day , the stock was down , for sure , but what made it happen ?
We can only guess .
SCO also put out a prepared statement in the morning , almost immediately after Novell's , and then at 11 AM , SCO held a conference call .
If the stock went down by the end of the day , who is to say that it was n't the conference call that caused it ?
Or SCO 's prepared statement , for that matter ?
Or some combination of all of them ?
What is SCO 's basis for its claim that it was Novell 's statement that caused the stock to " plummet " ?
At any rate , piecing together all the evidence I have collected , I am unable to confirm that the stock plummeted within two hours of Novell 's statement , and I see indications that it did n't happen that way .
I will show you what I found so you can draw your own conclusions .
Again , here 's the IDG article , published , it shows , at 10:12 AM on May 28 , 2003 , and notice it says the stock was up at that point .
It also mentions the 11 AM conference call as something that had not yet begun *********************************
In discovery , SCO learned that the timing of Novell 's announcement was not " entirely coincidental , " as Mr. Messman had claimed .
Novell Vice Chairman Chris Stone had informed Maureen O'Gara , a journalist who has covered the computer industry since 1972 , that Novell intentionally was making the announcement on the day of SCO 's earnings report to " confound SCO 's stock position " and " upset the stock price . "
According to her testimony , Mr. Stone leaked this information " with laughter " and " chortling . "
In footnote 4 of Novell 's appellate brief , you will find this important rebuttal : 4 SCO makes the unfounded and irrelevant accusation that Novell deliberately announced that it owns the UNIX copyrights on the day of SCO 's earnings report to harm SCO 's stock price .
( AB12 . )
Chris Stone , the alleged source of this information , testified that he did not even know that SCO was announcing its earnings on that date .
( 07584-88 . )
Unfounded means there is no foundation for the conclusion reached .
A bit about her history of helping out anti-Open Source entities like Microsoft .
Her support for SCO has been , I believe , obvious .
I 'll let you judge for yourself , though , and you can form your own opinion .
Here 's a page from Linux Business News in 2005 where you can start .
Decide for yourself if you think she was biased or accurate in her coverage .
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you 'll see several of her LinuxGram articles about SCO .
This might be the time to put something on Groklaw , to preserve it in our permanent collection , the apology Fuat Kircaali , Publisher of SysCon Media , posted after running one of her LinuxGram articles , which I and others viewed as a hatchet job on me :
We had a link to that apology in an earlier article back in 2005 , but the link is now broken .
So that 's why I decided it would be time to include a screen shot and the Wayback link , to preserve it for historians .
It was by no means the only hatchet job .
A concerted effort by SCO to get the media to smear Groklaw bore fruit .
I consider Mr. Murphy 's attack on Groklaw in the above - referenced article to be part of that campaign , by the way , and Mr. Parloff also attacked Groklaw .
Here 's another article about me by O'Gara , in which she reports that SCO 's Darl McBride asked the media to investigate me , an invitation she accepted , which led to the need for a SysCon apology to me .
*****************************
In January 2004 , SCO sued Novell for slander of title to the UNIX copyrights .
On Novell 's motion for summary judgment , the district court dismissed that claim , ruling that Novell had retained the copyrights under the APA .
The court reasoned that neither the original APA nor Amendment No. 2 to the APA , each standing alone , transferred the copyrights to Santa Cruz .
SCO appealed the ruling , arguing that the district court erred in reading the APA and Amendment No. 2 as separate and distinct documents and that when properly read together , as required by basic rules of construction , they provide for the transfer of copyrights .
The APA identifies " all of Seller 's right , title , and interest in and to the assets " listed in the Assets Schedule , and not listed in the Excluded Assets Schedule , as assets transferred in the
21
All copyrights and trademarks , except for the copyrights and trademarks owned by Novell as of the date of the Agreement required for SCO to exercise its rights with respect to the acquisition of UNIX and UnixWare technologies .
Robert Frankenberg , President and CEO of Novell at the time of the APA , testified that it was his " initial intent , " his " intent at the time when the APA was signed , " and his " intent when that transaction closed " that " Novell would transfer the copyrights to UNIX and UnixWare technology to Santa Cruz " and that " that intent never changed .

**********************
As is SCO 's wont , they phrase this in such a way to make it seem to a newbie that this is a list of Novell witnesses , some who ended up helping SCO , but it is n't .
As SCO acknowledges , Novell did n't call these witnesses .
These were witnesses SCO called , who happened to have previously worked for Novell , not current employees , and not called by Novell to testify .
By the way , Ms. Madsen is a paralegal , not that there 's anything wrong with that .
But " Assistant Negotiator " might be a bit of a promotion and confusing to those new to this story .
She is the paralegal who testified that she never heard anyone mention copyrights at any of the meetings she attended : Brakebill :
At any point in time did Novell , anyone from Novell , say to you , " We 're going to transfer the UNIX copyrights to Santa Cruz " ?
Madsen :
No , I do n't recall that .
It was assumed by everyone that , of course , the copyrights were accompanying .
Brakebill :
There were no express words from anyone from Novell to you saying Novell is going to transfer the UNIX copyrights to Santa Cruz , correct ?
Normand : Objection , asked and answered .
Madsen :
That 's correct ....
Brakebill : Again , you did n't have any discussions with anyone at Novell where they told you that UNIX copyrights were being transferred , correct ?
Normand : Objection to form and asked and answered .
Madsen : I do n't recall any conversations with Novell pertaining to copyrights .
Brakebill :
Were you part of any conversation between Santa Cruz representatives and Novell representatives where Santa Cruz put the question to Novell , " Can you transfer the UNIX copyrights to us ? "
Normand : Objection to form .
Madsen :
No , I do n't recall that .
Brakebill :
Are you aware of any conversations that may have taken place between Santa Cruz representatives and Novell representatives where anyone from Santa Cruz asked Novell to give them the UNIX copyrights as part of this deal ?
Normand : Objection to form .
Madsen :
No , I do not recall any conversation regarding the copyrights .
It was assumed that the copyrights came with the business , but I do not have any specific recollection about a conversation regarding copyrights .
Brakebill :
So it 's fair to say that you were assuming that the UNIX copyrights were being transferred ?
Normand : Objection to form .
Madsen : I do n't believe that was my assumption alone , but yes , I was assuming that .
Let 's give Ms. Madsen her SCO promotion .
Now we have the " Assistant Negotiator " for the APA testifying that she never heard anyone even discuss copyrights one way or another .
That is fatal to SCO , I think , because my understanding is that with copyrights , there has be a writing , a clear writing , to transfer copyrights , and if it is n't clear , at least you need witnesses to testify that it was discussed and everyone agreed as to the copyright transfer , with specificity .
Otherwise the copyrights stay where they were .
That would be with Novell .
Instead , the " Assistant Negotiator " says it did n't happen that way .
And on the other side , Novell has presented the 1995 Board minutes of a board meeting held the day before the APA was signed that state unequivocally that no copyrights were to transfer under the APA .
The minutes have one resolution that reads in part like this :
Novell will retain all of its patents , copyrights and trademarks ( except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare ) , a royalty - free , perpetual , worldwide license back to UNIX and UnixWare for internal use and resale in bundled products , Tuxedo and other miscellaneous , unrelated technology .
So Novell did discuss copyrights , and it resolved that they would not transfer .
And on the other side , the Assistant Negotiator says no one discussed copyrights at all , that she ever heard tell .
Here 's what Judge Kimball wrote about some other SCO and Novell witnesses in the order SCO is appealing regarding Amendment 2 , the part of the APA that SCO is relying upon : David Bradford , Novell 's Senior Vice President and General Counsel , oversaw the negotiation and drafting of a contract between Novell and Santa Cruz .
Decl .
David Bradford at ¶
4 . During the negotiations of the APA , he discussed with Braham the need to increase Novell 's protections in the transaction , including but not limited to retaining Novell 's intellectual property rights in UNIX and UnixWare .
Id . ¶ 9 . Bradford testified that the exclusion of copyrights was intentional and " should any person suggest otherwise , they are mistaken . "
Id . ¶ 12 .
Bradford reviewed the terms of the APA with the Novell Board of Directors at a meeting held on September 18 , 1995 , the day before the APA was signed .
Id . ¶ 13 .
Bradford received the final APA on the day it was executed and was responsible for reviewing it and approving it for final signature by Frankenberg .
Id . ¶ 17 .
Bradford wrote a memorandum reflecting his approval of the APA .
Id .
He testified in this litigation that he still agrees with the statement that the APA is " an accurate reflection of the business and legal terms and conditions negotiated between the parties . "
Id . James Tolonen , Novell 's Chief Financial Officer from 1989 through 1998 , testified that he was actively involved in the preparation of the APA .
Tolonen Decl. ¶¶ 3 , 7 . Tolonen interacted with Bradford , who he described as the " point person " heading up Novell 's negotiation team , and Braham .
Id. ¶¶ 8 , 9 .
Tolonen reviewed drafts of the APA and reviewed the final version of the APA to ensure that its terms were consistent with the intent of the deal .
Id. ¶¶ 9 , 10 .
Tolonen testified that " [ a ] s reflected in the plain language of the executed [ APA ] , Novell intended to retain and did retain , as an ' Excluded Asset , ' all copyrights , including all UNIX and UnixWare copyrights . "
Id . ¶ 11 . ... Jim Tolonen , Novell 's Chief Financial Officer and Novell 's business executive assigned to Amendment No. 2 , confirms that it was never Novell 's intent to transfer copyrights by way of Amendment No. 2 . Decl .
Jim Tolonen at ¶ 13 , 14 .
He states that he would not have signed it if he had believed it would do so .
Id . ¶ 15 .
He testifies that Amendment No. 2 was also not meant to " clarify " what the parties intended to transfer in the original APA .
Id . ¶ 14 .
Rather , he states that Novell intended to retain the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights in the APA , and Amendment No. 2 confirmed that Santa Cruz would be allowed to continue to use the Novell - retained copyrights as it had been doing as was required to exercise its rights under the APA .
Id . ¶ 16 .
Sabbath has no recollection of negotiating the copyright portion of Amendment No. 2 . SCO relies on the testimony of Robert Frankenberg and Ed Chatlos regarding Amendment No. 2 .
However , both men had left Novell before Amendment No. 2 was negotiated and had no involvement in the negotiation of the amendment .
Frankenberg Dep. at 86 ; Chatlos Decl . ¶ 4 . SCO relies on the testimony of several other individuals involved in the business , but none of them admits to being involved in the negotiations of Amendment No. 2 or to having any specific recollection of the negotiations with respect to the transfer of copyrights .
How rosy do SCO 's prospects look to you now ?
Even if they could get the case remanded back to Utah for a jury trial , how can they win against all that ?
They literally have n't got a single witness that I 've seen put forward that they can use to rebut the clear story Novell presents .
No doubt that is why Judge Kimball ruled as he did .
SCO is presenting to the bankruptcy court that if they can just win the appeal , it 's a slam dunk for them after that .
I disagree .

Transferred its UNIX copyright registrations to Santa Cruz , which transferred them to SCO in 2001 .
SCO has possession of the registrations .
Modified the copyright notices on the UNIX source code existing at the time of the APA to reflect the change in ownership of the copyrights from Novell to Santa Cruz .
Reported to the APA transition team that " the following changes have been made " to existing UNIX code at the request of Santa Cruz : " SCO copyrights added to documentation and software . "
Admitted that " All of the technology and intellectual assets " in existing UNIX source code " will be transitioned to SCO sometime after December 1 , 1995 . "
24
Announced in a joint press release that " SCO will acquire Novell 's UnixWare business and UNIX intellectual property . "
Notified its customers that Novell had transferred " its existing ownership interest in UNIX System - based offerings and related products " to Santa Cruz and referred to Santa Cruz as " the owner " of the UNIX software .
These UNIX assets were identified as " All Releases of UNIX System V and prior Releases of the UNIX System . "
Admitted that Santa Cruz had purchased the UNIX business " lock , stock and barrel . "
Contemporaneous with the APA and its amendments , Santa Cruz : Shipped countless UnixWare products with a Santa Cruz copyright notice on the product discs , without objection from Novell .
Announced in its 1995 Annual Report that it had acquired " certain assets related to the UNIX business including the core intellectual property from Novell . "
Wilson Sonsini , the law firm that represented Novell in the APA , was Santa Cruz 's counsel in connection with the 1995 Annual Report .

Stated through its investment banker that , under the APA , Santa Cruz " will obtain the IP " for UNIX , UnixWare , and all UNIX - related products .

Recited in a 1998 agreement with Microsoft that " SCO has acquired AT&T 's ownership of the copyright in the UNIX System V operating system . "
As UNIX copyright holder , brought a complaint against Microsoft before the European Commission in 1997 , representing that it had " acquired ownership of the copyright to UNIX , " and referring to itself as " the copyright owner of UNIX . "
operative
Breach of Contract and Unfair Competition .
SCO also brought claims against Novell for breach of contract and unfair competition based in part on Novell 's wrongful exercise of its rights under Article 4.16 ( b ) of the APA in defense of IBM .
For its part , Novell sought a declaration that its Article 4.16 ( b ) rights extend to
26
Article 4.16 ( b ) grants
Novell the right to " amend , supplement , modify or waive any rights " under certain licenses called " SVRX Licenses " in the APA .
The scope of Novell 's rights therefore turns on the meaning of the term " SVRX Licenses " as used in the contract .
Novell argued , and the district court on summary judgment ruled , that the term " SVRX Licenses " unambiguously includes IBM 's Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
But that is not what the APA provides .
Article 4.16 ( a ) identifies the " SVRX Licenses " by pointing to a list in Item VI of the Assets Schedule :
Following the Closing , Buyer shall administer the collection of all royalties , fees and other amounts due under the SVRX Licenses ( as listed in detail under Item VI of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) hereof and referred to herein as " SVRX Royalties ) .
All contracts relating to the SVRX Licenses and Auxiliary Product Licenses ( collectively " SVRX Licenses " ) listed below :
27
In addition , the district court confused the introductory sentence of Item VI with the list that appears under that sentence .
Like all other Items in the Asset Schedule , Item VI identified assets being transferred to Santa Cruz under the APA .
In that context , Item VI identifies " all contracts relating to the SVRX Licenses " listed below it as assets that Santa Cruz was purchasing .
Instead of independently listing the " SVRX Licenses " over which Novell was retaining waiver rights , Article 4.16 cross-referenced a portion of Item VI - the list .
By its own terms , the clear language of Article 4.16 applies only to the SVRX Licenses " listed below " the introductory sentence of Item VI - not to " all contracts relating to " the list .
Finally , the Software and Sublicensing Agreements , such as those executed by IBM , are separately listed as assets sold to Santa Cruz without any reservation of rights for Novell , under Item III of the Assets Schedule :
All of Seller 's rights pertaining to UNIX and UnixWare under any software development contracts , licenses and any other contracts to
28
which Seller is a party or by which it is bound and which pertain to the Business . . . including without limitation . . .
Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
Messrs .
Frankenberg , Chatlos , Thompson , Mattingly , Mohan , Wilt , Michels , and Sabbath , and Ms. Madsen all testified that Article 4.16 ( b ) was not intended to apply to Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
William Broderick and John Maciaszek , executives in Novell 's UNIX licensing group , specifically testified that Novell used the term " SVRX Licenses " to refer to other agreements that Novell and AT&T used in licensing individual SVRX products under the terms of the Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
SCO also showed that Novell and Santa Cruz previously resolved in SCO 's favor the very same dispute concerning the scope of the Article 4.16 ( b ) rights .
In April 1996 , without informing Santa Cruz , Novell and IBM entered into a so - called amendment of IBM's Software and Sublicensing Agreements granting IBM limited rights to distribute AIX source code .
29
Novell 's CEO , Mr. Frankenberg , did not challenge those assertions , and indeed , over the ensuing six months of negotiations , Novell did not once invoke its Article 4.16 ( b ) rights , as it did in 2003 .
Instead , Novell and Santa Cruz resolved the issue by executing Amendment No. 2 to the APA and two related agreements .
Pursuant to this resolution , Novell paid Santa Cruz $ 1.5 million for a release of claims against Novell for its execution of the unauthorized amendment and Novell also agreed that it " may not prevent SCO from exercising its rights with respect to SVRX source code in accordance with " the APA .
Copyright Infringement Claim .
SCO also brought a claim for copyright infringement against Novell based on its distribution of Linux products through its wholly owned subsidiary SuSE Linux , which Novell acquired in 2004 with a $ 50 million investment by IBM .
In addition , Novell 's distribution of Linux was also a partial basis for SCO 's breach of contract and unfair competition claims .
The

5 . The Strength of SCO 's Claims Against IBM .
In May 2006 , Dr. Jeffrey Leitzinger concluded that " IBM has received over $ 12 billion in Linux - related revenues and over $ 4 billion in Linux - related profits " since 2000 .
Dr. Leitzinger also concluded at that time that " SCO lost $ 753 million in profits and ongoing business value " since 2000 , " in connection with IBM 's unauthorized disclosures of SCO 's intellectual property , technology , methods and concepts . "
Consistent with Dr. Leitzinger 's opinion , Professor Avner Kalay , another expert , concluded that " the market value of the asset that SCO lost through the alleged breach of contract by IBM " was " between a low of $ 597,845,000 and a high of $ 717,414,000 " at the onset of the breach in February 2000 .
As to damages resulting from IBM 's unauthorized distribution of AIX after the termination of its Software and Sublicensing Agreements , Professor Christine Botosan concluded that " IBM generated actual AIX related revenues of $ 9,373.51 million during the
31
In addressing damages resulting from IBM 's misuse of SCO code provided in Project Monterey , Professor Botosan concluded that " IBM generated actual AIX related revenues of $ 9,490.55 million " and " AIX related profits of $ 4,694.82 million , " between October 1 , 2000 and June 13 , 2003 , the date SCO terminated IBM's Software and Sublicensing Agreements .
Professor Botosan calculated damages only through June 13 , 2003 , to avoid double - counting damages already included in her analysis of the copyright infringement claim for AIX .
Contract Claims .
AT&T's legal department created a Software Agreement and a Sublicensing Agreement that imposed strict requirements on licensees ' use , export , transfer , and disclosure of the UNIX - derived software .
The cornerstones of these protections were Sections 7.06 ( a ) and 2.01 of the Software Agreement .
Section 7.06 ( a ) of the Agreement states in relevant part :
LICENSEE agrees that it shall hold all parts of the SOFTWARE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement in confidence for AT&T .
LICENSEE further agrees that it shall not make any disclosure of
32
any or all of such SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ( Including methods or concepts utilized therein ) to anyone , except to employees of LICENSEE to whom such disclosure is necessary to the use for which rights are granted hereunder .
AT&T grants to LICENSEE a personal , nontransferable and nonexclusive right to use in the United States each SOFTWARE PRODUCT identified in the one or more Supplements hereto , solely for LICENSEE'S own internal business purposes and solely on or in conjunction with DESIGNATED CPUs for such SOFTWARE PRODUCT .
Such right to use includes the right to modify such SOFTWARE PRODUCT and to prepare derivative works based on such SOFTWARE PRODUCT , provided the resulting materials are treated hereunder as part of the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT .
33
SCO also brought claims against IBM for breach of its Sublicensing Agreements .
IBM 's Sublicensing Agreements authorized it to distribute binary - code versions of its UNIX - derivative products - AIX and Dynix - provided that IBM complied with the requirements of the Software Agreements .
In light of IBM 's breaches of its Software Agreements , SCO terminated IBM 's Sublicensing Agreements in 2003 .
When IBM continued thereafter to distribute AIX and Dynix , SCO brought claims for breach of the Sublicensing Agreements based on those ongoing distributions .
IBM has not disputed the facts that underlie SCO 's contract claims : AIX and Dynix are UNIX - derivative works , and IBM dumped substantial portions of AIX and Dynix into Linux and disclosed the methods and concepts found in UNIX , AIX , and Dynix in developing Linux .
Instead of disputing these facts , IBM has primarily argued that the protections in the Software Agreement apply only to the literal source code from the licensed UNIX product , and not to the methods and concepts and other intellectual property embodied in the code , or to any part of code physically written by IBM or Sequent in developing AIX and Dynix .
That is not remotely what the Software Agreement says , and IBM 's interpretation gives no meaning to entire provisions .
Section 2.01 required IBM to use the UNIX product " solely for [ its ] own internal business purposes " on specified CPUs , and Section 7.06 ( a ) required IBM to keep " all parts " of the UNIX software confidential , including specifically the " methods and concepts "
34
Copyright Infringement .
In addition to the fact that over 440,000 lines of source code in AIX are literally copied from SVr4 , IBM itself placed " Origin Codes " on 179 files in AIX to signify that the files were derived from UNIX System V .
Those files form the most important part of the AIX kernel .
They form the heart of AIX functionality ; it is impossible for AIX to function on any level without them .
The structure of AIX 4.3 is substantially similar to the structure of SVr4 .
AIX includes approximately 90 % of the SV r4 system calls .
In addition , AIX brings together several elements in a manner similar to SVr4 , such as the system calls , file system , shared memory , sockets , files , and pipes , as well as the fact that AIX is structured as a monolithic kernel .
The structure of AIX 5.3 is substantially similar to the structure of SVr4 in the same way as AIX 4.3 , which compels the inference that all versions of AIX
35
between those two versions share the same similarity in system calls and structure .
Dr. Thomas Cargill concluded that " it would be an astonishing coincidence if the selection , arrangement , and coordination of elements in Linux were developed independently from the remarkably similar selection , arrangement , and coordination of elements in SVr4 . "
Linux was developed through systematic copying of SCO 's copyrighted material .
Linux Torvalds , the person who conceived Linux , started with a " UNIX variant . "
He then referred to the manuals for the Sun Microsystems version of UNIX : " That 's how early development was done .
I was reading the standards from either the Sun OS manual or various books , just picking off system calls one by one and trying to make something that worked . "
In a presentation touting the UNIX - derived strengths of Linux , IBM admitted that " UNIX was a pre-write to Linux " and that Linux is " a UNIX - like operating system . "
IBM described Linux as " an independent UNIX OS implementation , that complies with the standard specifications that define the basic UNIX
***********************
SCO seems not to realize that they undermine themselves by the second quotation .
In saying that IBM described Linux as " an independent " implementation , it is saying that it is NOT a derivative of UNIX or anything else .
So the statement does not prove that IBM " admitted " that Linux is a derivative of UNIX .
In fact , it proves the opposite , that IBM said it was n't a derivative .
***************************
36
environment , " as a " community - developed version of UNIX , " or simply as " derived from UNIX . "
IBM has also repeatedly admitted that it copies Linux onto its machines , contributes to the Linux code base , and provides and promotes Linux products and services - all violations of the Copyright Act if SCO is found to be the owner of the relevant UNIX copyrights .
Instead of disputing that it has engaged in its undeniable Linux - related activities , IBM has primarily argued that SCO is not the owner of the relevant UNIX copyrights because Novell retained them under the Asset Purchase Agreement by which it transferred the UNIX business to Santa Cruz , SCO 's predecessor , in 1995 ( the " APA " ) .
Unfair Competition .
SCO 's unfair competition claim was based primarily on IBM 's conduct in connection with Project Monterey , which was supposed to be a joint venture between IBM and Santa Cruz to develop a UNIX - based operating system and related products for a new Intel 64 - bit chip in the late 1990s .
Through a trail of smoking - gun e-mails and other IBM internal documents , SCO showed that IBM made a conscious decision to abandon the project , concentrate instead on a competing Linux solution , and keep SCO in the dark about this decision .
IBM led SCO to believe that IBM intended to continue the project to the benefit of both partners .
This deprived SCO of the opportunity to find other partners , to upgrade its UNIX products to compete with Linux , and to avoid wasting the company 's resources on Project Monterey .
37
B. Cause " Does Not Exist Under Section 1112 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( B) Because the Estates Have
Not Been Grossly Mismanaged .
It is no secret that the Debtors filed bankruptcy , among other reasons , to stay alive long enough to allow SCO to prosecute an appeal of a seriously prejudicial ruling by the district court in Utah .
***********************
Judge Kimball is certainly not prejudiced against SCO , although some trolls are pushing that thought and SCO executives have been busy saying negative things about him to the media .
All that means to me is that if the case is sent back to Utah , SCO may try to get a different judge .
If a judge is " prejudiced " , it can be grounds t
This mosaic picture of the moon was compiled from mages taken by the Galileo spacecraft in 1992 .
The north polar region is near the top part of the mosaic , which also shows Mare Imbrium , the dark area on the left ; Mare Serenitatis at center ; and Mare Crisium , the circular dark area to the right .
There have been raging debates over the years as to whether there is frozen water on the moon or not .
Soon two NASA spacecraft , a lunar spycraft and a kamikaze probe , will help answer the question by peering into the permanent darkness of craters at the moon 's south pole .
The new moon probes , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the LCROSS impactor , are set to blast off this week on NASA 's first mission to the moon in more than a decade .
Any ice they discover could not only be used to quench an astronaut 's thirst , but also to help fuel rockets for adventures beyond the moon .
All moon rocks collected so far suggest that its surface is bone dry , with any water that might come from impacting comets baked off by the sun , except perhaps for a few water molecules trapped in volcanic glass beads .
Still , there are deep craters at the moon 's poles have received no sunlight for 2 billion years or more , and in the cold of these permanent shadows — minus 328 degrees F ( minus 200 degrees C ) — researchers have suggested ice might have survived , explained Anthony Colaprete , principal investigator on NASA 's LCROSS , short for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite .
NASA will decide today whether to launch the two moon probes on Wednesday as planned , or delay their flight to Friday to allow the shuttle Endeavour to lift off on June 17 .
The shuttle 's launch has been delayed since June 13 due to a hydrogen gas leak .
Where is it ?
Controversial evidence for whether there is water on the moon began appearing in 1996 with the Clementine probe , a joint Pentagon - NASA project .
Radar scans of the lunar surface reflected back the kind of signals at the south pole that one might expect of ice and other frozen compounds .
However , later studies using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico revealed similar reflections " even from areas exposed to sunlight , places too warm for water ice to survive , " Colaprete said .
This suggested the reflections that Clementine saw might have come not from water but from piles of rocks .
But in 1998 , NASA 's Lunar Prospector also detected hints of water , this time at both poles .
Its instruments analyzed neutrons absorbed by a variety of elements on the moon 's surface , including hydrogen .
With this device , Lunar Prospector discovered hydrogen concentrated at the moon 's poles , which scientists conjectured might have come from water molecules , each of which contains two hydrogen atoms .
Researchers speculated the moon 's poles could hold as much as 3 billion metric tons of ice .
The problem is that Lunar Prospector could only measure hydrogen , and not what matter the hydrogen was in .
Instead of ice , the hydrogen might come from water bound up in clays , or protons from the solar wind , or the kind of carbon - laden molecules from comets that might have been part of the organic soup that life developed from on Earth , " or a mix of all those things , " Colaprete said .
The upcoming LCROSS will crash two probes into the moon .
Its partner probe , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , will map the moon from orbit and work with other ground and space - based assets to scan the LCROSS impacts .
By analyzing the plume , scientists hope to answer once and for all whether there is water there .
The icy cold truth
Any ice there might be on the moon could be key to the future of humanity in space .
Although it could supply water for colonists to drink or grow food , more importantly , it could get split up to make hydrogen and oxygen for fuel for rockets .
" It costs about $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 per pound to launch something in the space shuttle , and there are about 8 pounds of water to a gallon , so we 're talking about $ 100,000 to bring a gallon of water to low Earth orbit , " Colaprete said .
" If we can use the lunar poles as a resource , we could use them as staging bases to go elsewhere on the moon , or beyond the moon , or beyond Mars or Europa or elsewhere we 'd want to go .
You would n't have to bring up millions of gallons of fuel , you could produce it on the moon . "
In addition , lunar ice might have survived untouched for billions of years , so it could " serve as a fantastic time capsule into the past , " Colaprete said .
" This is ice that could date back just as the Earth and moon and inner solar system as a whole were evolving , what kind of organic molecules might have been delivered to Earth .
What hits the moon also hits the Earth . "
If there is ice there , LCROSS could also show what form it is in - whether it is smoothly spread out in small grains across the crater , or in chunky patches .
This could make a difference in how the ice is mined - whether astronauts simply scoop it up anywhere or have to go hunting for patches .
" The results we 'll get could be critical for determining how we explore and make use of the moon , " Colaprete said .
Editor 's note :
This story has been updated to correctly reflect that 1 gallon of water weighs about 8 pounds .
Perhaps the most striking paradox of modern economics is the existence of near - record levels of involuntary unemployment .
Consider : there are millions of people who have bills and obligations to pay , for things that they want to keep ( but are in danger of losing to their creditors ) .
Among these millions ( and their creditors , perhaps ) , to dig up an antiquated term , you ’d think there would be some double - coincidence of wants .
That is , could n’t they help themselves by helping each other ?
In Michigan , something like 14 % of the work - force is currently unemployed .
These people are losing their homes , their cars , their families — their lives .
Nationally , I believe the figure is currently around 9 % which is a 25 - year high .
But few , if any of these people want to be unemployed .
They did n’t quit their jobs .
They did n’t stop paying their obligations because they are deadbeats , scofflaws , or criminals .
They were essentially forced out of work , into their current condition , by a grossly perverted economic system .
Could n’t they help themselves ?
Yes .
And no .
I ’ve been pondering this paradox for a while now :
As long as needs and wants remain unsatisfied , it does n’t make sense that people are losing jobs left and right .
Yes , we could help ourselves by helping each other .
But no , unfortunately , there are decades and decades of interference contributing to unsustainable growth , unsustainable structures of production , and unsustainable levels of debt , which all need to be undone .
Undoing it will be painful .
The political choice is to slap a band - aid on it , grant everyone a reprieve of uncertain duration , and attempt to restore faith in the zombieconomy , which as John Robb succinctly states ,
When authorities resort to propaganda confidence building instead of substantive action in response to an actual crisis , you know you are in real trouble
This band - aid , “ confidence building ” course of action may appear to “ fix ” the economy .
Until the next crisis , crises of course being endemic to the system .
In reality , restoring faith in a system which deserves none , only serves to perpetuate a system which will only continue to suck the life out of humanity until it is slain , or until it takes us all down with it .
What we need is a sustainable economy , and the degree to which we can wrest ourselves free of the crushing and now insatiable debt burdens , foist upon us by the zombieconomy is extremely limited .
The zombieconomy is unsustainable , because it thrives on the perpetuation of debt , which itself thrives upon mere faith .
I submit that no viable system can survive on faith alone .
I sustainable economy must ( in accordance with Say ’s Law ) be erected upon a foundation of production and free exchange .
All that needs to be done is nothing !
Let people produce wealth unimpeded , let them be free in order that they may propser .
The zombieconomy needs to be broken .
Some good old - fashioned , well - timed revolts wo n’t hurt .
Revolts against the status quo .
Revolts against a broken monetary system which is the foundation of our shell - game , rat -race economy .
Agorism is the weapon of choice .
Agorism is the non-violent , free - market - based means by which individuals , acting in their own best interests ( in order to satisfy the interests of other individuals ) , may achieve lasting prosperity .
When the white market refuses to employ you ( and one - in - seven of your neighbors ) for wage or salary , you and your neighbors need to ask yourselves , “ What can we do for one another , which previously required our dependence upon the zombieconomy that utterly failed to provide for us ?
What can we do to reduce our reliance on this system ? ”
Here we are , one - in - ten or one - in - seven unemployed but with needs yet unmet .
Is n’t there a way for us to meet one another ’s needs ?
Answer those questions , and break the chains that bind .
The interwebs are all a - twitter with speculation about a nefarious Twitter bug that could soon doom us all to fail - whale purgatory .
The truth , however , is that the so - called Twitpocalypse will probably not do much damage at all .
Each message that is posted to the popular Twitter microblogging service is automatically assigned a unique numerical ID that distinguishes it from other messages .
The ID values for new messages are getting higher as the volume of total messages posted to the service increases .
The premise behind the Twitpocalypse scare is that the ID numbers will soon exceed 2,147,483,647 , which is the highest value that can fit in a 32 - bit signed integer .
In theory , when Twitter ID values exceed that number , the resulting integer overflow will cause things to break .
At the current rate that users are posting Twitter messages , the ID numbers will reach that value by the end of the night .
The Twitter service itself is designed to accommodate higher numbers and is not susceptible to the problem .
In practice , it 's only going to effect a slim number of the most poorly written third - party Twitter programs .
Many modern high - level programming languages completely insulate programmers from these kinds of problems and use abstract numerical types that do n't have the same kind of hard size limitations .
For software that is written in lower - level programming languages , it 's still unclear if the Twitpocalypse is going to be problematic .
Third - party Twitter applications get their data from Twitter through the service 's APIs .
If a Twitter client application is retrieving a message stream as XML , then the program will parse the XML , pull out all of the values as strings , and then convert them to other types as needed .
Most third - party Twitter software developers are hopefully smart enough to use appropriate types for the ID values .
For the vast majority of desktop clients , there is no need to treat the ID value as an integer .
In fact , we suspect that most clients that are using Twitter 's XML feed store the ID values internally as strings .
The only major use for the ID on the client side is to specify which message a reply is directed to via the Twitter API 's in_reply_to_status_id parameter .
This is sent as part of the URL string , so it does n't need to be an integer for that .
The other major data interchange format that is supported by Twitter 's API is JSON .
Unlike XML , JSON does differentiate between string and number types .
Twitter 's JSON timeline specifies that the ID value is a number , so it is likely treated as such by programs .
Most third - party Twitter software that uses JSON , however , will be using a canned JSON library rather than rolling their own JSON parser .
This means that it will be up to the library to take the JSON content and determine how to handle the type conversion .
This is when we start to see some potential problems .
I suspect that most JSON libraries handle large numbers appropriately , but some might not .
All things considered , we doubt that we will see a lot of third - party Twitter software breaking down as a result of this issue .
TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) - Triumph International , maker of the solar , postal and chopstick bras , is offering a new kind of support for Japanese women on the prowl for a husband .
Japan ’s marriage rate is falling and the average age at which women get married is over 28 years , relatively late for a country in which single females were once considered over the hill at 25 .
Triumph ’s latest novelty bra features an electronic nuptial timepiece , putting women seeking spouses literally on the clock .
If an engagement ring is inserted into the mechanism , the countdown stops and the bra plays Felix Mendelssohn ’s “ The Wedding March . ”
The bra also includes holders for the traditional seal some people use to sign off contracts and a pen for any possible nuptial agreement .
Triumph spokeswoman Keiko Masuda said the product , which is not for sale , would suit modern Japanese women who are no longer content to sit and wait for a potential husband to approach them .
“ Japanese women are becoming more aggressive than men , working actively to make marriage happen , whereas in the past it was men who led women toward marriage , ” she said .
“ The roles have switched completely . ”
Government statistics show nearly 57 percent of women under the age of 34 are unmarried , while some 3,800 firms in Japan offer match - making services .
However , it is not always possible or practical to put pets in a locked room of their own during your party , especially in smaller living spaces .
You can still create a " safe zone " where pets can escape guests in a corner , open closet or even under a table .
Baby gates are particularly useful for this .
Simply place the baby gate in a closet doorway or hallway which you intend as the pet 's safe zone leaving a space under it big enough for the pet to easy get under .
Apply a " Do Not Disturb " or " Pets Only " sign to the baby gate and reasonable guests should respect the boundary you have created .
You can also create a barrier by tacking up a blanket or sheet or draping one over one or more chairs to block the safe zone from the common area of your home .
This will provide your pet with a safe , cave - like hiding spot .
Provide your pets with food , water , toys , and bedding in their safe zone .
If the litter box requires kitty to cross an area expected to be busy , give her a temporary litter pan in her safe zone .
If you use a closet to create a safe zone , do not close the door to the closet , always use a " door " such as a baby gate or curtain which allows for air flow in such enclosed spaces .

This volume is intended to compress , within the narrowest limits , an account of Negro life in the United States of America .
I have consulted the most reliable histories , and made personal inquiries with great care , and can conscientiously present the story as trustworthy .
No desire has been felt about gratifying the spirit of any race , but fairness to both white and black has been carefully kept in sight ; the oppressors of the Negro have been looked at from every point of view in the hope of finding some excuse for their cruelty .
In my work as a Christian teacher I have naturally felt the deepest sympathy for the poor and needy , and devoted my chief care to them .
I was born a slave , and lived for several years with the poorest of the poor , and can never forget my own poverty and sufferings ; to help the down - trodden is a desire which never leaves me .
When the Public Meeting , which was held at the Wilberforce Memorial Church , Priestly Road , Birmingham , England , on the 28th of May , 1894 , passed the following resolutions : -- " RESOLVED : That the Rev. Peter Stanford ( England 's Coloured Preacher ) be deputed , in the Page ii Page ii interests of the philanthropic and Christian public of England , to visit the States for the purpose of investigating these alleged outrages , and of there pleading with the prominent white Christians to induce them to exert their influence in preventing further reprisals , and in insisting upon the enforcement of law and order . "
" RESOLVED :
That this meeting , having implicit confidence in the impartiality and good judgment as a representative of his race , hereby desires to assure the Rev. Peter Stanford of their entire sympathy and support " : -- I felt there was nothing for me to do but relinquish my pastoral work in England , and as best I might proceed to discharge the new duties thrust upon me .
Leaving my Birmingham Church was the greatest trial of my life .
Greater than the trials of my youth , because then I knew not the meaning of human sympathy and helpfulness ; greater than those of school and college days ; it was my greatest trial because the kindness and love of many friends must be left behind , could not longer be enjoyed in all the paths afforded by church fellowship , neither requited with gratitude in bodily presence .
Until the day shall come that will witness my departure from this world , I can not forget the splendid generosity of my Birmingham Church members , and their sympathy in every time of trial will be enshrined in my heart .

When I arrived at America , and proceeded to make investigation into the condition of my race , I was soon convinced that a pamphlet of ten or a dozen pages would not afford space enough for a satisfactory description of it to be made ; indeed , were I to arrange , and print all the material now in my possession a book several times the size of this one would have to be issued .
The history of the Negro in America cannot yet be written ; but when it shall be written it will be a terrible comment on the character of many so - called Christians .
Pain , cruelty , and death will appear on almost every page .
Having investigated as thoroughly as time , ability , and means permitted , the various outrages reported in the press , and finding myself with material enough for a large book , after much consideration and consultation with friends of my race , I decided that a brief story of Negro life in the States would best answer my purpose .
I saw that the outrages of to - day are merely repetitions of previous outrages , the bad , poisonous fruit of seed sown in the distant and near past , and was convinced that the Negro 's cause would be best helped forward by a condensed statement of slave history from the beginning .
If I have successfully compassed my intention , the reader will be able in some measure to understand , at small expenditure Page iv Page iv of money and time , the indescribable horrors of slavery , and see the fearful darkness in which my people lived for centuries , and in which millions of them now live .
To tell the story as effectually as possible , observations are made on Africa , and why and how the Negro was brought thence is explained ; a few remarks are made respecting American geography and the founding of the States ; John Brown , the puritan descendant who attempted to free the slaves , is described ; what befell the Negro from 1619 to this present day is told in the briefest manner ; Lynchings , which are so diabolically done until now , are set forth in the mildest possible language ; some friends of the race are named with gratitude ; the different conditions of the Negro of the North and his brother of the South are made as clear as the writers ability permits ; and some suggestions are made for the consideration of all Christian people in respect of the future .
The attention of the reader is directed to the labour of the American Missionary Association among the coloured people of the South , of which it is impossible to speak with too much praise , and Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute , Alabama , Wilberforce University , Ohio , Guadalupe College , Texas , Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute , Virginia , Howard University , Washington , Page v Page v D. C. , and Livingstone College , North Carolina , are mentioned gratefully , and brief descriptions of the educational work they do are given .
These Christian and Educational Institutions will help the Negro to attain a complete victory over all his opponents .
Sending this " TRAGEDY OF THE NEGRO IN AMERICA " -- to me it is a tragedy -- to the public , I can not withold gratitude from any of the friends who have helped me , but do thank one and all most sincerely for the asssistance they have so willingly rendered .
Their reward must be my deepest thankfulness and , as I hope , an improved and healthier public opinion on the Negro question .
Praying and hoping for God 's blessing on this poor effort to expose a perpetuated wrong and help bring nearer the day of universal brotherhood , and that He may send labourers , more and more , into the " black malarial slough , " and make them competent to convey
His love and enlightening spirit to the millions of my race there living , I send it forth in humility to do whatever of good is possible .
P. T. S. Page vii Page vii BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH .
That the public may know who the writer is , and that this book may go forth with every mark of honesty and sincerity upon it , and , above all , that sympathy may be enlarged in the hearts of all Christians for the Negro of the " Black South , " the author deems it his duty to put aside delicacy of feeling and give the following particulars of his life .
Fortunately he is under no necessity of writing of himself ; he is spared that undesirable task by several newspapers and journals , quotations from whose articles , published at different times , will be found below .
The Christian Educator , edited by J. W. Hamilton , D.D. , and M. C. B. Mason , D.D. , the Official Magazine of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the South , in its issue of October and November , 1896 , says : --" In Birmingham , England , there is a congregation which is white that had a black preacher for several years .
This distinguished preacher is the Rev. Peter Thomas Stanford , D.D. , who was born a slave .
His parents lived at Hampton , Virginia .
His father was sold before he was born , and his mother was taken away from him when he was only four years old .
While yet a child he attracted the attention of General Armstrong , and was received Page viii Page viii into his Home for Black Orphan Children .
From the Home he was taken to Boston , where he was received into the family of Mr. Perry L. Stan - ford , whose name he adopted .
Here he remained until he was twelve years of age , when , for some trivial matter , he ran away from Mr. Stanford , and became a wanderer among the street arabs in New York City .
When Messrs .
Moody and Sankey began their tabernacle meetings in that city , he was attracted through curiosity to attend them , and was led to become a Christian .
Through the kindness of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe , the Rev. Henry Highland Garnett , and the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher , he was educated at Suffield Institute , in Suffield , Connecticut .
While attending the school he began to preach ; was ordained pastor of the Mt. Zion Baptist Church , Hartford , on the twenty - sixth day of September , 1878 .
In 1880 he went to Canada , and was there employed by the African Baptist Association .
He became pastor of the Horton Street Baptist Church in London , Ontario , and later on was editor of The Christian Defender .
He went from Canada to England .
He was kindly received by the English people , and greatly encouraged to prosecute his work as a Christian minister .
August 13 , 1888 , he married Miss Beatrice Mabel Stickley , an English lady , who was a cultivated Christian woman .
He went to Birmingham , where he be- came pastor of the Wilberforce Memorial Church .
The congregation was composed largely of the laboring people , who were greatly attached to their preacher .
Here he continued for eight years , doing heroic work .
He was popular , and treated with Page ix Page ix great consideration by men of position and influence .
During the agitation over the lynching of Negroes in this country , eminent citizens came together and organized a committee to protest against the barbarous treatment of black criminals in the United States .
Mr. Stanford did effective service in the public meetings which were held , and the interest which was awakened led to his return to America , where he has since remained .
He accepted work at first under the direction of the Massachusetts Home Missionary Society .
He is an earnest and interesting public speaker .
He delivered one of the addresses at the recent International Christian Endeavor Convention , held in Washington , D. C. "
The following was sent by the members of the Wilberforce Memorial Church and Congregation : -- " To the Editor of the Freeman : -- On Monday and Tuesday , September 30th and October 1st , 1894 , the farewell services of the Rev. Peter Stanford , who is soon to leave England as her representative upon the lynch - law question , were held at the Wilberforce Memorial Church , Priestly Road .
On Monday a crowded and enthusiastic public meeting was held , over which the Rev. W. A. H. Babidge presided .
During his address he said : " For a testimony to Rev. Peter Stanford 's worth and work in the city of Birmingham , we need only refer to the large congregation which assembled at his farewell services , and in the name of the Bible Xian Conference and my colleagues , I wish Mr. Stanford god-speed and great success in his undertaking on behalf of his brethren in America . '
Mr. J. Hallett , the assistant minister , offered prayer , and then a scene of the most pleasing Page x Page x character took place .
A. D. Chin , Secretary of the church much of the time during Mr. Stanford 's ministry in Birmingham , stepped forward and informed him that he had been intrusted with a number of useful gifts to present him on that occasion .
An illuminated address containing a photo of the chapel and public buildings of the city , costing $ 30 ; a farewell address ; a number of volumes rebound ; a fountain pen ; a traveling reading lamp ; a traveling dressing case , and a jug with Revs. John Wesley and Peter Stanford 's pictures engraved thereon ; a gold ring with Masons ' emblems .
Letters of encouragement were received from the following : Sir James Sawyer , Knight ; Revs. W. Wallace , George Campbell Morgan , Charles Joseph , N. M. Hennesey , T. Travers Sherlock , B. A. , Richard Cadbury , Esq. , and J. P. Mosely .
Addresses were given by H. E. Carl , Chairman of the Lynch Law Repression League , Thos .
Wright , Esq. , of the Peace Society , and J. Milton Chasterton , Esq . On Tuesday and Friday evenings , special credentials were presented to Mr. Stanford from the Ancient Order of Foresters and the Grand United Order of Good Templars , and before the Reverend gentleman sails he will receive the special commission from the Ancient Order of Buffaloes and Freemasons , of which he is an active member .
The meeting was altogether of a very satisfactory character , and was a happy punctuation to this part of Mr. Stanford 's life in Birmingham , and will be an inspiration to him in the new piece of work which he has undertaken . "
Page xi Page xi Page xii Page xii The Boston Courant , March 13 , 1897 , says :-- " The Rev. Stanford arrived in this city June 1st , 1895 , not quite two years ago , and when we consider the amount of work accomplished by him in so short a time we are amazed .
In August , 1895 , at the urgent request of the leading colored citizens of Boston , the Doctor founded the first and only congregational church in the city of Boston .
The churches invited were all the Congregational Churches in Boston , the Harvard Congregational Church , Brookline , and Rev. Joshua Coit , Rev , H. A. Bridgman , Rev. C. H. Daniels , D , D. , Rev. A. E. Dunning , D. D. , Rev. Geo. H. Gutterson , Rev. E. B. Palmer , Rev. H. A. Quint , D. D. , Rev. D. W. Waldron .
In September , 1895 , the Doctor , finding his new church well organized , lent himself to other important interests of the race .
He and the Rev. W. H. Scott united their efforts in the formation of the Interdenominational Ministerial Association , and the Doctor served for six months as its secretary .
He has written letters to the British press on Negro questions , also many able articles to our daily papers in Boston .
In November , 1896 , the Doctor was called upon to preach a sermon to the ministers of the Suffolk South Association of Congregational white ministers on the subject , ' What the influence of the ministry should be in literature , ' and in commenting upon it some of the ablest of them said the Doctor 's sermon was an able production .
The trustees of one of our leading colleges are seeking to further honor their great and influential institution of learning by conferring upon the Doctor the degree of L.L.D. , and we hasten to Page xiii Page xiii urge his acceptance , and will be the first to acknowledge that he is the Rev. P. Thos .
Stanford , D.D. , L.L.D. , America's " Negro Beecher " and England 's colored minister , and author of " From Bondage to Liberty , " and " The Tragedy of The Negro in America . "
Zion Congregational Church ,
Haverhill , Mass . , May 5th , 1897 .
REV .
P. THOS .
STANFORD , D.D. , L.L.D. , Rev. and Dear Sir :-- Some twelve months ago a few of us met together to talk over matters pertaining to the welfare of our people and to see what we as colored citizens in Haverhill could do to assist in bettering the condition of the race .
We were not long in arriving at the conclusion that much could be done .
Haverhill has a population of fifty thousand , of which seven hundred are colored , and this number is being augmented every year .
Having been organized into a regular Church of the Congregational faith , we have set ourselves the task of helping to build up our people , intellectually , morally and spiritually .
We want a house of worship , also a suitable building in which to provide for and train some of the orphan and neglected negro children , who are to be found in the rural districts of the Southern States , for whom no provision has as yet been made .
We have been praying earnestly and the burden of our prayers has been that God would send us a leader .

Knowing your world - wide reputation as a minister of the Gospel and as an ardent defender of our race , we feel that there is no one better able to direct our efforts in this important work .
We therefore unite in extending to you this unanimous call and hereby agree , should you decide to accept , that you have all the time you may require for your projected trip to England , and pray that the Great Head of the Church may send you to us .
Anxiously awaiting your reply ,
We are faithfully yours , Signed in behalf of the Church at the regular meeting , Friday Evening , April 23 , ' 97 ,
Signed in behalf of the Church at the regular meeting , Friday Evening , April 23 , '97 , ISAAC ROBERTS , Church Clerk .
Boston , May 10th , 1897 .
TO THE OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE ZION CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH , HAVERHILL , MASS . ,
Brethren :-- After much thought , prayer and consultation with friends , I have decided to accept your call to the partorate ; but must make my position very clear to you .
The work I have in hand respecting the whole Negro race in America , and the expectation of my many friends in England of hearing from me on the lynching question , will require and must receive much of my attention in the next twelve months .
Therefore , you will be prepared to accept such time and service as I will be able to give previous to my visit to Great Britain , also permit me , as you say in your call , to leave for that country in September or thereabouts , and return some time in the summer of 1898 .
Subject to these conditions and
Page xv
agreements , I accept .

CHAPTER I .
INTRODUCTORY .
MRS .
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE ,
AUTHOR OF " UNCLE TOM'S CABIN . "
Loss of life by unauthorized violence , and the resulting unhappiness to others , is called a tragedy ; and , every tragedy of real life has stimulated the best and the worst passions of mankind to vigorous interest and exertion .
All tragedies , however , have not been caused by unauthorized violence ; the pages of history are black with records of the foulest crimes , of violations of human rights and the divine law , by violence authorized and made legal by men in whom power was vested .
The history of the Martyrs of England , France and Spain is a tragedy which began in the distant past , whose pains and horrors , which were the direct result of misuse of power by cruel kings and bigoted statesmen , were realized by men and women of many generations ; and , in this day of civilization and advanced knowledge of christianity , the world is looking with weary eyes and sickened heart upon a tragedy in Armenia , commanded and made legal by the Sultan of Turkey , in which little children
Page 4
are mutilated , helpless women are outraged , and unarmed toiling men are horribly done to death .
This is an authorized , not an unauthorized , tragedy , which the whole world knows , but has not yet been outraged enough to stop it ; more cruelties must be done and more human blood must flow before the Christian powers will be sufficiently stimulated to dethrone the murderer and restore peace and order to the fairest garden of the east .
" Come and see the works of God : " said one of old , " His eyes behold the nations : let not the rebellious exalt themselves . "
" To me belongeth vengeance , and recompense ; their foot shall slide in due time : for the day of their calamity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make haste . "
Man knows not as God knows ; sees not as He sees .
It is written , however , so that he who runs may read , that all tyrants shall fall ; all cruelties will be avenged ; all powers which brutalize mankind must be either saved by fire or destroyed ; the righteousness of God is ordained to prevail in the world ; and , the brotherhood of man shall be fully established .
In America , -- which is known as the land of the free , whose people are rightly proud of a history that speaks of a noble , victorious struggle against tyranny ; of the wisdom , foresight , and piety of the founders of the States ; of the marvellous energy which transformed vast plains and forests into fields
Page 5
of wealth creating grain and fruit , built cities , established manufactures , and made a large sphere of art and science ;-- a long and revolting tragedy has been in progress , in which the Negro has sufferred indescribable misery and been afflicted with diabolical torture .
This also was a tragedy authorized by the powers that were , was recognized and defined by law , and endorsed and supported by not a few churches and religious teachers , in which the Negro was bound with chains , whipped with the lash , treated as a beast , sold in the common market as a thing , and , when he was no longer worth money , hurried to death and buried anyhow .
This authorized tragedy came to an end ; by fire , the fire of the vengeance of righteousness , it was destroyed .
In the great conflagration of the War of Emancipation , which would not have happened had the United States of America been willing to know God 's will without pain and blood - shed , no preserving angel walked to keep those from harm and death who were engaged therein ; the nation had sinned , and could not be relieved from sin 's penalty .
The nation paid the penalty in money and in blood , and thereby saved herself from the fate of Babylon , Assyria , and Rome .
Nations that forget God and forsake righteousness cannot abide ; they have been , and will be , overthrown .
Power cannot forever stay in the hand of the tyrant ; prosperity forsakes
Page 6
the land of blood ; ignorance and every debasing habit are the heritage of nations that do wickedly ; decay and destruction wait for the people who oppress the poor .
This authorized tragedy of the States , whose sufferer was the poor Negro , was always abhorred by pious men and righteous citizens , and eventually aroused the natural good feeling of the multitude , who together swept it away and prevented the country from sliding into immeasurable disgrace and calamity .
The authorized tragedy of the Negro in America , then , ended in a pouring out of blood and of treasure , and in a vast war tax which continues until now ; but did not in its death struggle engulf all the meanness of iniquity .
They who fought against emancipation , and many who fought for emancipation , when the war was over and the Negro set free , were unwilling , and remain unwilling , to recognize in him a brother .
He was free ; let him care for himself , and see what he could make of his freedom .
Free , it is true , but untaught , homeless , moneyless , a stranger in a land whose people loved him not .
Free ; yes , free ; to look on the fields he had made smile with harvests , but not to call one grain of the wheat his own ; to gaze with what intelligence was in him on all the wealth he had created , but not to find one copper of it in his own pocket ; to behold luxury and affluence all around him , but not to
Page 7
have a home for himself , in which to find shelter , peace , and love .
History tells of men being cast on uninhabited islands , in which naught but trees and wild fruit grew ; in which birds lived and reared their young , and wild beasts prowled and fought each other ; which was an unfortunate experience .
But they were free to fell the trees and make houses of wood for themselves , and to pluck the wild fruit and catch the fish of the streams for food , and to use the implements of defence they possessed in their struggle with the beasts ; and more than once have men filled desolate parts of the earth with human life , prosperity , peace , and happiness by merely putting forth unhindered effort .
How much worse was the position of the emancipated Negro than that of ship - wrecked men cast on uninhabited , fruitful islands !
The authorized Negro tragedy in the United States of America did indeed come to an end , but the unauthorized tragedy began with the declaration of emancipation ; and , had there been no righteousness therein , no hearts of flesh , no men whose souls had received the light of God and the compassion which is tender and eternal , the poor coloured man must have wished , had he known of such a thing , that he might be free as the ship - wrecked mariner to pluck and eat wild fruit in a lonely land , and make for himself a home out of wood which no man
Page 8
claimed .
Land there was around him in the States , stretching away in every direction , thousands of miles of it , but none of it his ; he must ask permission of the owners to live on it , which fact kept him in their power , and enabled the unworthy to continue the tragedy in an unauthorized form , which continues until now .
Will it forever continue ?
Let men who deny the Negro equal opportunity , who say equal civic rights are enough for him , who hinder and obstruct his development and progress in every imaginable manner , who cast him out of the sphere of white men and lynch him to death on the smallest Provocation , remember the saying : --" He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker . "
It may be that a few bold , bad men live , in whom neither faith nor love dwells , who dare even reproach God , who will do so until the grave swallow them up , and persecute not Negroes only , but whom they can of any colour ; but it can not be that the enlightened United States will forever tolerate this unauthorized tragedy of the Negro , this unlawful lynching which occurs in so many places .
Yet a little while , and , surely , the righteous people of the States will once more make an effort , an effort of peace , in the name of " Our Father who art in heaven , " to make it impossible in their country for child of His to suffer hardship because of colour , and bring to an end the reproach of caste which rests now on black and white equally .
Page 9
It is the purpose of this little book , which pretends only to be a report of inquiries made , to present in brief form the history of the Negro from the time of his importation into America as an article of commerce down to this day .
The writer aims not at sensation , but desires first to see for himself the facts in their true light , and , having seen , give to his readers an unexaggerated statement thereof .
No cause is assisted by falsehood ; no race of men can be permanently helped forward by fraud .
The scriptures are as full of warnings against misrepresentation , as against oppression , and all human history affords for all who are willing to see the clearest demonstrations of how falsehood developes destruction .
Not by falsehood , then , does this book seek to promote the Negro 's cause , but by a simple and brief story of his life in America .
It may be that white men and black men will never be as one people , perhaps cannot be ; but none who have accepted the teachings of the Christ can refuse to accord equal opportunity to the sons of Africa .

CHAPTER II .
AFRICA : AND HOW THE NEGRO WAS BROUGHT THENCE , AND WHY .
MRS .
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE'S HOUSE ,
IN WHICH SHE WROTE " UNCLE TOM'S CABIN . "
Africa , an immense peninsula of the Old World , the third in size of the great divisions of the globe , is a land of ignorance and darkness , and the home of the Negro .
" Its greatest length is about 5,000 miles ; its greatest breadth is about 4,600 miles ; its superficial area comprises nearly 12,000,000 square miles ; its population is estimated at 200,000,000 . "
Fifty years ago this vast peninsula was a land of mystery , of which we had the most meagre maps , and of whose people we knew next to nothing .
The Phoenicians , who lived in cities on the coast of Syria , one of which was ancient Tyre , were devoted to the pursuit of the sea , and established colonies on the north coast of Africa , and created extensive commerce .
It is said of them that they were the first people to circumnavigate Africa , and that Necho , who ascended the throne of Egypt in the year 617 , B.C. was the navigator .
The Carthaginians , who established a mighty empire , and
Page 14
absorbed all the Phoenician settlements of the West , followed in the steps of the Phoenicians , and sent their navy along the Atlantic Shores of Africa , which returned in the year 570 , B. C. , having settled several colonies on the coast .
Herodotus , who was born in the year 484 , B.C. , was the first Greek who travelled in quest of distant lands and the founder of Grecian geography .
He explored Egypt as far as the Cataracts of the Nile , and made excursions into Lybia and Arabia , and subsequently wrote accurate descriptions of the countries he visited .
After Herodotus , little seems to have been written of Africa until Ptolemy , -- who was born in Egypt and lived in the second century of the Christian Era , -- wrote his " Universal Geography , illustrated with maps , which was not superseded as the text book of science till the fifteenth century . "
After Ptolemy , nobody wrote much of Africa , and little is known of that strange land , other than that provided by the Phoenicians , Carthaginians , Herodotus , and Ptolemy , until modern maritime discovery began in the fifteenth century , after which information was afforded that astonished the world .
Since then adventurers , explorers , and missionaries have been busy in the great work of discovering the world , and of bringing to those in darkness the light of the truth of God .
Adventurers went forth in ships , which were paid for in their own money ,
Page 15
to gain wealth ; explorers , to make discovery in the name of king and country for the benefit of both ; missionaries , to declare the knowledge and love of the Most High .
Adventurers left behind them the bitterness of cruelty and the devastation of greed ; explorers made it easier for mankind to understand the greatness of the earth ; missionaries advanced , and yet advance , the eternal good of the human race by displaying before untaught men the gentleness and sympathy of the Christ .
The age of the adventurer in its ancient form is ended , passed and gone forever , and can never return in its old , bad sense of theft and murder ; but the humane explorer and the Christian missionary possess both present and future , in which they may together pursue their beneficent work .
The Portuguese , who explored the West coast of Africa in the fifteenth century , and the Spaniards , who gained possession of South America , were the first Christian powers that paid attention to Africa , and did indeed erect the figure of the Cross there , and upon every new land they discovered ; but by their foul and brutal practices caused the holy symbol to remind the native tribes of rapine and murder .
They respected no right of property in the land , in the produce of the country , not even in the flesh and blood of the natives ; but treated all and sundry with indignity and plunder .
They have
Page 16
long since received the recoiling punishment of wrong doing , and are to - day among the weakest and poorest nations of the world .
Africa , whose peoples , it must be said , have inflicted fearful cruelties upon one another , has not escaped the ravages of the adventurer ; but when her true history shall be written , the names of Mungo Park , Dr. Barth , Dr. Livingstone , Dr. Moffat , Mr. Stanley , and a host of others will stand out in letters of gold for all time , and the African of the future , who will certainly be educated and one day stand erect among men , claiming and receiving perfect equality , will in them recognize under the providence of God , the saviours of his race .
Then , in his native land of luxuriant vegetation , fruitful fields , noble rivers , vast forests , and immense deposits of mineral wealth , and wherever else he may chance to live or be , white men will respect him , and none will dare speak of slavery , shackles or death .
Man is one the whole world over , and consists of a single species .
He is distinguished from the animals beneath him by conscience , reason , and speech , and is so marvellously endowed that he can adapt himself to every known climate .
His intelligence has taught him how to protect himself from the cold of the North , and to endure the heat of the South .
He may be found in every climate , from
Page 17
the hottest to the coldest .
In vast forests , in regions of fertility , in wastes of sterility , in valleys and in mountains he finds a home , and makes the earth provide him food and shelter .
But man is not the same in stature , intelligence , and colour in every place ; diversity obtains most prominently ; but colour is the most noticeable feature of difference .
His skin is black , yellow , olive , tawny , white , but he is man , qualified for the highest effort of mind and the holiest act of worship .
Whether black or white , educated or uneducated , he is the same creature in his feelings , and has ideas of a state after death , of a supreme power , of guilt , of pardon , which vary according to his state of enlightenment .
The saying that God " hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth " has been abundantly established as a truism all over the world , particularly by the rising of several savage tribes to the average level of educated nations .
The ancestry of mankind is one ancestry , and man everywhere is the child of a divine father , and is destined for all eternal life , and nations ought to cultivate sentiments of peace and good - will .
It is the duty of the learned to teach the unlearned ; the strong to help the weak ; and , they who have knowledge of God and are conscious of His sustaining grace and love are under the heaviest obligation to rescue from wretchedness , guilt , and
Page 18
impurity those who are ignorant and depraved , that the identity of man be perfect .
If this be true ; if men ought to respect and help each other , and recognize before God their common origin and the obligation resting upon each to promote the good of all ; -- of which in this day there can be no doubt -- the question , how the Negro was brought from Africa to America , and why , becomes very interesting , particularly so in view of the conditions of his past and present state therein .
In the answer we shall see how strangely events of life intertwine with each other .
In the year 1485 , just seven years before Columbus was permitted by Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain to sail westward in search of unknown lands , who discovered Watling Island , one of the Bahamas , and one of the great islands of Cuba and St. Domingo , Alfonso de Aviso discovered Benin , Africa , which then comprised Benin , Dahomey , and Yoruba , three Negro kingdoms , and subsequently Fernando Po of Portugal established a Portuguese Colony and the Church of Rome at Gaton , Benin .
The Brothers of Jesus laboured in their usual manner to convert the natives to Christianity , to Christianity as they understood it ; but met with small success .
Knowing not the " perseverance of the gospel , " and not being qualified to labour in patience and love they adopted a quicker
Page 19
method of conversion than that of the Master .
They turned their attention to the king , who cared little for their new religion , but much for the satisfying of his personal desires .
This untaught son of the Dark Continent made a proposition , viz. , that he would turn Christian , and compel his subjects also to turn , if the Brothers of Jesus would find him a white wife .
He asked for a white wife to be provided as he would for any article of manufacture that was new to him , and probably was not conscious of any existing difference between a piece of cloth and a wife ; but the same cannot be said of the Brothers of Jesus .
However , knowing or not knowing that marriage is a sacred covenant , they agreed to the king 's proposal , and forthwith proceeded to keep their part of the agreement .
They went to the Sisters of St. Thomas , an order of women devoted to charity and holy work , and , wonderful to relate , one of the Sisters consented to accept the king as husband .
What prompted her to agree to this extraordinary compact ?
Human love was out of the question , because she had never seen him , and it is difficult to imagine that any lower desire moved her .
Let it be written down to the eternal credit of this nameless Sister of Mercy that she placed her all on the altar of sacrifice in the name of the Son of Man .
Nothing more is heard of her ; but her noble effort , -- noble from her point of view - -
Page 20
though probably successful for a time , failed of a permanent settlement of Christianity in the king 's country .
Why ?
The Portuguese established the slave trade in Gaton , which is answer enough .
Men cannot preach the Kingdom of God , establish colonies in peace , prosperity and social order , and at the same time buy and sell , or steal and sell , flesh and blood .
" Ye can not serve God and Mammon . "
It is impossible to educate and civilize the human race by any such self - destructive method ; piety and holiness can not be preached by men who traffic in human life .
The influence of this diabolical conduct of the Portuguese was almost instantaneous on the natives , who , taught by the evil example of the Europeans , themselves became man stealers and followers of the slave trade .
Then the poor , ignorant people , who had previously tilled the land and pursued the calling of fishermen , gave themselves to the work of hell , and carried all who were weaker than they to the coast , and for the merest trifles , for worthless trinkets , sold them into slavery .
This was the white man 's work in Benin .
Instead of inspiring honesty , truthfulness and gentleness , he stirred up a huge sea of treachery , duplicity and cruelty , and made himself rich for a time by the proceeds of miseries immeasurable which were heaped on the helpless , the aged , and all who were unable to protect
Page 21
themselves .
He can find no excuse for his base conduct in the cruelty of the King of Dahomey , the adjoining kingdom , whose court was paved with human skulls , and whose palace , -- the place he called his palace - - walls were decorated in like manner .
There it stands , and will abide , a deep black mark of infamy against the white man , who went to Africa to establish colonies and preach heaven , yet managed to create pandemonium on earth .
This fiendish work was begun by white men on the coast of Africa between the years 1485 and 1490 , and in 1492 Columbus set forth to find lands in the West .
Following Columbus , but unlike Columbus , were thousands of Spaniards , and legendary stories of the measureless wealth of the West were soon told far and wide .
Spain was then preeminent among the nations of the world , and pointed with pride to continents discovered by her mariners .
But Spain was unfitted to be the missionary of heaven ; she was drunk with the lust of gold , knew not liberty , gloried in her cruel inquisition , and has long since found her reward .
Other nations entered into the work of discovery , and wrested from her the supremacy .
On the fifth of March , 1496 , John Cabot was commissioned by Henry VII . of England " to sail into eastern , western , or northern seas with a fleet of five ships , to search for islands , provinces and regions hitherto unseen by Christian people ,
Page 22
and to set up the banners of England on city , island , country or continent , and , as vassal of the English Crown , to possess and occupy the territories which might be found . "
On the twenty - fourth of June , 1497 , fourteen months after Columbus on his third voyage came in sight of the main land , John Cabot discovered the Western Continent , and , " having sailed three hundred leagues along the coast , planted on the land the flag of England . "
Then followed in due time Sir Walter Raleigh , Sir Richard Grenville , Cavendish , the great navigator , and ultimately the Pilgrim Fathers , and English colonies were established in Virginia and in Massachusetts .
In 1664 the English defeated the Dutch at New York , and became the masters of North America .
In that wonderful fifteenth Century , then , we find the Portuguese in Africa , the Spaniard in South America , the Dutch in New York , the English in Virginia , and subsequently in Massachusetts .
White winged ships crossed and re-crossed every sea , carrying cargoes of commerce to favourable ports .
Why not carry cargoes of Negroes ?
Were there not enough and to spare of them in Africa ?
Had not the Portuguese stolen and sold them in 1485 ?
It was a profitable idea ; not to be forgotten .
They were black men , therefore inferior , fit only to obey the white man , who needed them to
Page 23
do the work of the New World .
The Dutch of New York would buy some Negroes , or steal them ; would sell them and make money ; and , in 1619 , a Dutch Man of War brought the first slaves , fourteen in number , to Virginia .
There the captain of the ship gave them in exchange for provisions to Captain Miles Kendall , deputy - governor of the colony .
Why not ?
In those days few men so much as thought of the great sin which was being committed , and were utterly incapable of foreseeing the fearful heritage of sorrow that would accrue to succeeding generations .
This is how the Negro was brought from Africa .
First by the Dutch , in a Man of War , and the why may be seen in the money value of so much free labour , which was made to produce harvests at the low cost af feeding .
To look back on those fearless Englishmen , who fought like heroes in defence of their own homes and country , and laboured continuously that wife and child might be fed and clothed , and supplied with every comfort the earth could produce , and see them doing the devil 's work so shamelessly , is to look upon a scene which causes infinite regret , which more than suggests the thought that England 's priests had grossly neglected to guide rightly her valiant men .
The Dutch , too , were brave and religious , thrifty and careful of each other , yet could barter in flesh and blood , which proves how
Page 24
strangely and awfully both good and evil are mixed in man .
Love of money , a real , frightful source of wrong in all times , blinded the eyes of these brave men , and prevented them seeing rightly ; and , having no prophet to warn and guide them , they fell into the blackest sin .
For money and ease of life they gave play to the worst passions of human nature , and dared heaven , perhaps unconsciously , to curse them , which curse came then and there , though they knew it not , and burst in tornadoes of of fire , shot and death on succeeding generations .
We see , then , how and why the Negro was brought from Africa to America , and it is known that this mad trafficing in blood , which stained the banners of England and America , finally cost both countries millions of treasure and thousands of lives to erase the blot .
It is a tragedy indeed , this of the Negro in America , which we are watching , on which also a silent , offended God looks ; but a tragedy whose end is not death to all concerned ; a tragedy whose clearest fact is fire , the fire of cleansing and deliverance .
It is strange that men will so depart from virtue and plunge so deeply into sin , when they know that catastrophe must follow .
Meanwhile , we leave white and black men face to face , one the owner and oppressor , the other the owned and oppressed , and will see in following chapters how the mighty battle was fought and won between right and wrong .

CHAPTER III .
AMERICA : AND WHAT BEFELL THE NEGRO THEREIN FROM A. D. 1619 TO A. D. 1712 .
MRS .
HARRIET TUBMAN ,
SHE ACTED AS A SPY FOR THE UNION ARMY .
The geography and history of the United States need not more than a passing glance ; the Negro and what has befallen him therein being the subject of this little book .
It is enough to say that the territory of the States stretches for thousands of miles in every direction , that the population exceeds the huge figure of 70,000,000 , and that for great rivers , coal fields , gold mines , silver mines and agriculture it is not surpassed by any other part of the globe .
The growth of its population is one of the world 's wonders ; a kind of miracle wrought by steam boat and railroad train .
In the year 1800 it amounted to about 6,000,000 , that is , it was not more than the population of London to - day ; had increased to 39,000,000 at the census of 1870 , and , -- an extraordinary fact -- as stated above , to 70,000,000 at this present time .
The natural leaders of this great population , which is composed of men from almost every nation under the sun , have resting
Page 28
upon them a responsibility that will not be easily borne , a responsibility which calls for the highest qualities of mind , extensive knowledge of human nature , and faith in the providence of God .
Compared with the older nations of Europe and Asia , the States are yet in their infancy ; but have in the short period of one hundred years become infinitely more important than most of them in respect of everything pertaining to the good of the human family .
Here are Greeks , Russians , Armenians , Germans , French , Chinese , Japanese , English , Irish , Scotch and Americans , men born under every form of government and trained in conflicting ideas of religion and morals , bound together in a free republican government , each having the right to vote in City , State and National affairs .
It has been an experiment , perhaps is so yet , in human government on a vast scale ; but appearances justify the remark that it has successfully stood the test of trial , and that to - day , thanks to Washington , Adams , Webster , Lincoln , and many other noble men , who devoted extraordinary powers of mind to the service of the New Nation , is better established than many of the dynasties of the Old World .
But the States were not a nation of 70,000,000 of inhabitants when white and black man first stood face to face on American soil ; they were colonies of England , and were governed by that extraordinary
Page 29
power , which has so marvellously colonized so many portions of the globe .
But the England of the year 1619 , when those fourteen slaves were landed on the shore of Virginia , and given in exchange for provisions to Captain Miles Kendall , deputy - governor of that state , and the England of to - day are scarcely comparable .
Then , it is true , Englishmen were free men , and could pursue the calling of their choice in perfect safety ; but the toiling millions were practically outside of the constitution , and had no voice whatever in the government of the country .
Then England was governed by the aristocracy and the free - holders , who formed a very small part of the population , and the colonies were in the hands of chartered trading companies .
Corruption was in every office ; the House of Commons was in the power of the House of Lords ; seats in the Commons were bought and sold openly , and places of power were given without regard to merit ; reformers , men who sought the privilege of the vote , were persecuted and even put to death by the sword ; and , not until the year 1832 was the constitution widened so as to admit persons of substantial position , which good work was completed in 1867 with Household Suffrage .
To - day it is a different and better England .
Every working man who has a home or a lodging can vote in every election that is held , whether for City Counsellors , Members of
Page 30
School Board , Members of the House of Commons , or any representative position , and can even be elected himself .
Corruption is dead ; the power of the House of Lords is small , and cannot be exercised at all in respect of money bills ; seats in the Commons are no longer , cannot be , bought and sold ; places of power are bestowed according to merit and length of service ; reformers are free to advocate reform in open meeting or in any manner not harmful to the persons and property of the inhabitants , without fear of interference .
To -day , as some one has well put it :--" England is a republic with a hereditary president " and protects her citizens the wide world over , and suffers no slave to live beneath her banner .
Let England and America , then , as we know them to - day , be in no sense blamed for the fixing of a slave - system in the States .
Both countries have paid in money and in blood the price of the sin of dead generations , and are the greatest hope of mankind .
In a holy rivalry they hold up the torch of civilizing light , spread on every hand the beneficence of business , display before all nations the safety and solidity of national life based in the free vote of their peoples , and send forth missionaries at immense cost to all who are in the darkness of ignorance .
Personal wrong there surely is in both countries , which is inflicted by individuals upon
Page 31
others who can not help themselves ; but the wisdom of their peoples and rulers will yet find a remedy for these evils , and perfection will be attained as nearly as is possible in human institutions .
In that good time which is certainly before both countries , the unworthy effort of many wicked persons to place the Negro outside the human family will be finally defeated , and race prejudice in the States will be dead .
Returning to the evil year 1619 , we find that Captain Butler succeeded Captain Miles Kendall in the governorship of Virginia , and that a disgraceful dispute arose respecting the ownership of the fourteen slaves .
He claimed the negroes in the name of the Earl of Warwick which claim Captain Miles Kendall resisted , and sought what he called equity by placing his case before the London company .
From the beginning of the traffic , human strife and cruelty were alarmingly aggravated , and men of all stations in life were filled with the meanest wickedness , rich and poor alike , from the Earl of Warwick to the poorest black man who was strong enough to kid-nap a weaker black man and sell him into slavery on the coast .
This dispute was not quickly settled .
However , in July , 1622 , the London Court disposed of the case , giving nine slaves to Captain Kendall and the remainder to the company .
But what is the terrible fact of this fixing of the slave
Page 32
system in the States ?
This :
That the English colony of Virginia purchased the first Negroes who were brought to the States , and inaugurated the hideous traffic in human flesh and blood .
For this most shameful act of inhumanity , out of which crime too black and foul to be described grew , the reader must not blame either England or America ; it was the act of men who had left the Old Country to seek wealth and get it in any manner , righteous or unrighteous , who scrupled not to class a man with a coloured skin with the beasts of the field .
Their reward is shame , which clings to them until now , and reflects disastrously upon the otherwise fair fame of the wisest and best of them .
The institution of slavery , once established , took root , but did not grow rapidly .
Taking the census of the colony of Virginia of February 16 , 1624 , the fourteen slaves of 1619 had only grown to twenty - two .
Perhaps they were a little afraid of the system ; may be conscience troubled many of the colonists ; or , what is quite as likely , importers of flesh and blood were probably not over well supplied by Negro stealers .
But twenty - four years subsequently , in 1648 , the population of Virginia was about 15,000 , of whom 300 were slaves .
Evidently the whites had somewhat lost fear of the system in those twenty - four years , if they ever felt it , and it is equally certain that conscience had been educated .
Page 33
The colonists of 1648 were not a reputable lot ; indeed there were more men of bad character among them than the original settlers and their descendants liked .
Thieves , vagrants , burglars and disorderly persons of every evil character , who had been sent to Virginia by the English Government for their crimes at home , formed no inconsiderable part of the population ; yet were more graciously received than the poor Negro .
It is difficult , if not impossible , in this day of enlightenment to imagine how a God - fearing man , -- many of the colonists were such -- could bring himself to treat a condemned criminal with greater kindness than he was willing to extend to a Negro ; yet such is one of the ugly facts of that time .
Sin is subtle , and overthrows the best of men , if they cease to fight it , and destroys their manhood , covers them with disgrace , and causes them to make the most ignoble laws .
It so happened in Virginia .
On September 17 , 1630 , an act of prohibition was passed by the colonists to the following effect : " That the banished criminals of England must not have relations with Negroes . "
Think of it .
The vilest of the vile , men too bad to be allowed a place in English life , banished for offences proven against them in courts of law , must not defile themselves with the Negro !
Language , it is said , undergoes perpetual enlargement of meaning and purification , and it must be true that defilement
Page 34
could not have meant in Virginia at the time now under consideration what it means to - day .
How could a criminal , a creature of the blackest indecencies , defile himself by having relations with an ignorant , untaught , probably trustful Negro ?
The defilement would be more on the side of the Negro , though he knew it not .
Yet the prohibition was made , and the punishment for every such offence was public flogging and confession of the offence in church on the following sabbath .
Bad men may make bad laws , and other bad men will break them , even as good laws are broken , and have been broken in every age .
The colonists had to bring out the whip and hear confession in church ; villany could not forego the easy prey within its reach .
Hugh Davis , a white servant , whose name is written in history forever , -- whether an English criminal or an ordinary colonist we know not -- was indeed publicly flogged before a company of blacks and whites for defiling himself with a Negro .
He was not the last victim of this vicious law ; but if it were possible or right to sympathize with a worker of iniquity , Hugh Davis would have our sympathy .
We can pity him , and regret that he could defile himself with any child of God ; but for the Negro , whose education along lines of debasement , cunning and treachery had been continued by white men , only sympathy ought
Page 35
to be felt .
He was a natural child of the forest , acquainted with the rudest life only , knowing nothing of civilization and little of the white man , whose whole subsequent history in America would have been different and better had he been put to work in a humane manner and treated as a man who needed training in skilled labour and educating in letters .
It was not .
Therefore , he became the cause , by no fault of his own , of the most fearful struggle of modern times , which held in suspense for four years the very life of a mighty nation , whose salvation was accomplished by the slaughter of 1,000,000 men .
From 1619 until 1662 slavery existed without any direct sanction in law , and had no foundation in the order of state Virginia , the mother state of slavery , and none in any other state .
It was a case of one man owning another because he had bought him .
But was he not property ?
He had cost money .
Slave owners felt the need of a law , which would fix beyond dispute the right of ownership , as real estate was fixed , and on the fourteenth of December , 1662 , the foundations of slavery were laid by a proclamation --" that the issue of slave mothers should follow their condition . "
No help now for the Negro , neither for any innocent child born of a coloured mother ; for two hundred years he must toil , bleed , die in the service of the white man , and
Page 36
not dare to murmur .
For two hundred years he must obey his master and ask no questions , though he hear questions of right and wrong discussed .
Patience must be the order of his tribe ; ignorance , and suffering will abide with him .
While this inhuman business was being done , it is certain that Christian mothers in Virginia taught their children that stealing , swearing , speaking falsely , coveting another 's property and committing adultery were all sins against God and man ; and , it is equally certain that so - called Christian fathers did steal the Negro 's labour , did most cruelly abuse him , did commit adultery with their own slaves with the horrid intent of increasing their live stock , and forsook , turned their backs upon every feeling of humanity .
God has made it easy for man in all the departments of morality to decide the right and the wrong , in view of which eternal fact no excuse can be found for slave owners .
They decided , those original slave owners of Virginia , " that the issue of slave mothers should follow their condition , " and thereby accomplished two things ; viz , hereditary slavery , and statutary sanction thereof .
Thus far this battle between right and wrong went against right in the person and life of the Negro , and the quotations given below will show how tightly the manacles were fastened to his feet and hands .
In 1670 , Virginia , thoroughly accustomed to the
Page 37
infamous institution , and having realized the profit of so much unpaid labour , declared by Act of Assembly that " all servants not Christians , coming into the colony by shipping , should be slaves for their lives . "
On the twenty - fourth of October , 1684 , the province of New York made the slave trade legitimate within its borders , recognizing that the white man had a right to buy and sell the coloured man .
On the fourth of October , 1705 , an act was passed without a single dissenting voice , declaring the Negro , Mulatto and Indian , slaves within their dominion .
In 1706 an act was passed to " encourage the baptism of Negroes , " which was done , it is said , " to quiet the public mind on the question . "
On the thirty - first of October , 1751 , King George II .
issued a proclamation repealing the act which declared slaves real estate .
Thus the business went , all against the Negro , who had become a thing .
King George II .
declared he must not be " real estate , " but left him to be classed with cattle , or crops , or any other miserable article , and the traffic increased .
In 1648 there were 300 slaves in the colony of Virginia ; in 1671 -- 2,000 ; in 1715 -- 23,000 ; and in 1758 more than 100,000 , which was only a little less than the white population .
Think of it .
In one hundred and
Page 38
thirty - nine years fourteen slaves had increased to over 100,000 ; an awful fact , which caused even Virginia to realize that the institution was a most serious and alarming one .
True , it was a well organized system , and recognized in the most solemn manner by the law ; was defended by the Church of Christ , the Church of Him who declared and revealed the brotherhood of man , and Christian ministers received slaves as salary ; yet was the ghost that haunted the vision of many good men , and a problem which was ultimately solved by a volcanic upheaval that scattered death on every hand .
It was futile to baptize the Negro that his soul might be saved ; that same Negro lived and multiplied to baptize a nation in blood .
He had no rights ; could not appear as witness in any court of law ; could be condemned on the evidence of one witness without a jury ; could own nothing ; if he secretly saved anything it was taken from him ; had no family relations such as white men enjoyed ; lived together by common consent ; dared not strike a Christian or Jew , no matter what the provocation ; had no schools ; was at last buried in a common ditch .
Pity 'tis there was no prophet in those days to foresee coming events , and to warn men of judgment to come .
Such an one might have saved past and present generations from deep disgrace and exhausting strife .
Page 39
This is what befell the Negro in the States of America between the years 1619 and 1712 .
God , it is said , never makes haste , but that His will is certain of execution .
We do know that He desires none to be ignorant , and that He seeks to save every child of man with a complete salvation .
With Him was the issue , and is , and as we shall examine and describe the condition of the Negro from 1712 to 1865 , the year of emancipation , -- his life on the plantations , his struggles for freedom , his simple , hearty acceptance of the gospel , his glad awakening on the day of redemption , and his most wonderful subsequent progress , we shall hope to see that the hand of God is set against the wrong doing of men , and behold the promise , set as in rainbow - light and beauty , " that the kingdoms of this world " shall " become the kingdoms of God and His Christ .

CHAPTER IV .
HOW THE NEGRO WAS TREATED DOWN TO 1844 .
HON .
FREDERICK DOUGLASS .
THE NEGRO STATESMAN AND ORATOR .
The closing years of the nineteenth century will be looked back upon by future generations with considerable interest , and the whole century will be esteemed the most important in results of beneficence to human life since the time of Jesus Christ .
Man has always been king of all creatures living on earth ; but time never was when he stood for so much as now .
Fortune , caste , privilege and birth , the historic barrier builders , are by no means passed and done with , yet do not obstruct individual progress so seriously as they used to ; there is now plenty of room for earnest capable men to exercise their personal powers .
Vast business companies and combinations notwithstanding , which certainly many times and in different ways destroy the best efforts of the individual , a man of energy , endowed with faith in the Almighty , may make much of his life .
Christian sympathy and the spirit of God are his assistants , by whose help he may overcome many difficulties .
Indeed , the fact is , whenever
Page 44
we see success of any kind we know that a man is behind it , though we see him not .
Ideas , principles , truth and right are indispensible , it is true ; but until a living man incarnates them , and puts them into active operation , not much is accomplished .
A man of noble personality , -- who loves truth , dispenses right , lives by principle , does right because it is right and refuses to do wrong because it is wrong , and disseminates ideas of holiness , -- inspires everybody and moves hundreds forward to the ground of hope and a happier existence .
Such an one , -- possessing a tender conscience , natural piety , a glowing heart full of sympathy and benevolence , and a high moral purpose in all he does -- carries heaven with him and strengthens the weakness of all among whom he moves .
Jesus Christ , Martin Luther , John Knox and John Wesley ; Tennyson , Longfellow and Whittier ; Thos .
Carlyle , Emerson and Chas .
Dickens were men who saw , and knew , and taught , and the whole civilized world looks back upon them with admiration and gratitude .
Jesus Christ was the incomparable one , who illumined human consciousness and commenced an era of never ending progress , whose name must always be mentioned with reverence .
When men listen to His teaching and emulate
His example it is well for the world , and progress is advanced in the best and surest manner .
If dead generations had walked in
Page 45
His footsteps , obeying His commands , and if living generations were eager above all things to keep
His law , slavery had never been amongst men in the last nineteen centuries , and war and standing armies would have no place in the life of nations to - day .
Looking back from this wonderful nineteenth century to the year 1712 , in which the Negro in the States of America found himself bound by manacles of slavery , in which , also , men and women , the men and women who owned him , feared God and reverenced Jesus Christ , it is difficult to realize that the holy name had much influence with them , and no one could for a moment believe that it had if evidence were not abundantly at hand in proof thereof .
" They feared God and worshipped their idols " was said by one of old of a well known people , which saying might with perfect justice be applied to many of the original slave owners .
It seems mysterious that the year , in which the Dutch man of war landed the first batch of slaves at Jamestown , Virginia , bore the " Mayflower " to the New World , whose passengers , were men and women that sought a new home and liberty to worship God according to their conscience .
The " Mayflower " carried a freight of piety , learning and Christian civilization which were to be written into the law of the New World ; the Dutch man of war carried a burden of wretchedness
Page 46
and sorrow , and a system destined to perish in the flames its own hand should kindle .
The Pilgrim Fathers were men whose fame has gone forth over all the world , and probably to the end of time they will be held up as ensamples of robust faith , fearless courage , and sincere piety ; yet it is certain that slavery was established in Massachusetts not long after their arrival .
Chief - justice Parsons declared from the bench that " slavery was introduced into Massachusetts soon after its first settlement and was tolerated until the ratification of the present constitution of 1780 . "
Let all ministers of the gospel observe this fact , and be it their duty never to weaken God 's demand for righteousness .
Need there is for real prophets , who seek not wealth , neither position , who will at any cost warn men of the sinfulness of sin .
Slavery cannot come back , but other evils are here , and will increase in power and in destructiveness , if the voice of the preacher be not true to the solemn duty of declaring the whole counsel of God .
The first mention of Negroes in Massachusetts we find in the year 1633 .
It appears that some Indians found a creature in the woods they thought was the devil , of whom they were so afraid that they dared neither approach nor touch him .
They hastened to the English settlers , and declared they had seen the evil spirit .
The English returned with the
Page 47
terrified red men to the woods and found a harmless black man , who was lost , had wandered from his master 's house ; but they sent him back to his master .
Why ?
Why did they not keep him , and instruct him in their religion , and in all useful social duties ?
He was a black man , and was owned by a white man , which is explanation enough .
It was no doubt honest to send him back ; but it would have been more in keeping with the religion they professed to have kept and treated him in a Christian manner .
This amusing incident of red men being afraid of a black man , and of white men returning him to his owner on a point of honesty , brings into clearest view the peculiar , soul - saddening fact , that religious people can be morally blind and do grossly immoral acts .
Who the owner was of this solitary Negro is not known , neither does history tell how he came into Massachusetts ; but it is clearly recorded that the first importation of slaves into the state was in 1637 , just four years after the above mentioned event , who were brought from Barbados , and for whom Indians were given in exchange .
At first , slavery in Massachusetts , as in the other colonies , was a family business , which was its most harmless form ; then it became an affair of the community ; and , finally , an ordinary business of men who wished to enjoy the fruits of forced labour .
Page 48
Like all the works of sin it developed into larger proportions , destroyed the humanity of men , and filled the colonies with unworthiness .
In 1720 , General Shute placed the number of slaves in Massachusetts , including a few Indians , at 2,000 .
In 1735 there were 2,600 , and within the next seventeen years the Negro population of Boston alone was 1,541 .
In 1754 a system of taxation was established by the Colonial government , which included black people in the schedule of taxable property , not a little to the confusion of Governor Shirley .
In his message of November 19 , 1754 , to the assembly , he said : " There is one part of the estate , viz. , the Negro slaves , which I am at a loss how to come at the knowledge of , without your assistance . "
But he was helped out of his difficulty .
In that year 4,489 Negroes were classed with hogs , and in 1764 the number had increased to 5,779 .
5,779 human beings , in Massachusetts , the home of the Pilgrim Fathers , were rated with hogs and horses , and Negro children were considered an incumbrance , and were given away like puppy dogs .
It is impossible to believe that all the Colonists countenanced this horrible business , indeed it is certain they did not ; but it is clear that the life of the colony was morally poisoned , which was the unhappy condition of all the English colonies in the year 1754 , Georgia excepted .
The natural
Page 49
rights of thousands were subverted .
They were " deemed , held , taken , reputed and adjudged in law to be chattels personal to all interests , constructions and purposes whatsoever , " as the law put it ; which was contrary to reason and the admonitions of conscience , and gratified the spirit of vulgar pride and class distinction , and the lust of dominion .
Violence was the spirit of slavery , and depraved greed its inspiration .
From the first slave - hunt in unhappy Africa to the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox , its blood - stained hand was laid on the bodies and souls of the slaves , and on the moral sensibilities of the people .
It had no mercy ; knew no decency ; forced the slave to make the earth produce harvests ; whipped him ; sold him ; killed him ; defied God and the inexorable law of righteousness .
But Jehovah 's judgment came at last in the awful War of Emancipation , and men trembled ; and , let this never be forgotten , all who thus disobey must , either here or yonder , in time or eternity , stand in the same sure retribution .
It was the old sin , of which many are guilty to - day , of " doing wrong that good may come . "
There is nothing before men who forget righteousness but confusion and disaster .
It is with astonishment we read the state papers and official documents bearing on the slave trade ; they cause us to imagine that we hear the clanking
Page 50
chains which bound living men to a living death ; but when to - day we see 8,000,000 of Negroes living and toiling as free men a great hope is felt , which is related to the whole Negro race in Africa and America .
May not these 8,000,000 , when they shall have won equality as well as liberty , provide our missionary societies the best ministers for the African field ?
Is it impossible for them to become a power under the providence of God which shall lift the entire race of coloured people to conditions of moral and spiritual life ?
They have suffered , and yet suffer .
They have been in the blackest darkness of despair ; but now see a light of hope , in which thousands of them rejoice perfectly .
They have been , as their brethren in Africa are to - day , untaught , savage and immoral ; but are now gaining knowledge , and becoming followers of Christ .
All their suffering and degradation , heroic struggles and present pursuit of things worthy and sacred cannot end merely in their own elevation , but must surely have some relation to the uplifting of the race .
It has puzzled and perplexed thoughtful men to explain the connection between suffering and progress , and probably no satisfactory solution of the problem has yet been found ; but it is known that the cleansing fire of affliction and the noblest character have a close relation with each other .
Page 51
There is something in prolonged prosperity which demoralizes most men , and something in fierce adversity that draws the grandest soul - elements to the surface .
The man who never had a personal Gethsemane knows not the supremest glory of the mount of Transfiguration ; the greatest men and women have braved the storm .
Is it not possible , then , that what men call the worst thing may turn out the best ?
The undisciplined soul cannot be compared with the soul that has by bitter experience learned the deepest truth of the Christ .
The Negro , therefore , may yet , by the over - ruling providence of God , become one of the world 's most noble benefactors .
While we follow to a close the history of his life in America , this hope of future extensive good shall be cherished , and faith reposed in God .
Resuming the story of his life in the United States of America , a quotation from the pen of the immortal Rev. George Whitefield , the renowned evangelist , who travelled extensively through the Southern States , will help the reader to understand the awful sufferings that were inflicted upon him .
" In 1739 , Mr. Whitefield said , in a letter he addressed to the inhabitants of the Southern States , that his sympathies had been strongly excited by what he had seen of the ' miseries of the poor Negroes . '
He called attention to the practice of slave - masters , and the encouragement it afforded to the savage
Page 52
tribes in Africa to continue their warfare on each other , to supply the demand for slaves thus created .
He charged ' the generality ' of them with using their slaves 'as bad as though they were brutes nay , worse , '-- worse than their horses which were ' fed and properly cared for ' after the labours of the day , while the slaves must grind their corn and prepare their own food , -- worse than their dogs , who are ' caressed and fondled ' while the slaves ' are scarce permitted to pick up the crumbs which fall from their master 's table . '
He spoke of the cruel lashings which ' ploughed their backs and made long furrows , ' sometimes ending in death .
He reminded them of their spacious houses and sumptuous fare ; while they to whose ' indefatigable labours ' their luxuries were ' owing had neither convenient food to eat nor proper raiment to put on . ' "
Mr. Whitefield did not exaggerate ; but placed on record a faithful description of what he had seen , which record can not be destroyed .
His letter briefly set forth what was happening in all the English colonies , Georgia excepted .
In New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , and South Carolina , in one degree or another of fiendishness , more severely in some states than others , these cruelties were inflicted on 58,850 human
Page 53
beings , each one a sensitive creature , capable of feeling pain , and endowed with faculties of soul , whose deep moan and uttered cry for deliverance went up constantly to heaven .
It is impossible to set forth in words the horrors of the trade in New York .
The Dutch , under whose government it was known as New Netherlands , looked on slavery as a necessary evil , but did not treat slaves with cruelty .
They added them to their families , taught them letters as best they could , and called them in to family prayers ; but bought and sold them in the ordinary manner .
When the Dutch were defeated by the English the lot of the Negro changed for the worse ; a system of neglect , punishment and torture was introduced .
In 1702 the assembly passed a law which was called " An Act for Regulating Slaves , " and the following quotations show the quality of that regulation .
It was declared " not lawful to trade with Negro slaves ; " " not more than three slaves may meet together ; " " a slave must not strike a freeman ; " " all the children of freed black mothers already born , or yet to be born , must be slaves ; " " that a common whipper be appointed . "
No lion in his cage , no eagle fastened by chain to post , fed and cared for by keeper , was ever so miserable as the poor Negro in the bad past .
He might walk about and work ; but no Christian or Jew would risk fine and
Page 54
imprisonment by trading with him .
He was allowed to talk with two other Negroes ; but if more than three met together they were all whipped by a J. P. or the common whipper , or sent to jail .
A freeman was at liberty to beat him anywhere and anyhow ; but let him so much as raise his hand in self - defence , and legal punishment followed .
A freed black woman -- some of the better sort gave manumission papers to their slaves -- could become a mother ; but her child was taken from her as soon as he could work and was pushed into slavery , often sold to a dealer in another state .
All this being true , how great ought one 's sympathy to be for coloured men and women who are the children of parents that were so ill - treated !
That they can believe in a God of righteousness , that they do not hate and abhor the white man , is the miracle of our time , and a solid proof of the divine that is in them .
From the eleventh of May to the twenty - ninth of August , 1741 , -- only three short months -- one hundred and fifty slaves were cast into prison in New York ; eighteen of whom were hanged , fourteen burnt to death , seventy - one transported to other colonies , -- sold for cash -- and the remainder , forty - seven of them , pardoned .
For what ?
Absolutely nothing .
One , Mary Barton by name , gave out a report that the slaves had made a plot to burn the town and murder the inhabitants , which was absurd
Page 55
on the face of it .
Yet Justices lost their heads , and the inhabitants , each one armed , -- slaves were unarmed -- became terror stricken , and hanging and burning were done without mercy .
" The wicked fleeth , when no man pursueth . "
God is the maker and judge of all men .
He made us innocent , and never placed burden on mortal man beyond his strength , nor imposed a duty that could not be discharged ; but men have created apparently inexplicable contradictions , crooked aspirations , and injustice and impurity , and now and again vainly endeavour to run away from their own badness .
Looking steadfastly into this Egyptian darkness of slavery in the States we see a little light of promise ; and , in God-fearing men , most of them Quakers , such as Leister King , Elizur Wright , John Sloane of Ravenna , David Hudson , from whom Hudson City received its name , and Owen Brown , father of the immortal John Brown , we discern His ambassadors , who feared not to proclaim their Master 's will .
They did not labour in vain .
As early as 1726 , the Colonists of Virginia , alarmed by the increase of slaves , tried to check further importation by imposing a tax ; but " the African company obtained the repeal of that law . "
In I760 , South Carolina endeavoured to restrict the traffic , " for which she received the rebuke of the British
Page 56
government . "
Earlier than the Colonists of Virginia , the people of Pennsylvania passed a law in 1712 to prevent the increase of slaves , which the Crown promptly annulled .
In 1771 , also in 1774 , Massachusetts adopted measures for the abolition of slavery ; but the Colonial Governors , who represented the government , refused to approve them , and so they were lost .
Rhode Island , more fortunate than the other colonies , passed a law in 1774 , prohibiting the importation of slaves , and in 1784 , declared all children free born after the next March , of which acts the government took no notice .
Light was breaking through the clouds ; this was the first step towards emancipation .
No more slaves to be imported , and all children of slaves then in the state , also all children to be born , to be free , meant the redemption of Rhode Island from the horrible crime , and had more influence in the other states than can now be measured .
The light and the promise grow more clear while we look , and circumstances of good omen accumulate .
With the annexation of Texas , a vast country adapted to the growth of cotton , which increased the demand for and the price of slaves , we see a bolder activity on the part of the Quakers , who , filled with the love of God and man , stepped forth before all men to render aid to the hunted fugitive .
The hunted fugitive ?
Yes ; for the slave had at
Page 57
last found manhood enough in himself to attempt escape , to fly from the auction block , the flesh and blood jobbers , the pain of the lash and the woe of children sent from his heart into other lands .
To Eastern Pennsylvania hundreds of them took flight , and were received and helped by good Samaritans .
This was the beginning of the end .
God had assisted the Negro to feel his manhood , and had provided good men to help him .
The slave power might , and did , continue to oppress him ; deny him the rights of citizenship ; prohibit meetings and schools ; forbid him to preach to his brother slaves ; punish white men who dared to instruct him ; bind manacles tighter to his feet ; but in vain .
He had learned that men lived in other places who were ready to serve him , and had discovered a personal courage to dare something for himself .
Previous to the annexation of Texas came the revolution , and separation from England , in which the Negro found that he could use arms , and was encouraged by both Colonists and Crown to do so , and of 501,102 slaves at that time in the States , some fought for the Crown and some for the Colonists .
They knew not for what they fought ; but it was a new experience , and was not forgotten .
His valour , however , did not win liberty for him .
After the new constitution had been ratified , and the States were established as a separate nation , he
Page 58
went back to his labour and sorrow ; for him no improvement had been won .
But something had been won personal to himself , which was increased courage and bolder daring .
He had seen white men fight for something they called liberty ; had ignorantly fought with them , and had seen many new things .
And slaves in every state had heard of Canada , a land far away ; but of distance they knew nothing and cared less .
With miraculous courage and wonderful faith thousands of them ventured forth ; were helped by a society known as the Underground Railroad ;-- composed of good men of all creeds -- were fed and directed ; were sheltered by day and conducted through the woods by night ; and , it is pleasing to read that they always proffered to pay in labour for what they had received .
The light grows clearer , and thousands of men are looking at the horrid cruelties of darkness , and much earnest discussion is heard throughout the land .
It is 1844 , just two hundred and twenty - five years since those unfortunate fourteen slaves were delivered to the Governor of Virginia , and the divine judgment of slavery and slave - holders is getting nearer .
In eighteen years the inhabitants of the States will know what slavery means , and how fearful a thing it is to forsake righteousness .
England , once a partner in the business , has meanwhile made
Page 59
a noble repentance , and has set free every slave that lived beneath her banner , and never more will stain her hands with the blood of such a crime .
More than that ; at her own cost and as best she can she prevents the crime being committed by others .
Her Sons of to - day must not be blamed for the sins of their fathers .
But in 1844 the darkness had not passed from the United States , though thousands of her noblest sons saw the light , and sorrowed o'er the sin ; the storm might not be avoided , but must break in death - giving force upon them .
The Negro must suffer and wear his manacles yet a while .
Then the world shall see and the States feel the awful judgment of God , and widows will weep , and sons lament , and fathers moan for those who are not .

CHAPTER V .
JOHN BROWN .
JOHN BROWN .
PURITAN HERO , CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHER , MARTYR
FOR THE SLAVES .
On the seventeenth of October , 1859 , John Brown , at the head of a small force of armed men , entered the town of Harper 's Ferry , Virginia , a little after ten o'clock in the evening , to free the slaves .
Five colored and fourteen white men constituted the entire force , with which he hoped not to destroy the huge slave party of the South , but to create a feeling , or so inflame a feeling already created , that would burn in Christian hearts until the power of that party should be destroyed .
He took possession of the armoury buildings , cut the telegraph wires , stopped trains on the railroad , liberated several slaves , and held the town not much longer than a day .
The slave party , at first , were astounded , if not for a moment paralized ; then they laughed , and said : " The folly of a madman . "
John Brown could not with his small force accomplish a task which ultimately cost millions of treasure and one million lives ; but he could , and did , reveal to the anti-slave party , as they had never seen it before ,
Page 64
the evil spirit of the slave party in its diabolical nature and purpose .
On the nineteenth of October , 1859 , only two days after his bold attack on the town , John Brown was cast into prison , where he remained until the seventh of November without a change of clothing , and , his wounds not withstanding , without medical aid ; and , forty - two days from the time of his imprisonment was hanged to death .
The raid , capture , trial , conviction and execution of this wonderful man and his followers profoundly stirred the nation , and attracted the attention of the civilized nations of the world .
His friends , who admired his simplicity of heart and life , felt very sorrowful ; thought he had made a grievous mistake and that military action would not advance legitimate reform ; the slave - owners were excited and furiously determined to stand by their property .
But his friends did not know that they had opposed to them the worst , most wicked , subtlest of sin-serving men this world has ever seen ; they could not then feel , for which they cannot be blamed , that only blood and death could rid the nation of the evil of slavery .
But it was brought home to them a few months after John Brown 's execution , when they saw for the first time that it was war or eternal disgrace , perhaps destruction .
Then all good men of every creed , with infinite regret , but with courage made mighty
Page 65
by burning indignation , drew the sword , not to sheath it until the curse was destroyed .
We are , always have been , for peace , and must oppose war ; but if ever war was justifiable , that of the emancipation is justified .
It was not desired by the North , the government did not seek it , there was no coveted territory to be won , not a private interest to be advanced ; it was a case of wresting from blood - stained hands that would not peaceably let go millions of human beings .
John Brown did not mean war ; but was mysteriously , no doubt providentially , influenced at the last moment to depart from his original plan .
To quote from a letter he wrote on the fifteenth of November , 1859 , to a minister of religion , it is clear that some influence moved him to act as he had not intended .
He says : " I am not as yet , in the main , at all disappointed .
I have been a good deal disappointed as it regards myself in not keeping up to my own plans ; but now I feel entirely reconciled to that even ; for God 's plan was infinitely better , no doubt , or I should have kept my own .
Had Samson kept to his determination of not telling Delilah wherein his great strength lay , he would probably have never overturned the house .
I did not tell Delilah ; but I was induced to act very contrary to my better judgment . "
God 's plan was better than my own is the substance of the letter ,
Page 66
and we doubt not that this rugged puritan , a lineal descendant in the direct line of Peter Brown of the " Mayflower , " saw visions and dreamed dreams in his cell , and clearly perceived that the end of slavery in the United States was near at hand , and that his own death would hasten its downfall .
He felt that he , as Samson by telling his secret was brought to the task of overturning the enemies ' house , by not keeping his own plans had secured the destruction of slavery in the States .
There can be no question now about his vision being correct .
A few months later , the Twelfth Massachusetts marched out of Boston singing the John Brown song , and sang it in camp , and regiment after regiment caught up the air of it , and on the march and in the midst of battle descendants of the Puritans and of the Pilgrim Fathers , and other noble - hearted men , made fields and pathways resound with musical words of " John Brown 's body lies a - mouldering in the grave , " and of " his soul still marching on . "
The fore - seeing eye is yet in the world , and God 's prophets have somewhat to do even in the nineteenth century .
He was a real Puritan , and , like the fathers from whom he descended , sternly religious .
Baxter and Bunyan were the men with whom he sat and talked , through their books , and the bible was his chief adviser and guide .
Selfishness had no place in his character , but generosity was the shining virtue of
Page 67
his life , and he was endowed with an exceedingly fine sense of justice .
Fear he knew not ; when told that the Missourians had marked him for death , he replied : " The Angel of the Lord will camp round about me . "
His destiny was linked with that of the slave ; he felt that he must live and die for him ; he was one of the instruments by which God worked out His will .
In prison , he wrote : " I never did intend murder , or treason , or the destruction of property , or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion , or to make insurrection .
The design on my part was to free the slaves . "
Virginia and all the Southern States , though the great slave - owners called him a madman , were thrown into confusion by this Puritan and his nineteen men , and the baser sort would gladly have lynched him .
They had for years taunted the anti-slavery party with cowardice , saying that they dared not preach emancipation in the South .
In their imagined safely established power they sneered at the party of humanity , were sneering on that historic seventeenth of October , when , to their infinite surprise , momentary dread , and long - continued suspicion of a vast conspiracy against them , a few brave men stood up in their midst sword in hand to bear testimony with their lives against the crime of slavery .
Never did lightning from heaven smite the human heart with terror more suddenly than
Page 68
did this John Brown into the souls of men who owned flesh and blood .
They must find out who had supported him , and see what power was behind him .
Therefore , Senator Mason hastened to Harper 's ferry , and , finding the old puritan lying on the floor of the armoury office , his face , hands and clothes stained with blood which flowed from his undressed wounds , proceeded to question him .
When was the organization formed ?
Who provided the money ?
Where did he get the arms ?
Said Brown : " I will answer freely and faithfully about what concerns myself - - I will answer anything I can with honour , but not about others . "
Asked : " How do you justify your acts ? " he answered : " I think , my friend , you are guilty of a great wrong against God and humanity -- I say it without wishing to be offensive -- and it would be perfectly right for anyone to interfere with you so far as to free those you willingly and wickedly hold in bondage .
. . .
I think I did right , and that others will do right who interfere with you at any time and all times .
I hold that the golden rule , ' Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you , ' applies to all who would help others to gain their liberty . " . . .
" I want you to understand , gentlemen , " he said , " that I respect the rights of the poorest and weakest of coloured people oppressed by the slave system just as much as I
Page 69
do those of the most wealthy and powerful .
That is the idea that has moved me , and that alone .
We expected no reward except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do for those in distress and greatly oppressed as we would be done by .
The cry of distress of the oppressed is my reason and the only thing that prompted me to come here .
. . .
I wish to say , furthermore , that you had better , all you people of the South , prepare yourselves for a settlement of this question , that must come up for settlement sooner than you are prepared for it .
. . .
You may dispose of me very easily .
I am nearly disposed of now ; but this question is st
Many rumors have been circulating regarding President Obama ’s stance on illegal drug use .
Some drug reform advocates hope the president will legalize marijuana ; some critics think he will continue the failed policies of the Bush administration in Latin America .
The President ’s actual stance on drug policy falls somewhere in between .
On Whitehouse.gov , Obama states :
With escalating violence along our Southwest border and far too many suffering from the disease of addiction here at home , never has it been more important to have a national drug control strategy guided by sound principles of public safety and public health .
We must demonstrate to our international partners , the criminal organizations threatening to undermine stability and the rule of law in those nations , and the American people , that we take seriously our responsibility to reduce drug use in the United States .
The Obama administration has dropped usage of the term “ War on Drugs ” in favor of “ harm reduction ” signaling a shift from prohibition to prevention .
The President wants to establish a policy that focuses on public health needs and plans to federally fund needle exchanges ; however , the ’09 - ’10 federal budget continues the longstanding ban on needle exchange programs .
The selection of Seattle police Chief Gil Kerlikowske as drug czar could signal a shift in drug policy , but the jury is still out on .
Kerlikowske ’s state of Washington has needle exchange programs , medical marijuana rights , and made marijuana a low priority for law enforcement .
Ethan Nadelmann , the executive director of the Drugs Policy Alliance , explains :
These statements really indicate a significant shift .
It ’s not just a repudiation of the Bush administration , it ’s a repudiation of the Clinton administration .
This signals a new direction in US drug policy .
This is about all the leading scientists and all the public health people pushing in the same direction and Obama saying he ’s putting science above politics .
But is this really true ?
What about the US financial support of Mexico ’s war on organized crime and drug - trafficking ?
In the Fiscal Year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Request , Obama requests funding for “ counterdrug / anti- crime assistance for Mexico ” , although the $ 0.5 billion is to be shared other economic development projects in Kenya , Zimbabwe , and Burma ; nuclear dismantling in North Korea ; and security assistance for Lebanon .
According to the Committee on Appropriations , this amount has been increased to “ $ 470 million to address growing violence along the United States - Mexico border by supporting the
Government of Mexico ’s war against organized crime and drug - trafficking . ”
Combined with the Merida Initiative , the supplemental could double US funding for the Mexican war on drugs , although it is unclear how the two fundings will be combined .
Kristin Bricker of Narcosphere writes :
This new money , along with February ’s $ 410 million for the Merida Initiative ( $ 300 million of which is destined for Mexico ) , is being pledged despite the fact that Mexico has failed to meet the human rights conditions laid out in the Merida Initiative .
Less than 15 % of overall Merida Initiative funds are subject to human rights conditions .
While the US government is withholding the required 15 % , it seems to be more than making up for this loss by appropriating new money to Mexico ’s war on drugs .
If the Appropriations Committee ’s new supplemental really does appropriate $ 400 million more to Mexico than Obama requested , and if it is all destined for the Mexican government , then this supplemental would bring fiscal year 2009 funding for Mexico ’s war on drugs to $ 770 million –that is , nearly double last year ’s funding and over 50 % more than former President George W. Bush had originally requested when he proposed the Merida Initiative .
US Drug War funding policies are accused of increasing the level of violence in Mexico , and 60 to 70 percent of drug trafficking and cartel activities involve marijuana .
Radley Balko , senior editor of Reason thinks that “ lifting prohibitions on it in the United States would eradicate a major source of funds for the cartels . ”
Balko accuses Obama of changing “ “ from a thoughtful drug - war critic to a typical Beltway drug warrior . ”
He notes Obama has never been in favor of legalization .
The Drug War began in the Nixon administration and is responsible for half of the 200,000 Federal prison inmates .
From the sale of Afghan child brides to the murder of more than 10,000 Mexicans , the Drug War has had far reaching consequences around the globe .
It has also put a strain on our economy .
Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron explains :
Prohibition is a drain on the public purse .
Federal , state and local governments spend roughly $ 44 billion per year to enforce drug prohibition .
These same governments forego roughly $ 33 billion per year in tax revenue they could collect from legalized drugs , assuming these were taxed at rates similar to those on alcohol and tobacco .
Under prohibition , these revenues accrue to traffickers as increased profits .
In addition , taxpayers spend $ 68 billion annually on prisons .
Obama has proposed reforming crack and cocaine laws to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences .
Other political leaders think legalization of marijuana should be explored .
Arianna Huffington writes :
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for “ an open debate ” and careful study of proposals to legalize , regulate , and tax marijuana .
Former Mexican President Vicente
Fox has also urged renewing the debate , saying that he is n’t convinced taxing and regulating drugs is the answer but “ why not discuss it ? ” Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard , pointing to evidence that Mexican drug cartels draw 60 to 80 percent of their revenue from pot , suggested legalization might be an effective tool to combat Mexican drug traffickers and American gangs .
The Obama administration does represent some change in drug policies .
Kerlikowske has called the nation ’s drug problem one of “ human suffering ” , and Obama campaigned on allowing non-violent drug offenders “ a chance to serve their sentence , where appropriate , in the type of drug rehabilitation programs that have proven to work better than a prison term in changing bad behavior . ”
The administration has stated that legalization of marijuana is off the table .
When asked if legalization was realistic , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano responded , “ No , it is not . ”

* US courts says Plan B must be available to 17 - year - olds
* Rules FDA must reconsider its Plan B decisions
NEW YORK , March 23 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. court on Monday ordered the Food and Drug Administration to reconsider its decisions on the sale of the Plan B emergency contraceptive and ordered its producer to make the pills available to 17 - year - olds without a prescription .
The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York , in a 52 - page ruling , said its order to make Plan B available to 17 - year - olds under the same conditions it is currently available to older women must be complied with within 30 days .
The controversial Plan B , also known as the morning after pill , is now available without a prescription to women 18 and over to reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancy after sexual intercourse .
Women 17 and under have been required to get a prescription for the drug .
The contraceptive , which works best when used within 24 hours of sexual intercourse , is sold by Barr Pharmaceuticals , which was recently acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA .TA .
The FDA was also ordered to reconsider its decisions for Plan B over - the - counter sale .
It is currently available only behind the counter , so those who want to use the drug must ask a pharmacist for the pills .
Plan B ’s availability without a prescription in the United States was repeatedly delayed during the Bush Administration amid opposition from anti-abortion groups .
It was ultimately approved with the age and availability restrictions that will now be reconsidered by regulators .
“ The court recognized that the FDA favored politics over science , ideology over women ’s health , and violated the law in the process , ” Nancy Northrup , president of Center for Reproductive Rights , said in a statement .
“ Emergency contraception is proven safe and effective , and today we have succeeded in expanding access to 17 - year - olds and are one step closer to making it fully available to all women , ” she said .
In making its ruling , the court said it would be premature to take up various constitutional challenges to the FDA ’s decisions regarding Plan B. ( Reporting by Bill Berkrot , editing by Gerald E. McCormick )
It is no secret that Brazil has one of the highest interest rates in the world .
In order to resume economic growth in the country and offer lower interest rates for access to credit , the Monetary Policy Committee ( Copom ) reduced the Selic rate to 5.5 % per year .
The downturn affects the financial market from two fronts : fixed - income investors , who have to focus on diversifying investments to maintain profitability , and borrowers , with the chance to renegotiate their debt with lower interest rates .
In this post , you will learn more about the base interest rate that governs the economy and how its decline influences access to credit and investment .
Keep reading !
How does the Selic rate work ?
The Special Settlement System of Custody , better known as Selic , is the reference interest rate and tracks inflation .
When it is high , interest on loans is more expensive .
When it ’s low , you pay less interest for the money you borrow .
Recently , the Selic rate reached 5.5 % per year , the lowest since the Real Plan in 1994 .
In search of a more sustainable economy , economists project more cuts by the end of the year , reaching 4.5 % . % per year .
How does the Selic fall reduce interest rates ?
The country ’s economic and political scenario has a direct influence on raising or lowering interest rates .
With the prospect of falling Selic rate , some banks have already announced the transfer of lower interest to their credit lines .
Good Finance has already announced the transfer of the cut as well as Banco do Brasil and Bradesco .
Real estate financing is also with falling interest rates creating a good time for those who want to invest in home ownership .
What is the impact on credit demand ?
The fall of Selic is seen as a path to the growth of the Brazilian economy and brings two main perspectives to the economic scenario :
Resumption of jobs and income generation ;
Reduced default risk by demanding more credit for those in need of money and increasing banks ’ confidence to lend .
This is a good time to make lower interest loans if you need money , or to renegotiate debts if you already have some financing or debts to settle .
What is the impact on investments ?
Those who invest money in search of more profitability should look for alternatives in order to increase fixed income gains by diversifying investments with variable income investments and securities with longer redemption or inflation indexed terms .
Before setting , it is important that you take into account your investor profile , ie your acceptable risk levels and your short , medium and long term goals .
With the Selic rate falling and with lower interest rates , the economy tends to grow , while access to credit is simplified for the consumer , reducing debt , attracting investments and turning capital around .

A group of rebel MPs have begun soliciting signatures for a round robin letter calling for Gordon Brown to step down , which they plan to hand to the prime minister after the results of the local and European elections have come in on Monday morning .
The Guardian has learned there are reports that the backbenchers think they can reach 70 or 80 signatories , crucial within Labour party rules that require 20 % of the parliamentary party to mount a challenge – 70 MPs .
The current plan is that no hard copy of the letter should exist for fear of leaks .
Instead , a " tree " of backbenchers , extending through the 350 - strong parliamentary party , is soliciting signatories .
Under the plan , an email address would be handed out to which sympathetic MPs are to send an email saying they support a single - sentence statement that they would like Brown to stand down .
There had been plans for the letter to go " live " at 10 am on Friday morning but it now appears that those at the head of the movement are considering delaying their strike until Monday morning .
There were even claims yesterday that the letter could be delivered to Downing Street by the end of today .
Some backbenchers have seen the letter and are not signing it on account of a perception that the names already on the list are " too leftwing " .
The rebels are deeply irritated that news of the plot has emerged , knowing that the charge of disloyalty ahead of the elections will dissuade as many as a score of backbenchers from joining their ranks .
At the beginning of the week , 50 MPs were said to have agreed to sign the letter with the ambition that the number would rise to 80 before it was sent to Brown .
There had been a deep fear among those who want Brown to go that the exposure of any " plot " would endanger the results of this week 's elections and that Downing Street would crush the rebellion .
Rebels calculated that the " disloyalty factor " could dissuade a crucial 20 - 30 extra names , and that feeling is magnified this afternoon .
The revelation came as Hazel Blears , the communities secretary , delivered another devastating blow to Brown 's leadership by unexpectedly resigning ahead of tomorrow 's polling day .
Her announcement came 24 hours after Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , quit , and amid continuing rumours about the fate of the chancellor , Alistair Darling .
David Cameron told Brown at prime minister 's question time that his " ability to command the cabinet has simply disappeared " .
He said the prime minister was " in denial " about the scale of the crisis facing him .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , joined in the attack , telling Brown that his government was in " meltdown " .
We all need to save money , and in my opinion there is no easier place to start than in areas that we are already spending more than we should .
It ’s also easier to cut expenses immediately than it is to make more money , especially in this economy .
Over the last year since we moved here ( which saved us a ton right away ) , I have really worked on cutting expenses in our house for two reasons – 1 .
I do n’t like spending more than I have to and 2 .
cutting expenses means I can work a little less because I do n’t need to bring in as much money each month .
Because of the way the economy is , I figured I would share some of the ways that we have really cut down our expenses and hopefully inspire you to make some of the changes yourself .
Haul your own trash to the landfill .
In March , I canceled trash pickup at my house and decided to take it to the dump myself .
They were charging me about $ 27 a month for pickup , and to take it myself I pay $ .35 for every 20 pounds of trash .
In April , I brought my trash over for the first time – and handed the guy $ .35 for my 4 pounds of trash .
This is now saving me over $ 26 a month , or at least $ 312 a year .
If you can take your own trash , I would seriously look into doing so !
Get rid of the phone company .
If you are still paying the phone company for home phone service , you are being ripped off .
My mom , who still has n’t made the switch , pays $ 72 a month for her home phone with unlimited calling .
I pay $ 25 .
What ’s the difference ?
I use Vonage , which is a VOIP service that lets you make calls over your high - speed internet connection .
If you have high speed internet ( either cable or if you can get naked DSL , which is DSL without home phone service ) I recommend you switch to a VOIP service asap and start saving money .
The phone works exactly the same as regular service , your computer does n’t have to be on , and we have never had an issue .
And even if you did , most people have cell phones as a backup .
Over the course of a year , if your bill is like my mom’s , you can save $ 564 !
Drastically reduce your electricity use .
My electric bill last year was $ 53 a month .
Last month ?
$ 23 .
And that has nothing to do with needing less heat , as we have propane for that .
To get it down that low , almost every electronic device in our home is either on power strips or unplugged when not in use .
In the entertainment center , the TV , stereo , & DVD player are completely switched off by a power strip when not being watched , and only the DVR is left “ on ” .
The coffee maker , toaster oven , microwave , various radios , and our computers are unplugged or have their strips switched off .
Only the wireless router , modem , and Vonage box are left on .
Any device in your house that either goes to “ standby ” mode or has a power brick continues to use energy even when not in use .
Invest in a couple of cheap power strips and put everything on them – the savings can add up very quickly .
Right now we are saving about $ 25 a month compared to last year , which adds up to $ 300 a year in savings .
Slow down your internet speed .
Chances are , you wo n’t even notice the difference unless you spend your days uploading files .
When I lived closer to town , I had 7MBPS speed on my DSL – and now I have 1.5MBPS due to the fact that I live out in the country .
That sounds like a major speed drop , but I rarely , if ever , notice any difference .
I still stream music all day from Pandora while working on my sites , and can even still use our VOIP phone .
No problems at all to be found .
I did n’t have a choice in the matter , but it did save me $ 10 a month on my internet bill .
That ’s $ 120 a year in savings .
Look into it if you are paying for a higher speed than you actually need .
The above are some major ways you can cut your home expenses starting TODAY that could save you over $ 1,296 a year or about $ 100 a month if your bills are anything like ours .
That ’s a pretty easy $ 100 a month to save .
Even by doing all of them , our life has not changed in the least – it is no different now than it was last year , except for the fact that we are saving even more money .
Still want to save even more ?
Here are a bunch of quick ways to shave a few bucks off your monthly expenses :
– Sounds simple , but making sure your tires are properly inflated can save you money on gas .
– Call a few other auto insurance companies and ask for new quotes to compare to your current policy .
Policies can differ by thousands of dollars a year , and it is definitely worth a 2 minute phone call to find out .
– Turn down your water heater to 120 degrees .
– Combine all your credit card debt onto a card with a 0 % interest balance transfer offer .
– Raise the deductible on your home and / or auto insurance policy .
Our auto policy has a $ 1,000 deductible .
– Fire the landscaper and mow the lawn yourself .
It ’s good exercise and it saves you money at the same time .
– Refinance your mortgage with these new low rates that are available .
– Ask for a discount .
On everything .
What ’s there to lose ?
Now it ’s your turn – what , if any , expenses have you been able to cut at home and not suffer too much from ?
I am not one to advocate living like a hermit in a tent , but oftentimes many people spend way more than they need to on “ necessary ” household expenses , if only because they do n’t know any better .
That ’s the point of this article , to point out what might be obvious to others .
So if you have some great ways to easily cut “ regular ” expenses that do n’t change your life too much , please let us all know in the comment section !
AT&T has a new privacy policy , and this time it means it .
Even the New York Times ' Saul Hansell says it seems earnest , despite all that messiness with helping the National Security Agency warrantlessly wiretap the internet for years .
Here 's the summary of AT&T 's new company - wide policy .
* We will protect your privacy and keep your personal information safe .
We use powerful encryption and other security safeguards to protect customer data .
* We will not sell your personal information to anyone , for any purpose .
Period .
* We will fully disclose our privacy policies in plain language , and make our policies easily accessible to you .
* We will notify you of any revisions to our privacy policy , in advance .
No surprises .
* You have choices about how AT&T uses your information for marketing purposes .
Customers are in control .
* We 're listening .
You can send us questions or feedback on any of our privacy policies .
We 're also sure that if the company is ever caught violating its policy or federal law , it would accept responsibility .
The last thing it would do when busted letting the nation 's spooks have access to its massive internet backbone is hire a bunch of connected lobbyists , start making campaign contributions to key senators and get Congress to pass a law making it impossible for citizens to ask a court to hear their grievances , even if they do have proof .
No , AT&T would never do that .
Hey , forget all that history .
Look at our pretty privacy policy page .
It even has JavaScript and embedded video !
Okay , okay , okay .
And the new policy is actually honest .
Look at the last bullet point carefully and read slowly .
" We 're listening . "
Finally , the truth .

The Central Intelligence Agency wo n't release memorandum that former Vice President Dick Cheney claims prove that the torture techniques applied by CIA interrogators provided valuable intelligence .
The reason , according to an agency spokesman , is that the memos are the subject of pending litigation -- the litigation itself is unspecified -- and therefore , by statute , can't be disclosed until the litigation process is completed .
Interesting note : the CIA does n't say that they 're not declassifying the memos because of national security reasons .
They 're giving themselves a technical out here .
Cheney can ask President Obama to override the CIA 's decision .

It ’s easy in our jubilation over Obama ’s victory to forget the many people in America who were deeply fearful and hate - oriented towards an Obama presidency .
Those people did n’t just shrug their shoulders at the Democratic victory in Nov 2008 .
No , they ’ve re-organized .
Largely abandoned by the Republican party who tapped cynically into their ignorance , fear and hatred and whipped these folks into a racist lather as a Get Out The Vote strategy , the Tax Day Tea Party people have used the internet to find each other and organize .
They ’re getting plenty of news coverage .
And do n’t get me wrong : the teabaggers ( heh ) have expressed some legitimate concerns about the impact of the economic stimulus on the ballooning deficit and the evolving structure of the financial bailout strategy .
Concerns some progressives and many Americans share actually .
Yet Obama ’s kept his promise to lower taxes for most Americans except the very wealthy – I do n’t know about you but I definitely am getting more back than I expected personally on my own taxes .
So …whassup , really ?
Are these folks really concerned about their taxes going up or is it about what they perceive their taxes to be funding ?
Here ’s an image from the Michelle Malkin blog that sums up their real concerns , IMHO – note the bloody imagery , btw .
I ’ve been parsing the words and the racists have been very careful to cover their tracks and fury that a black man is President .
But not well enough .
I ’m starting to become pretty convinced at this point that “ socialist ” is a some kind of code word for “ nigger ” .
Here ’s an example of some of the subtle language the Tea Party people are using to describe their own movement ( emphasis mine ) from the Michelle Malkin blog , a central hive for the poorly informed , wild - eyed , bigoted , Fox News / wingnut blog - driven lynch , ahem I mean Tea Partiers :
As you ’re probably aware , Michelle ’s been a huge supporter of the “ tea parties , ” as has been Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Rush and countless others .
The phenomenon is spreading , and more will be held on Tax Day — April 15 ( a map of all the locations is here ) .
In late February , I attended a tea party in Lansing , Michigan , and will be there again next Wednesday .
While there , I spoke with several people , and , while everybody attended for the same “ big picture ” reason , many had their own reason to be there .
For some it was wildly excessive and confusing tax laws .
Others were there out of concern for their children and grandchildren .
Some were there because they ’re maddened that the same glorious policies that have made Detroit look like Bangladesh after a garbage haulers strike are being introduced on a national level , a few were upset because the same people who created these massive problems are charged with fixing them , others do n’t want their country sold out to some global entity , and one man I saw had a sign that said “ ‘ Government job ’ is a contradiction in terms . ”
Many were there for the reason of “ all of the above . ”
Huh ?
What does Detroit or Bangladesh have to do with Barack Obama ?
Oh that ’s right , Detroit has experienced white flight , urban blight and economic devastation for years now , making some areas seem almost Third World .
But that would n’t have anything to do with the crumbling U.S. auto industry and everything to do with the black mayors the city has been electing , right ?
The corrupt Kwame Kilpatrick notwithstanding , this sounds like a snarky , swiping slur directed at South Indian immigrants , African - Americans and unions all combined succinctly .
There ’s real racist animus here : check out the video above of Tea Party nuts convinced that Barack Obama ca n’t be president because he faked his birth certificate and is actually Kenyan by birth .
My God — do you know what that means ?
It means a black man is illegally president !
Because it ’s just not possible for a black man to be president unless something has gone horribly wrong with the system !
Citizens , act now and get to your local Tea Party !!!
White supremacists are loving the Tea Party movement btw .
They hear the dogwhistle loud and clear and are looking to take advantage of the discontent .
Much more including what white supremacists are saying , the top five questions journalists and bloggers should be asking Tea Party rallygoers and my updated criteria for undercover racist attacks after the jump .
Many white supremacists report planning to attend Tea Parties or already have and some are looking for a way to recruit into their White Nationalist movement .
There ’s an awful lot of Tea Party chatter among these folks .
Why does n’t the media cover this angle ?
Here ’s a telling and typical comment from Stormfront.org :
Ladies and gentlemen , I think every WN needs to not only attend the April 15th Tea Party nearest you ( I ’m going to the Alamo in San Antonio ) but then stay involved and help provide leadership to this movement .
I believe that this is the white revolution we ’ve been waiting for .
It does n’t look what we expected but this is it .
I ’ve seen probably 50 videos on TV showing previous marches and what strikes me is that the participants are all WHITE .
It stands to reason . . . we ’re the ones being taxed to support Affirmative Action , Welfare and other worthless social programs .
It ’s our tax dollars going to ACORN and supporting the 12 million illegals swarming into our neighborhoods .
I would urge news media and citizen journalists covering the tea parties to scratch below the surface to get at the rotting racist underbelly of these protests and ask revealing questions like these top five :
“ How do you know Obama is a socialist ? ” ,
“ Do you believe Obama ’s presidency is a conspiracy by the Jews and Blacks ? ” ,
“ Who do you think Obama takes his orders from ? ” ,
“ Is Barack Obama an American citizen like you ? ” ,
“ How do you feel about having a black president in the White House – what ’s the worst that could happen ? ”
I ’ve re-activating my criteria for an undercover racist attack on Obama from the campaign and revising it for the new reality .
Check out the original and my updated revision after the jump .
The original criteria for the racist attack zone from Oct 2008 :
My criteria for a racist attack during this long and arduous campaign season has been to pause when these three conditions are present and examine what message might actually be on the dogwhistling march :
1 ) Is it unique to Obama , i.e. is it a phrase we ’ve never heard before applied to any other presidential candidate ever or is it something we have n’t heard in recent memory ?
For example : elitist or drug seller .
2 ) Is it illogical or impossible – does the assertion plainly contradict the facts ?
For example : elitist , drug seller or tax raiser .
3 ) Is it repeated , over and over , by a desperate person whose team is falling in the polls & who adopts a wide - eyed , credulous , nodding stare pronouncing the lie slowly and precisely with a watchful eye to see if the listeners are buying it .
For example : elitist , drug seller , tax raiser or terrorist .
Optional : Does the assertion cause nervousness , embarrassment or confusion among non-blacks ?
When other white people such as Tom Brokaw sense something wrong and start to ask questions like “ Do you really believe that ? ” , you know for sure you ’re in the racist attack zone .
Here ’s the new criteria for an undercover racist attack :
1 ) Is it unique to Obama , i.e. is it a phrase we ’ve never heard before applied to any other president or is it something we have n’t heard in recent memory ?
For example : he ’s not an American citizen or he ’s a socialist who ’s planning re-education camps for young people .
2 ) Is it illogical or impossible – does the assertion plainly contradict the facts ?
For example : not an American citizen , socialist , tax raiser , re-education camps for young people .
3 ) Is it repeated , over and over , by a desperate person whose team lost badly in the last election & who adopts a wide - eyed , credulous , nodding stare pronouncing the lie slowly and precisely with a watchful eye to see if the listeners are buying it .
For example : not an American citizen , socialist , elitist , drug seller , tax raiser or terrorist .
Optional : Does the assertion cause nervousness , embarrassment or confusion among non-blacks ?
When other white people such as Tom Brokaw or John Stewart sense something wrong and start to ask questions like “ Do you really believe that ? ” , you know for sure you ’re in the racist attack zone .
As Exhibit A , I offer John Stewart ’s interpretation of the Tea Party movement as Baracknophobia above .
My main concern here is that the heated rhetoric around the protests could lead to violence against African - Americans , Jews and Latinos if some Tea Party recruits go from non-violent to violent .
That ’s why it ’s important to drag the masked racism here out into the daylight so we can deal with it and force denials from their movement leaders before certain elements become more brazen and people start getting hurt .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea ’s top technology university has developed a plan to power electric cars through recharging strips embedded in roadways that use a technology to transfer energy found in some electric toothbrushes .
The plan , still in the experimental stage , calls for placing power strips about 20 cm ( 8 inches ) to 90 cm ( 35 inches ) wide and perhaps several hundred meters long built into the top of roads .
Vehicles with sensor - driven magnetic devices on their underside can suck up energy as they travel over the strips without coming into direct contact .
“ If we place these strips on about 10 percent of roadways in a city , we could power electric vehicles , ” said Cho Dong - ho , the manager of the “ online electric vehicle ” plan at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology .
The university has built a prototype at its campus in Daejeon , about 140 km ( 90 miles ) south of Seoul , for electric - powered golf carts and is working on designs that would power cars and buses .
The system that can charge several vehicles at once would allow electric cars and buses to cut down on their battery sizes or extend their ranges .
The non-contact transfer of electricity , also called inductive charging , works by magnets and cables on the underside of the vehicle making a connection with the current in the recharging strip to receive power as they travel over it .
It is employed in some brands of electric toothbrushes that are sealed and water resistant , which do not need to be plugged into anything but use a magnetic connection to receive energy while resting in a cradle .
The recharging strips , which are attached to small electrical stations , would be laid in places such as bus lanes and the roads running up to intersections so that vehicles could power up where traffic slows down , Cho said .
The system will be tested later this year for use in the bus systems of Seoul and other South Korea cities while some of the country ’s automakers are also cooperating in the project .
Unlike electric lines used for trams , vehicles do not need to be in constant contact with the strips and a person can touch the lines without receiving a shock .
The system so far has proven safe to humans and machinery , Cho said .
The cost of installing the system is an estimated 400 million won ( $ 318,000 ) per kilometer of road .
Electricity is extra .
I 'm not a lawyer , but as I look at Temporary Senator * Roland Burris ' disgraceful dissembling and odious parsing of words over his sworn testimony to the Illinois House impeachment panel , I see a lot of lying but no perjury .
We 've had this lesson before in the informal law school class that is news coverage of important legal issues , but let 's refresh on perjury :
Perjury , the Supreme Court has said , is " an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts " of justice .
To prove a charge of perjury , according to the Department of Justice handbook for prosecutors , the government must at least show : that the testimony was given under oath ; that it was false and that the accused knew it to be false ; and that it concerned a matter that was " material " to the crime being investigated .
" Materiality " has been defined by the courts as anything " capable of influencing the tribunal on the issue before it . "
( Washington Post article published in the Tribune , October 30 , 2005 )
It 's on the materiality issue where , for now , Temp .
Sen .
Burris has to get a pass .
If we go back and assume that he gave the same answers in his testimony that he gave in his recently revealed affidavit -- that he 'd actually had several other contacts with members of former Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's inner circle about Barack Obama 's U.S. Senate seat and that he'd been asked to raise money for the governor -- there is still , in that admission , no reason to deny Burris that seat , to which Blagojevich later appointed him .
Burris now says he did not raise money for Blagojevich , did not agree to raise money for Blagojevich in the future and even told Blagojevich 's brother that such fundraising would be inappropriate under the circumstances .
Further , from what Burris now says there 's no evidence that he was presented with a pay - to - play offer that he should have reported .
So there 's nothing legally material as regards either Burris or Blagojevich in Burris ' , um , failure to tell the whole truth during his testimony and previous affadavit .
At least not so far , near as any of us know .
Still , Burris ' oleaginous hair - splitting and preposterous excuses do amount to a serious political offense , and I expect voters will administer their punishment to Burris on primary day , 2010 .
* Why do I call him a Temporary Senator ?
Because that 's what he is according to the 17th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
As a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the US regularly prepares a report on its civilian nuclear program for the Agency , which provides a detailed listing of the sites and assets of the nuclear power industry throughout the US .
Although most of the information is available from other sources , the report is , quite reasonably , considered very sensitive .
Over the weekend , however , the Federation of American Scientists ' Secrecy News blog noticed that the document had appeared on the website of the Government Printing Office and quickly grabbed a copy , hosting it on their server .
Although the original has been pulled from the government 's site , these sorts of errors have become irreversible in the Internet era — the FAS ' document is now mirrored on Wikileaks .
Part of the IAEA 's mandate is to identify and limit nuclear proliferation by tracking civilian uses of nuclear technology , and determining when materials are diverted for potential military use .
As part of the protocols it has signed with the IAEA , the US discloses , " each site , location , facility , and activity would be declared in order to meet the obligations of the United States of America with respect to these provisions , " according to President Obama 's cover letter , which is attached to the document .
The cover letter indicates that the document wound up at the Government Printing Office because the Administration was reporting it to Congress .
It was explicitly not intended for public disclosure ; under Federal disclosure rules , it was marked as " Sensitive but Unclassified , " which limits who gets to see it .
Under IAEA rules , the document is termed " Highly Confidential Safeguards Sensitive , " and each page of the report is marked by that phrase .
So , it 's pretty clear that the GPO was in error when it posted the document in a publicly accessible location , and it quickly removed it once the mistake became apparent .
Of course , anyone who checked the Secrecy News site before the document could be pulled would have been able to download a copy of their own , so it 's no surprise that someone took their copy and placed it on Wikileaks .
As of this morning , the site was offering downloads of it from sites in Sweden , US , Latvia , Slovakia , UK , Finland , Netherlands , Poland , Tonga , and Europe , so it 's safe to assume that , even if the US attempts to take action to have it pulled , it will be a long , drawn out fight that will probably wind up ensuring that any interested parties have the opportunity to get their copy in the mean time .
As noted above , most of the material in the document is already public knowledge .
Civilian nuclear sites are pretty difficult to miss , and it's widely known that radioactive wastes are generally stored on site , and will remain there until the US makes its way through the political minefield involved in opening a long - term storage site .
Still , some of the information provides a glimpse into the facilities at the Department of Energy 's National Laboratory system .
Various press reports say that information is available on Los Alamos , Livermore , and Sandia National Labs , and details are provided on a major storage facility for enriched uranium housed at Oak Ridge National Lab .
Even if that information is available elsewhere , anyone interested in it will definitely appreciate having it all in one place , although the document is an unsearchable scan of the original , rather than a text PDF .
In any case , the path the document took to public recognition highlights the changes the Internet has brought to the process of journalism .
It has allowed interested parties — in this case , the Federation of American Scientists — to easily monitor the places where accidental disclosures of this sort are likely to take place , and provided them a way to reach the wider world ( even if their blog had to be amplified by traditional press outlets to get there ) .
The disclosure also highlights how digitized documents can have a life of their own , turning a limited accident into a one - way ticket to public disclosure .
PETALUMA , Calif .
—A prominent under - bite , scrunched face and floppy ears are the hallmarks of a winner .
The winner of the World 's Ugliest Dog contest , that is .
Pabst , a boxer - mix rescued from a shelter by Miles Egstad of Citrus Heights , Calif. , won the annual contest on Friday at the Sonoma - Marin Fair in Northern California .
It was an upset victory for Pabst , who beat former champion Rascal , a pedigree Chinese Crested .
Pabst 's owner took home $ 1,600 in prize money , pet supplies and a modeling contract with House of Dog .
Miss Ellie , a blind 15 - year - old Chinese Crested Hairless , won the pedigree category .

Update ( June 24 ) :
The issue continues and the attackers have switched their URLs to innocuous - looking Bloglines URLs containing the word " twitterbest " .
—
Web security company Panda Security contacted us today to warn that malware links have started to invade Twitter 's Trending Topics .
Scammers are targeting the service , they say , by creating fake Tweets that include the name of a trending topic .
The idea is that you 'll search for a topic to find out what it means , and accidentally click through to the malware sites .
Beware " Twitterbest " and " Zasaden " in Twitter Search
The most common rogue links are called " Twitterbest [ dot ] mp " and " Zasaden [ dot ] mp " - do not visit either site .
The sites are obviously scams based on the fact that the URLs usually have some pornographic phrase in them , but with the sheer volume of links being distributed it would be extremely easy to conduct a Twitter search and accidentally click a link .
Once you click the link :
1 . You 'll be taken to a page that prompts you to " upgrade your Flash player " or similar .
2 . If you agree to this download , the software installs itself .
3 . You receive error messages saying you have a virus and need to download a fake antivirus program they call " Fast Anti-Virus 2009 " .
This is the end goal of the scam : to get you to pay $ 89 for the fake anti-virus software .
You can avoid these scams by being cautious of links in Twitter search that look like those above .
More generally , it 's smart to avoid downloading software from unknown sites .
The Twitter Trending Topics Scam in Pictures
Here 's the full process of the scam , and screenshots of each stage supplied by Panda Security .

Step 2 : Prompt to Download Flash or Other Video Software

Disney 's quarterly revenues may only have been down 7 % year - over - year , but its studio entertainment division ( the one that releases its movies ) saw a 21 % year - over - year revenue drop during the quarter -- the company 's second for its 2009 fiscal year .
In fact , on their investor conference call , Disney execs said that their disappointing movie slate was the largest driver of their revenue decline .
We 're not surprised .
Disney 's movies — including the poorly timed Confessions of a Shopaholic — have n't done so well this year , leaving the studio with a lot of ground to make up this summer if they want to remain competitive with their rivals .
( See what all of the major studios have at stake this summer here . )
How bad did Disney 's films do at the U.S. box office this quarter *?
Take a look :
Bedtime Stories : $ 110 million on an $ 80 million budget .
Confessions of A Shopaholic : $ 43.2 million ( budget unknown )
The Jonas Brothers : The 3 - D Concert Experience : $ 19.2 million ( budget unknown ) [ Interestingly , this was the only movie Disney failed to mention on its conference call as performing poorly in the quarter , even though it did worse than all of its other films during the period . ]
Race to Witch Mountain : $ 49.2 million ( budget unknown )
And as Disney noted , those films did n't do as well as Q2 2008 titles National Treasure 2 ( $ 218.3 million US ) , Enchanted ( $ 127.7 million on an $ 85 million budget ) and the Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus 3 - D concert film ( $ 64.9 million ) .
Disney 's DVDs released during the quarter ( High School Musical 3 , Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Bolt ) also did n't sell as well as last year 's Q2 titles ( Enchanted , The Game Plan and No Country For Old Men ) .
The Mouse House said it 's expecting a similar Q3 from its studio entertainment division , purely due to a disappointing slate of DVD releases ( the movies that bombed at the box office this quarter ) .
But , unsurprisingly , Bob Iger and his CFO Tom Staggs said they 're psyched about their upcoming slate , including this summer 's Pixar 3 - D movie Up , The Proposal , and G - Force and upcoming titles The Princess and the Frog , A Christmas Carol , The Sorcerer 's Apprentice , Prince of Persia , Toy Story 3 , Alice in Wonderland , Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean 4 .
It 's a shame that most of the movies in that last batch wo n't be released until 2010 , at the earliest .
* We used domestic figures because several of these titles are still unspooling internationally , and it was impossible to compute how much they 'd done globally by March 27 .

Le député et porte - parole de l'UMP Frédéric Lefebvre a souhaité , lundi 26 mai , que les salariés puissent être autorisés , via le télétravail , à poursuivre leur activité professionnelle pendant leur congé maladie ou maternité .
Il devait défendre un amendement en ce sens lors de l'examen de la proposition de loi UMP sur le prêt de main - d' œuvre entre entreprises , qui devait débuter lundi soir à l'Assemblée nationale .
Ce texte de Jean - Frédéric Poisson ( UMP ) vise à assouplir les règles de prêt de main - d'œuvre , au nom des " chances de l'emploi " .
M. Lefebvre entend " permettre aux salariés qui en feraient la demande de maintenir une activité par la voie du télétravail dans certains cas où leur contrat est normalement suspendu " , selon l'exposé des motifs de son amendement .
Ces cas concerneraient les congés consécutifs " à une maladie ou un accident " , le " congé maternité " , le " congé parental d'éducation ou congé de présence parental " , précise le texte .
" L'intérêt de la poursuite du contrat de travail est évident pour le salarié à qui elle permettrait , au minimum , de maintenir sa rémunération , à nombre d'heures de travail effectuées équivalent " , détaille l'exposé des motifs .
" L'employeur pourrait également être incité à encourager le passage au télétravail en se voyant offrir une réduction de charges sociales , financée par les économies réalisées par la caisse d'assurance - maladie , qui n'aurait plus à verser d'indemnité au télétravailleur " .

Troopers have arrested a man and a woman suspected of damaging at least 14 vehicles by throwing rocks onto them from a railroad trestle over Interstate 5 near Lakewood , Wash . , as a part of a bizarre stripping game .
Trooper Guy Gill says 23 - year - old Joshua N. Sizemore and 18 - year - old Amanda L. Madison were tossing baseball - sized rocks from the trestle early Monday .
Sizemore , of Tacoma , and Madison , of Lakewood , were booked into the Pierce County Jail in Tacoma , Wash . , for investigation of malicious mischief and second - degree assault .
Sizemore and Madison were tracked down by troopers on the ground with assistance from a State Patrol airplane which captured video of the couple throwing rocks .
Investigators say Madison was in her underwear when police caught up with the couple .
Investigators say the couple was playing a stripping game , the rules of which involved Madison shedding a layer of clothes for every left headlight the two managed to bust .
The same rule applied to Sizemore and right headlights .
Gill says the vehicles that were hit included a State Patrol cruiser .
One person was injured when a rock crashed through the window and bruised his arm .
He did not need to be hospitalized .

If ever there was a reminder to be cautious with e-mails , it came this week as romantic missives from South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford to his Argentine lover surfaced in the national press .
Sanford , a conservative Republican who disappeared for several days to rendezvous with his lover in Argentina , returned to the United States on Wednesday to find out his tryst had been exposed in the media , along with months ’ worth of steamy electronic exchanges between the couple .
“ I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificently gentle kisses , or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curves of your hips , the erotic beauty of you holding yourself . . . in the faded glow of night ’s light , ” one of Sanford ’s messages read .
“ But hey , that would be going into sexual details . ”
The State , a South Carolina newspaper which first published the correspondence , said it received the e-mails anonymously as early as December of last year .
They appeared to come from a personal e-mail account belonging to Sanford rather than a government - related account , according to the paper .
Advertisement
Sanford is now battling for his job as some constituents call for his resignation .
How the anonymous source obtained the e-mails and whether that source violated any laws in doing so is n’t clear .
What is clear , experts said , is that anyone using e-mail , text messages and other forms of electronic communication that can zip around the globe in seconds should simply assume that the whole world is reading .
“ Never intermingle professional stuff and personal stuff , ” said Elizabeth Charnock , chief executive of electronic data analysis company Cataphora Inc. , based in Redwood City , Calif .
Sanford is hardly the first public figure to become tangled in his own e-mails .

Frank Quattrone ’s career at Credit Suisse First Boston as a celebrated investment banker was derailed in 2003 , in part by e-mails in which he allegedly suggested that his colleagues should destroy evidence .
Quattrone was then charged with obstructing justice and witness tampering .
His conviction in federal court was later reversed and all charges dismissed .
E-mails figure prominently in the fraud and insider - trading lawsuit filed this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Angelo Mozilo , the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial Corp .
The suit accuses Mozilo of hiding the troubled mortgage lender ’s true financial condition from shareholders even as he lambasted his own company ’s loan products as “ toxic ” and “ poison ” in e-mails to other executives .
Mozilo has denied the allegations .
In this electronic age , companies are monitoring their workers ’ e-mails with a prevalence that far surpasses that of wiretapping phone calls .
And most experts say the high - tech snooping is on the rise .

Nearly 30 % of employers have fired employees for e-mail misuse , with reasons including inappropriate language , excessive personal use and breach of confidentiality , according to a 2007 survey from the American Management Assn . and consulting firm EPolicy Institute .
Just after landing a job abroad in 2001 , an employee of a Washington - based investment firm sent an e-mail to friends through his work account about his plans to sleep his way through the local female population .
He also bragged about bankers who “ cater to my every whim . ”
He was forced to resign when the e-mail went viral .
Companies increasingly are trying to protect themselves from wrongful termination lawsuits by monitoring mundane communications , Charnock said .
Her company often does e-discovery work .
Advertisement
Businesses often employ software that flags e-mails with phrases such as “ delete this e-mail , ” “ I could get in trouble for telling you this ” and “ just between you and me , ” she said .
“ I ’m always surprised how many people in an e-mail about a contract negotiation will talk about how they have the hots for a co-worker even if they ’re married , ” Charnock said .
Employees should rarely expect privacy with a work e-mail account , said Ron S. Brand , a partner with employment law firm Fisher & Phillips .
Courts tend to side with employers , many of whom now have strict policies governing e-mail use and stating their ownership of e-mailed content , Brand said .
Even e-mails sent from personal accounts during personal time can be subpoenaed if they contain information about an employer , experts said .
Advertisement
“ But this is still a developing area of the law , and there are so many permutations , ” Brand said .
“ A lot of employers take the pragmatic view that it ’s virtually impossible to monitor every employee ’s activities . ”
Still , experts advise employees to never send e-mails at work or through their company accounts that they would n’t want publicized .
Workers should pretend that a supervisor is reading every message .
An e-mail informing a spouse when you ’ll be home is easily forgiven , most agree .
But using the office server to download music or hunt for jobs is asking for trouble .
The “ reply to all ” button is also dangerous .
And contrary to popular belief , deleting an e-mail is n’t like shredding a damning paper letter , experts said .
The messages can stick around in company archives for years .
Advertisement
“ Most people think of e-mails as a conversation , not realizing that they ’re writing a document that ’s just as legal as a memo or a letter , ” said Sandra Chrystal , director of the Center for Management Communication at USC .
“ That e-mail is not confidential . ”
E-mail is n’t the only minefield .
People also should be wary of how they text , instant message and even post to forums .
Just ask former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick .
Thousands of text messages written on a city - owned BlackBerry to his chief of staff , Christine Beatty -- many of them steamy -- were revealed by the Detroit Free Press last year , after both had denied a personal relationship under oath .
The text messages also revealed that the pair had lied about their involvement in a police official ’s firing .
Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and agreed to pay $ 1 million in restitution to the city .
He was released from jail in February after serving 99 days .
Advertisement
At one point during the affair , fearing that Kilpatrick ’s bodyguards knew she had spent the night in his hotel room , Beatty texted : “ So we are officially busted ! ”
Kilpatrick responded : “ Damn that .
Never busted .
Busted is what you see ! ”
He , and others , might want to rethink that .

US warships are heading to the area following Capt Phillips ' capture Somali pirates have hijacked a tugboat in the Gulf of Aden with 16 crew members on board - 10 of them Italians .
Maritime industry sources say the tug was towing two barges at the time of the attack at 0800 GMT .
The crew are said to be unharmed .
Meanwhile pirates holding a US captain hostage have warned that using force to rescue him could result in " disaster " .
They said they hoped to put Capt Richard Phillips on a larger vessel .
US ships are on their way to the area .
He is being held by four pirates in a lifeboat hundreds of kilometres off Somalia .
In other developments : Sailors on a Panama - flagged bulk carrier repulsed a pirate attack with water hoses .
Nato officials on a nearby Portuguese warship said an unexploded rocket - propelled grenade landed in the commanding officer 's cabin On Friday , one Frenchman and two pirates were killed in a rescue operation by French troops on another vessel captured off Somalia .
Four others , including a child , were freed from the yacht Growing concern Earlier reports suggested that a group of Somali elders were preparing to mediate between American officials and the pirates for Capt Phillips ' release , but there has been no news of any progress .
The US national was taken hostage on Wednesday after pirates hijacked his ship , the Maersk Alabama , as it sailed towards the Kenyan port of Mombasa carrying food aid .
MAJOR PIRATE INCIDENTS Ukrainian ship MV Faina seized on 25 September 2008 , held until 5 February 2009 Saudi tanker Sirius Star held for two months from November 2008 ; a $ 3 m ransom was negotiated At least 15 pirate attacks reported to International Maritime Bureau during March 2009
The 32,500 - tonne Malaspina Castle , UK - owned but operated by Italians , seized on 6 April 2009 .
Growing sophistication of pirates Q&A : Somali piracy Profile : Capt Richard Phillips
After a long struggle , crew members regained control of the ship .
It is thought Capt Phillips offered himself as a hostage in order to save his crew .
The Maersk Alabama arrived in Mombasa late on Saturday .
" He 's a hero , " one crew member shouted as the ship moored , referring to Capt Phillips .
The BBC's Karen Allen at the port says there is unprecedented security .
FBI agents are on board the ship .
Maersk President and Chief Executive Officer John Reinhart told journalists the ship was now a crime scene and the crew would have to stay on it during the investigation .
They would all be repatriated as soon as possible , he added .
There has been rising concern in the US over the fate of the captain - Defence Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Washington on Friday that his safe return was a " top priority " .
FBI experts are helping negotiate his release , but analysts have said the process could be lengthy .
Capt Phillips tried to escape on Friday by jumping overboard and swimming towards a nearby US ship , but was recaptured .
Reports in the US say the pirates are demanding a ransom of $ 2 m for his safe release .
The US Navy destroyer , USS Bainbridge , is at the scene of the confrontation with other American warships on the way .
Stories circulating in Somalia claim that extra pirate ships are also making their way towards the area .
The pirates say they hope to transfer Capt Phillips to a bigger and better - protected vessel .
The Pentagon is also said to be considering other options , including possible military force , US sources say .
But the Somali pirate commander warned against any forcible intervention .
" I 'm afraid this matter is likely to create disaster because it is taking too long and we are getting information that the Americans are planning rescue tricks like the French commandos did , " Abdi Garad said .
French ordeal
The attacks have renewed international focus on hijackings in one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
Florent Lemacon , the owner of the French yacht and father of the child who was on board , was killed during the rescue operation .
French Defence Minister Herve Morin said on Saturday that officials " cannot rule out " that Mr Lemacon was killed by French fire .
But he said the raid was " the best possible decision , " and that an investigation would determine what happened on board the Tanit .
The four released hostages - Mr Lemacon 's wife Chloe , their three - year - old son Colin , and two other adults - are due to arrive in Paris on Sunday , he said .
Somalia has been without an effective government since 1991 , fuelling the lawlessness which has allowed the pirates to thrive .
Pirates typically hold the ships and crews until large ransoms are paid by the shipping companies .
Last year the firms handed over about $ 80 m ( £ 54 m ) .
Efforts to stop the pirates have so far had only limited success , with international naval patrols struggling to cover the vast areas of ocean where pirates operate .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A toy nuclear power plant built by two six year - olds sparked a public alert in Germany , only for authorities to discover the would - be security threat was the shell of a computer with a radiation warning sign stuck to it .
Fire services and police cordoned off several streets and told residents to stay indoors in the western town of Oelde after the two boys left their mock power station on the street when they went home for dinner Monday evening .
“ It was n’t a prank , they were just playing , ” a local police spokeswoman said Tuesday .
“ The boys tried to go back later to carry on but the fire brigade would n’t let them through . ”
The lock - down of the area began when a passer - by saw the metal object with the yellow and black symbol on it , took fright and alerted authorities , the spokeswoman said .
Police sent out warnings on local radio for residents to remain in their homes while a radiation detector was rushed to the scene to investigate the old computer casing and the warning sign , which the boys had printed out from the internet .
After the object had been identified , the boys ’ parents explained to police the children had gone out to “ play nuclear power station ” that evening , the spokeswoman said .
Just days after releasing its latest smart phone , Palm Inc. on Wednesday named a former Apple Inc. executive that it hired to help turn around the company as its new chief executive .

Spending caps and sports do not make good bedfellows , despite cries form underfunded teams to the contrary .
No where is this more evident than in F1 racing .
Historically , the F1 team that spends the most enjoys the most success .
Max Mosley wants to change all that .
Mosley has proposed spending caps for teams , but the rules are not so cut and dried .
Instead of enforcing a level playing field in all regulations , poorer teams will be allowed more freedom to interprete the rules as they see fit .
Teams spending more than $ 60 million dollars ( not including engines , drivers , and marketing expenses ??) will be governed strictly by the rule book , while teams with pocket lint for funding will get to make it up as they go , but not if Ferrari has anything to say about it .
In a press release today , Ferrari publically denounced the rule changes , and threatened to end their 60 year streak of continuous involvement in F1 if the rules were not amended .
Ferrari is to F1 what the New York Yankees are to Baseball , so lets hope this statement does not go unnoticed by the FIA .
It makes no sense to alienate the best teams or most well funded teams or the most ingenious , when the name of the game is being at the pinnacle of motor sports .
Ferrari is routinely all three , and has only recently fallen off the podium as a result of not being able to do anything in their power to go faster .
I say “ Let them go faster , Mr Mosley , at any cost . ”

Let 's get this out of the way : I 'm a Ghostbusters Super - Fan .
It 's my favorite movie , I own a jumpsuit as well as a movie - accurate Proton Pack and I even cried during an episode of Extreme Ghostbusters when Slimer accidentally killed Eduardo ... keep in mind that this was a cartoon that aired when I was in high school .
Personally , I like the idea of people reviewing games from franchises they love because I feel like they 'll be tougher on a property than your average reviewer , but that 's my opinion .
You 're an IGN reader -- you get pissed when a non -fan reviews a game and you get pissed when an admitted fan reviews a game , so there 's no way to win .
Anyway , still here ?
Awesome ; Ghostbusters : The Video Game
The boys are back ( PS3 Video ) .
Take + that , +ghost + ceiling !
Set in 1991 , two years after the events of Ghostbusters 2 , this title finds the boys in gray moving onto the next chapter in the world of paranormal investigations and eliminations -- namely , expanding the team .
You 'll join the squad as an experimental weapons technician with the sole purpose of testing Egon 's latest Proton Pack modifications .
Within moments of showing up on the job , a strange wave of ghostly energy emanates from a museum packing a Gozer exhibit and spreads across New York City .
The spiritual spike gets every ghoul in the five boroughs riled up , the boys get to work and a devious master plan is set in motion .
This game is meant to be the third movie in the franchise , and with that in mind , we have to talk about presentation right off the bat .
The game opens detailing the ghostly explosion in a beautiful cutscene -- all the computer - generated movies look great with lots of detail and animations -- and we 're launched into the Ghostbusters theme just like when the Gray Lady scared the librarian in the first movie and when Dana caught up to Oscar 's carriage in the second film .
These nifty scenes will continue along with the soundtrack from the original movie throughout the game and setup the tale .
There are dips in this presentation value -- which I 'll get to in a bit -- but these touches are pulled right from the movie and drop you into this third - person shooter with a specific story to tell ( i.e. do n't expect to choose your next job GTA - style ) .
To immerse you in the experience , your noob Ghostbuster character does n't speak and is n't given a name other than " rookie . "
In the game , it 's explained that this nameless move is to keep the core four from getting attached in case a device goes haywire and puts the whippersnapper out of commission , but in reality , it 's so you can just sit back and play your part as the real Ghostbusters banter with each other in the tech - heavy dialogue and comedic one - liners you 'd expect .
For me , this works quite well .
If you have n't been paying attention , the four original Ghostbusters ( Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd , Harold Ramis , and Ernie Hudson ) are back to lend their voices along with the team 's receptionist ( Annie Potts ) and the dickless wonder known as Walter Peck ( William Atherton ) so you really do n't need some new guy getting in the way of the dialogue , which was penned in part by the films ' original writers Aykroyd and Ramis .
I 'm sure many would want to create their own character , but when you see some of the facial animations in the CG cutscenes and how the experience plays as a whole , I think you 'll forgive the omission .
OK .
So , the game feels a lot like a movie -- we 've even got a new love interest for Venkman in Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn , who is voiced by Alyssa Milano -- but you 're probably more concerned with how it plays .
A third - person shooter , your Ghostbusters experience is told from the behind - the - back perspective .
Rather than have the screen littered with health bars and HUDs ( the screen will get red as you take damage and display a running damage total as you blast objects in an environment ) , your Proton Pack will serve as your hub of in - game information .
By monitoring the meter on the right side of the device , you can see how close to overheating you are ; yes , to give you some restraints , liberties were taken with the device so that you now have to vent the pack to keep it from overheating and taking you out of the game for an extended period of time .
The pack is also your visual representation for which weapon mode you are in .
Rather than limit you to just a proton stream , Egon will have outfitted your pack with a total of four firing modes by the time all is said and done .
The first mode is the classic Proton Pack from the movies but packs a Boson Dart ( a ball of condensed energy that explodes on impact ) as a secondary fire .
By tapping No. 2 , you 'll switch to your dark matter functions , which causes some blue lights and gizmos to pop out of the pack .
These dark blue attacks include the shotgun - like Shock Blast and Stasis Stream that slows enemies to a crawl .
The Meson Collider is assigned to No. 4 -- which causes an antenna crackling with electricity to come out of the pack -- and tags a ghoul with a tracker and then rapidly fires particles at the enemy .
Finally , the Slime Blower is No. 3 and can be used to coat enemies and objects in positively charged goo or as a Slime Tether that draws two objects together .
This beaut turns the four red lights green and causes a slime reservoir to rise out of the pack .

And Lenovo's official press release came through over the wire this morning as well ....
Lenovo Energizes Mini-Computing with its First 12 - Inch Netbook Debuts World 's First Netbook with NVIDIA 's ION Graphics Processor
It 's shaping up to be quite the month for Lenovo .
Just weeks after it unveiled a refreshed version of its IdeaPad S10 netbook ( understandably deemed the S10 - 2 ) , the company is dropping yet another new rig on the world .
Today , the IdeaPad S12 came to light , bringing with it the title of world 's first netbook with NVIDIA 's Ion technology .
How significant will this be in the netbook world ?
If we had to guess today , we 'd say " very .
"
If you 'll recall , NVIDIA 's Ion is a new chipset that aims to provide 1080 p capabilities to otherwise underpowered and low - cost machines .
It 's the same technology that launched in Acer 's Aspire Revo nettop , and the same technology that recently shipped in a Zotac mainboard .
Most netbooks today ship with lowly integrated graphics that can't handle multimedia at 720 p or higher and cannot run any of the latest 3D gaming titles .
Thus , most netbooks are stricken to handle only Office - type tasks and Web browsing .
Lenovo's IdeaPad S12 promises to be the first netbook that can seriously handle high - def tasks , with a 12.1 " display and the ability to play back 1080 p content ( via the HDMI output , of course ) in " silky smooth " fashion .
As if that were n't enough , Lenovo also made sure to bless this machine with a 100 % full size keyboard , something that 's extraordinarily rare on netbooks .
In fact , we 'd say the tight , often misshaped keyboards are the worst attributes on netbooks .
With this machine , it 's just like typing on any standard 15.4 " notebook .
Nice touch , Lenovo .
The company hopes to begin shipping the S12 next month with prices starting at $ 449 , though the Ion version ( the flagship model ) will cost $ 499 .
Still , for a netbook with a full size keyboard , Ion graphics and a six cell battery good for nearly six hours of life , that 's not a lot to ask .
Full specifications are below in the press release from Lenovo .
NVIDIA also took the opportunity to brief us on their proud new design win with Lenovo , underscoring the benefits of the platform over Intel chipset based solutions for the Atom processor .
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK , NC – May 25 , 2009 : Lenovo today announced the IdeaPad S12 , the company 's first 12 - inch netbook .
The new netbook takes the best in connectivity , style and entertainment features in Lenovo 's other netbooks and brings users the next level in netbook computing with improved usability and performance .
These enhancements include a 12.1 - inch screen , a 100 percent full - size keyboard and new graphics options with the NVIDIA ION ™ platform .
"
We've heard from consumers loud and clear about the need for affordable and extremely portable computing devices , and we 've responded by introducing our third netbook with a completely new form factor , making mini-computing more usable and redefining value in today 's market , " said Dion Weisler , vice president , Business Operations , Idea Product Group , Lenovo .
" We are pioneering new territory in the developing netbook arena by being the first vendor to give customers high quality video and entertainment capabilities in a netbook with optional NVIDIA ION graphics .
" Whether it 's looking at photos , playing music , emailing or cruising online , consumers want smaller and more portable PCs .
The Lenovo IdeaPad S12 netbook is raising the bar for higher levels of netbook computing with choices of the Intel Atom processor with Intel integrated graphics or the Intel Atom processor with NVIDIA ION graphics .
Also , for the first time on a netbook with NVIDIA 's ION graphics platform , users will be able to enjoy brilliant 1080 p high definition video with silky smooth playback .
" NVIDIA ION graphics help deliver the same features found in premium PCs at lower price points and new form factors , " said Rene Haas , general manager , Notebook GPUs , NVIDIA .
" With enhanced graphics , the Lenovo IdeaPad S12 netbook is perfect for watching movies , playing popular games like Spore , flipping through vacation pictures or enhancing family videos .
" The IdeaPad S12 netbook offers plenty of up and running time with up to six hours of battery life to support the mobile demands of netbook users1 .
Because netbook users need to stay connected wirelessly , the netbook comes with WiFi connectivity and ready for 3G with an ExpressCard slot to enable connectivity2 .
To hold the photos , music and videos users keep on their netbooks , the IdeaPad S12 netbook offers ample hard drive storage and memory with up to 160 GB of storage and 1 GB of memory .
For peace of mind in case data becomes corrupted , Lenovo 's OneKey ™ Rescue System can help recover user data or device settings .
In addition to the netbook 's sleek and sophisticated ring pattern design in black or white , users can make the netbook their one - stop entertainment device , starting from the moment they turn it on .
Lenovo 's expanded VeriFace facial recognition technology makes logging in a snap by recognizing the user 's face .
If users want " on demand " functionality , they can go into the Lenovo Quick Start environment and check email , browse the Internet and more without waiting for the full operating system to boot .
They can also don any set of headphones and enjoy surround sound audio with Dolby Headphone technology .
If opting to watch video on an external monitor , they can easily connect through the netbook 's VGA port or HDMI port on select models .
They can also choose among several multimedia formats to upload through the 4 - in - 1 multicard reader .
Lenovo designed the IdeaPad S12 netbook for consumers looking for a super thin , portable and affordable device that offered a familiar , computing experience .
Lenovo enlarged the netbook 's WXGA screen from 10.1 inches to 12.1 inches for better viewing and made the keyboard 100 percent the size of a full - size laptop to make typing easier and less cramped .
And when it comes to portability , by measuring less than an inch thick4 , the netbook leads the industry for thinness compared to other 12 - inch netbooks .
The lightweight IdeaPad S12 netbook weighs in at just three pounds5 .
The IdeaPad S12 netbook will be available in June through business partners and www.lenovo.com.
Pricing for models starts at $ 449 .
Models with the NVIDIA ION graphics will be available later this summer .

What did Pelosi know and when did she know it ?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pauses during a news conference about the Obama administrations first 100 days on Wednesday , April 29 , 2009 , in Washington .

What did Pelosi know and when did she know it ?
1 / 1 Back to Gallery
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been pushing for a " truth commission " to investigate the CIA 's use of " enhanced interrogation " techniques like waterboarding - until Republicans started shining the spotlight on Pelosi herself .
Now she is not so adamant .
Spokesman Brendan
Daly told me that Pelosi wants a truth commission , " but she still realizes the political reality " - as in the opposition of President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
The rest of the reality may well be this : Pelosi knew that White House lawyers had sanctioned waterboarding in 2002 - and did not protest .
According to the Senate Intelligence committee , the CIA briefed Pelosi , then the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , on the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah - who was waterboarded - in 2002 .
The Washington Post reported in 2007 that the 2002 briefing provided Pelosi and company with a " virtual tour " of interrogation techniques .
At the time of the story , a congressional source speaking for Pelosi , however , told the Post that Pelosi thought waterboarding was in the planning stages .
The source admitted Pelosi did not object .
Who , then , is Pelosi to go after Bush lawyers for sanctioning waterboarding , which she now refers to as torture ?
This is what Pelosi said last week : " We were not - I repeat - we were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used . "
Yes , the Bush Office of Legal Counsel said the techniques " could be used , " she explained , " but not that they would . "
So Pelosi thought that just because the Bushies were sticking out their necks and authorizing the CIA 's use of waterboarding , that did not mean the CIA would use it .
And the Democrats called George W. Bush dim and ineffective ?
Note that Pelosi used the term " enhanced interrogation methods " when referring to her CIA briefing .
Not torture .
On Tuesday , Pelosi added a twist to the story .
She told CNN that the briefers " said they had a legal opinion they said they were n't going to use and when they did they would come back to Congress to report to us on that . "
Daly added , " There 's really not a whole lot you can do when you 're being briefed " and you 're a member of the minority .
Then what is the point of having a bipartisan intelligence committee ?
Why not just buy a rubber stamp ?
Porter Goss , the House Intelligence Committee chairman in 2002 who went on to become director of the CIA , has a different recollection .
As he wrote in the Washington Post , he , Pelosi and the ranking Senate Intelligence Committee members were briefed extensively , " understood what the CIA was doing , " and " gave the CIA our bipartisan support . "
Goss was " slack - jawed to read that members claim to have not understood that the techniques on which they were briefed were actually to be employed . "
Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra , the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee , has called on the Director of National Intelligence to release complete CIA briefing documents - including information as to who attended and what was said , so that Americans will know what congressional leaders like Pelosi knew .
Daly told me that Pelosi supports that effort as she generally believes in transparency .
Good riddance to a " truth commission . "
It 's pretty sickening to think some Democrats have been poised to investigate and possibly prosecute those who sanctioned waterboarding , yet , when Pelosi knew in 2002 that the White House was pushing it , she did not try to move heaven and earth to make sure it never happened .
If you were here last summer , you might remember the Implant Madness series where BC traveled the globe searching for moments where women were using their implants to make some extra scratch .
One of those stops last year was at a Missouri Hooters where ladies spend a weekend day washing cars .
The waitresses are back with new outfits for 2009 .
Think 1980 ’s Cinemax bikini car wash movies where some chick who would somehow lose her bikini and then all her friends would get naked too .
Except this modern - day version is SFW .
Looking to get the new BMW cleaned off while you slam down some brews and artery clogging wings ?
Here is the location for the Springfield , Missouri Hooters .
After about 15 - 20 minutes of search we ’ve yet to find details on costs .
Figure on spending $ 20 and a few bucks on tips .
This is n’t like taking the ride to the automatic .
These women give your car special attention .

Yesterday from the Palace of Versailles , Nicolas Sarkozy became the first president to address Parliament in 150 years .
He took the opportunity to show his determination over the proposed HADOPI legislation , promising that he will " go all the way " to enforce law on the Internet .
Sarkozy ’s address yesterday was made possible by the annulment of a law prohibiting a sitting president from addressing lawmakers .
The last time an address of this type occurred was 1848 , in Napoleon ’s day .
After condemning the wearing of burqas by Muslim women in France and labeling it a “ sign of subservience , ” he moved on to HADOPI – France ’s controversial anti-piracy law which aimed to implement “ 3 Strikes ” for alleged pirates .
Earlier this month the Constitutional Council , France ’s highest legal authority , deemed Internet disconnections unconstitutional , and stopped the law .
Speaking to both the Senate and the National Assembly in a joint session at Versailles Palace just outside of Paris , Sarkozy was clearly undeterred .
During a 45 minute speech , he turned to the issue of Internet piracy , stating ;
“ How can there be areas of lawlessness in areas of our society ?
How can one simultaneously claim that the economy is regulated but the Internet is not so ?
How can we accept that the rules that apply to society as a whole are not binding on the Internet ? ”
Sarkozy Will “ Go All The Way ” With 3 Strikes
Sarkozy went on to say that by championing HADOPI , he ’s not just protecting artists .
“ By defending copyright I do not just defend artistic creation , I also defend my idea of a free society where everyone ’s freedom is based on respect for the rights of others .
I am also defending the future of our culture .
It is the future of creation . ”
In pressing for HADOPI , Sarkozy said he will “ go all the way . ”
Charlotte Allen is very , very angry with us atheists -- that ’s the only conclusion that can be drawn from her furious broadside in The Times on May 17 .
She ca n’t stand us ; we ’re unpopular ; we ’re a problem .
What , exactly , is the greatest crime of modern atheists ?
We ’re boring .
I can’t actually argue with that .
It ’s true .
We ’re all just ordinary people -- your neighbors , your friends , your relatives .
I know atheists who are accountants , real estate agents , schoolteachers , lawyers , soldiers , journalists , even ministers ( but do n’t tell their congregations ! ) .
Our leading lights are college professors , scientists , philosophers , theologians and other such pedantic , scholarly riffraff .
For entertainment , they read books , and if they want to do something ambitious and dramatic , they write books .
I ’m one of them , so trust me , I know -- we do n’t exactly live the James Bond lifestyle .
Calling us boring is a fair cop .
But still -- why would anyone get angry about that ?
I find myself bored witless by games of chance , but I do n’t write irate letters condemning all card players and demanding the immediate shuttering of all casinos .
I ’m afraid I do n’t believe Allen .
There are other motivations behind her denunciations , and they are n’t as simple as that she finds us boring .
She should drop the pretense that the objectionable part of our character is our lack of excitement .
What really annoys Allen is that in our books , blogs and media appearances , we challenge religious preconceptions .
That ’s all we do .
It ’s admittedly not exactly a roller - coaster ride of thrills , but it does annoy the superstitious and the fervent true believers in things unseen and unevidenced .
We are also , admittedly , often abrasive in being outspoken critics of religious dogma , but it ’s also very hard to restrain our laughter and contempt when we see the spectacle of god - belief in full flower .
We witness many people who proudly declare that the Earth was created 6,000 years ago , roughly 9,000 years after the domestication of dogs , 5,000 years after the founding of Jericho and contemporaneous with the invention of the plow .
They cling to these beliefs despite contradictions with history , let alone physics , geology and biology , because they believe the Bible is a literal history and science text .
We find much to ridicule in these peculiarly unreal ideas .
We live in a world where the majority of the population are quite convinced that they have a direct pipeline to an omnipotent , omniscient being who has told them exactly how to live and what is right and wrong , and has spelled out his divine will in holy books .
Unfortunately , there are many holy books , and they all disagree with each other , and of all these multitudes claiming possession of such a potent source of information , we similarly see widespread disagreement .
This god seems to be an exceptionally unreliable oracle -- most of what he has supposedly said is wrong .
We atheists do take glee in pointing out God ’s lack of consistency , which I ’m sure Allen finds irritating .
Contrary to Allen ’s claim that we are n’t interested in criticizing the important elements of religious belief , we are :
We go right to the central issue of whether there is a god or not .
We ’re pretty certain that if there were an all - powerful being pulling the strings and shaping history for the benefit of human beings , the universe would look rather different than it does .
It would n’t be a place almost entirely inimical to our existence , with a history that reveals our existence was a fortunate result of a long chain of accidents tuned by natural selection .
Most of the arguments we ’ve heard that try to reconcile god and science seem to make God a subtle , invisible , undetectable ghost who at best tickles the occasional subatomic particle when no one is looking .
It seems rather obvious to us that if his works are undetectable , you have no grounds for telling us what he ’s been up to .
Allen requests that we atheists take religious belief seriously .
We do ; it ’s hard not to take seriously a bizarre collection of antiquated superstitions that are furiously waved in our faces in our schools , on television , in our politics and even on newspaper editorial pages .
That we take the intellectually bankrupt beliefs of religion seriously is precisely why we do question it , and will continue to question it , in our boring way : by simply speaking out .

June 24th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson

Scientists have discovered a remarkable , unexpected and cheap way to store hydrogen fuel– using carbonized chicken feather fibers .
The problem of storing hydrogen as fuel has traditionally been a perplexing and expensive dilemma .
For instance , a car with a 20 - gallon hydrogen storage tank made from carbon nanotubes or metal hydrides– two of the best ideas so far– would add $ 5.5 million or $ 30 k respectively to the price of that vehicle .
A storage tank made from carbonized chicken feathers , however , would only mark up the cost a measly $ 200 .
The green bio-material would also help solve the problem of how to dispose of the 2.7 billion kilograms of chicken feathers generated each year by commercial poultry operations .
One of the major reasons hydrogen - powered vehicles are n’t commonplace on our highways is the immensely difficult problem of how to store enough of the fuel on - board to give those vehicles a cruising range that approaches that of gasoline or diesel fuel .
Storing sufficient quantities requires placing it under extreme pressure , which can add significant weight to the vehicle and increase the potential for a dangerous explosion .
That problem has led scientists to look toward structures like carbon nanotubes for a solution , since they can pack large quantities of hydrogen at normal pressure within a fairly small space .
The catch is that manufacturing carbon nanotubes is very expensive and ultimately impractical .
Enter scientists at the University of Delaware , who while researching the potential of keratin derived from chicken feathers to improve the performance of microcircuits , unexpectedly discovered that by heating the keratin fibers they could strengthen its structure enough to compare to the strength of nanotubes .
In other words , the hydrogen storage capacity of the strengthened keratin was essentially equivalent to that of carbon nanotubes , but using nothing more than chicken feathers as raw material .
In addition to hydrogen storage , the new method could turn chicken feather fibers into a number of other eco-products like hurricane resistant roofing , lightweight car parts , as well as the aforementioned bio - based computer circuit boards .
Furthermore , utilizing this technology would be recycling at its best .
Previously , there has been no major use for all the feathers leftover from chickens in the poultry industry .

The United Nations appointed a Jewish South African judge Friday to investigate both sides amid allegations of war crimes and human rights violations during the recent Israeli offensive in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
Richard Goldstone — a former UN chief prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda — said his team will investigate " all violations of international humanitarian law " before , during and after the conflict that ended Jan. 18 .
The human rights probe will examine alleged war crimes by Israel in its three - week war with Hamas , as well as possible Palestinian violations in southern Israel .
" It 's in the interest of the victims .
It brings acknowledgment of what happened to them , " Goldstone told reporters in Geneva .
" It can assist the healing process .
I would hope it's in the interests of all the political actors , too . "
As a Jew , he said he was " shocked " to be asked to head the mission , but believes he can handle the task in an " evenhanded and impartial manner . "
The UN Human Rights Council ordered the investigation in January .
Israel has refused to co-operate in such investigations in the past , calling them biased .
" This committee is instructed not to seek out the truth but to single out Israel for alleged crimes , " said Yigal Palmor , spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry .
The investigation team includes British professor of international law Christine Chinkin , Pakistani lawyer Hina Jilani and retired Irish army colonel Desmond Travers .
( CNN ) --
The boy writhes uncontrollably on the floor , but the church members remain calm , if increasingly loud .
They 're trying to drive a " demon " out of him .
In the video , Manifested Glory Ministries members gather around a boy in Bridgeport , Connecticut .
" You homosexual demon , get up on outta here ! " they say .
" You demon , loose yourself ! "
" You sex demon ... you snake ! "
The shouts , the convulsions , the references to homosexual spirits -- they are all captured on a video posted on YouTube by the Manifested Glory Ministries .
The video has sparked anger among gay youth advocacy groups and put the small church from Bridgeport , Connecticut , in the middle of an ongoing national debate on gay issues .
Patricia McKinney , pastor of the nondenominational church who describes herself as a prophet , said she has even been receiving death threats as a result of the video , but does n't understand the outrage .
" I believe in deliverance , I believe in anointing , I believe in the power of Jesus , " she said in a phone interview with CNN .
" I 've been threatened already , I 've been attacked , and it does n't make any sense to us .
Really , what they 're doing , they 're putting me out there on the mat . "
McKinney says she does n't refer to the events of the video as an exorcism , but rather a " casting out of unclean spirits . "
She said this is n't the first time that an event like this has taken place at her church , but it is the first one centered around homosexuality .
McKinney said the boy approached the church and told her he wanted to be a pastor , but was struggling with his sexuality .
" We allow [ gay people ] to come into our church .
We just do n't allow them to come in and continue to live that lifestyle , " she said .
" God made Adam and Eve , " she said .
" He made a woman to be with a man , and a man to be with a woman . "
Robin McHaelen , who worked with the 16 - year - old boy at the center of the video in her position as executive director of True Colors Inc. , a gay youth advocacy and mentoring program in Connecticut , said the video was taped in March .
She would not identify the teen .
McHaelen said she does n't think the church acted maliciously -- but that 's part of her problem with the video .
" None of the people in this video were intending to hurt this kid , " she said .
" They performed this ritual in an attempt to rid him of feelings that he did n't want to have . "
The boy is the fifth teen True Colors is aware of that has undergone an event like the one documented in the video .
But unlike the boy , not all the teens approached a church or religious organization .
The event , McHaelen said , reflects a culture and society that does n't believe a person can be both Christian and gay .
" That 's what makes me so sad and so mad , " she said .
McHaelen said she talked to the boy since the incident and said he 's feeling very conflicted and confused in trying to reconcile who he is with his religion .
" He 's 16 and having the feelings that he 's having , the relationships he 's having , and then [ he 's ] being tormented by ' What if I 'm going to go to hell because of what I feel and who I am ? ' " she said .
McHaelen notified the Connecticut Department of Children and Families , as she 's mandated to do in her position when she suspects abuse or neglect of a minor .
However , she told CNN the department will be looking into whether or not abuse or neglect occurred by the parents and family of the boy , not the church .
The department declined to comment Thursday .
Isaiah Webster , Director of Communications for the National Youth Advocacy Commission , said he was deeply saddened by the timing of the video and the accompanying uproar .
" It 's very , very sad that this still takes place in society , " he said .
" It 's also very sad that it comes about during this week , [ as the ] 40th anniversary of Stonewall is this weekend . "
The so - called " Stonewall Riots " are believed by many to have kicked off the gay liberation movement .
" That is really something to celebrate , " Webster continued , " and it 's unfortunate that young people still have to endure things like this . "
McHaelen said that as an advocacy group , she does n't think True Colors can take any legal action against the church , and said she would rather engage in an open dialogue with its members .

What you are looking at here is the very first image ever taken of the surface of Mars .
It was acquired by NASA 's Mariner 4 using a television camera , and rendered using crayons .
Look closer :

After Mariner 3 failed to take images because of a hardware problem , Mariner 4 became NASA 's next big hope to get images of the Red Planet .
There were going to be ten Mariner missions , but they wanted these badly .
The spacecraft did its first flyby on July 15 , 1965 , at 00:18:36 UT .
It took 21 pictures alternating green and red filters , which were saved to tape .
Then , the probe went behind the planet and the signal was lost .
Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , waited impatiently , listening to static as Mariner 4 travelled fearless across the dark side of Mars .

At 03:13:04 UT signal was reacquired .
All systems were nominal , cruise mode was re-established , and transmission of the images started 8.5 hours later .
It lasted until August 3 .
The people at the JPL were so excited to receive the images that they could n't wait for them to be processed by the lab 's imager .
As the first picture was beamed down as a stream of 8 - bit numbers — each point indicating a brightness point — they thought of a quick way to get an image straight away :
Print the numbers indicating brightness in paper strips , put them together , and color them with pastel crayons .
Click to viewI do n't know about you , but I like the crayon version better than the actual image .

Smeagol92055 : R.O.A.C.H. :
I can say that Ben Sisko changed my life ; he was so different from either of the captains showcased before him .
Whereas Kirk treated his underlings like utter shit , and Picard ... well , hell , the man could make you feel bad , like you let down your father or something , Sisko was an entirely different beast .
He was a father himself , and he treated all of his crew with respect and understanding , even when the people on the station tested his limits , he rarely lost his cool completely with someone .
He was far more diplomatic than anyone I had ever seen , and it molded me into a pretty diplomatic person myself .
These days I think pretty hard before speaking ( in the real world , of course , ) and I always try to find a way out of a situation that will be mutually beneficial for all parties involved .
Here 's to you , Sisko .
ElimGarak :
I spent several years at alt.startrek.vs.starwars , and it shaped my outlook on life immensely .
It taught me that some people are just too wrapped up in their own little worlds to consider alternate perspectives - and also helped me take things less seriously .
Furthermore , the stories in Star Trek are one of the few areas where you win by solving a problem as an adult , instead of punching and kicking .
Too much sci- fi is aimed at the lowest common denominator , and tries to capture the high school jock demographic .

Star Trek ( especially TNG , DS9 and Voyager ) totally changed my life .
I think it did so because of how old I was at the time and that it was exactly what I needed at the time to develop a positive sense of self .
It was late 1993 and I was 12 the first time I encountered Star Trek .
It was a TNG novel dealing with Klingons and a subplot with Wesley Crusher .
Being a geeky kid I felt calmed by the idea that there were smart kids in the future and that , in the Star Trek world , being geeky was n't a bad thing .
This is why , crappy writing for the character in most episodes aside , that character will always be my favorite .
When I started watching DS9 and TNG on the little b&w set my mom had I just fell in love with the shows .
Here were people who were smart and adventurous and I spent a lot of time modeling my attitudes based on what I learned from Star Trek .
I , too , learned from Star Trek what I wanted my friendships and relationships to be like in the real world .
Also , the multicultural love fests ( in regards to actors and character backgrounds ) that were DS9 and , eventually , Voyager really made me happy and feel that it was okay to look different than 95 % of my peers .
In the future , I thought , life would be good , and not so sucky as my real life was at the time .
There were heroes , like Picard and Sisko and Janeway , who were good and smart and I wanted to be just like them .
The casts became like a family to me , in a " I know it 's just a tv show and the actors do n't know me personally " kind of way .
I still choke up momentarily when I attend a convention with an actor present who I 've never met before .
Star
Trek gave me such a sense of self that it 's hard not to be overwhelmed .
Watching Star
Trek back then sometimes meant more to me than being with my real family .
jedikalos :
It was TOS for me , in 1966 when I was ten years old .
My parents had divorced and the world seemed strange and scary ( Vietnam on TV , and the atomic war drills in school — they actually had us bring in blankets and glass jars for water , I kid you not , and taught us how to duck down when the sirens wailed , and the civil rights struggles and all of it ) — and Star Trek gave my small self a real hope and comfort that people could be different : rational and caring and yes , as you talk about , in a community .
The relationship between Kirk and Spock and McCoy fascinated me and in some way made me feel better about my life .
And Spock inspired me to embrace rationality and logic with a true passion — not to mention the ideals of equality and tolerance which were just imprinted on my young mind ( never to fade ) .

But for Star Trek I would have grown up a happy , open - minded , liberal , unwitting racist .
I grew up in a pleasant , happy , liberal ( ish ) enclave where there were certainly people of color , I just did n't know them .
So despite my parents best efforts , I must have figured that being black ( or whatever ) did not make someone unequal , it was just something polite people did n't notice .
Not an outright handicap , more like a birthmark or something .
Dianne Carroll , Nat King Cole and Harry Belafonte were popular on television , despite ( I must have thought ) the minor disadvantage that there were to be congratulated for overcoming .
Then came Uhura .
She was African ( no hyphens ) , she was manifestly competent ( arguably the most emotionally stable person in sight ) , she was an officer respected by everyone ( the white boys jumped when she gave an order - happily so , see previous ) , did n't apologize , did n't explain , she was a perfect example of ' do the work . '
Two particular moments stuck in my head : one where an alien in the form of Lincoln addressed her as ' a charming negress ' and I had to have that word explained to me .
She responded with admirable grace , and a remark about the power of words that I carry with me to this day .
Then of course there was the time Sulu , deliriously D'Artagnen , fencing sword in hand , came up to her declaring ' I 'll protect you , fair maiden ! ' to which she tartly replied : " Sorry , neither . "
I had to have that explained to me , too .
Anyway .
The message penetrated that not only was she exactly who she was , but no one on the Enterprise was politely ignoring anything ( such as her race ) , the entire notion of ' acceptance ' or ' tolerance ' would have baffled them .
( One recalls the episode with the two fellows with black / white face paint .
On occassion , The Message was writ quite large . )
Meanwhile , Spock 's race was only an issue because he frequently made it one ( or the writer 's did ) .
And over in the gender studies department , there were times when Ms Nichols was expected to say ' Captain , I 'm frightened , ' and though her mouth pronounced the words her eyes said ' You know , if it were me in the captain 's chair instead of your horny butt , we would n't be getting shot at by an armada of angry fathers '...
Thus staking out a place in my tiny whitebread mind for women in positions of authority .
Captain Janeway was a long time coming .
Without Uhura , I would have been a subtle bigot , because I would n't have thought I was one .
" I treat all people as if they were equals " , I would have said , not realizing that I was nonetheless thinking of women or non-white people as ' Other . '
I thank Star Trek , and Ms Nichols , for giving me a good lecture and a hard shake both directly and by example .
It stuck .

Without a shadow of a doubt , Star Trek had a huge impact on my life .
I watched TNG as it aired in the 80's , and I was six years old .
Since then I knew I wanted to be an engineer or a scientist .
I was living in the middle east at the time and things were quite rough , needless to say , TNG made me stick with it , and I graduated as an engineer and now I am a scientist .
I still remember the starry night I walked back home from watching Star Trek First Contact , thinking to myself , warp drives are exactly what I want to do with my life .
That lead me to study numerical relativity and sure enough I ended up across the world working and studying as a scientist at a research center .
That being said , the moral questions , the sense of wonder and awe at the universe , the quest for knowledge and truth , the philosophical questions the crew of the Enterprise tackled every week , it gave me hope of a better future , of a humanity where you are judged based upon your merits and shortcomings as an individual ( not if you have the " force " on your side ) .
The vast universe stretched further than our eyes can see in a million years just begging to be explored and charted .
All we had to do was lay the building blocks in science and engineering , and perhaps one day , we might get there .
In the meantime , we will watch re-runs :)

Robert Carver :
Star Trek had a definite impact upon my life .
I was an ADHD kid in a small rural school system back in the mid-70's .
There was no diagnosis available at that time that would explain to my parents and teachers why I was such a hyperactive child .
So those feelings of alienation weighed upon me when I discovered Star Trek in re-runs Monday through Friday at 6 pm on a cable channel .
I was immediately drawn to these characters and the universe they inhabited where every person was of value .
The crew of the Starship Enterprise were wonderful role models for me as it was a show that celebrated the best aspects of humanity coupled with the exploration of the Final Frontier .
So I was relieved to find that even troubled kids like me had a place in the future .
The movies with the original cast were very enjoyable as I was hungry for further adventures with these family members .
I was 14 when I went to see The Wrath of Khan in June of 82 .
The story of how important the relationship between Kirk , Spock and McCoy was appealed to me .
They each possessed aspects of behavior and thought that were made whole when they were together .
Spock 's death as he sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise viscerally hit me at such a primal level that it took about an hour after the movie ended just to stop crying .
The theme of friendship and loyalty resonated with me as I internalized the values espoused in the series and these movies .
I had been ill in high school and as time passed I kept getting worse but the doctors I saw were n't able to diagnose me .
I finally became so ill I was rushed to the ER and then hospitalized .
While I was waiting to find out what was wrong , I watched episodes of TNG as often as possible .
They were halfway through the pivotal 3rd season while I was in the hospital .
That helped keep me calm as I awaited the news .
I was finally diagnosed with Crohn 's Disease .
Since that diagnosis in 1990 I have had 4 bowel resections , other surgeries , a multitude of invasive tests , hospital stays and numerous complications .
My constant companion over the past 19 years has been the stories of a better future on TNG , DS9 , Voyager and Enterprise .
For that one hour each week I was transported away from my earthly problems into a reality where so many of the things I valued were explored in continuing voyages of each crew .
Star
Trek has helped me battle my depression as I struggle with Crohn 's and my difficulties in maintaining relationships .
Gene Roddenberry 's vision of a secular , science and reason based Earth that sends out explorers to seek out new life and new civilizations fires my imagination and encourages me to do what I can in the here and now to lay the foundation for that imagined Star Trek universe .
I have been a fan of this franchise for so long , now 25 years , I can not remember a time in my life when Star Trek was n't there .
Star Trek has evolved with the various incarnations and with the release of the new movie , it has made a quantum leap back into the national zeitgeist .
Star
Trek has become relevant again in our culture and the old school die - hard fans are no longer an endangered species .
Like any great mythological tale , Star Trek has been and will continue to be many things to each fan .
For me , the boundless optimism that humanity will unite , progress and finally leave the cradle of Earth to explore a universe teaming with sentient life forms makes me a better person in the here and now .
Rather than destroy our world , we will evolve to a higher level of awareness and have a higher purpose than the current obsession with material goods and religious / cultural wars .
The journey to get to that Utopian future I know we must act now .
So I can not imagine how different I would be if I had never discovered Star Trek .
I would not have learned to appreciate Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations .
I would n't have learned that it does n't matter what we look like , where we are from , how different we are to each other , it is the content of our character that is important .
All we have is this one life so we better make the best of it while we can .
" To Boldly Go " is n't just about exploring space , it is about exploring ourselves .
I just wish I could live to see the world imagined by Star Trek become reality .
Now that would be my idea of heaven .

A clause in the convention means countries can hunt whales for research
The outgoing chair of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) has suggested whale conservation could benefit from ending the commercial hunting ban .
Dr William Hogarth 's remarks came at the end of this year 's IWC meeting , which saw pro- and anti-whaling nations agree to further compromise talks .
A Greenpeace spokesman said the moratorium had to stay intact .
The meeting deferred a decision on a controversial bid from Greenland to add humpback whales to its annual hunt .
The Greenland Inuit are one of the indigenous peoples granted hunting quotas because they are deemed to need whalemeat .
I am probably convinced right now that there would be less whales killed if we did n't have the commercial moratorium
Dr William Hogarth , IWC chairman
The meeting wrapped up a day ahead of schedule , although a small group of delegates convenes on Friday to start planning a second year of talks about a possible compromise deal between the various blocs .
The first year 's discussions were supposed to reach a deal by this meeting , but the deadline proved too tight .
Sustainable yields
The 1982 commercial whaling moratorium is one of the conservation movement 's iconic achievements , and environment groups and anti-whaling nations are , at least on the surface , lined up four - square behind it .
But Dr Hogarth , a US fisheries expert who led the compromise talks for the last year , suggested it could now be a problem for whale conservation .
" I 'll probably get in trouble for making this statement , but I am probably convinced right now that there would be less whales killed if we did n't have the commercial moratorium , " he told BBC News immediately after the meeting ended .
Guide to the great whales
His argument is that Japan 's hunts , conducted under a clause in the whaling convention that gives any country the right to hunt as many whales as it wants for scientific research , are essentially unregulated .
Currently Japan catches more than 1,000 whales each year ; and Dr Hogarth believes use of the scientific whaling clause encourages large hunts in order to get enough samples to draw scientifically valid conclusions .
" I 'm not sure you 'd need nearly so many whales if it were strictly for sustainable use , " he said .
The key , he suggested , was to find a way of allowing limited , tightly regulated small - scale whaling for local consumption , while outlawing large - scale , heavily commercial hunts and keeping international trade under control .
No return
The Japanese delegation has kept a low media profile during this meeting , but it is likely that Dr Hogarth 's words will be well received in Tokyo as it seeks to win international agreement for introducing " small - type coastal whaling " as part of a compromise deal .
How it goes down with environmental groups is another matter .
Greenpeace oceans campaigner John Frizzell , a long - time opponent of whaling , said the moratorium had to stay .
If there 's one common element involved here , it 's that everybody believes the status quo is no longer acceptable
Cristian Maquieira
incoming IWC chairman
Whaling :
It 's the politics , stupid !
" Lifting the commercial moratorium would be an extremely bad idea , " he said .
" Before the moratorium , under the IWC 's guidance and supervision , populations were driven down to commercial extinction one after the other and heavily depleted .
" The moratorium is the only management procedure that has even halfway worked , and to talk about scrapping it is going back to the old days . "
Privately , some anti-whaling campaigners may be prepared to countenance a partial end to the moratorium , with strict regulations placed on catch quotas , trade and monitoring , in return for bringing scientific whaling under the IWC 's control .
Sue Lieberman , head of the global species programme at WWF International , said that although Japan was not currently offering to end scientific whaling within a timeframe of a few years , progress was possible in the longer term .
" I do n't think anyone should expect Japan to come forward and say ' you 're right , we 've been wrong all these years , we give up ' , " she said .
" But I think it 's important to sit down with Japan and talk about it .
" It is time to give it up .
Economically it makes no sense , it 's not necessary for food security , it 's time to leave the Southern Ocean [ whale ] sanctuary as a sanctuary - and I hope politically Japan will understand that . "
Local needs
The meeting 's other potentially contentious issue - Greenland 's request to add 10 humpback whales per year to the minkes , bowheads and fin whales that the Inuit already catch - was left open after EU nations could not agree a position among themselves .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat EU policy is to vote as a bloc in all international environmental agreements .
But here there was an unbridgeable split between those such as the UK who found the detail of Greenland 's proposal unacceptable and others who favoured approval .
With the EU commanding so many votes in the IWC as to hold the balance of power , the option of deferring a decision , awaiting research into how much meat Greenlanders obtain from whales , poured diplomatic oil on troubled waters .
But it did not find favour with Amalie Jessen , Greenland 's deputy minister for fisheries , hunting and agriculture .
" I do n't think EU countries understand the needs of traditional hunters , " she said .
" I have observed very little tolerance and very little understanding of our situation , and they are always coming up with new requests and questions and conditions . "
Greenland 's request was turned down at the last two IWC meetings , and the government cites the issue as a reason for wanting to move its whaling outside the commission 's remit .
Southern climes
Away from these main issues , environmental groups were pleased to see the passage of a resolution noting that climate change will affect cetaceans , and appealing to IWC members to " take urgent action to reduce the rate and extent of climate change " .
Environmental lawyers said this could be a precedent for regional fisheries management organisations , which normally shy away from discussion of climate issues .
Pecking hors d'oeuvre : Gull attack
There was also appreciation for Australia 's initiation of a new research partnership in the Southern Ocean that will use exclusively non-lethal methods .
Although comment on Japan 's research in the same region tends to focus on the lethal aspects , its fleet also carries an international team of scientists that documents whale numbers by sightings and other techniques .
A long - time contention of some observers has been that if countries such as Australia want Japan to stop its expeditions , they have to start funding an alternative research operation - and now that message appears to have been heard .
With Dr Hogarth 's departure , the job of steering next year 's negotiations between Japan and anti-whaling countries such as Australia falls to incoming chairman Cristian Maquieira , who said that on a scale of difficulty from one to 10 , this was " about a 12 " .
" Speaking candidly , it 's an organisation that has no carrots and no sticks , " he said .
But the Chilean diplomat was optimistic about the negotiations " I feel if there 's one common element involved here , it 's that everybody believes the status quo is no longer acceptable , " he said .

The rush to repay TARP monies gives us another opportunity to consider why the hell this absurd financial giveaway ever happened in the first place .
A close inspection suggests some dishonesty on the part of the prior Treasury Secretary .
From its inception , the TARP never made much sense .
Forcing banks that did not need money to accept government bailouts was simply irrational .
The basis for the TARP went through several differing rationales — it began as a recapitalization of the major money center banks , then came the explanation of removing toxic assets , then it moved to freeing up credit and making banks lend again .
Its was $ 700 billion dollar pile of money in search of a justification for its existence .
Most people still look at TARP the wrong way .
When trying to discern what the true basis of it was , we eliminated what made no sense whatsoever , and what was left were a few strange ideas .
When you eliminate the impossible , what ’s left , no matter how improbable , becomes the best explanation .
What was that explanation ?
In Bailout Nation , we discuss the possibility that The TARP was all a giant ruse , a Hank Paulson engineered scam to cover up the simple fact that CitiGroup ( C ) was teetering on the brink of implosion .
A loan just to Citi alone would have been problematic , went this line of brilliant reasoning , so instead , we gave money to all the big banks .
Bailout Nation excerpt :
“ Shortly after the TARP was passed , Paulson added to its original intent — to use the funds to buy toxic debt from the banks — with a mishmash of programs and schemes , including : – Injection of $ 250 billion into the nation ’s banks .
–
The U.S. government would guarantee new debt issued by banks for three years ; this was designed to prompt banks to resume lending to one another and to customers .
–
The FDIC offered unlimited guarantees on bank deposits in accounts that do n’t bear interest — usually those of small businesses .
–
The Treasury took preferred equity stakes in the nation ’s largest banks ( Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Citigroup , Wells Fargo , Bank of New York Mellon , and State Street ) .
Beyond those massive expenditures , Uncle Sam was to “ temporarily guarantee $ 1.5 trillion in new senior debt issued by banks , as well as insure $ 500 billion in deposits in noninterest - bearing accounts , mainly used by businesses . ”
All told , the costs of the “ bailout package came to $ 2.25 trillion , triple the size of the original $ 700 billion rescue package . ”
Now for the punch line :
It was all an elaborate ruse , a coverup of the fact that Citigroup was busted .
As of October 2008 , the other banks , while somewhat worse for wear , neither wanted nor needed the capital injection .
None of them were in the same trouble as Citi .
Even Bank of America ’s problems via Merrill Lynch would n’t become acute until December 2008 .
Washington Mutual , the most troubled on the list , had already been put into FDIC receivership the month before .
26 JPMorgan bought WaMu from the FDIC for under $ 2 billion , and Wachovia was swept up by Wells Fargo for about $ 15 billion .
Thanks to a change in the tax law , Wells Fargo got to shelter $ 74 billion in profits from taxation .
Instead of the FDIC absorbing a few billion in losses from Wachovia ’s bad assets , the taxpayers lost 35 times that amount .
The hurry to repay this cheap cash confirms that the fix was in .
If this banks were really in the basd shape Paulson suggested , they would hold onto this cheap source of credit .
Instead , they want to throw the yoke of government monies off as soon as possible .
The desire to return to their old compensation packages for executives cannot be the only factor . . .
JEDDAH ( Reuters ) - “ Let her get fat ! ” is the slogan women in Saudi Arabia are using to challenge a clampdown on female - only gyms .
Unhappy at the growing number of unlicensed female gyms , the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs recently closed two in the Red Sea city of Jeddah and one in the city of Dammam on the Gulf Arab coast for not having a license .
In response , newspaper columnists and bloggers are promoting the sarcastic line “ let her get fat ! ” as a way of fighting back , though it is likely to be a losing battle .
In Saudi Arabia , where clerics have extensive influence in society , gyms are sexually segregated because of conservative tribal and religious values .
Female participation in sports has long been a controversial issue in the kingdom , with physical education banned from public girls ’ schools and clerics issuing religious prohibitions on female participation in sports .
While male gyms get licenses from a government sports body , female gyms have no official authority overseeing them .
“ The idea of female fitness is non-existent within our government , ” said Fouziah Alouni , a prominent women ’s rights campaigner .
“ Depriving women of this is yet another way of marginalizing them .
Give us a justifiable reason or leave woman alone .
This is unbearable . ”
The result has been high rates of diabetes and even bone frailty among women , which the Ministry of Health says it wants to combat .
“ Football and basketball are sports that require a lot of movement and jumping , ” Sheikh Abdullah al - Maneea , member of the official Supreme Council of Religious Scholars , said in a religious opinion published in Okaz newspaper Thursday .
He said such excessive movement may harm girls who are still virgins , possibly causing them to lose their virginity .
“ There is a school of thought that unfortunately exists and which has a distorted interpretation of Islam , ” said Lina Al - Maeena , who organises basketball training in Jeddah .
Women ’s gyms can only exist inside hospitals as “ health centres ” supervised by the Ministry of Health but prices are so high , at least 1,000 riyals ( $ 266 ) a month , that only the affluent can afford membership .
Cheaper versions have sprung up under name “ beauty salon ” or “ studio ” but now their future is in doubt .
Madawi Al - Hassoun of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce said the chamber has been trying for three years to find a government body prepared to take on board licensing female gyms .
“ Some people do n’t like women to go out of their homes .
This is a common struggle for female businesses in Saudi , ” she said .
As the social web has exploded in growth , so has the need for companies to respond and set guidelines .
For large companies especially , these rules can be key to avoiding PR disasters .
As we stated in an article on social media policy , " you have to contemplate what might happen if someone says or does something stupid . "
However , a lot of media companies just do n't seem to get social media ( i.e. The Wall Street Journal ) .
But the venerable Associated Press seems to have crossed the line by asking its employees to not only control what they say , but what their friends say .
Now its employee union is fighting back .
Objections to AP's Policy
According to Editor & Publisher , the News Media Guild , which represents 1500 + AP employees and journalists , is speaking out about two items in the new AP social media guidelines , issued last Thursday .
The first policy forbids any talk of AP internal operations .
The second , more objectionable policy requires employees to delete certain things that their friends say on their Facebook page .
Here are the two policies , taken directly out of the AP 's social networking guidelines :
" Q. Anything specific to Facebook ?
It 's a good idea to monitor your profile page to make sure material posted by others does n't violate AP standards ; any such material should be deleted .
Also , managers should not issue friend requests to subordinates , since that could be awkward for employees .
It 's fine if employees want to initiate the friend process with their bosses . "
— — — — — ——
" Q. What are the general guidelines for such accounts ?
Employees must identify themselves as being from the AP if they are using the networks for work in any way .
Posting material about the AP 's internal operations is prohibited on employees ' personal pages , and employees also should avoid including political affiliations in their profiles and steer clear of making any postings that express political views or take stands on contentious issues . "
The News Media Guild 's administrator , Kevin Keane , focused specifically on the Facebook profile policy in his response :
" It is making some people cringe .
It is not appropriate for a company that heralds free speech . "
Finding a Middle Ground
Traditional media outlets have been all over the map with social media .
While organizations like CNN , The New York Times and Gannett Co. have effectively utilized social media , other organizations are either catching up , have n't been consistent , or just have made policies in fear of social technology 's repercussions .
The new AP policy falls in the middle of the spectrum .
At the beginning of the memo , the AP clearly states that they do n't want to quash the use of social media :
" The bottom line is that the company supports social networking as a personal and professional tool , but expects employees to bear in mind how their actions might reflect on the AP . "
And while both policies in question were made with the intention of protecting the AP brand , we 're pretty sure that telling employees that they have to control the content of others is going too far .
What others post on your social profiles should not be grounds for punishment .
You can control what you post , but not what others post .
Asking for that is just too much .
The best option for the Associated Press is to sit down with its employees and address these concerns and create a policy that takes everybody 's interests into account .
Yes , social media can cause embarrassment , but the benefits of fast , direct communication are too much for even the AP to ignore .

Why not ?
Tipped with a sewing machine needle and finished with a tail made from a drinking straw , they looked more like a schoolboy 's toy than a terrifying weapon .
For Britain 's wartime scientists , however , these tiny projectiles were the sharp end of a chilling project to secure victory over the Nazis by bombarding German troops with poisoned darts .
A secret file that details British research to develop the lethal anti-personnel darts , carrying a toxin likely to have been anthrax or ricin , casts rare light on the work that was carried out by the Allies during the Second World War into chemical and biological weapons that could be deployed against Hitler 's forces .
The document , released at the National Archives in Kew , London , reveals how scientists at Porton Down in Wiltshire , the site of Britain 's top secret weapons laboratory , worked between 1941 and 1944 to perfect the projectiles to ensure the maximum number of casualties and the quickest death for enemy soldiers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Entitled Research Into Use of Anthrax and Other Poisons for Biological Warfare , the report said the idea of using darts dated back to the First World War but the novelty of adding a poison , either coated on to a grooved point or injected through a hollow needle , meant that a viable weapon to cause " death or disablement " had been created .
A memo written in 1945 summarising the project said : " The use of poison enables a much lighter dart to be used , since a slight penetration without necessarily piercing a vital organ is all that is required to implant the poison ...
It seems most unlikely that any first aid measure or medical treatment could be devised which would prevent the death of a man who has received a lethal dose . "
The researchers , working in conjunction with Canadian colleagues , developed a dart weighing no more than four grams which could be loaded into bombs carrying 30,600 of the projectiles at a time .
The researchers carried out multiple tests and calculations to work out the chances of hitting troops , ranging from 90 per cent for a soldier lying flat on open ground to just 17 per cent for one lying in a slit trench .
The consequences of being struck were dire .
If a victim failed to pluck out each dart within 30 seconds , he was condemned to a grisly death .
Detailing the effects of ricin , codenamed T1123 , in tests on sheep and goats , one researcher reported : " The symptoms produced are : twitching of the muscles , profuse salivation and sweating , acute defecation , micturition and retching .
The pulse becomes very slow and the blood pressure falls .
The subject collapses and lies on its side with twitching muscles .
Where the dose is lethal , death occurs in 30 minutes , usually preceded by convulsions . "
Attempts by the scientists to perfect their projectile took on a darkly comical dimension when they approached Singer Sewing Machines Ltd , based in Bristol , to supply a variety of differently shaped needles without stating their purpose .
The request was met with bemusement by the company .
In one letter sent in 1941 , an executive wrote : " We are afraid we do not quite understand your requirements .
From your remarks it would seem that the needles are required for some purpose other than sewing machines . "
Despite the assertion of the researchers that their weapon was both more lethal and cheaper to make than conventional bullets , the darts never made it into mass production .
Noting that the projectiles were useless against any form of cover , a senior officer wrote them off as " highly uneconomical " and unlikely to cause mass casualties .
The Northern Ireland civil rights movement may not have been but for Martin Luther King Jr . We remember his most famous speech which took place on this day in 1963 .

Statement of Chairperson Norah Gibbons played a huge role in the work of CICA from the beginning .
She was a driving force in the Confidential Committee serving as Chair and contributed greatly to the Commission overall .
Her major impact on our investigations was only one element of the extensive child and social care responsibilities Norah undertook .
Norah was hard - working and dedicated and she was a pleasure to work with as a colleague .
I know that the other Commissioners and the staff of CICA share my deep sadness at her loss and join me in sending condolences to Norah 's family .

Statement of Chairperson
The Commission ’s report published in May 2009 contains a seriously erroneous statistic according to the general agreement of relevant experts and bodies .
In two places it states that the total number of children who were admitted to Industrial Schools between 1936 and 1970 was approximately 170,000 .
See Volume 1 Chapter 3 Page 41 and the Report at Volume 5 Chapter 2 – Gateways – page 52 Table 1 .
The Commission has had correspondence disputing this total and citing the work of Prof Eoin O’Sullivan among others .
The chairperson has consulted Prof O’Sullivan , Prof David Gwynn Morgan , the Department of Education and Skills and the other Commissioners and is of the view that the number stated in the report is not correct .
It appears that the total given in the report was derived by adding the yearly figures for the population in the institutions but that did not take account of the fact that children were counted in each year of detention .
The statistics provided by the Department cover the period from 1930 and extend beyond 1970 because some institutions continued to operate .
They also refer to Reformatories as well as Industrial Schools .
While it is not possible to establish a precise figure , the Department ’s calculation of the number of children in Industrial Schools and Reformatories from 1930 - 1970 and beyond is approximately 42,000 or somewhat higher .
The statistical information from the Department appears below .
The chairperson has directed that this statement appear on the Commission ’s website .
The Chairperson is happy to acknowledge the role of Dr. Niall Meehan , Faculty Head , Journalism and Media , Griffith College Dublin in raising this issue with the Secretary to the Commission and precipitating the steps that led to the publication of the corrective material .
Department of Education Information
Through its annual statistical reports , the Department of Education published data on the number of committals to and discharges from industrial schools and reformatories – see table N following .
With the exception of deaths that occurred while resident in an institution , children committed to an industrial school or a reformatory and who survived would eventually be discharged from that institution .
It seems reasonable to assume , therefore , that looking at the number of children discharged from the institutions should equate fairly closely to the number of individuals who passed through the schools .
It is noted that there would be a certain element of double counting because of : -
a) The number of children who may have been committed to reformatories on more than one occasion ;
b ) The number of children discharged from one residential institution who may have been admitted to another institution or transferred there on the closure of some institutions .
Table No N : No of children discharged from reformatories and industrial schools between the 1930s and 1970s .

Table No N : Total number of discharges between the 1930s up to 1970
Reformatories Industrial Schools Total 3,796 34,881 38,677
As the format of the statistical report changed during the 1970s , the population of the schools , which was well in decline by then , is given as an estimate only .
The 1969/70 statistical report stated that there were 117 children in reformatory schools at the start of the school year and 1,513 children in industrial schools .
Instead of exact figures , a conservative estimate of the number of children who were committed in the 1970s is 1,500 based on an average number of 150 committals per year .
It would add over 3,000 to the number of children who had been through either the Industrial or reformatory school system bringing the numbers close to 42,000 .
It should be noted that the scheduled institutions which eventually came within the ambit of the Redress Scheme included institutions which were not industrial or reformatory schools : for example , orphanages .
There are no population statistics available for such institutions .
However , it is known that the bulk of applicants to the Redress Board came from industrial and reformatory schools .
Nevertheless , it should be noted that the figure of 42,000 children will be somewhat understated as a result .

Statement of Chairperson , Mr. Justice Sean Ryan on news of the death of Ms. Christine Buckley , institutional abuse campaigner and co-founder of the Aislinn Centre “ I am greatly saddened to learn of the death of Ms Christine Buckley .
Her contribution to the understanding of institutional abuse of children going back for so many years cannot be overestimated .
At considerable personal cost she brought to public attention some of the most painful and disreputable wrongs that happened to children with the authority of the State .
She was an indefatigable champion of those who were abused as children and disbelieved as adults .
Ms Buckley worked tirelessly over many years to achieve justice and she leaves a legacy of achievement .
The nation owes her an enormous debt of gratitude and respect .
On a personal level , Ms Buckley was a pleasure to meet and to deal with .
In difficult and sensitive circumstances in the Child Abuse Commission , she always behaved in a most courteous and professional manner .
My deepest sympathies go to Ms Buckley ’s family on their loss . ”

Vaccine Trials records dismantlement
The Commission has commenced the administrative process that will lead to its eventual closure .
One of the initial stages of this process is the dismantlement of the records of the Vaccine Trials Division of the Commission whose work ceased in 2003 following a High Court ruling that the work of the Division was ultra vires the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 .
A key element of this dismantlement process is the return of records supplied to the Vaccine Trials Division to their original sources .
The Commission has commenced this process .

Settlement of 3rd Party Legal Representation Costs
The Commission wishes to notify all parties who may be entitled to legal representation costs , for matters which were the subject of inquiry by its Investigation Committee , that the deadline for submission of fees , from their legal representatives , is Friday , 28 October , 2011 .
After this time , no costs will be considered or processed by the Commission , which is the statutory body with sole authority in these matters .
The Commission has taken this decision in order to facilitate the timely completion of its work and so it can plan , accordingly , for adequate resources to meet any outstanding liabilities .
The Costs Team will write this week to all solicitors on record with it , if costs have not yet been settled , to advise of this decision .
The Commission published its report in May 2009 and before and since then , has settled legal costs as it went along .
As such , ample time has been allowed to all parties to formulate their reasonable costs .

FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSION
The Commission is finalising its report which is expected to consist of five volumes plus appendices and which will be published , somewhat later than the Commissioners hoped , in mid to late May , 2009 .
The work of the Commission has taken longer than expected .
The Commission has asked the Government to extend the time for publishing the report to the 31st May 2009 and is confident that this deadline will be met .
If it is possible to bring the publication date forward , that will be done but it would be unrealistic to expect much earlier availability .
The Commission was not able until now to make accurate predictions about printing and publication .
The Commissioners are very conscious of the importance and urgency of the report and they appreciate the patience shown by participants and by the public and their understanding of the difficulty and complexity of the Commission 's undertaking .
There will be no significant extra cost because of the extension of time .

NOTICE FOR WEBSITE RE 3rd PARTY LEGAL COSTS
Section 20 A ( 2 ) of the “ Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 ” ( as amended ) , provides that “ the Commission may pay such reasonable costs arising out of the [ 3 rd party legal ] representation …to the person so represented , as are agreed between the Commission and that person … ” .
It is the Commission ’s position that the Act of 2000 only allows for settlement of 3 rd party legal representation costs that accrued since the establishment date of the Commission .
Currently , the Commission is engaged in settling the legal representation costs of the persons referred to in section 20A of the Act .
The Commission considers costs submitted by solicitors and counsel who have acted for complainants or respondents , including
those of the witnesses who attended at the Commission ’s “ Investigation Committee ” proceedings .
There are no legal
representation costs for witnesses who have attended the Commission ’s “ Confidential Committee ” .
However , it is open to the Chairperson of the Commission to hold further hearings if it is deemed necessary in order to complete
the work of the Investigation Committee .
Therefore , the Commission reserves the right to settle 3 rd party legal representation
costs , only at the point it considers a matter “ closed ” .
With reference to Section 20A of the 2000 Act , once the Commission has decided , in principle , to pay a particular set of fees ,
it is statutorily bound to pay only what is reasonable in relation to the legal representation of a person .
Full and final settlement
of the fees will be agreed with a client ’s solicitor ( or be subject to taxation ) , after the Commission ’s Costs Team , including its
Legal Costs Accountant , has extensively scrutinized the work undertaken by the legal representatives .
As such , but without
interfering in the solicitor / client relationship , the Commission considers that once those fees have been accepted by the solicitor ,
no further costs should accrue to the person .
Any questions on the subject of the 3 rd party legal representation costs should be addressed , via your solicitor , to the
Secretary of the Commission .
