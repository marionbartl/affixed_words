Classic Mac OS , as it's now known , had a decade - long honeymoon period .
From its release in 1984 until 1994 , it enjoyed a healthy development life that included several major revisions .
But by 1994 , the limitations of the OS were apparent to technophiles both inside and outside Apple .
Sure , there was a lot of legacy cruft from the 80s in what was then known as System 7 , but the real problems were more fundamental .
These problems were so well - known that I 'm sure anyone who was a " PC enthusiast " back in those days can rattle them off .
Classic Mac OS lacked two very important features .
Say it with me , folks :
Memory protection and preemptive multitasking
In the early 1990s , Apple created the Copland project to add these two features to its operating system .
Yes , a lot of new end - user features were going to be added as well , but memory protection and preemptive multitasking were Copland 's raison d'être .
Funny story — as it turns out , it was n't too easy to add these features to classic Mac OS while also maintaining backward compatibility with existing software .
Oh , and did I mention that Apple switched processor architectures around this time as well ?
By 1996 , the Copland project was dead , and classic Mac OS still lacked memory protection and preemptive multitasking .
Thus began a downward spiral that included several more frantic , abortive attempts to solve Apple 's OS dilemma .
We all know how it ended .
A series of unlikely events led to the return of Steve Jobs and the refashioning of NeXTSTEP into Apple 's new operating system — yes , an operating system with memory protection and preemptive multitasking .
Phew .
So , here we are in 2005 , with several major revisions of Mac OS X behind us .
Maybe we Mac users are feeling a bit smug , knowing that we once again have The Best Operating System™ .
Of course , I felt that way in 1991 when System 7 was released , too .
But a mere five years later , things were going downhill fast .
Hm .
Will Mac OS
X suffer the same fate ?
Surely not , you say .
Mac OS X is The World 's Most Advanced Operating System !
But this is exactly the kind of thinking that lets an OS crisis sneak up on you .
It 's worthwhile to think about what Mac OS X will need in order to remain competitive two , five , even ten years in the future .
Obviously Mac OS
X will need ( and will get ) a ton of new features in the coming decade or so .
The trick is to find the equivalent of " memory protection and preemptive multitasking . "
That is , the features that will be essential in the future , but that are very hard to add while still supporting existing software .
I 'm tempted to make this a two - part post , asking the readers to write their opinions in the comments area first , and then revealing mine in a follow - up post .
But that 'd be cruel ( or lame , take your pick ) , and I 'm sure plenty of people would have the same ideas I do .
Why let them steal my thunder ?
So , here it is .
Here 's what I think will quickly become Mac OS X's most glaring technical limitation , and what could lead to another Copland - style disaster if Apple is n't careful .
Here 's what Mac OS X is missing today that will be very difficult to add later without causing big problems for existing software and developers :
A memory - managed language and API
< cue dramatic music >
Both of Mac OS X's primary application development APIs require the programmer to manually manage memory .
Carbon is a C - based API , and memory management does n't get much more manual than plain - old C these days .
Cocoa uses Objective - C , which abstracts memory management with a retain / release system , but the programmer must still explicitly trigger or schedule these actions .
Under the covers , Objective - C is just a runtime engine on top of C anyway , so it 's no surprise that manual memory management is still part of the development experience .
But why is this a bad thing ?
Does n't manual memory management offer more opportunities for optimization ?
Are n't languages with totally automatic memory management " slower " than their lower - level brethren ?
Yes and yes .
But " more abstracted " is a better way to think of those " slower " languages , and " more abstracted " always wins in the end , especially when it comes to operating systems and application development .
I do n't want to go down the rat - hole of programming language religion , but suffice it to say that languages ( and their associated APIs ) that support automatic memory management are the future of software development .
In fact , in many cases , they 're the present .
Java has made great strides in the server arena , and languages like Perl , Python , and Ruby are coming from the other direction .
C , C++ , and yes , even Objective - C , are being squeezed in the middle .
As was the case with the memory protection and preemptive multitasking crisis , Microsoft is way out ahead on the memory - managed language / API front .
MS has its own new programming language , C# , and is working on an all - new memory - managed API to supplant the venerable C - based Win32 API .
These are both projects that were started years ago , and that are finally coming to fruition today .
Whither Apple ?
Back when C# and the API that would come to be known as WinFX were on the drawing board at Microsoft , Apple was kind of busy trying to finally get over that pesky " memory protection and preemptive multitasking " thing .
Today , Carbon and Cocoa are just settling down ;
Tiger is the first Mac OS X release to be accompanied by a promise from Apple that APIs wo n't be intentionally broken in future releases .
Put bluntly , Apple is way behind here .
Yes , " Copland " behind .
Even if Apple is smart and " borrows " an existing memory - managed programming language ( hello , C# ) , there 's still that pesky API issue .
Apple recently killed their Objective - C/ Java bridge , and with good reason .
Bridges stink .
So forget about an Objective - C/ C# bridge .
And no , do n't talk to me about adding garbage collection to Objective - C .
That is exactly the sort of " half - way " mindset that led to Copland .
No , Apple needs to pull a WinFX and rethink the whole widget , so to speak , from top to bottom .
New APIs are extremely risky and hard to pull off , of course .
Plus , Apple 's just coming off a big transition , moving from the Mac Toolbox to Carbon and , for new development , to Cocoa .
It 's way too soon to even think about another move , right ?
Sure , if you 're a developer .
But if you 're Apple , you 'd damn - well better be thinking about it — not only thinking about it , but beginning work .
Oh yeah , that 's right , there 's some other transition going on right now , is n't there ?
Well , fine , delay the whole memory - managed language / API thing a year or two if necessary .
But someone , somewhere at Apple had better be thinking long and hard about this issue .
If Apple does get itself into another Copland - style jam around 2010 , I 'm not sure there 'll be any pre-fab " modern operating systems " hanging around for them to purchase and refurbish this time .

Saddam Hussein was hanged at the weekend
Mobile phone footage showed Saddam being told to " go to hell " by people attending the hanging , while the ex-leader mocks their " bravery " .
Mr Prescott said those responsible for the scenes should be " ashamed " , without saying if that included the Iraqi government which organised the hanging .
Iraq 's government has now begun an inquiry into Saturday 's events .
' Totally unacceptable '
Mr Prescott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " I think the manner was quite deplorable really .
" Frankly , to get this kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves . "
Prime Minister Tony Blair , currently on holiday in Florida , has been criticised by Labour MPs opposed to the Iraq War for refusing to make an official statement about the execution .
To get this kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves
John Prescott
Deputy prime minister
Glenda Jackson branded his lack of public reaction " amazing " , while Peter Kilfoyle said it was " yet another error in a long catalogue " on Iraq .
Downing Street said Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett had spoken " on behalf of the whole government " when she gave her reaction to Saddam Hussein 's death at the weekend .
She said Saddam had been " held to account " , but added : " We do not support the use of the death penalty ... we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime . "
The silent , official film released after the execution showed a subdued Saddam Hussein .
But the other footage , believed to have been filmed on a mobile phone , shows a charged , angry scene .
Unlike the official film , it shows the moment that the gallows trapdoor opens .
The amateur footage first appeared on websites and then excerpts began airing on major news channels .
The authorities fear the secret footage could contribute to a dramatic rise in sectarian tensions between Iraq 's Sunni and Shia communities .
" There were a few guards who shouted slogans that were inappropriate and that 's now the subject of a government investigation , " an adviser to Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , Sami al - Askari , told Reuters news agency .
' Wrong to interfere '
The official line from UK government ministers has been that they oppose the death penalty - but say the decision to execute Saddam was one for Iraq 's government to take .
The Bishop of Lichfield , the Rt Revd Jonathan Gledhill , said Saddam 's hanging " cannot be called unjust " .
In a statement , he added : " For many criminals death is in fact a greater mercy than life - long imprisonment ...
Anyone who deliberately murders another human being immediately forfeits his or her own right to life .
" If Saddam Hussein had a fair trial and proper opportunity to appeal , his execution cannot be called unjust . "
The Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams , had demanded a " sharp and unequivocal punishment " for Saddam but not death .
" I would say of him what I have to say about anyone who has committed even the most appalling crimes in this country , that I believe the death penalty effectively says there is no room for change and repentance , " he told the BBC .

I ’m still really jazzed that the systemic users detected Gl 581 c prior to its discovery announcement .
A dramatic ESO press release “ Artist ’s impression ” of the Gl 581 system is all over the web today .
It shows a planet that appears quite dry , clearly drawing on a model of in - situ formation from silicates and iron .
In all likelihood , however , the planet migrated from beyond the snowline in Gl 581 ’s protostellar disk .
It likely contains at least an Earth ’s mass worth of water , and the view from space would show the upper layers of a deep and stormy atmosphere .
Jonathan Langton is running hydrodynamical simulations to try to get a sense of what the weather is like on this world , and we ’re hoping to have an animation up very shortly .
( See this brief description of yesterday ’s splash image ) .
Image Source .
One of my pet peeves is that it ’s possible to produce far more accurate and photo - realistic press release images of extrasolar planets than is usually done .
Artist ’s impressions generally veer toward being luxuriously long on depicting what we do n’t know and rudely short when it comes to presenting what we do know .
At the JPL Cassini / Huygens website , there is a trove of photos taken by the orbiter showing Saturn and its moons from different vantages and illumination conditions .
The photos below were taken from a location near the ring plane , and show Rhea and Enceladus .
The two pictures were taken one minute apart as Enceladus ( 314 miles in diameter ) is occulted by the larger Rhea ( 949 miles across ) as seen from the spacecraft .
This sequence of photos makes the most of the kinds of information that we do know about extrasolar planets , namely the system geometry , the relative sizes , the orbital dynamics , and the illumination .
Note how the night side of Enceladus is eerily lit by the unseen Saturn .
These particular photos , furthermore , are effortlessly discrete with respect to what we do n’t know about extrasolar planets , namely the geological details of the surfaces .
In the absence of concrete information , the surface is perhaps better left either to the mind ’s eye or to the moment when we get the real image .
In Cassini ’s glorious up - close view , Enceladus was revealed to be far more bizarre and interesting than anyone had imagined :
The lighting in the Gl 581 press release image is pretty weird .
We ’re looking straight at the parent star , and yet planet “ c ” is seen in quarter phase , illuminated by a source of white light placed to the right of the scene .
The star , however , is thought to be single .
The dynamic range of illumination in the scene is way off as well .
If we ’re looking straight at a star , then the field of view is completely flooded , saturated with light , and replete with lens flares .
Planets are always lost in the glare if you ’re looking straight at a star .
Since any view of a star is seen through an optical system , I think it should be possible to achieve a better sense of optical dynamical range by correctly applying lens flares .
Over the next year , we ’ll be looking into this in much more depth .
Image Source .
This website has an interesting discussion of how to correctly render the colors of stars .
Dynamic range aside , and assuming that the star is a 3000 K blackbody radiator ( which is n’t quite right , but is a reasonably good approximation ) the color should be a lighter shade of orange .
As drawn , the color is more appropriate to the night - side glow of a hot Jupiter .
What about the perspective in the scene ?
At first glance , it looks like Gl 581 “ b ” might have been drawn a little too large .
Using the information in table 1 of the Udry et al. preprint , and adopting a 1.7 Earth - diameter size for “ c ” , a Neptune - size for “ b ” , and 0.3 solar diameters for Gl 581 itself , we can draw the orbits and sizes of the planets to scale and almost have it fit correctly in an image that fits on the blog .
( You may want to make your browser window wider ) :
In reality , because of pixelation , the tiny dots showing the planets are a bit larger than they should be .
Ellipses are circles seen from an angle , so by applying a 1 - dimensional re-scale with Adobe Illustrator , we can view the system to scale from a long distance away :
When I ’m looking at the ESO press release image on my computer screen , the planet measures 7.5 cm across , and is located 45 cm from my eye .
It subtends an angle of 9.5 degrees at the vantage from which its being viewed .
The point of view is thus located 11 planetary radii above the surface of the planet , and drawn to scale , the geometry in the image looks like this :
As viewed from the skies of planet “ c ” , planet “ b ” subtends an angle of 36 arc minutes , and remarkably , would appear just slightly larger than the Moon appears from Earth .
The parent star , on the other hand would subtend 2.3 degrees of the sky , which is about ~ 4.6 times larger than the Sun appears in our sky .
( Given that Gl 581 “ c ” is in a habitable orbit , and given that the star is a red dwarf , it ’s absolutely necessary to have the star fill more of the sky . )
With this information , we can draw the correct angular sizes of the star and the planet “ b ” as seen from the vantage of the drawing .
The planet “ b ” should be somewhat smaller than drawn , and the star should be somewhat larger .
On the balance , however , the angular sizes are n’t that far away from being correct .
Hello applicant : I ’m very sorry , but I do n’t have good news about the job opening here at BigCo .
We really liked meeting you , but the bottom line is that you do n’t have a degree from the right kind of University . —
— What ’s that you say ?
You have learned an awful lot about writing software during the four years that you were n’t carting textbooks around the campus ?
My dear applicant , thanks for pointing out the obvious I can read , you know .
I was impressed by the list of projects you have completed .
I even took an extra thirty seconds to Google your name and enjoyed the screen shots and links on your home page .
But nevertheless , University teaches you things above and beyond how to write code .
And that ’s what we need here at BigCo . —
— I beg your pardon ?
You think that you have learned just as much about communication , teamwork , and project management from shipping software in small teams as you would have learned completing coursework ?
Please do n’t take this personally , but I need a moment to chuckle .
Ok , I ’m done .
University is n’t about communication , teamwork , or project management .
If you happen to learn those things , that ’s a bonus .
I was thinking of something else . —
— Look , I admire your enthusiasm , but if you ’d let me do a little of the talking I could tell you what we need .
But since you bring it up , no I was n’t thinking of any of that Computer Science stuff .
Just in case you ’re thinking of referring any of your friends to BigCo , please let them know that if they learned why S , K , I , and Y are the most important letters in the alphabet , they need not apply .
Ever .
To paraphrase Eric Beck , “ At either end of the educational spectrum there lies a hacker class . ”
And we are not interested in hackers , even great hackers .
We need those middle of the spectrum folks who are going to live in the suburbs , commute to our offices , and do a decent job for a fair wage week after week , year after year .
Quite honestly , the very fact that you passed on University tells us something disturbing about you .
Quite obviously you are n’t stupid .
And you knew that people like us would have a problem with your lack of education .
But you believed in your heart of hearts that you could make up for this with excellence .
But you know what ?
That same attitude might have you think “ It ’ll look bad if I quit this job in less than five years , but I ’ll make up for it . ”
That kind of attitude makes you a little fearless .
And while we try our best to build a decent working environment , we like our people to be just a little afraid of leaving the nice security blanket we give them .
This may come as a surprise to you , but we ’re looking for people who are looking for us .
Of course we know that the educational component of University is a waste .
We would n’t have it any other way .
Like hazing rituals and wearing dark suits to work in August , attending a certain kind of University is a statement that you want to belong , that you know there is no practical purpose to the exercise but that you are prepared to make the sacrifice just to fit in .
And you , dear applicant , would not fit in .
Let me stress this point about what kind of University .
We are n’t talking about some aerie faerie place where you build robots or spend your free time writing business plans .
Those places exist to skim the cream off the top so we can hire a plain glass of 1 % milk .
As a matter of fact , the kind of University we like discourages you from dreaming about the future and keeps your feet firmly planted in the ground .
For example , our favourite institutes of higher learning send you to work for companies like ours on work terms .
This provides us with cheap labour and has the pleasant side - effect of discouraging the more creative undergraduates from wasting everybody ’s time by coming to work for us . —
— Look , I really have to go , and I do n’t want this call to end on a down note .
There are lots of happy people in this world , and most have never even heard of BigCo , much less come to work here .
So please consider this a redirection instead of a rejection .
I know that ’s trite , but it ’s no less true just because it has a memorable rhyming form .
It ’s not you , it ’s us .
The plain fact is , you would n’t be happy here .
So buck up , look around , and see if you can get yourself into something a little more early stage .
Consider starting your own company .
Because quite honestly ?
I ’d read your business plan any day .
Your résumé would look better on top of a funding proposal than under a cover letter .
Good luck out there .

As most people know , the NFL does n't want you to use the word " Superbowl " when hosting a party , sale , event , etc , and they aggressively enforce their trademark on this term .
In response , since all the country does in fact have parties , sales , events , etc. associated with the Superbowl , folks have adopted the euphemism ' the big game " in their communications .
I observed that this not only pointed out some of the silliness in our intellectual property laws , but also was counter - productive for the NFL -- should n't they want people talking about and holding events for the Superbowl ?
I suggested a simple licensing program that would raise a little money and probably work better for everyone :
The NFL needs to offer a one time use license each year for a bar or
other establishment to hold a Superbowl party and actually use
Superbowl in the promotion .
The license would of course be
non-exclusive , and would carry a myriad of restrictions on how you use
the name , etc .
The license could be purchased for a price that would
be cheap for a business , maybe $ 200 , and could be purchased right over
the web .
It would actually be easier , I think , to go after violators
because the NFL could point to the existence of a legal licensing
program the violator could easily have participated in .
I would think
they could easily bring in a couple of million dollars , not to mention
saving them enforcement money and PR headaches .
The NFL has decided to go in a different direction .
It is trying to trademark the term " the big game " so that term can't be used either ( HT Overlawyered ) .
I particularly liked this from the application :
Disclaimer NO CLAIM IS MADE TO THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE " GAME " APART FROM THE MARK AS SHOWN
Jeez , why not ?
Who at the NFL is sleeping on the job here ?
Well , that 's what I get as a libertarian for trying to work within the system to make things incrementally better rather than going on one of my usual idealistic rants .
So I officially withdraw my previous suggestion in favor of a new one : Trademarks should , at most , only give one the protection from someone else labeling a similar product with the trademarked name .
By trademarking Jif , P&G gets protection from another company selling peanut butter under the same name in the US .
However , any other use of Jif in communication should be entirely legal .
If I communicate to people that I am having Jif party , that communication is protected under the first amendment and P&G can't shut down my party .
If I want to put out a poster and sell it with Jif peanut butter labels and how they have changed over the past 100 years , I should have the right to do so .
Ditto if I want to print bumper stickers that say " Jif sucks . "
Similarly , the NFL can be legally protected from having another group host a football game ( and if I am in a generous mood , maybe any type of sporting event ) and calling it the Superbowl .
And that is it .
They should not be granted an exclusive government monopoly to use the word Superbowl , or more ludicrously , " the big game " :
posters , calendars , trading cards , series
of non-fiction books relating to football ; magazines relating to
football , newsletters relating to football , notepads , stickers , bumper
stickers , paper pennants ; greeting cards ; printed tickets to sports
games and events ; pens and pencils , note paper , wrapping paper , paper
table cloths , paper napkins , printed paper party invitations , paper
gift cards ; paper party decorations , collectible cards ; collectible
card and memorabilia holders , souvenir programs for sports events , ... toys and sporting goods , namely , plush toys , stuffed toy
animals , play figures , golf balls , footballs , sport balls , toy banks ,
playing cards , Christmas tree ornaments ...
Men's , women 's and children 's apparel , namely T - shirts , fleece tops , caps , headwear
And do n't even get me started on Pat Riley 's " Threepeat . "
Impression :
The adult would have been about 2 m in length
More details
The 95 - million - year - old bones are from an adult and two juveniles and were unearthed in a chamber at the end of a 2.1 m - long sediment - filled tunnel .
The researchers say the discovery is the first definitive evidence that some dinosaurs dug dens and cared for their young in such structures .
Details are reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
" Burrowing also represents a mechanism by which small dinosaurs may have exploited the extreme environments of polar latitudes , deserts and high mountain areas , " Dr David Varricchio and colleagues tell the publication .
The team has been commended for its diligence
The team says the species ' snout , shoulder girdle and pelvis have features one would expect to see in an animal that dug into the ground .
Judging from the preserved vertebrae , the adult would have been about 2.1 m ( 6.8 ft ) from nose to tail , with the major part of that ( about 1.2 m ; 3.9ft ) being the tail itself .
The estimated width of the animal fits neatly with the size of the tube it was digging ( about 30 cm ; 1 ft in diameter ) .
What is left of the tunnel structure is sloping and has two sharp turns before ending in a chamber .
The team says its architecture is similar to the dens of modern burrowers , such as the striped hyena , puffin and some rodents .
The dinosaur remains were covered in the coarse - grained sediment from an ancient flood ; but Dr Varricchio , of Montana State University , said this did not explain the animals ' deaths .
" The bones are disarticulated ; they are not in life position , " he told BBC News .
The scientists found the dinosaur fossils inside a den
Commenting on the discovery , Professor Kevin Padian from the Museum of Palaeontology , University of California - Berkeley , said the Montana team should be commended for the detailed way in which it went about its work .
Many would have missed the significance of the tunnel , he said
" This discovery is first and foremost a testament to the value of keeping one 's eyes open in the field and noticing everything , and it took a special group of scientists to realise the meaning of the discovery that they made , " he added .
Professor Padian bemoaned the impact of commercial fossil hunting which , he claimed , sought to get specimens out of the ground as fast as possible , often destroying valuable scientific information in the process .

Seminal Studies In Social Psychology
( Click these links to skip down the page )
Asch S. E. ( 1956 ) Studies of independence and conformity
Sherif M. ( 1956 ) Experiments in inter -group conflict .
Festinger and Carlsmith ( 1959 ) Cognitive consequences of forced compliance
Asch S. E. ( 1956 ) Studies of independence and conformity
Solomon E. Asch was born in Warsaw , Poland , on September 14 , 1907 .
He came to the United States in 1920 and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1932 .
His mentor there was the gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer .
On joining Swarthmore College he spent the next 19 years working with another notable gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Kohler .
Asch was assisted in his work into conformity by a young Stanley Milgram , who himself was later to achieve worldwide fame with his studies into obedience to authority .
What is conformity ?
Conformity is any change in a person 's behaviour or opinions as a result of real or imagined pressure from a person or group of people ( Keegan , 2004 ) .
Asch said that conformity should be measured in terms of our tendency to give the wrong answer on a task where the solution is obvious or unambiguous .
This was because of a criticism levelled at an earlier study done by Sherif ( 1935 ) called the Autokinetic Effect .
Regards this , Asch and others thought Sherif 's task ambiguous , and that this ambiguity influenced the degree of individual conformity shown .
Asch and Conformity
ASCH , S.E. Studies of independence and conformity : a minority of one against a unanimous majority .
Psychological Monographs , 1956 , 70 .
Aim
The aim of these studies was to investigate conformity in a group situation .
Method
Laboratory experiment
Independent variable :
There were various manipulations of the IV .
Main one involved stooges giving a wrong answer on the size of a line at particular points ( critical trials ) during the experiment .
Other manipulations included the changing the size of the group ; whether a stooge ( dissenter ) disagreed with the majority ; and whether the adjudging line task took place in private or public .
Initially in a pilot study Asch tested 36 participants INDIVIDUALLY on 20 presentations of stimuli like the one below .
When asked to compare and identify the standard line with the three A , B , C comparison lines only three mistakes were made in 720 trials ( 0.42 error rate ) .
The purpose of the pilot was to ascertain that the task was both simple and unambiguous .
This procedure in social psychology is known as the Asch Paradigm .
Some of his participants were than asked to take part in the main experiment , but this time in a group .
They were told that the group was to have a ' naïve ' participant who would not know that they were stooges .
On certain critical trials , of which there were 12 , Asch secretly signalled the stooges to give the same wrong answer .
These were interspersed by 6 neutral ( right answer ) trials , giving 18 trials in all .
50 naïve participants were recruited .
Dependent variable :
The occurrence of a conformity response by naïve participants when the critical trials occurred .
Procedure
Naïve participant is brought into lab with 7 - 9 stooges
Seated last , or last but one , at a straight or round table
Asked to make a judgment about line length .
In 12 of 18 trials stooges gave wrong answer .
NB DV is whether participant concurs .
Results
Asch found a mean conformity rate of 32 % over all trials .
No one conformed on all of the critical trials
Of the 50 naïve participants who took part 13 ( 20 % ) never conformed
1 conformed on eleven of 12 critical trials
38 conformed at least once on 12 critical trials
In further studies using his Asch Paradigm he discovered other variables that affect group conformity
Size of group : as group size increases to 3 others , conformity increases .
After that , little change .
One naïve participant , one stooge : 3 % conformity .
One naïve participant , two stooges : 14 % conformity .
One naïve participant , three stooges : 32 % conformity ( confirmed results of original experiment above ) .
Unanimity : Presence of one dissenter amongst the stooges decreases conformity immensely .
Privacy :
The more private the setting the naïve participant is allowed to give their answer ( e.g. writing it down / behind a screen ) the less conformity there was ( 12.5 % ) .
Why ?
When asked why they had conformed naïve participants reported the following :
To convey a good impression of himself or herself to the experimenter .
Not to upset the experimenter .
Some genuinely believed their eyesight had suddenly got worse and that the stooges therefore must be right .
Not to look inferior .
Not to be a social outcast .
These participants had a private belief that the stooges were wrong but kept it to themselves .
To be like everyone else , to appear part of the group .
For any Freudians reading this you will be interested to discover that some later denied they had conformed , when clearly they had !
( Asch was himself an admirer of Freud ) .
Variables Asch found That Increase / Decrease Conformity
Decrease : lack of unanimity
Decrease : induce individual to make commitment to their initial judgment
Decrease : high - self esteem individuals
Decrease :
Whether you come from an Individualistic or Collective culture
Decrease : feeling of security in a group
Increase : perceived expert power
Increase : similarity of group to the individual
What Others Say
Eiser ( 1987 ) says ' for Asch , the important finding was that there was any conformity at all . '
This study become a classic and is to be found in all texts on psychology .
However , studies carried out from 1980 onwards have undermined this classic status - or at least preferred alternative explanations for the amount of conformity found .
Perrin and Spencer ( 1980 , 1981 ) suggested that the Asch effect was a " child of its time " .
They carried out an exact replication of the original Asch experiment using engineering , mathematics and chemistry students as subjects .
The results were clear - cut : on only one out of 396 trials did an observer join the erroneous majority .
They argue that a cultural change has taken place in the value placed on conformity and obedience and in the position of students .
In America in the 1950s students were unobtrusive members of society whereas now they occupy a free questioning role .

Nicholson et al. were more positive .
They found while the number of error responses obtained was significantly less that those reported by Asch , it was also significantly greater than zero ( 12 out of the UK sample of 38 and 8 of the US sample of 21 conformed at least once ) .
British and American students did not differ in their responses to unanimous peer - group opinion .

' Asch fails again ' .
Social Behaviour and Personality ; 18 (1 ) 7 - 12 .
Lalancette and Standing modified the social conformity paradigm of Asch ( 1956 ) to ( 1 ) make the test stimuli more ambiguous and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood of obtaining conformity in an experiment with 40 undergraduates .
With the same aim , anonymous and individuated conditions were used .
As with a previous attempt to replicate Asch ( Perrin and Spencer , 1981 ) , no conformity was observed .
They conclude that the Asch effect appears to be an unpredictable phenomenon rather than a stable tendency of human behaviour .

' Conformity and independence revisited ' .
Social Behaviour and Personality , 23 ( 3 ) , 217-222
This study aimed at investigating whether conformity in the experimental setting suggested by Asch was particularly related to American culture and less likely to be replicable elsewhere - e.g. in Portugal - as has been suggested more recently .
Thus ,
Asch 's classic conformity and independence experiment was replicated , using women psychology students in a Portuguese university as minority of one , unanimous majority group , and control participants .
The original procedure was re-enacted as similarly as possible using a computer program .
Among participants in the experimental condition 59 % conformed at least once , 28 % yielded three to twelve times .
Among participants in the control condition 27 % erred at least once , 3.3 % made more than three errors .
The differences between the experimental and control group was significant .
Thus this shows that a degree of conformity to a unanimous peer - group opinion remains observable .
Participants reported considerable distress under the group pressure .
Sherif M. ( 1956 ) Experiments in inter -group conflict .
Introduction and Overview
Muzafer Sherif is a famous social psychologist important to the psychological understanding of groups and its members .
His main contribution is known as Realistic Conflict Theory , and accounts for group conflict , negative prejudices , and stereotypes as being the result of competition between groups for desired resources .
Sherif validated his theory in one his most famous experiments , " The Robber 's Cave "
In this field experiment , 22 white , fifth grade ( P7/S1 ) , 11 - year - old boys with average - to - good school records , and above average intelligence were sent to a special remote summer camp in Oklahoma , Robbers Cave State Park .
They all shared a Protestant , two - parent background .
The remoteness of the part ensured that the study remained free from external influences and that the true nature of conflict and prejudice could be studied .
None of the boys knew each other prior to the study .
The researchers randomly divided the boys into two different groups , and assigned them cabins far apart from each other .
During this first phase , the groups did not know of the other group 's existence .
The boys developed an attachment to their groups throughout the first week of the camp by doing various activities together like hiking , swimming , etc .
The boys chose names for their groups , The Eagles and The Rattlers , and stencilled them onto shirts and flags .
At this point , the next part of the study began .
Sherif set up a four - day series of competitions between the groups , and promised trophies , medals , and camping knives to the winners .
As the competition progressed , prejudice began to become apparent between the two groups .
At first , this prejudice was only verbally expressed , such as taunting or name - calling .
As the competition wore on , this expression took a more direct route .
The Eagles burned the Rattler 's flag .
Then the next day , the Rattler 's ransacked The Eagle 's cabin , overturned beds , and stole private property .
The groups became so aggressive with each other that the researchers had to physically separate them .
During the subsequent two - day cooling off period , the boys listed features of the two groups .
The boys tended to characterize their own in - group in very favourable terms , and the other out - group in very unfavourable terms .
Sherif then attempted to reduce the prejudice , or inter - group conflict , shown by each group .
However , simply increasing the contact of the two groups only made the situation worse .
This was because they noised each other up even more !
Alternatively forcing the groups to work together to reach common goals , eased prejudice and tension among the groups .
This experiment confirmed Sherif 's realistic conflict theory .
The study itself : The Robbers Cave Experiment
In the mid-1950 's Muzafer Sherif and others carried out the Robbers Cave experiment on intergroup conflict and co-operation as a part of research programme at the University of Oklahoma .
This large - scale Intergroup Relations Project was established as an interdisciplinary " psychological " and " sociological " approach to the testing of a number of hypotheses about intergroup relations .
The hypotheses tested were :
(1) When individuals who do n't know each other are brought together to interact in group activities in order to achieve common goals , they will produce a group structure with hierarchical statuses and roles within it .
(2) When two in - groups , once formed , are brought into functional relationship under conditions of competition and group frustration , attitudes and appropriate hostile actions in relation to the out - group and its members will arise ; these will be standardised and shared in varying degrees by group members .
The experiment initially called for the selection of 24 boys of about 12 years of age from similar , settled , lower middle - class Protestant backgrounds .
They were to be well adjusted psychologically , of normal physical development , and in the same year at school .
In the event 22 such young persons were selected and were randomly divided by the researchers into two groups , with efforts being made to balance the physical , mental and social talents of the groups .
They were then , as individual groups , picked up by bus on successive days in the summer of 1954 and transported to a 200 acre Boy Scouts of America camp in the Robbers Cave State Park in Oklahoma .
At the camp the groups were kept separate from each other and were encouraged to bond as two individual groups through the pursuit of common goals that required co-operative discussion , planning and execution .
As expected , and in line with the findings of earlier studies , over the initial five or six day " first stage " of the experiment the two groups of boys tended to individually generate their own acceptance of common membership and their own status hierarchies .
One group adopted spontaneously name of " The Rattlers " and the other similarly the name of " The Eagles . "
As each group became aware of the presence of the other group the boys become reinforced regards being in a particular group and defensive about the camp facilities that their group enjoyed , and that the other group might be " abusing . "
Both groups were happy to encourage the camp staff ( i.e. the researchers ) to arrange some sort of competition against the other .
Performance in all activities like tent pitching , baseball , etc. was entered into with more zest and also with more efficiency .
The researches now arranged Stage Two or the Competition Stage where friction between the groups was to occur over the next 4 - 6 days .
In this phase it was intended to bring the two groups into competition with each other in conditions that would create frustration between them .
A series of competitive activities were arranged with a trophy being awarded on the basis of accumulated team score .
There were also individual prizes for the winning group such as a medal and a multi- bladed pocketknife with no consolation prizes being given to the " losers . "
The Rattlers ' reaction to the informal announcement of a series of contests was absolute confidence in their victory !
They spent the day talking about the contests and making improvements on the ball field , which they took over as their own to such an extent that they spoke of putting a " Keep Off " sign there !
They ended up putting their Rattler flag on the pitch .
At this time , several Rattlers made threatening remarks about what they would do if anybody from The Eagles bothered their flag .
When the two competing groups were brought together for the first time in the mess hall there was considerable name - calling , teasing , and singing of derogatory songs by each group in turn .
Before supper that evening , some Eagles expressed a desire not to eat with the Rattlers .
Following on from this the groups showed disrespect for each other 's flags ( i.e. each group actually felt moved to burn the others flag ) , and they also raided each other 's cabins .
After the Eagles , with the discreet connivance of the researchers , won the contest the Rattlers raided their cabin again , and removed any medals or pocket - knives they could find !
In the row that ensued the Rattlers and the Eagles almost came to blows .
The names , which had previously been routinely hurled back and forth ( " stinkers , " " braggers , " " sissies , " and many considerably worse ) now intensified .
Derogation of the out - group was expressed in word and deed e.g. holding noses when in their vicinity .
Now also both groups objected to eating in the same mess hall at the same time .
The researchers now embarked upon Stage Three , or the Integration Phase , which was intended to dispel the present state of friction and was intended to last some 6 - 7 days .
There were to be a number of improvised , and hopefully reconciliatory , get - to - know - you opportunities such as a bean - collecting contest , or the showing of a film , or the shooting of Firecrackers to celebrate the fourth of July .
In the event this series of reconciliatory opportunities did not lead to any appreciable lessening of tensions between the Eagles and the Rattlers .
Several such get - to - know - you opportunities ended in food fights .
Sherif et al. concluded that such contrived contact opportunities were not going to lessen tensions between the groups .
They now arranged for the introduction of a number of scenarios presenting superordinate goals which could not be easily ignored by members of the two antagonistic groups , but the attainment of which was beyond the resources and efforts of one group alone .
These scenarios were played out at a new location in the belief that this would tend to inhibit recall of grievances that had been experienced at Robbers Cave .
The Drinking Water Problem :
The first superordinate goal to be introduced concerned a common resource used by both groups .
Their water supply , which had suddenly stopped flowing .
All of the drinking water in the camp came from a reservoir on the mountain north of the camp .
The water supply had failed and the Camp staff blamed this on " vandals . "
Upon investigations of the extensive water lines by the Eagles and the Rattlers as separate groups , they discovered that an outlet faucet had a sack stuffed into it .
Almost all the boys gathered around the faucet to try to clear it .
Suggestions from members of both groups concerning effective ways to unblock the obstruction were thrown in from all sides simultaneously which led to cooperative efforts clearing the obstacle itself .
The joint work on the faucet lasted over 45 minutes .
When the water finally came on there was common rejoicing .
The Rattlers did not object to having the Eagles get ahead of them when they all got a drink , as the Eagles did not have canteens with them and were thirstier .
No protests or " Ladies first " type of remarks were made !
The Problem of Securing a Movie :
The next superordinate goal to be introduced was a favourite feature - length movie for boys of their age .
Two films had been chosen in consultation with children 's movie experts and brought to the camp along with other stimulus materials .
In the afternoon , the boys were called together and the staff suggested the possibility of watching either " Treasure Island " or " Kidnapped " : Both groups yelled approval of these films .
After some discussion , one Rattler said , " Everyone that wants Treasure Island raise their hands . "
The majority of members in both groups gave enthusiastic approval to " Treasure Island " even though a few dissensions were expressed to this choice .
Then the staff announced that securing the film would cost $ 15 and the camp could not pay the whole sum !
After much discussion it was suggested that both groups would pay $ 3.50 and the camp would pay the balance .
This was accepted even though , as a couple of homesick Eagles had gone home , the contribution per person per group was unequal .
At supper that night there were no objections to eating together .
Some scuffling and sticking chewing gum on each other occurred between members of the two groups , but it involved fewer boys on both sides than were usually involved in such encounters .
Other problem - solving superordinate goals introduced in this phase included the joint use of a tug - of - war - rope , and both groups of boys ' accidentally ' coming across a stuck - in - a - rut truck that was carrying food for both groups .
In the event the joint pursuit of such superordinate goals saw a lessening of intergroup conflict .
At breakfast and lunch on the last day of camp , the seating arrangements were considerably mixed up insofar as group membership was concerned .
The majority of the boys agreed by the last day that it would be a good thing to return to Oklahoma City together on one bus .
When they asked if this was possible , and were told yes by the staff , some of the boys actually cheered .
When the bus pulled out , the seating arrangement did not follow group lines .
Just before the bus pulled into the town where a refreshment stop was planned , a Rattler asked if they still had the five - dollar reward they had won in the bean contest .
Others repeated this inquiry when the boys were at the refreshment stand , and the Rattler leader suggested that their five dollars be spent on soft drinks for all the boys in both groups .
Several Rattlers nearby agreed ; and the others approved the idea when asked .
This meant that drinks for all the boys were paid for with the five dollars contributed by the Rattlers , though each boy paid for sandwiches and other treats himself .

Introduction and Overview
Cognitive Consistency
Theory proposes that people are motivated to change and act consistently with their beliefs , values , and perceptions when there is psychological inconsistency or disagreement between two pieces of information .
The conflict between the inconsistent factors produces cognitive dissonance .
Cognitive dissonance arises when faced with two conflicting pierces of information because we begin to doubt previously held thoughts , beliefs , or values .
These doubts produce uncomfortable feelings and may interfere with our ability to act .
The pros and cons of each factor are examined .
The resolution of dissonance occurs when one factor is seen by us as more attractive than the other .
Prior to the resolution of dissonance , the dilemma between the conflicting factors prevents action .
When dissonance is resolved , the person is better able to act in accordance with the more attractive factor because beliefs , values , and perceptions agree with the behaviour .
This modern theory of motivation contained in Festinger 's Cognitive Consistency Theory ( 1957 ) illustrates that commitment to a decision is the beginning , not the end of conflict .
Festinger and Carlsmith ( 1959 ) .
Cognitive consequences of forced compliance .
Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology , 58 , 203-210 .
If you want to buy a man 's beliefs , how much should you pay him ?
Festinger and Carlsmith , social psychologists at Stanford University , explored this question in 1956 .
The following aspects of cognitive dissonance were investigated by way of laboratory experiment and interview .
That when an individual is forced to act in a manner that is contrary to his private attitude , he will experience dissonance .
That when external forces which compel him to act contrary to his attitudes are overwhelmingly strong , the total magnitude of dissonance will be minimal ; if the forces are weak , or just barely strong enough to induce him to act , or behave they way he does , dissonance will be maximal .
That one way to reduce dissonance is for the individual to change his attitude to correspond with his action / behaviour .
Since the pressure to reduce dissonance is related to the magnitude of it , Festinger and Carlsmith thought that attitude change should be greatest when the force used to induce the action / behaviour is just minimally sufficient .
Three groups of 20 undergraduate students each were used as participants .
There were three conditions of the independent variable .
In the " One - Dollar " group , the subjects were first required to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks .
They were then hired by the experimenter as an " assistant " and paid one dollar to tell a waiting fellow student that the tasks were enjoyable and interesting !
In the " Twenty - Dollar " group , the subjects were hired for twenty dollars to do the same thing .
Control subjects merely performed the monotonous tasks .
A post experimental interview was then held to learn the participants ' attitudes toward the tasks .
The interviewer was identified as a member of the psychology department who was conducting a study of the experiments in which elementary psychology students were required as participants .
The true purpose of the interview was to get valid expressions of the subjects ' private attitudes .
The results confirmed cognitive dissonance theory .
The One - Dollar subjects had persuaded themselves that the tasks were really interesting and enjoyable .
The Twenty - Dollar subjects had not changed their private opinions ( as compared against the control group ) .
Like the control group they too thought it was incredibly boring , but as they got $ 20 for it , who gave a s***!
Why windows takes so long to start up .
.
Most of us have had a brand new computer at one time .
It ’s a great feeling .
You boot up windows and within 30 seconds you are surfing the net , checking your email , or playing your favorite game .
10 months down the road things are n’t so nice anymore .
You power up your computer and it seems to take forever to load .
Even when you are careful about what you install it seems that each day it takes longer for it to boot .
It ’s not your imagination – and there are a couple of good tips to keep your boot time short and sweet .
As always – backup your system before you start any of this .
If you make a mistake you might need to restore from backup
Update ( 09/08/2006 ) –
There has been some controversy about the prefetch folder .
I think this issue needs to be looked into .
I did have a reputable source for this information :
It was the “ Windows XP Annoyances ” book by O’Reilly .
Page 210 .
Titled “ Keeping an eye on prefetch ”
1 . The prefetch cache
The first tip I want to talk about is the windows prefetch .
Windows XP has this feature that loads commonly used programs – at boot time .
Here is how it works : Yesterday you used MS Word , and Duke Nukem 3D .
Today you boot your system to check e-mail .
It sees parts of these two programs in the prefetch folder and loads them into memory before windows completes the boot process .
The benefit is faster application launch times .
If you really wanted to use MS Word , it would pop up really quick when you double clicked on it .
The problem is most people have been running windows for years , and the prefetch gets clogged with stuff that you almost never use .
Windows takes forever to boot because it is prefetching a 1.0 copy of Napster , and you just want to check your email before you have to go to work .
What can be done about it ?
Well there are a few things we can do to tweak the prefetch cache .
One method is to disable it partially , and this can be done quite easily .
Simply browse to the windows folder ( Ex : C : \Windows ) and under there you should see the prefetch folder .
Go into the prefetch folder and delete all the files ( Careful !
It should look like this c:\windows \prefetch )
And here is a screenshot of one if you still have questions
The first thing to note is the next reboot will be slow .
This is because windows needs to relearn the prefetch for system files .
Subsequent boots will run much faster since the sludge of programs has been removed , and only new ones are in the cache .
The trouble is that it will only help you for a while – until the prefetch gets clogged up again .
We need to edit a registry key to tweak it .
Open regedit and browse to this key :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager \Memory Management \PrefetchParameters
Under this key you should see a value named : EnablePrefetcher
It has 4 possible values :
0 – Disabled :
The prefetch system is turned off .
1 – Application :
The prefetch only caches applications .
2 – Boot :
The prefetch only caches boot system files .
3 – All :
The prefetch caches boot , and application files .
We do n’t want to disable it entirely .
This would actually make boot times * longer * .
This is because this feature is also used to speed up the loading of boot files .
That is why we are going to pick the number 2 option .
It allows us to keep the advantage of caching system files , without continually clogging the system up with applications .
Set the value to 2 and reboot .
The 2nd time you boot it should boot much faster .
Remember that the side effect is that launching individual applications once windows has loaded will now be slightly slower .
2 . Hard drive fragmentation
Over time your hard drive will become fragmented .
An over simplified explanation of fragmentation is when your files and folders are not all stored in the same spot .
For example lets say you had a large movie file .
If it were fragmented the first 5 megabytes are at the beginning of the hard drive , and then next 5 are at the end .
It takes longer for windows to read the file than it would if it were all in the same spot .
The point is that if each file is stored in a linear fashion , and the drive does not have to move all over the place to read it – it will load faster .
XP has a built - in defrag tool , and it is simple to run .
Open “ My Computer ” right click on the boot drive , and go to properties .
Now click on the tools tab .
Click “ Defragment Now ” and the following window should appear :
Before you click on the “ Defragment ” button you want to close all applications and be aware that it might take hours to complete .
If you leave something running it might keep windows from completing the defragment operation .
Click on the defragment button and you can walk away .
Or you can watch it defrag your hard drive :
3. Disconnected network drives
I am using networked drives all the time .
If you have ever put your machine on a network and connected to a shared drive , this can slow you down too .
If you have a drive that is still mapped , but can not be reached it will slow down windows during boot time .
This is because windows will wait … wait … and wait some more for the remote server to respond .
To clean these out open “ My Computer ” and go to the tools menu .
Click on “ Disconnect Network Drives ”
It will open a window that looks like this :
Click on the drives you no longer need , and click OK .
4. Spyware & Adware
These can have a big impact on your start times .
If your PC gets loaded with spyware , it spends a large portion of its boot time making sure those pesky programs are loaded and ready to throw popup adverts at you all day .
To check and clean your system of spyware there are three free programs that I highly recommend :
1. Microsoft Windows Defender
2. Ad- Aware
3. SpyBot Search And destroy
5. File and Printer Sharing
One other item that can significantly impact is the “ File and Printer Sharing ” feature within windows .
Obviously , if you are sharing your printer , or folders you do n’t want to disable this – so this tip is not for you .
If you never use it , then why waste your time waiting for it to load ?
Here is how to turn it off :
Go into the control panel .
Click on “ Network Connections ”
Now right click on “ Local Area Connection ” and click on properties
Uncheck the “ File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks ”
Click OK , and reboot .
That wraps up our windows startup optimization .
And if you are tired of waiting for windows to shutdown , then check out our article on speeding that up too !
Stay tuned .
We are about to release a new version of our Remote Reboot program .
This version adds a feature suggested by David in our forum .
It allows you to specify the shutdown reason that is written to the event log on Windows XP , and 2003 .
If you are not sure what I am talking about … this should remind you :

Beyond Russia , Venezuela is also considering a venture with Iran , its closest ally outside Latin America , to build a remotely piloted patrol aircraft .
Gen. Raúl Isaías Baduel , the Venezuelan defense minister , recently told reporters that the project to build 20 of the aircraft could be used to bolster border surveillance and combat environmental destruction in Venezuela .
Venezuela is also strengthening military ties with Cuba , sending officers and soldiers there for training .
Supporters of the arms buildup contend that under Mr. Chávez , who has been in power for eight years , Venezuela has spent proportionately less on its military in relation to the size of its economy than the United States or than other South American countries like Chile and Colombia .
In 2004 , the last year for which comparative data were immediately available and before Venezuela ’s arms buildup intensified , overall defense spending by Venezuela , including arms contracts , was about $ 1.3 billion and accounted for about 1.4 percent of gross domestic product , compared with 4 percent in the United States and 3.8 percent in Colombia , according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , which tracks military spending .
Doubts persist as to how powerful Venezuela ’s armed forces have become in a regional context , even as they acquire new weapons .
Military experts here say pilots in the air force still need training to start flying their new Russian fighters .
And in terms of troop strength , Venezuela ’s 34,000 - soldier active - duty army still lags behind the armies of Argentina and Brazil , with about 41,400 and 200,000 members respectively , according to GlobalSecurity.org , a Web site that compiles data on military topics .
Pro-Chávez analysts also say the president is less adventurous in relation to military policy outside Venezuela than predecessors like Luis Herrera Campíns , who supported Argentina in the Falklands War in 1982 to detract attention from a decline in oil revenue and climbing inflation .
But critics of the arms purchases say they are being made with little participation from or discussion with the National Assembly , which recently allowed Mr. Chávez to govern by decree for 18 months .
Ricardo Sucre , a political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela , said that the lack of transparency of the weapons contracts had heightened concern that Mr. Chávez could be arming parts of the army , the new civilian reserve and partisans like the Frente Francisco de Miranda , a pro-Chávez political group , that would be loyal to him in the event of fractures within the armed forces .
The presiding judge , Mahmoud Hawissa , read out the verdict in a seven - minute hearing at a Tripoli court , which came at the end of the defendants ' second trial .
The six - who had detained for nearly seven years - had previously been convicted and sentenced to death , but Libyan judges granted them a retrial after international protests over the fairness of the proceedings .
Bulgaria says the children were infected by unhygienic practices at their Libyan hospital .
The accused now have the right to appeal to the Libyan supreme court .
If it upholds the sentence , the only hope the medics have left is of a pardon .
The long trial has become a bone of contention in the efforts of the Libyan leader , Muammar Gadafy , to rebuild ties with the west .
The EU and US have called for the six to be released , indicating that future relations with Triploi would be affected by the verdict .
However , the case is emotive in Libya , where it is seen less as an indication of how far Colonel Gadafy will go to boost his standing with the west than as the trial of people accused of infecting children with HIV .
Relatives of the infected children - around 50 of whom have already died of Aids - waited outside the court early today .
They held poster - sized pictures of their children and placards that read " Death for the children killers " and " HIV made in Bulgaria " .
When the supreme court ordered a retrial in December 2005 , friends and relatives rioted in Benghazi , the Libyan city in which the children were infected at a state hospital .
Hundreds of people in Bulgaria staged peaceful protests in support of the five nurses yesterday .
The EU , the US and international rights groups have accused Libya of prosecuting the six foreign staff - who were first sentenced to death by firing squad by a Libyan court in May 2004 - as scapegoats .
Amnesty International today urged the Libyan authorities to declare that the death sentences would not be carried out .
" In this trial , as in their earlier one , confessions which they have repeatedly alleged were extracted from them under torture were used as evidence against them , " Malcolm Smart , the Middle East and North Africa programme director , said .
" Defence lawyers were not allowed to bring in international expertise , and the evidence produced by Libyan medical experts was questioned by international medical experts .
" Only a fair trial can bring out the truth and do justice to the children who have been infected with HIV and their parents . "
Luc Montagnier , the French doctor who co-discovered HIV , testified in the first trial that the virus was active in the hospital before the Bulgarian nurses began their contracts there in 1998 .
The death sentences from the first trial were overturned by the Libyan supreme court , which said there were " irregularities " in the arrests and interrogation of the accused .
These days Asian parents are increasingly asserting their desire for their children to be educated around others sharing their religion .
Church of England and Catholic schools are well - established and , in the past few years , the government , sensitive to the accusation of unfairness and aware of Muslim resentment over the Iraq war , has been encouraging the establishment of faith schools catering for Muslims , Hindus and Sikhs .
Last week the former Home Secretary David Blunkett made a thoughtful speech at the ICA arguing for a story of Britishness that was broad and inclusive enough to incorporate the diversity of the nation .
When I asked Mr Blunkett if he believed faith schools assisted this he conceded that the decision to establish Muslim , Hindu and Sikh schools had not been a philosophical choice but ' pure pragmatism . '
But pragmatism at what price ?
I recently completed a BBC Radio 4 documentary which asked whether faith schools might exacerbate existing tensions between communities .
I visited an Islamic school in Birmingham .
The school is popular and produces excellent exam results .
Walking along the corridor I noticed posters depicting Islamic history and heroes and a map highlighting the different origin nations of the pupils .
Supporters of such schools claim they produce self - confident young adults who do not feel they are the only Muslim in the village .
I sympathise but think this comes with a price .
My Muslim values were transmitted through my parents who would not have dreamed of expecting my school to provide them .
I find it hard to understand why today 's parents - Muslim , Sikh , Hindu or Christian - believe schools should have a role in teaching religious faith .
Britain today is multicultural and multi - faith and it seems perverse to try to create artificial mono - faith ghettos .
This is as true for the white parents who suddenly discover
God so that their child can go to a white school as it is for any other community .
What concerns me is that some Muslim parents are opting for Islamic schools in a futile attempt to ' protect ' their children from wider society .
Islamic schools do n't , of course , necessarily breed or teach extremism and it is worth remembering that the London bombers were educated in the state sector .
But do faith schools help forge a common British identity ?
Under the flag of parental choice we are institutionalising a segregation that already exists in many cities .
So how do we avoid , in Trevor Phillips 's phrase , sleepwalking into segregation ?
We can't turn the clock back and close all faith schools .
But there can be greater vigilance about what and who is taught .
If Muslims , Hindus and Sikhs want their children educated separately , they need also to learn about the ties that bind all of us together .
It can not be right to have only Islamic heroes on the walls of Islamic schools .
In my documentary I met a young Pakistani girl who attended a multi- faith girls ' grammar school and I asked her what she thought of faith schools .
Here , she said , she had friends from many different cultures .
' In faith schools you learn about how you are meant to get on with everyone , ' she explained ' but at this school you do n't just learn it , you live it . '
Faith schools should have to accept children of other faiths , it is better for the children and it is certainly better for the country .
My brother now has children .
In order to ensure that they attend a mainly white school he moved .
I would do the same .
Not because we want to deny our religion or forget our culture but because we and they are British as well as Muslim .
Parents today have the freedom to send their children to faith schools but , if they do , they should think carefully about the consequences for their children and the community .

Yesterday morning , Sens. Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) and Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) introduced the Fair Elections Now Act , a bipartisan bill to bring voluntary public financing to U.S. Senate elections .
( A companion bill will also be introduced on the House side by Rep. John Tierney ( D - MA ) soon . )
We all know the problem : even with the rise of small - dollar donations pioneered by the Dean campaign , a hundred $ 20 donors can be dwarfed by a single $ 2300 maximum contribution , and very few Americans ( one in 400 ) gives even $ 200 + as a campaign contribution .
So candidates spend all their time chasing down that money -- Tuesday 's Philadelphia Inquirer highlighted how freshman Reps .
Patrick Murphy and Joe Sestak are on a perpetual fundraising mission to retain the seats they just won months ago .
The Fair Elections Now Act , modeled after the successful systems in place in Maine and Arizona , has three parts :
Seed Money : Candidates can raise up to $ 100 per individual / PAC to get a campaign off the ground ( up to a set limit ) , in an effort to finance their bid to ...

: To qualify for public financing , Senate candidate needs to demonstrate her seriousness and base of support by obtaining a set number of $ 5 contributions ( and no more than $ 5 ) from citizens across the state .
Obtain enough ( based on the size of your state ) , and you receive ...
The Benefits : For agreeing not to accept private funding , a candidate instead receives a large sum of money to run her primary campaign , and if she is successful , a larger sum for the general as well .
That sum is based on the size of the state and its media costs , and if the candidate is facing an opponent receing private money or support via independent expenditures , it can be as much as tripled ( the " fair fight fund " ) to ensure a level playing field .
Let 's put some numbers on it to make this tangible .
A Senate candidate in Delaware could raise up to $ 75,000 in seed money in order to gather the two thousand $ 5 contributions necessary to qualify for primary funding ; upon obtaining that sum , $ 500,000 would be immediately available for the primary ( and up to $ 1.5 M if needed for a fair fight ) , and $ 750,000 for the general ( and up to $ 2.25 M if needed ) .
In California , a Senate candidate could raise up to $ 465,000 in seed money in order to gather the 28,000 $ 5 contributions necessary to qualify for primary funding ; upon obtaining that sum , $ 5.7 M would be immediately available for the primary ( and up to $ 17.1 M if needed for a fair fight ) , and $ 8.5 M for the general ( and up to $ 25.6 M if needed against a privately - financed opponent ) .
[ Moreover , there will be a media market adjustment to address variations among states , and participants would receive vouchers for purchasing broadcast airtime and would receive a 20 % discount beneath the lowest unit cost on all advertising purchased near the end of the primary and general campaigns . ]
Here , of course , is the beauty of the system : the system first forces grassroots organizing at the early stages , and then with the burdens of fundraising removed , frees up the candidates to spend much more time with citizens than they can right now .
And once elected , they 're no longer dependent upon the continued support large donors to get re-elected , but on citizens alone , which could change the dynamics on a wide range of policy issues .
Moreover , it 's voluntary : a candidate can choose to stick with private contributions , but he 'll have to be able to raise a huge amount , because all that effort will otherwise just be matched by automatic " fair fight " grants to his opponent .
The voluntary nature of this also avoids any constitutional questions about restricting candidates ' or contributors ' rights .
Who 's supporting it ?
Labor groups like the AFL - CIO , AFSCME , SEIU , and CWA have lined up behind it to give working people a chance to be heard in the political process .
MoveOn is supporting it -- even though they 're now among the big spenders / influencers in elections , they do n't like the status quo .
The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters are on board , as are civil rights organizations like NAACP and MALDEF .
Also , perhaps surprisingly , some very wealthy and influential donors like Alan Hassenfeld ( Hasbro ) and Edgar Bronfman Sr. fmr. Seagrams ) , who are tired of how the game has been played .
Public Campaign has even more details , and Nick Nyhart and Nancy Watzman have more on why this matters .
What can you do : Sign up as a citizen co-sponsor .
Tell your friends about it .
And call up your Senators and get them on board .
I tend to be a cynic about Big Change Legislation , but I think voluntary public financing is a much - needed idea whose time has come .

Poke around the web for information on switching to a Mac , and you 'll quickly get a face full of hyperbole , zealots , platform bigots , feature weenies , and naysayers - from both the Windows and Mac camps .
I 've been taking mental notes for the past few years , and thought I 'd write them up .
Before I get into things , I should say that I 've been a happy Mac user for ten years , but spent most of the 10 + years before that quite enamored with Windows and DOS as well .
So what 's it actually like to own and use a Mac ?
Here are 20 thoughts on what it 's like , without all the whining and hysterics :
When other Mac owners find out you have one too , you 'll get a little smile of camaraderie , and you 'll likely end up talking about Macs for five or ten minutes - no matter who they are and what the circumstance is .
You may or may not find this annoying .
Other Mac owners are usually fairly willing to help you get up and running on the Mac .
This may be self - serving on their behalf , because it helps sell more Mac stuff which in turn justifies their investment in a company with less than 10 % market share , but hey , it 's still a perk .
Probably not through altruism , but rather because Mac platform is ( a ) less widely used and ( b ) based on a fairly robust UNIX operating system , there are almost no viruses , worms , or other nasty stuff for the Mac .
Each time the Windows community gets up in arms about the next big virus that is circulating around the globe , you can go about your business on your Mac without really worrying .
However , you do have to be careful to not forward on infected files from one Windows user to another , and make sure to use anti-virus if you 're running Windows under Parallels or VMware .
Even though Microsoft Office is 99 % the same on both platforms , you 'll inevitably find yourself struggling with that 1 % late at night as a final deliverable is due to the client .
I 've found that embedding images and video in PowerPoint is where I usually run into problems , to the point that I 'll work under Windows for really important PowerPoint decks .
All that said , if you stick to broader standards like HTML and RTF , things work out pretty well .
Pretty much everything on the Internet will work like it does on Windows , including your banking site and your favorite home page .
However , once in a blue moon you 'll find a frustrating page that refuses to work with Safari or Mozilla or some other browser , and you 'll have to either find a Windows PC or just give up on the page entirely .
This is less and less frequent , however .
After a year with my first Mac , I was still surprised at how it made me smile like a schoolgirl at the little things : the design of the power supply , the quality of the keyboard , the lack of dongles and flaps hanging off of it .
Even today after staring at them for several years , I still enjoy the simplicity of the design of Mac notebooks .
That said , the beauty is n't always long - lasting : white MacBook cases can crack , the black MacBooks get really dirty from fingerprints , and the paint is wearing off the keycaps on my MacBook Pro .
From time to time you 'll be really upset with yourself for using the Mac , because you 're trying to get something done , and the Mac is n't responding like you would expect .
Usually you end up realizing that you 're trying to get it to respond like a Windows machine would , but you still have to spend the time to figure out the " Mac " way to get it done .
From time to time you 'll be pleasantly surprised because the Mac will do something that you completely did n't expect , because you 're used to how Windows would do things .
For instance , you put a picture into the Address Book , and it appears automatically in iChat , email , and on your phone .
I spent years honing the craft of keyboard shortcuts on Windows , to the point where it was mostly muscle memory pressing the keys for me .
On the Mac , it seems like there are two or three different ways that the various shortcuts are implemented , and it drives me nuts to this day .
Even worse is trying to switch back to a Windows keyboard from time to time , once you 're half accustomed to the Mac keyboard .
You 'll have a few moments where you really , really wish you had purchased that Dell laptop for $ 349 , and you 'll seriously consider taking the Mac back to the store , but eventually you 'll get over it and wonder what the hell you were thinking .
I was a major tweaker in Windows - registry entries , options , toolbar buttons - and was taken aback at how few things there are to tweak on the Mac .
At first it seemed to be restrictive , but I 've realized it has actually freed me to do things other than tweaking , like get a life .
You 'll find that you leave dozens of things open all the time - browsers , documents , folders , stickypad notes - and that the need to reboot comes as a surprise .
A printer install that requires a reboot will really tick you off .
Yes , I 'm talking about you , Brother Printers .
As a matter of fact , the power button on my old PowerBook is broken .
If I were to shut it down , I would have to disassemble the keyboard and touch two points on the motherboard to turn it back on .
However , I just shut the display when I 'm done , open it up to start working again , and I 've been working that way for over a year now .
If you go to the local Fry 's or Best Buy , you 'll find aisles and aisles of stuff for Windows , a few things ( like USB Keys or mice ) that work on both Windows and the Mac , and if you 're lucky , a crappy little shelf of Mac goodies .
But you 'll also likely find that you do n't need to buy all that extra stuff , as a lot of it's not necessary with the Mac .
From the initial hardware purchase , to software , to more frequent OS upgrades , you 'll likely end up spending more money than someone with a Windows box - but you 'll find you often get good value for your extra money .
It 's the old adage : you get what you pay for .
And Apple will keep coming out with new shiny objects that you really , really want to have .
Apple computers tend to retain their value better in the used marketplace .
Even a two - generations - back non-Intel laptop will sell for $ 250 -300 on craigslist .
People will stop you in the airport , the hallway , the office and talk to you about your Mac laptop .
They 'll admire the display , ask about compatibility , mention the Intel processor , and otherwise chat .
Sometimes it 'll be cool , sometimes you 'll be a bit embarrassed .
And no , they wo n't always be jeans - wearing , tousled - hair hipsters .
Sorry .
Once you get over the bouncy icons in the dock , and exploring all the built - in applications , you 'll probably end up spending a lot more time getting things done with your computer , and less time doing things to it .
Lots of people have decent stories about returns and repairs , but the net is full of horror stories as well .
If you decide you want to return something at an Apple retail store , there 's often a 10 % restocking fee ( although they waived it for me on a keyboard return ) .
Or if your display goes on the blink , it can take days or weeks to get your machine back .
No matter how minor the problem , make sure you back up your Mac before you hand it over to a ( cough ) Genius .
As advertised , I 've had very few problems connecting up to Windows servers and sharing files and printers .
However , sometimes I 'll have to run a client 's VPN software within Parallels , and my wife still has to go back to IE for some online banking .
So there you have it .
No hype , no bull , just the truth about switching .

Facebook SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) 
Oil prices were up nearly $ 1 in Asian trading Wednesday , easing back after spiking more than $ 5 a barrel on rumors that Iran had fired a missile at a U.S. ship in the Persian Gulf .
The U.S. military denied the reports .
Lt. Cmdr. Charlie Brown of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet said all ships in the Gulf had been checked and the rumors were untrue .
U.S. DENIES ACTION : Iran did not fire at U.S. warship Still , rumors about a military confrontation spurred panic buying in after - hours trading , Dow Jones Newswires reported , sending oil prices above $ 68 in a matter of minutes .
Rising tensions between Iran and the West have created a potentially dangerous situation in the Gulf and markets are jumpy .
Prices fell back within a couple hours , although they remained higher than Tuesday 's settlement price of $ 62.93 a barrel .
Light , sweet crude for May delivery was up 96 cents at $ 63.89 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile exchange in Singapore .
" The major concern is that if the rumor had been true , you 'd have a major disruption to supply , " said Andrew Harrington , an analyst with ANZ Global Natural Resources in Sydney .
" You have about a quarter of the world oil coming through the Straits of Hormuz and any military conflict would severely disrupt those supplies , which obviously sees the price spike . "
The spike indicates the nervousness in markets , he said .
" The political premium had been taken out of the price , and as soon as any signs of new development takes place , they get put back into the price , " Harrington said .
Traders were awaiting U.S. government oil inventories data due later in the day .
The U.S. Energy Department 's report is expected to show a gain of 1.1 million barrels in crude oil inventories in week ending March 23 , according to analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires .
Gasoline supplies are expected to decline by an average of 1.8 million barrels , while distillate stocks — which include heating oil and diesel fuel — are expected to dip by 800,000 barrels .
But the oil data most likely would be overshadowed by continued concerns about the Mideast , analysts said .
Tehran continues to hold 15 British sailors it captured on Friday , giving no indications of their whereabouts despite repeated pleas for their release from Britain , the United States and the European Union .
Also , the U.S. kicked off a military training operation in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday that commanders said was meant to send a warning to Iran .
The operations are the largest show of U.S. force in the Gulf since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
" A large part of the oil market , at least in the immediate future , will be very much focused on the events in the Middle East , " Harrington said .
" That will take precedence . "
In other Nymex trading , heating oil futures up 2.54 cents to $ 1.8118 a gallon ( 3.8 liters ) while natural gas prices climbed 9.5 cents to $ 7.598 per 1,000 cubic feet .

Methamphetamine Users Before and After Photos
The toll meth use takes on the user is unbelievable .
In a few short months the changes in appearance are easily spotted no matter what age the meth user is , after a couple of years some meth users are unrecognizable .
The longer meth is abused the more severe the effects become .
Meth abuse does n't just create euphoria ; meth causes brain damage , mental problems , physical problems and devastating physical effects .
The meth user soon becomes so dependent and obsessed with the drug they do n't sleep or eat .
Many meth users become chronic habitual users , their physical health is affected immensely and their once youthful appearance becomes forever changed .
Unfortunately you never think something like this can happen to you , but it can and it does .
Looking at the pictures you will begin to understand that meth abuse takes your mind , your body , and your soul until all that 's left is an empty sad shell of the person you once were .
What goes up need not come down , unfortunately
WE HUMANS are a dirty species , seemingly determined to cover our whole planet with our pollution .
Even in Antarctica , where the population consists of a few thousand environmentally - conscious weathermen and climatic scientists , industrial chemicals are turning up in the snow .
But our generosity with garbage extends even beyond Earth .
Fifty years of space exploration has left a great cloud of litter in orbit containing everything from discarded rocket stages and flecks of paint to astronaut 's toothbrushes and fragments of exploded satellites .
This stuff is dangerous as well as ugly .
The objects whizz round the Earth at eight kilometres a second or more .
At that speed a piece of debris the size of a coin packs as much punch as a bus moving at 100 kilometres an hour .
Worse still , nobody is sure exactly how much is up there .
America 's Space Surveillance Network tracks around 11,000 of the largest bits , but the small stuff―less than about 10 cm across―goes unwatched .
NASA reckons there are more than 100,000 of these smaller pieces , still big enough to damage badly or destroy anything they hit .
Do n't think this just a theoretical risk .
Holes thought to have been punched by small particles have been found in returning space shuttles .
In 1991 the shuttle Discovery had to adjust its orbit to avoid a speeding fragment of an old Russian satellite .
Five years later an errant chunk of Ariane 5 rocket smashed into a French satellite at around 49,000 kilometres an hour , destroying a stabilising boom and narrowly missing the satellite 's main body .
Spacefaring countries have set up a body called the Inter - Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee , in the hope of ensuring that new space missions will avoid adding to the problem .
New spacecraft are designed to commit suicide in the Earth 's atmosphere once their missions are complete , says Richard Crowther of Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory .
An errant chunk of Ariane 5 rocket smashed into a French satellite at around 49,000 kilometres an hour , destroying a stabilising boom and narrowly missing the satellite 's main body
But still , according to a paper published last year by two NASA scientists , the total amount of orbital litter is likely to go on increasing for another couple of centuries even if rocket launches cease .
That is likely to happen in part through accidents and decay .
Left - over fuel in old rocket stages and satellites may explode , for example , scattering satellite parts far and wide .
Nor are all countries equally co-operative .
Last month China tested an anti-satellite missile by ―whoops ―blowing up an old orbiting weather satellite .
The test could well generate more than 800 substantial fragments , each in a slightly different orbit .
Mr Crowther worries that firms operating satellites in popular orbits ―such as the geosynchronous orbit that keeps satellites above the same part of the earth ―may be unwilling to shell out the cost of waste disposal , ensuring that the most useful orbits are also those most filled with rubbish .
And , of course , orbital junk is a self - multiplying problem .
Each collision produces more debris , adding to the chance that something else will be hit .
One suggestion is to send up robot - binmen to drag the debris down .
But that would be risky and expensive , since a separate mission might well be needed for almost every piece of junk .
There is talk , too , of using ground - based lasers to nudge debris back to earth , but such a scheme would take years to work .
in the mean time , it is possible to toughen up spaceships : the International Space Station is already armoured , for example .
But that is only likely to be effective against the smallest particles ; and tougher spacecraft are heavier , and so more expensive to launch .
Low - flying litter ―anything below 800 kilometres or so ―will fall out of the sky eventually as friction with Earth 's atmosphere slows its orbit .
But at least half the known debris is higher than that , and can stay up indefinitely .
The consensus seems to be that it constitues a ( literally ) unavoidable danger of doing business in space .
“ No single remediation technique appears to be both technically feasible and economically viable , ” concludes a paper published last year .
In other words , says Mr Crowther , “ we 're just going to have to live with it . ”
Writing in the New York Sun , Liz Mair wonders if there is any hope for libertarian minded Democrats in 2008 .
Unfortunately , the results are not encouraging .
As Mair points out , all three of the current front runners are far from what you would describe as libertarian :
First , we have Senator Clinton , master of the big - government welfare state , with its price tag to be paid for with tax increases .
Despite all her positioning as a centrist Democrat , she ’s voted against repeals of the death tax and deficit reduction bills , as well as free trade legislation .
She ’s anti-gun with a vengeance and has an F rating from the NRA ( a big no - no in the pro-gun West ) .
And , of course , any libertarian voter who was paying attention during the 1990s still remembers and fears HillaryCare .
Then , we have the former senator from North Carolina , John Edwards .
During his Senate days , he was one of the most fiscally conservative Democrats .
But , since then , he ’s jumped on the loony - Left bandwagon , bashing Wal - Mart , personally leading a new War on Poverty , and championing tax hikes and large - scale redistribution of wealth .
He ’s also no friend of gun owners , with his 2002 and 2003 77 % ratings from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence .
And , finally , we have Senator Obama , the man who has served a grand total of two years in the Senate and in that time has voted against every notable bill that would cut taxes .
He said during his 2004 campaign for Senate that he would roll back the Bush tax cuts .
And , during that same campaign , his opponent blasted him for voting for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax increases and pushing costly new government programs .
He also shares the distinction with Mrs. Clinton of an F rating from the NRA .
The one interesting candidate is someone who has n’t officially announced yet , Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico :
Mr. Richardson scored third best of any Democratic governor for overall current - term performance on Cato ’s 2006 Fiscal Policy Report Card on America ’s Governors .
He earned a better grade than 37 other Governors , including 20 Republicans , in part because , during his tenure , New Mexico ’s top marginal income tax rate has dropped a remarkable 35 % .
Mr. Richardson also brings good credentials where immigration , guns , and social issues are concerned .
He declared a border emergency in his state in 2005 ( so he ’s no immigration softie ) , and he voted against the Brady Bill and other gun control initiatives while in Congress .
Yet , Mr. Richardson also has solid , moderate , pro-choice credentials , and is not a proponent of constitutional bans on gay marriage or civil unions .
Mr. Richardson ’s record and his views could resonate with libertarian Democrats , and that ’s something that should give Democratic Party bigwigs pause for thought .
I do n’t know much about Richardson , but this sounds encouraging at least .
Of course , while he might do well in the West , I think he ’d have a harder time in the Northeast and Mid West .
And then there is the possibility that there could be some skeltons in his closet .
Nonetheless , Richardson strikes me as interesting .
But those same insiders said that in retrospect Mr. Cheney ’s power was at its peak in 2003 and 2004 , before Iraq ’s insurgency flared , before the abuses at Abu Ghraib were revealed , before the setbacks in Congress and at the Supreme Court .
Without the help of his closest adviser , I. Lewis Libby Jr. , who resigned last fall after his indictment in the Central Intelligence Agency leak case , Mr. Cheney has lost the early warning radar that gave him and his staff such command over the federal bureaucracy .
Administration insiders said Mr. Cheney and his aides were now having to fight to maintain positions that a few years ago he would have won handily .
“ During the first term , Cheney was considered one of the smartest guys in the administration , ” said Representative Ray LaHood , Republican of Illinois .
“ But his influence has been diminished because of the Scooter Libby thing and because the war in Iraq has not gone well . ”
In his second term , Mr. Bush has grown less dependent on Mr. Cheney for information , current and former officials said .
When Joshua B. Bolten became the White House chief of staff earlier this year , he told associates that he wanted to make sure the president heard from more voices .
“ My impression is that there are a lot more data points or gathering points now , ” said Senator John Thune , Republican of South Dakota .
For instance , Mr. Bush has turned to another Washington insider , James A. Baker III , who served Mr. Bush ’s father as secretary of state , for help as the co-chairman of an outside group developing options for dealing with Iraq .
One group member said , “ You get the sense that the president now realizes , perhaps a little late , that he needs Baker to find him an exit door . ”
Mr. Cheney told NBC News in May that his influence with Mr. Bush was unchanged .
“ I feel like he gives me the access that I need to be able to do my job , ” Mr. Cheney said , adding later : “ I give him the best advice I can .
He does n’t always agree .
Sometimes he does , sometimes he does n’t . ”
Challenges in Congress
Perhaps nowhere has Mr. Cheney ’s shifting influence been more visible than on Capitol Hill , where the vice president ’s ability to win his way without challenge — a luxury he enjoyed through much of the first term — has evaporated .
This page is about an older project of ours .
We keep ALL of our projects up on the internet for anyone that 's interested ... but we are no longer pursuing many of these older ideas .
Before starting this project , please check our main Wind Power page to check for similar , more recent designs .
These will be the top of the list and flagged with an " active project " tag .
If you have any questions about what is current and what is not , or why we no longer work on certain designs , first check out our Wind Turbine Evolution page for a detailed history of how our designs have changed over the years .
You can also Email us and we 'll fill you in as our email volume permits ... check the Evolution page first .

And , be sure to check out our book Homebrew Wind Power for more small wind power information !
These pages serve as a brief summary about building and flying a 17 ' diameter wind turbine from scratch .
This is very similar to other designs we 've built , just scaled up a bit .
Pictured above are all the metal parts for the machine except for the tail .
Unlike most other machines we 've built in the past , this one does not make use of any salvaged auto parts .
( no Volvo parts here !! )
I started with a trailer hub , and spindle .
The steel rotors for the alternator are 16 " in diameter , cut from 1 / 2 " thick steel .
I had this done at a local shop that has a CNC Water Jet cutter .
The disks cost around $ 70 ea , but they came out very nicely - all the holes predrilled etc .
The ' yaw bearing ' ( that part that slips over the top of the tower ) is a 16 " long piece of 3 " diameter pipe .
The spindle for the trailer hub is suspended inside a 4 " long piece of 4 " dia pipe via two steel ' rings '
I cut out with hole saws .
The steel bracket that supports the tail pivot is frm 1 / 2 " thick steel , it 's 6 " tall and cut at an angle of 18 deg , very much along the lines of Hugh Piggott 's plans - just scaled up a bit .
Above we have the main chassis for the machine all welded up .
To do it over again , I would probably make a few things stronger .
I 'd consider a larger diameter yaw bearing .
I would reinforce the tail bracket ( that flat piece with the 18 deg angle ) where it 's welded to the yaw bearing .
I would use a larger wheel hub / spindle .
As it is ... it works fine so far , but some minor upgrades would do no harm .
Above I 've welded the 6 stator brackets on .
The diameter of the stator will be 20 " , so the diameter of the stator brackets is also 20 " .
I made a simple ' jig ' 20 " in diameter , and drilled the 6 holes in it - and a center hole that fits over the wheel spindle , ( basically a blank stator ) and then we bolt the stator brackets to the jig .
We can then stick the jig over the wheel spindle and weld the brackets on in exactly the right position .
Pictured above is the template we use to place the magnets on the steel rotors .
In this machine we have 16 magnets per rotor .
The magnets are quite large - very powerful ... and dangerous !!
They measure 1.5 " X 3 " X 3/4 " thick .
Here I 've laid out the path the magnets will take , and the approximate size that I think the coils should be .
Later on , this wooden piece will serve as the bottom of the stator mould so I 'll have some guidelines for placing the coils .
Pictured above we have the magnets ' super glued ' onto the rotor , and one rotor is mounted to the machine .
Of course we 'll need to take this back off so we can cast polyester resin around the magnets .
I made the coil winder so that the inside spindle is the size of my ' paper ' coil template .
The disks are 6 " in diameter , the rest is a simple hand crank affair just like all the other wind turbines we 've made .
Most past machines had slightly thinner ( 1/2 " thick ) magnets .
This machine is using thicker 3/4 " thick magnets , so we can also run with a slightly thicker stator .
This stator will be 5/8 " thick , so the coils can be a bit thicker .
The coil winder , when assembled - makes coils 9/16 " thick , I like to wind them a bit thinner than the stator .
First we wind 1 test coil .
Since this is a new design - I needed to make a test coil of the ' right size ' .
Then I can run that between the magnet rotors and get an idea of how many windings we need for a desired cut - in speed .
Since this is planned to be a 17 ' machine , we want a cut - in speed around 70 - 80 rpm .
This test coil consists of 79 turns of # 13 wire .
It would 've been prettier if I 'd cast this coil into such an assembly , but I tend to get impatient sometimes .
We cut out a piece of plywood and glued the coil in there so we could mount the coil on 2 of the stator brackets and run it between the magnet rotors .
Here we 're testing the coil with only 1 rotor on the machine .
We have an optical tachometer to measure RPM accurately .
Here we see 2.4 Volts @ 70 rpm .
At this point it should be noted ... these magnets are really crowded on the disks !
At the inner diameter of the ' magnet ring ' there is less than 3/8 " between the magnets .
This surely causes some cancellation in the coils when we have two opposite poles over 1 coil leg at the same time , and it results in some flux going straight from magnet to magnet , rather than through our coils where we want it .
So we are not making the very best use of our magnets on this machine , but ... we are keeping it perhaps a bit smaller and lighter weight by doing things this way .
It is a compromise .. we spend a bit more on magnets , and we have a slightly lighter weight , smaller machine .
Pictured above is the back of the machine with the test coil mounted .
You can also see the large resistor I used to ' load up ' this test coil and get a rough idea of what sort of power to expect at a given rpm .
The attraction between these magnet rotors is very strong and very dangerous !!
We drilled at tapped 3 holes in the front rotor so that we ' jack ' the rotor down , or ' jack ' it back up with 3 1/2 " pieces of allthread .
( jacking screws )
It takes a while , but it 's the only safe way to do this .
Editor 's note -- George 's fingers are in a BAD place .
If the jacking screws were to fail , he would LOSE 4 fingers .
This is unlikely -- but it 's always something to keep in mind when dealing with any magnet rotor .
There we have the front rotor on .
At 70 rpm now , with this one coil , we see 5.4 Volts AC - which , is just about perfect for 48 volt cut -in .
So my test coil is right in there .
I prefer a slightly higher cut - in speed , so the actual coils will have a few less windings of slightly heavier wire .
One other test I did ...
I wired this single coil up to a big resistor ( somewhere around 1 ohm I think ) and cranked it hard by hand .
At about 104 rpm , under load , I had 6 Volts AC and 6 Amps into the resistor ( 36 Watts ) .
Im not sure if I 'm figuring all this right - but I think that with 12 coils wired in 3 phase Star configuration ...
I should be close to 400 watts @ 100 rpm .
At this point we have about 2 days work into the project .
Never again will I make fun of U.S. Army recruiting commercials .
It just would n't be fair now that I 've seen ads for the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force .

Kは10歳くらいのときにプログラミング言語を覚えたが、その時はF-BASICから入った。BASIC言語ではとても簡単な命令で画面に線を引いたり長方形を描いたりできる。文字色設定やカーソル移動も簡単だった。これで十分だった。時代は進歩したはずなのに、どうして現状はこうなってしまったのだろう。BASICがC言語よりも優れているなんてみじんも思わないが、こと初心者の視点で比べたら何十倍もの差があるように思う。・・・
これは打破すべき問題である。しかも解決は難しくない。BASICでできたようなことができる簡単なライブラリがありさえすればいいのだ。それが標準になってしまえばよい。標準になるかどうかはどれだけ普及するかによるけど、とにもかくにも、そういうライブラリがなければ話にならない。ということで、作った。

“ Getting ” Joins
NOTE : I highly recommend people read the Coding Horror extension of my post .
I wrote this up as a quick and dirty cheat for a friend .
Coding Horror actually takes his time with the subject and gives it a better explanation .
I was asked to post this after explaining it to someone on IRC .
If you have tried to understand how joins work and constantly get confused about what join to use , you just need to keep a simple picture in mind ( I like pictures ) .
I will be explaining joins by referencing a Venn diagram .
Have no fear – I wo n’t get into any of the set theory / math involved .
This is just a basic overview to give you an idea the data a particular join will return to you .
This is not a technical discussion – just concepts .
We will start with just an empty diagram :
The T1 circle represents all the records in table 1 .
The T2 circle represents all the records in table 2 .
Notice how there is a bit of overlap of the 2 circles in the middle .
Simple right ?
I will use red to signify the records that will be returned by a particular join .
INNER JOIN
An inner join only returns those records that have “ matches ” in both tables .
So for every record returned in T1 – you will also get the record linked by the foreign key in T2 .
In programming logic – think in terms of AND .
OUTER JOIN
An outer join is the inverse of the inner join .
It only returns those records not in T1 and T2 .
“ Give me the records that DON ’T have a match . ”
In programming logic – think in terms of NOT AND .
LEFT JOIN
A left join returns all the records in the “ left ” table ( T1 ) whether they have a match in the right table or not .
If , however , they do have a match in the right table – give me the “ matching ” data from the right table as well .
If not – fill in the holes with null .
It should be noted that the same thing is possible with a right join – most people just use a left one .
LEFT OUTER JOIN
A left outer join combines the ideas behind a left join and an outer join .
Basically – if you use a left outer join you will get the records in the left table that DO NOT have a match in the right table .
Again it is noted that the same thing is possible with a right outer join – most people just use a left one .
Theta JOIN
A theta join is the Cartesian product of the 2 tables and not normally what people are looking for – but what they sometimes get by mistake .
How many of us have written a join similar to this only to get way more then we were ever expecting .
SELECT t1.* , t2 . *
FROM table1 t1 , table2 t2
WHERE t1.id = 5 ;
So there you have the basic concepts of joins .
Next time you need to use a join and have no clue what to do to get the data you need from the database , draw a picture .
It may help you figure out what join to use .
Least it helps me .
Important : Please be sure to read the comments below .
There are definite situations where my simplistic drawings are invalid and brought to light .
Disclaimer : I am by no means a database guru .
Please be sure to learn more about joins from the many online articles available .
If you invited me to try and crack your password , you know the one that you use over and over for like every web page you visit , how many guesses would it take before I got it ?
Let ’s see… here is my top 10 list .
I can obtain most of this information much easier than you think , then I might just be able to get into your e-mail , computer , or online banking .
After all , if I get into one I ’ll probably get into all of them .
Your partner , child , or pet ’s name , possibly followed by a 0 or 1 ( because they ’re always making you use a number , are n’t they ? )
The last 4 digits of your social security number .
123 or 1234 or 123456 .
“ password ”
Your city , or college , football team name .
Date of birth – yours , your partner ’s or your child ’s .
“ god ” “ letmein ” “ money ” “ love ”
Statistically speaking that should probably cover about 20 % of you .
But do n’t worry .
If I did n’t get it yet it will probably only take a few more minutes before I do …
Hackers , and I ’m not talking about the ethical kind , have developed a whole range of tools to get at your personal data .
And the main impediment standing between your information remaining safe , or leaking out , is the password you choose .
( Ironically , the best protection people have is usually the one they take least seriously . )
One of the simplest ways to gain access to your information is through the use of a Brute Force Attack .
This is accomplished when a hacker uses a specially written piece of software to attempt to log into a site using your credentials .
Insecure.org has a list of the Top 10 FREE Password Crackers right here .
So , how would one use this process to actually breach your personal security ?
Simple .
Follow my logic :
You probably use the same password for lots of stuff right ?
Some sites you access such as your Bank or work VPN probably have pretty decent security , so I ’m not going to attack them .
However , other sites like the Hallmark e-mail greeting cards site , an online forum you frequent , or an e-commerce site or a cryptocurrency wallet you ’ve shopped at might not be as well prepared .
So those are the ones I ’d work on .
So , all we have to do now is unleash Brutus , wwwhack , or THC Hydra on their server with instructions to try say 10,000 ( or 100,000 – whatever makes you happy ) different usernames and passwords as fast as possible .
Once we ’ve got several login + password pairings we can then go back and test them on targeted sites .
But wait …
How do I know which bank you use and what your login ID is for the sites you frequent ?
All those cookies are simply stored , unencrypted and nicely named , in your Web browser ’s cache .
( Read this post to remedy that problem . )
And how fast could this be done ?
Well , that depends on three main things , the length and complexity of your password , the speed of the hacker ’s computer , and the speed of the hacker ’s Internet connection .
Assuming the hacker has a reasonably fast connection and PC here is an estimate of the amount of time it would take to generate every possible combination of passwords for a given number of characters .
After generating the list it ’s just a matter of time before the computer runs through all the possibilities – or gets shut down trying .
Pay particular attention to the difference between using only lowercase characters and using all possible characters ( uppercase , lowercase , and special characters – like @ # $ %^&* ) .
Adding just one capital letter and one asterisk would change the processing time for an 8 character password from 2.4 days to 2.1 centuries .
Password Length All Characters Only Lowercase 3 characters 4 characters 5 characters 6 characters 7 characters 8 characters 9 characters 10 characters 11 characters 12 characters 13 characters 14 characters 0.86 seconds 1.36 minutes 2.15 hours 8.51 days 2.21 years 2.10 centuries 20 millennia 1,899 millennia 180,365 millennia 17,184,705 millennia 1,627,797,068 millennia 154,640,721,434 millennia 0.02 seconds .046 seconds 11.9 seconds 5.15 minutes 2.23 hours 2.42 days 2.07 months 4.48 years 1.16 centuries 3.03 millennia 78.7 millennia 2,046 millennia
Remember , these are just for an average computer , and these assume you are n’t using any word in the dictionary .
If Google put their computer to work on it they ’d finish about 1,000 times faster .
Now , I could go on for hours and hours more about all sorts of ways to compromise your security and generally make your life miserable – but 95 % of those methods begin with compromising your weak password .
So , why not just protect yourself from the start and sleep better at night ?
Believe me , I understand the need to choose passwords that are memorable .
But if you ’re going to do that how about using something that no one is ever going to guess AND does n’t contain any common word or phrase in it .
Here are some password tips :
Randomly substitute numbers for letters that look similar .
The letter ‘ o ’ becomes the number ‘ 0 ’ , or even better an ‘ @ ’ or ‘*’. ( i.e. – m0d3ltf0rd … like modelTford ) Randomly throw in capital letters ( i.e. – Mod3lTF0rd )
Think of something you were attached to when you were younger , but DON ’T CHOOSE A PERSON ’S NAME !
Every name plus every word in the dictionary will fail under a simple brute force attack .
Maybe a place you loved , or a specific car , an attraction from a vacation , or a favorite restaurant ?
You really need to have different username / password combinations for everything .
Remember , the technique is to break into anything you access just to figure out your standard password , then compromise everything else .
This does n’t work if you do n’t use the same password everywhere .
Since it can be difficult to remember a ton of passwords , I recommend using Roboform for Windows users .
It will store all of your passwords in an encrypted format and allow you to use just one master password to access all of them .
It will also automatically fill in forms on Web pages , and you can even get versions that allow you to take your password list with you on your PDA , phone or a USB key .
If you ’d like to download it without having to navigate their web site here is the direct download link .
Mac users can use 1 Password .
It is essentially the same thing as Roboform , except for Mac , and they even have an iPhone application so you can take them with you too .
Once you ’ve thought of a password , try Microsoft ’s password strength tester to find out how secure it is .
By request I also created a short RoboForm Tutorial .
Hope it helps …
Another thing to keep in mind is that some of the passwords you think matter least actually matter most .
For example , some people think that the password to their e-mail box is n’t important because “ I do n’t get anything sensitive there . ”
Well , that e-mail box is probably connected to your online banking account .
If I can compromise it then I can log into the Bank ’s Web site and tell it I ’ve forgotten my password to have it e-mailed to me .
Now , what were you saying about it not being important ?
Often times people also reason that all of their passwords and logins are stored on their computer at home , which is save behind a router or firewall device .
Of course , they ’ve never bothered to change the default password on that device , so someone could drive up and park near the house , use a laptop to breach the wireless network and then try passwords from this list until they gain control of your network – after which time they will own you !
Now I realize that every day we encounter people who over - exaggerate points in order to move us to action , but trust me this is not one of those times .
There are 50 other ways you can be compromised and punished for using weak passwords that I have n’t even mentioned .
I also realize that most people just do n’t care about all this until it ’s too late and they ’ve learned a very hard lesson .
But why do n’t you do me , and yourself , a favor and take a little action to strengthen your passwords and let me know that all the time I spent on this article was n’t completely in vain .
Please , be safe .
It ’s a jungle out there .

And here ’s another ABC World News report :

With Salam Talib
Until two weeks ago , Ali Falah worked as an emergency room doctor in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk .
The city , which is ethnically mixed but dominated by two Kurdish militias , has been the scene of increased sectarian violence .
Most doctors left the city earlier this year after one physician was gunned down inside the emergency room .
Falah says lately he ’s often been the only doctor on the floor of an emergency room that receives 80 patients a day .
Falah says he was ready to hang on and continue working , but two weeks ago someone dropped a note off at his home in a Shi’ite section of Kirkuk .
“ They threw a letter in the house saying the residents who are Shia have to leave the city , ” he says .
“ Otherwise , they said , ‘ What will happen , will happen . ’
So most of the people left .
Me also . ”
Falah says that was the last straw .
He left for the southern province of Amara , where he ’s living near his fiancée ’s family .
He ’s given up medicine , saying it ’s too dangerous , and is working for a company .
He wo n’t say which type .
“ Economically , the situation for doctors was bad , ” he says .
“ They pay us about $ 200 a month , and we are living in a dormitory .
It ’s not enough .
We work about 16 hours a day and with the situation in Kirkuk  the explosions and the incidents are so numerous we can’t keep up .
There ’s a very heavy load on us , and now communication with the people is very difficult . ”
Falah says the different factions do n’t understand that medical doctors are impartial and only want to care for the sick and wounded .
“ The police and military do n’t respect us as doctors , ” he adds .
“ They ’re aggressive toward us .
It ’s gotten to the point where they beat doctors and insult us .
That ’s become very normal . ”
Nezar al - Sammarai , a Sunni Arab lawyer practicing in western Iraq says he ’s not surprised Shi’ite doctors like Falah have fled areas like Kurdish - dominated Kirkuk for their ancestral homelands in southern Iraq .
Shi’ite professionals are also leaving Sunni - dominated western Iraq , he says .
Al - Sammarai says that ’s not displacement .
“ Western Iraq did n’t used to be a mixed area , ” he explains , “ so we do n’t consider what ’s happening here displacement .
We just think that people are returning back to their original place .
So if the professionals who lived here were originally from other areas , they ’ll not live in those sectors anymore because they ’re not from here . ”
In such an environment , over a million Iraqis have simply given up and left the country .
Among them , the United Nations estimates fully 50 percent of Iraqi doctors have left since the U.S. military invasion in 2003 .
“ It ’s just so difficult to live in Iraq , ” says Nada Doumani , spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross - Iraq , which is now based in Jordan .
“ When you leave your home in the morning , it ’s not clear that you ’ll come back in the evening .
Of course people want to get out . ”
Professionals are at greater risk , she adds , “ because they are perceived to make more money and therefore face a bigger risk of kidnapping . ”
Indeed , doctors are n’t the only professionals under threat in Iraq .
Since February , Iraq ‘s Ministry of Higher Education reports , nearly 180 professors have been killed and at least 3,250 have fled the country .
Security checked every piece of luggage from the flight
Transport officials said the 59 - year - old woman was held in connection with a confrontation with the flight crew .
She was carrying hand cream - a banned item - and matches on board the United Airlines flight .
The aircraft was escorted into Logan airport by two jet fighters .
Responding to reports that the woman had been tied up during the flight , United Airlines spokesman Brandon Borrman said that she had been restrained .
" Safety and security are top priority .
Crews are trained to restrain when they feel it is appropriate for the safety and security of the flight , " he said .
Reports that the woman was carrying a screwdriver and a note referring to al - Qaeda have been denied .
Security officials at Boston 's Logan International airport laid all of the luggage from the plane out on the runway and checked every item with sniffer dogs .
The woman , who is from Vermont , is expected to be charged on Thursday .
However , US Attorney Michael Sullivan 's office said , in a statement , that " at this time , there is no evidence that this was a terrorist - related incident " .
' Claustrophobic '
United Flight 923 from Heathrow Airport , with 182 passengers on board , was originally bound for Washington DC's Dulles Airport .
It landed at Logan at about 1020 local time ( 1420 GMT ) .
Nenette Day , a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Boston , said the woman passenger was apparently claustrophobic and had become disruptive on the flight .
" This is n't just an ' I want another drink kind of thing , ' it was a disruption that caused them to divert the plane , " she said .
The incident comes almost one week after an alleged bomb plot targeting UK flights to the US was uncovered by British intelligence officers .
One of North America 's largest ship container terminals was evacuated on Wednesday after bomb - sniffing dogs became alarmed by two cargo containers from Pakistan .
No explosives or chemical or biological agents were found in the containers in Seattle , the US customs and border protection service said .
One was filled with clothes and the other with large bundles of used or recycled textiles .
“ Asphyxiation games have been with us for generations , but what makes the current generation ’s execution of this game different is that more kids are willing to play it alone , ” said Dr. Thomas Andrew , the chief medical examiner in New Hampshire , who has consulted on 20 cases around the country where the game was suspected .
Of those 20 cases , most of which were listed officially as suicide , Dr. Andrew said he became convinced that four were really accidental from the choking game , and two others were unclear enough that they should have been changed to an undetermined cause of death .
But he said that none of the death certificates , to his knowledge , were changed .
Anxiety about sex is another entanglement in the discussion .
In some older teenagers and adults , the game can become associated with autoerotic practices of masturbation or intercourse to intensify orgasms , though Dr. Andrew and other experts say they think sex is not a factor for younger teenagers — and there was also no sex or ejaculation in Levi ’s case , his mother said .
For now , most of the new debate is driven by advocates like Scott S. Metheny , an intense police officer from Upper Moreland , Pa. , a suburb of Philadelphia , who has done more than 140 antichoking game presentations in the past 18 months on his own time .
He flew to Texas to talk to the students at Navarro , about 40 miles northeast of San Antonio , and to introduce Levi .
“ Bringing Levi in was a shock factor , ” Kandi Knippa , 18 , president of the Drug Awareness Council , a student group .
“ It was very intense .
But if we can save one life , it was worth it . ”
Image Above , Kelly Mitchell , 12 , left , and Kaitlyn Murphy , 14 , students at Navarro , listened to a program about a game that involves choking .

About three - quarters of Ms. Knippa ’s classmates , girls as well as boys , raised their hands when asked if they had heard of the choking game , which Mr. Metheny said was typical .
I Wish Elliot Abrams Would Come Up With New Ways To Lie To Us
Here 's Elliot Abrams today , lying about never having seen Iran 's 2003 peace offer :
Leverett said yesterday that he became aware of the two - page offer , which came over a fax machine at the State Department , in his waning days in the U.S. government as a senior director at the National Security Council , but that it was not his responsibility to put it on Rice 's desk because Rice had placed Elliott Abrams in charge of Middle East policy .
" If he did not put it on her desk , that says volumes about how she handled the issue , " he said yesterday .
Abrams is currently the deputy national security adviser in charge of the Middle East and democracy promotion .
An NSC spokeswoman , speaking on behalf of Abrams , said yesterday that Abrams " has no memory of any such fax and never saw or heard of any such thing . "
Here 's Elliot Abrams in 1984 , lying about massacres by the Salvadoran military :
Appearing with Aryeh Neier on " Nightline ' in February , Abrams insisted to Ted Koppel , " I 'm telling you there were no massacres in El Salvador in 1984 . '
When Neier asked about reported massacres in Los Llanitos in July and near the Gualsinga River in August , Abrams countered , " They never happened " ... When asked by Koppel if the embassy had investigated reports , Abrams 's confidence seemed to drop : " My memory is that we did , but I do n't want to swear to it because I 'd have to go back and look at the cables . "
Neier says embassy officials have told him the investigations never took place ; the State Department has never offered proof to the contrary .
Here 's Elliot Abrams in November , 1986 , lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the contras :
SENATOR BRADLEY : So let me ask it again .
Did either one of you ever discuss the problems of fundraising by the contras with members of the NSC staff ?
MR .
ABRAMS : No , I can't remember .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again : the only way to get appointed to a high political position in America is to have a terrible memory for politics .

Solar cell technology developed by the Massey Universityâ€™s Nanomaterials Research Centre will enable New Zealanders to generate electricity from sunlight at a 10th of the cost of current silicon - based photo - electric solar cells .
Dr Wayne Campbell and researchers in the centre have developed a range of coloured dyes for use in dye - sensitised solar cells .
The synthetic dyes are made from simple organic compounds closely related to those found in nature .
The green dye Dr Campbell ( pictured ) is synthetic chlorophyll derived from the light - harvesting pigment plants use for photosynthesis .
Other dyes being tested in the cells are based on haemoglobin , the compound that give blood its colour .
Dr Campbell says that unlike the silicon - based solar cells currently on the market , the 10x10 cm green demonstration cells generate enough electricity to run a small fan in low - light conditions â€ “ making them ideal for cloudy climates .
The dyes can also be incorporated into tinted windows that trap to generate electricity .
He says the green solar cells are more environmentally friendly than silicon - based cells as they are made from titanium dioxide â€ “ a plentiful , renewable and non-toxic white mineral obtained from New Zealandâ€™s black sand .
Titanium dioxide is already used in consumer products such as toothpaste , white paints and cosmetics .
â€ œThe refining of pure silicon , although a very abundant mineral , is energy - hungry and very expensive .
And whereas silicon cells need direct sunlight to operate efficiently , these cells will work efficiently in low diffuse light conditions , â€  Dr Campbell says .
â€ œThe expected cost is one 10th of the price of a silicon - based solar panel , making them more attractive and accessible to home - owners.â€ 
The Centreâ€™s new director , Professor Ashton Partridge , says they now have the most efficient porphyrin dye in the world and aim to optimise and improve the cell construction and performance before developing the cells commercially .
â€ œThe next step is to take these dyes and incorporate them into roofing materials or wall panels .
We have had many expressions of interest from New Zealand companies , â€ Professor Partridge says .
He says the ultimate aim of using nanotechnology to develop a better solar cell is to convert as much sunlight to electricity as possible .
â€ œThe energy that reaches earth from sunlight in one hour is more than that used by all human activities in one yearâ€ .
The solar cells are the product of more than 10 years research funded by the Foundation for Research , Science and Technology .
While all of the attention during the final hours of the Virginia General Assembly session was focused on the transportation bill , the Senate and House of Delegates passed a bill aimed at restricting local government ’s authorty to use the power of eminent domain :
RICHMOND —
After more than a year of work on the issue , the General Assembly on Saturday passed legislation that restricts government ’s power to seize private property by invoking eminent domain .
The Senate and House of Delegates agreed on bills that define “ public uses ” under which government can take private property , stripping out a Senate provision that would give housing and redevelopment authorities greater ability to condemn property in blighted areas .
The passage of House Bill 2954 and Senate Bill 1296 nearly completes lawmakers ’ efforts to strengthen eminent domain restrictions in the wake of a 2005 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in Kelo v. New London .
In that case , the court upheld a Connecticut city ’s condemnation of a homeowner ’s property for a private development project .
The bills define five “ public uses ” for which private property can be taken .
The legislation allows eminent domain for eliminating blight , but only if the property itself is blighted .
The bills would not affect current plans of redevelopment and housing authorities if they file petitions for condemnation by July 1 , 2009 .
The text of the relevant bill can be found here and it limits the power of eminent domain to the following situations :
( i ) the property is taken for the possession , ownership , occupation , and enjoyment of property by the public or a public corporation ; ( ii ) the property is taken for construction , maintenance , or operation of public facilities by public corporations or by private entities provided that there is a written agreement with a public corporation providing for use of the facility by the public ; ( iii ) the property is taken for the creation or functioning of any public service corporation , public service company , or railroad ; ( iv ) the property is taken for the provision of any authorized utility service by a government utility corporation ; ( v ) the property is taken for the elimination of blight provided that the property itself is a blighted property ; or ( vi ) the property taken is in a redevelopment or conservation area and is abandoned or the acquisition is needed to clear title where one of the owners agrees to such acquisition .
Not perfect , but still a fairly good start and even the definition of “ blight ” , which is an area where local governments have frequently gotten away with murder , is fairly restrictive :
“ Blighted property ” means any property that endangers the public health and safety in its condition at the time of the filing of the petition for condemnation and is ( i ) vacant and constitutes a public nuisance or ( ii ) an individual commercial , industrial , or residential structure or improvement that is beyond repair or unfit for human habitation or use .
Like I said , a good start .
Hopefully , Governor Kaine will do the right thing on this one .

Jeff Jacoby became an op - ed columnist for The Boston Globe in February 1994 .
Seeking a conservative voice to balance its famously liberal roster of commentators , the Globe hired him away from the Boston Herald , where he had been chief editorial writer since 1987 .
A Cleveland native , Jacoby graduated with honors from George Washington University in 1979 and from Boston University Law School in 1983 .
He practiced law for a short time at the firm of Baker & Hostetler , but returned to Boston to become deputy manager of Ray Shamie 's 1984 campaign for the U.S. Senate .
From 1985 to 1987 , Jacoby was an assistant to Dr. John Silber , who at the time was president of Boston University .
In addition to his print work , Jacoby has been a political commentator for WBUR - FM , Boston 's National Public Radio affiliate .
For several years he hosted " Talk of New England , " a weekly television program , and has often appeared as a panelist on WCVB - TV's " Five on Five . "
He is an overseer of the Huntington Theatre Company , the largest resident theatre in Boston , and is on the board of The Concord Review , a quarterly journal of essays on history by secondary students worldwide .
Inflation has at least 8 distinctly different definitions that I can readily find , and probably a whole lot more that I have not yet found .
Commonly Used Definitions
Decline in purchasing power of the currency held
Rising prices in general ( essentially the same as # 1 although some might disagree )
Rising consumer prices ( CPI ) Rising producer prices ( PPI )
Rising prices due to expansion of money supply
Rising prices due to expansion of money supply and credit Expansion of money supply Expansion of money supply and credit
A Dictionary Definition
A persistent increase in the level of consumer prices or a persistent decline in the purchasing power of money , caused by an increase in available currency and credit beyond the proportion of available goods and services .
The Cart before the Horse
" caused by an increase in available currency and credit beyond the proportion of available goods and services "
Is Price all that Matters ?
A Look Back at the New Economy
The Role of Government
" We need to reach out to African - American , Hispanic and other first - time buyers with better loan concepts , more flexible guidelines and quicker service .
I am absolutely emphatic about winning back our share of the market that has slipped away to subprime lenders . "
A Use for the CPI
Money vs. Credit
A net expansion of money supply A net expansion of money supply and credit
Cash + demand deposits with commercial banks and thrift institutions + government deposits with banks and the central bank
As prices of financial assets begin to rise , in order to keep their growth momentum intact the money supply rate of growth must expand .
Any slowdown in the money supply rate of growth will slow the growth momentum of financial assets ' prices .
Once the rate of growth slows down false activities encounter trouble .
Since the diversion of real resources toward these activities slows down , a fall in the money rate of growth strangles them .
It follows then that rising growth momentum of money leads to an expansion in nonwealth generating activities ( also known as an economic " boom " ) while a fall in growth momentum undermines false activities and results in an economic bust .
Conclusions
Inflation is best described as a net expansion of money supply and credit .
Deflation is logically the opposite , a net contraction of money supply and credit .
Government mandated solutions to problems best left to the free market is the root cause of money supply expansion .
With no enforcement mechanism such as a gold standard to keep things honest , and with no desire to raise taxes , governments simply approve programs with no way to fund them .
The FED has been all too willing to play along by printing the money needed for those government programs .
To make matters worse , the fractional reserve lending policies of the FED allows an even greater expansion of credit on top of the money printed .
Eventually those actions result in a crack - up - boom and debasement of currency .
Changes in " Purchasing power " required to buy a basket of goods and services can not be accurately measured because of the need to continuously add new products to the basket , because the measurement of quality improvements on existing products is too subjective , and because it is impossible to pick a representative and properly weighted basket of goods , services , and assets in the first place .
Furthermore , such measurements are highly prone to governmental manipulation at private citizen expense .
Endless bickering over the CPI numbers every month should be proof enough of these allegations .
Measurement of equity price fluctuations poses a particularly difficult problem for those bound and determined to put the cart before the horse as well as those that think such assets belong in any sort of basket .
Price targeting by the FED is doomed to failure because a representative basket of goods and services can not be created , because prices can not properly be measured , and because price targeting puts the cart before the horse .
Expansion of money supply ( typically to accommodate unfunded government spending ) and expansion of credit ( via GSEs , fractional reserve lending , and other unsecured debt issuance ) are two of the biggest problems .
Targeting the outcome ( prices ) can not possibly be the solution .
Ludwig von Mises describes the endgame brought on by reckless expansion of credit : " There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit ( debt ) expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit ( debt ) expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved . "
The FED should have been listening to Mises all along .
Instead they have put their faith in " productivity miracles " , " new paradigms " , and their own hubris .
Those actions have accomplished nothing other than delay the eventual day of reckoning .
Four of those definitions refer to money supply .
That brings up another issue .
When one refers to " money supply " are they talking about M1 , M2 , MZM , Money AMS ( Austrian Money Supply ) , or simply the amount of money they have in their bank account or wallet at the time of the conversation ?
Definitions 5 and 6 refer to " rising prices " yet fail to distinguish between consumer prices , producer prices , or simply prices in general .
It seems we could easily add a lot more definitions .
Furthermore , some people make no distinction between money and credit but others do as noted by choices 5 thru 8 .
Still others insist than in the fiat world we are in , the web is so tangled between money and credit that this mess is not even worth bothering to figure out .
Those folks simply hold gold and wait for " The Crash " .
The thing is , it is simply impossible to argue about inflation ( or anything else ) unless one can agree on a definition .
Like it or not , we live in a fiat world .
Therefore we must attempt to have sound definitions that best describe the fiat world we are in .
Dictionary.com defines inflation as : One might commend dictionary.com for making the distinction between money and credit , but others might take exception to " consumer prices " vs. " prices in general " , and still others might argue endlessly about what " purchasing power " means .
The real problem with the definition however , is that it puts the cart before the horse .
The problem with definitions that have a " because of " clause is that it impossible to know exactly why prices are rising or falling .
Should rising oil prices due to peak oil , geopolitical concerns , hurricanes , or other supply disruptions really constitute inflation ?
More to the point :
Is there any possible way to decide what % of the increase in the price of oil ( or anything else ) was The answer to that latter question is easy : of course not .
Furthermore , the natural state of affairs is decreasing prices because of increasing productivity ( more goods produced by less labor ) thereby causing a drop in prices over time .
One farmer today produces as much wheat or corn as did 20 or even 100 farmers not that long ago .
Unions strive to protect jobs even though one worker today produces more cars than several workers a decade ago .
Dictionary.com thus proposes a definition of inflation that simply can not be measured .
The problem is the " because of " clause that puts the cart before the horse .
Of course those in the " price is all that matters " camp have no such problems .
To them , prices of a basket of goods and services rose , therefore inflation rose .
A big problem for those in this camp is that rising asset prices ( such as stock market equities ) are not properly accounted for in any known basket of goods and services .
Some might argue that that problem can be solved by including stock market prices in the basket of goods and services .
Unfortunately that further compounds the problem by orders of magnitude .
How does one decide which stocks to include in the basket as well as the relative weighting of those stocks ?
Furthermore , is it really valid to call genuine improvements in business conditions " inflation " ?
Even without the problem of equity assets , there is a huge problem of selecting a basket of goods and services that works for both consumers and producers .
Not only is it impossible to accurately pick a representative basket of goods an services that properly measures " purchasing power " , it is also impossible to make accurate quality judgments about the prices of goods in that basket .
For example : double pane insulated argon gas filled windows are now common .
How does one measure the price of those windows with windows thirty years ago when such a thing did not even exist ?
How does one accurately measure the relative values of such windows vs. the windows of yesteryear ?
It simply can not be done !
Practically speaking , the price drop is 100 % because one could not get those windows at any price if you go back far enough .
How long ago was it that PCs , Gore - Tex , and Teflon did not exist ?
How does one accurately account for that ?
Backward price measurement comparisons are simply hopeless because of a continuous array of new product and service offerings .
Some even look at such quality improvements to make a claim that the CPI is actually overstated !
The ranges for overstatement that I have seen are generally 1 - 2 % and understatement by as much as 6 - 7 % .
Can a definition of inflation that includes enormously subjective measures possibly be of use to anyone ?
Is a basket that relies solely on producer prices ( PPI ) the answer ?
If so how does one properly account for rising consumer prices but not producer prices and vice versa ?
Obviously this line of reasoning is hopeless .
The problem of accounting for stock market fluctuations is even worse for those in the " price increases caused by an increase in available currency and credit " camp because they have to decide if stock market prices are rising or falling because of general business conditions or because of expansion of money supply , risk taking , speculation , or time preferences .
Let 's take a step back from all this madness and consider the decade of the 1990's .
In the mid to late 1990 's money supply rose dramatically by any commonly used measure yet the folks in the " price is all that matters " and " purchasing power " camps were not alarmed because the price of oil and gold and copper and computers were falling as Greenspan became a cheerleader for the " New Economy " .
Can a definition of inflation that ignores such problems possibly be right ?
The fatal flaw made by Greenspan and the " price is all that matters " camp is that productivity improvements led by an internet revolution , along with global wage arbitrage and outsourcing to China and India , lowered costs on manufactured goods and kept the lid on wage increases in the manufacturing sector .
Those factors all helped mask rampant inflation in money supply .
The Greenspan FED further compounded the problem by injecting massive amounts of money to fight a mythical Y2 K dragon that simply did not exist .
Those monetary injections helped fuel a massive bubble in the stock market in 2000 .
Everyone in the " price is all that matters / purchasing power " camp either has to ignore equity distortions or account for them by adding equity prices to the basket of goods and services .
Either way is problematic .
Those in the " because of " camp also need to take account of the fact that rising prices in a basket of goods and services as well as rising equity prices often happen because of " government imposed solutions to nonexistent problems " .
One can even logically argue that government itself is the primary cause of rising prices .
Look no further than Y2 K , a Medicaid Bill that legislates against mass purchases of drugs , congressional action that impose tariffs on crops and lumber , congressional actions that prevents drug imports from Canada , builds bridges to nowhere in Alaska , and other such nonsense .
There are now more than 200 governmental bills designed to make housing affordable .
The worst of the lot were bills authorizing creation of the GSEs ( Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) .
Lenders eventually figured out how easy it is to dump the riskiest loans onto those quasi government agencies .
Credit standards then went downhill and home prices sky rocketed .
As reported in the Washington Post article FHA Alternatives To Subprime Loans Alphonso Jackson , Housing and Urban Development Secretary actually went so far as to send this message to private sub - prime lenders :
A government desire to win back market share from private lenders is most assuredly pure insanity .
Indeed , promotion of the ownership society itself is at the very heart of this mess .
Supposedly the government wants " affordable housing " yet it puts into practice anti-free market policies that absolutely ensure the opposite .
Let 's briefly discuss Medicare / Medicaid .
Government policies prohibit negotiation of bulk discounts .
Those policies also prohibit imports from Canada and other nations willing to provide drugs at a cheaper cost .
The most recent boondoggle is a process whereby recipients can only change providers once a year while providers can add or drop coverage with a mere 60 days notice .
Someone signing up for benefits specifically because a needed drug was covered may find out after 60 days they have to eat the entire cost .
What kind of sense does any of that make ?
Somehow entitlement programs always have enormous cost overruns .
The Medicare / Medicaid bill is no exception .
Before the bill was even passed , its costs were known to be understated by at least $ 139 billion dollars .
The Washington Post article White House Had Role In Withholding Medicare Data notes that Richard S. Foster , the government 's chief analyst of Medicare costs was threatened with firing if he disclosed the true costs of the bill to Congress .
The bill passed by an extremely slim margin .
Had the true costs been disclosed it is doubtful the bill would have passed .
If you are looking for a source of inflation , there is no doubt that Greenspan , the FED , and government policies are all a huge part of the problem .
What is interesting is that Greenspan is now finally starting to make sense for the first time in his entire career with his recent warnings about Fannie Mae , government spending , and trade deficits .
For 18 years everyone listened to " The Maestro " even though most of what he said was totally unintelligible .
Now the ultimate irony is that no one is paying attention just as he is finally starting to make some sense .
We will leave this matter for another time except to point out the following :
The government and the FED are both always fighting some sort of mythical dragon .
That is a huge problem over time .
Let 's now return to a question I asked earlier : Can a definition of inflation that includes enormously subjective measures such as the CPI possibly be of use to anyone ?
Actually it can , but not to any private citizen 's benefit .
The basket of goods and services as well as subjective measures of quality improvements can indeed be used by the government to underpay holders of inflation protected securities like TIPS , as well as understate cost of living adjustments to social security recipients .
How many believe the government 's basket of goods and services is overweight computers and appliances and underweight heating bills , medical expenses , gasoline , insurance , and housing ?
Even if one believes the government was honest about the makeup of the basket , is the government biased about subjective measures of quality improvement of items in that basket ?
The problem of baskets and weightings is simply impossible to solve .
The cynical will propose it is impossible to solve on purpose .
Because of cart before the horse problems , basket selection problems , PPI vs. CPI problems , asset price problems , and government manipulation problems , we can easily discard the first 6 widely used definitions of inflation .
That leaves us with a choice between the following :
Given the current government policies that allow tremendous leverage via the fractional reserve lending , the most logical conclusion is that it is indeed necessary to distinguish between money and credit .
Fortunately the work in this area has already been accomplished by Austrian economist Frank Shostak .
In The Mystery of the Money Supply Definition Shostak makes note of the difference between money supply and credit , while making a solid case that Money Supply ( elsewhere called Austrian Money Supply or Money AMS ) is .
The difference between Money AMS and other published " money supply " figures such as M1 , M2 , M3 , or MZM is therefore either credit , over - counting , or pure nonsense .
Before making a final decision between the two remaining definitions let 's first consider a real world example : Japan 1982 - 2004 .
Some argue that Japan never went through deflation .
One basis for that argument is that " money supply " as measured by M1 never contracted over a sustained period .
The other argument is that prices as measured by the CPI never fell much .
Once again we have a flawed argument about consumer prices and a flawed argument that only looks at money and not credit .
Although Japan was rapidly printing money , a destruction of credit was happening at a far greater pace .
There was an overall contraction of credit in Japan for close to 5 consecutive years .
Property values plunged for 18 consecutive years .
The stock market plunged from 40,000 to 7,000 .
Cash was hoarded and the velocity of money collapsed .
Those are classic symptoms of deflation that a proper definition incorporating both money supply and credit would readily catch .
Those looking at consumer prices or monetary injections by the bank of Japan were far off the mark .
Frank Shostak nicely describes the end of such economic booms in Making Sense of Money Supply Data Note that it was a continued collapse in credit as opposed to a collapse in government monetary printing that eventually sealed the fate in Japan .
The lesson to be learned from Japan is that once the ability and / or desire of consumers and corporations to take on more debt is reached , the party is over barring and out and out hyperinflationary expansion of money .
For a discussion of Ben Bernanke 's hyperinflationary " helicopter drop " solution to deflation , please see Robert Blumen 's article Bernanke : Foreign Savings Glut Harms the US
In practice , a helicopter drop of money would bail out consumers at the expense of the FED .
Furthermore such actions would eventually destroy the FED 's own power and wealth .
Logic would therefore dictate that the helicopter drop threat would not be carried out in actual practice .
No doubt there will be further endless debate on this subject , one way or another , until the final collapse is at hand .
The logical outcome of the above discussion is that a proper definition of inflation or deflation must be built on the foundation of a sound definition of money supply that distinguishes between money itself and credit .
The definition should also ensure that the horse and the cart are in their proper places .

The book Sex in Space has attracted some controvesy from people uncomfortable with the general concept , regardless of its importance or how it ’s presented .
Sex in Space : bizarre reactions I am amazed how many people in the United States are so intimidated by the word “ sex ” and are unwilling to discuss its consequences .
My latest book , Sex in Space , tackles both the fun and serious sides of this currently neglected topic .
It ’s not just my opinion that the possibilities of sex in space need more attention .
This is the recommendation of a 2005 report from the US National Academies of Science .
Yet I have encountered all sorts of bizarre problems when bringing up the topic of sex in space .
Apparently , some people just do n’t understand that the book is intended to spark the public ’s interest in space exploration , settlement , and tourism .
To illustrate my case , here are some examples .
Apparently , some people just do n’t understand that the book is intended to spark the public ’s interest in space exploration , settlement , and tourism .
Sex in Space was sold at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) store for the first month after Apogee Books released the book .
It was doing very well , so the store manager invited me to do a book signing .
The trouble began as soon as a cheery book - signing announcement was emailed to all personnel at JPL .
Unbeknownst to me , the store simply is n’t allowed to do book signings because JPL ca n’t be seen as endorsing a commercial product .
The JPL store personnel simply made a mistake by booking my signing .
However , what happened next is ridiculous .
First , a liaison to the store e-mailed an announcement to all personnel — thousands of people at JPL — citing “ ethical reasons ” for the cancellation of the signing .
This , of course , prompted many people to contact me to ask exactly what it was that I did wrong .
The implication is that I did something unethical .
I ’ve done nothing wrong , which the JPLers involved have assured me of via several telephone conversations .
A simple clarification sent to the same distribution list ( all personnel ) as the previous announcement would have fixed things .
To date , no such email has been sent .
Second , those involved ordered my Sex in Space books pulled from the store .
Apparently the title “ Sex in Space ” is just too racy .
Perhaps I should have titled my book , “ The Possibilities of Human Reproduction Beyond Earth . ”
Oh , yes , the general public would have been so interested .
Unfortunately , my experience with JPL is n’t unique .
My publishers told me that all of the other NASA centers , as well as several space museums , are unwilling to carry Sex in Space .
These are the same stores that stock and restock my other two books , which are aimed at young women ( Women Astronauts , and Women of Space : Cool Careers on the Final Frontier ) .
Fortunately , regular bookstores are stocking Sex in Space .
In addition , I have been kicked off a space tourism discussion panel because the seminar sponsor , a conservative California space organization , does n’t like the title of my new book .
I was n’t even asked what I would be presenting about on the panel .
Anyone who knows me knows that I ’m not one to discuss graphic details or use vulgar language .
I ’m not that kind of journalist — or woman , for that matter .
In Sex in Space I cite other cases in the past where people — even NASA scientists and engineers — have received strong criticism , and were even silenced , for bringing up the topic of “ sex ” in the context of long - duration space missions .
It ’s an important topic that certain people and organizations are not willing to face .
This reaction is childish and shortsighted .
I ’m a wife , a mother , and a concerned journalist who is trying to open people ’s eyes to what is turning into a very serious problem of the not - so - distant future .
I hope that my little book makes the people who are working on space exploration , settlement , and tourism really consider the consequences of the nature of humanity .
Let ’s face it , sex is the way we humans reproduce .
The Universe created us to be this way .
So I find it very sad that certain people feel they need to repress this natural part of being human .
I ’m a wife , a mother , and a concerned journalist who is trying to open people ’s eyes to what is turning into a very serious problem of the not - so - distant future .
To ignore the sexual and reproductive issues surrounding people in space will not make them go away .
Future long - duration space missions and the possibility of space tourist couples in the next decade make the topic more urgent than ever .
My fear is that the first serious look at sex in space will occur when birth control fails ( because drug absorption in space is less , or maybe fluids behave differently in space ) and we have a radiated fetus in space in danger of having horrific birth defects .
Now is the time to study the sex in space topic seriously and shed our Puritanical ignorance .

There ’s been a tremendous level of interest in the fact that pre-installed Linux ( in the form of Ubuntu | Fedora | OpenSuSE ) is the # 1 rated suggestion on Dell ’s IdeaStorm .
On the face of it , there is little question that Linux pre-installation is popular with customers .
Why , then , is it so difficult to buy a PC in the US or Europe that has Linux ( and ideally Linux alone ) on the hard drive ?
The devil , as always , lies in the details .
First , margins on PC ’s are razor - thin .
This has two significant consequences .
Most importantly , it means that Microsoft co-marketing funds are a substantial portion of the profit margins for many large PC retailers .
Tweaking the nose of the giant might be fun but it ’s risky .
If Microsoft reduces the per-PC marketing contribution it makes for a particular reseller , that puts them at a huge financial disadvantage relative to their competitors .
This means that one of the biggest issues a computer manufacturer or reseller faces in considering Linux pre-installations is the impact it will have on the Microsoft relationship , and hence bottom line .
Also , thin margins mean that any customer interaction or support call can blow away the profit not just on that sale , but on many others as well .
The worst - case scenario is a customer who buys a computer at the lowest price off your website , assuming it ’s a Windows machine , and then calls , infuriated , because it “ wo n’t work with the game they are trying to install ” .
One customer who accidentally gets Linux without knowing what that means is an expensive proposition for a company that makes relatively little on the low - end product range .
For this reason , I do n’t think it makes any sense for Walmart to sell low - cost Linux PC’s , and we ’ve never pushed US / European retailers to try pre-installing Ubuntu unless we think they can segment out the market which genuinely WANTS Linux from those that are just looking for a great deal on “ a [ windows ] computer ” .
Second , we free software fans are a fussy crowd , and very hard to please .
You know what you are like – you sit and configure that Dell system down to the finest detail , you want a specific model of HP laptop , you want the one that has the Intel graphics chipset not the other chipset because you prefer the free driver approach from Intel … you are in short an expert , demanding customer .
This means , that in order to reach us with Linux , a reseller has to offer Linux EVERYWHERE , not just on a few select models .
Worse , we are not “ Linux ” users , we are users who want version 6.06.1 of Ubuntu , or 10.2 of SuSE , or Fedora 6 .
We want a specific distro , and in many cases also a specific VERSION of that distro .
In order to please us , the vendor has to offer an enormous matrix of possibilities – machine and distro / version .
This is an expensive proposition .
So , what can we do to help address the need ?
First , we can help the vendors get more detailed insight into the real nature of demand .
For example , here ’s a survey being run by Dell that will I ’m sure help inform their decisions about how they help you get Linux on Dell :
It would be great , of course , if those sorts of surveys were less vendor - specific , so that we could express our opinions once and have that counted across the whole industry , but there you have it .
( It would also be great if Dell would consider Ubuntu to be both community - and commercially - supported , but that ’s a different story ;-) ) .
Second , we can start looking at ways to change the model so that there ’s a better fit between customer expectations and the economics of the industry .
For example , if you ’re one of the people who voted for Linux pre-installation on Dell IdeaStorm , would you be happy to receive a Dell box with no OS and with an Ubuntu disk in the box , which you yourself installed , with no support from Dell ?
What if it came with an assurance that the set of components you had configured * should * work , but no guarantee ?
Can we tweak the parameters to get to the point where you would be satisfied , and Dell could make a reasonable profit with only reasonable risk ?
Solve that , and I think we could all get one step closer to fixing Bug # 1 .
Addendum :
Of course , some resellers specialise in Linux pre-installations .
My favourite of them is System76 , who do a great range of laptops and desktops with , amongst others , Ubuntu preinstalled .
Kudos to them for spotting the market and making the most of it .

Bio
George Walker Bush ( born July 6 , 1946 ) is the 43rd and current President of the United States and former governor of Texas .
He is the son of the 41st president , George H.W. Bush , brother of the current governor of Florida , Jeb Bush , and grandson of former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush .
He is the second son of a former United States president to become president himself ; the first was John Quincy Adams .
A member of the Republican Party , Bush was elected the 46th governor of Texas in 1994 , then re-elected in 1998 .
He won the nomination of the Republican Party for the 2000 presidential race and ultimately defeated Democratic Vice President Al Gore in a very close , and legally disputed , election which ended in a Supreme Court decision ; see Bush v. Gore .
[ 1 ]
In 2004 , Bush was elected to a second presidential term , defeating John Kerry , the junior Democratic Senator from Massachusetts .
His term will expire on January 20 , 2009 .
Bush 's presidency has been defined by the War on Terror following the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
After the attacks , Bush and the United States Congress created the Department of Homeland Security and increased the powers of law enforcement agencies with the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act .
In 2003 , the United States and a multinational force took military action in Iraq , overthrowing and eventually capturing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
However , the war has lasted far longer than the initially estimated 6 weeks to 6 months .
The commitment of United States , Europe , and Canada troops has been controversial both domestically and internationally .
A central theme in Bush 's continuing policy in Iraq has been the creation of a democracy , to which end , Iraq held free elections in 2005 .
Bush has also signed into law a Medicare prescription drug plan and tax cuts at all income levels .
Bush 's terms of office coincided with Republican control of the U.S. Congress , giving him greater control over policy formulation than presidents dealing with an opposition - controlled legislature .
In late 2005 and 2006 , Bush led the world community in opposition to Iran 's announced intention to develop nuclear technology .

Kristin here –
Behind closed doors , major negotiations and offers concerning the film of The Hobbit are presumably passing back and forth .
The glimpses afforded the public via the key players suggest a stormy process .
One of those players , Bob Shaye , is president of New Line Cinema , which he founded in 1967 and has headed ever since .
He was the one who in 1998 took on the Lord of the Rings project and decided to make the film in three parts .
On January 10th , a report posted on the internet quoted Shaye as declaring that Peter Jackson will never get to direct The Hobbit for New Line .
That ’s quite a leap from the situation as it was back on October 2 , when I posted my first blog on the subject .
At that point MGM ( which owns the distribution rights for The Hobbit ) had just announced that it and New Line would co-produce the film .
The studio ’s spokesperson mentioned Jackson as the director of choice .
The big concern among fans then was whether Jackson , who had been announcing new producing and directing projects right and left , would have time in his schedule to tackle such a major project — especially given that MGM suggested that the film might be made in two parts .
Having written a book , The Frodo Franchise , with the cooperation of the filmmakers , I weighed in on the logistics of all this .
As I said at the time , since finishing my research in New Zealand in 2004 , I have not had direct contact with Jackson or the others privy to the negotiations concerning his subsequent projects .
I simply offered an educated opinion on the situation and why Jackson might well be able to fit The Hobbit into his schedule .
The recent major developments suggest that it ’s time again to provide some additional context .
One fundamental bit of backstory on the whole issue of who will direct The Hobbit dates back to early 2005 , when Jackson filed a lawsuit against New Line .
The entire complaint , published March 25 , 2005 , is available online .
It makes a number of claims concerning New Line , including ways in which the exploitation of The Fellowship of the Ring and its licenses was dealt with .
Primarily it alleges that New Line did not “ properly account , calculate and pay to Wingnut its share of the profits ” ( i.e. , from theatrical distribution ) and did n’t “ properly allocate license fees paid with respect to packages of defendants ’ film properties that include the Film . ”
I take it that the latter refers to the DVDs .
Jackson insists that the lawsuit does not demand a set amount of money but simply a proper auditing of the money from the Fellowship release , licensed goods , and DVD .
On November 19 , 2006 , Jackson and producing / writing partner Fran Walsh posted a letter on TheOneRing.net .
In essence they said that they had been approached by New Line to make The Hobbit , with the implication that the lawsuit would be settled if they accepted .
Jackson and Walsh countered by saying that they would not link the film to the lawsuit .
New Line decided to find another director , and Jackson and Walsh told the fans they would not be making The Hobbit .
There followed a storm of protest on the Internet .
MGM pointed out that it still wanted Jackson to direct The Hobbit .
Saul Zaentz , who had sold the production rights back in 1997 , said he hoped that Jackson would direct .
At that point , an observer might reasonably assume that the participants were drawing lines in the sand .
Jackson clearly wanted to direct
The Hobbit , but he had plenty of other projects in the pipeline and did not need to chase this one .
Perhaps he saw the November 19 announcement as a way to pressure New Line into settling the lawsuit .
Perhaps New Line suspected that they would end up owing Wingnut a great deal of money if the audit occurred .
There the situation evidently stood for nearly two months , with no public signs of either side budging .
Then , in a brief interview with Sci Fi Wire ( the news service of the Sci Fi Channel ’s website ) posted on January 5 , Shaye declared : “ I do not want to make a movie with somebody who is suing me .
It will never happen during my watch . ”
Shaye declared that Jackson had so far been paid “ a quarter of a billion dollars , ” implying that suing for more was greedy and again emphasizing : “ He will never make any movie with New Line Cinema again while I ’m still working for the company . ”
Wingnut ’s deal with New Line for producing , directing , and writing LOTR involved flat fees for Jackson and Walsh as well as an undisclosed percentage of the income and bonuses if the film hit certain box - office levels .
Later the same day , Jackson responded on Ain’t It Cool News , briefly reiterating in measured terms the reasons for the lawsuit and expressing regret at Shaye ’s statement .
Where do things stand now ?
According to the November 19 letter , Mark Ordesky ( Executive Producer of LOTR ) was the one who called Jackson about The Hobbit .
In the course of it he mentioned that the option on the production rights for the novel would eventually revert to Saul Zaentz .
Hence New Line ’s need for speed and its decision to seek another director .
Rumors that Sam Raimi had been approached circulated , though no evidence for that has surfaced .
It is customary for production options on a literary property to be sold for a limited time .
Given that we just passed the tenth anniversary of Zaentz ’s sale of the rights , obviously that was n’t the period .
Who knows how many years are left ?
Is New Line using that issue as a way to put pressure on Jackson ?
Quite possibly .
New Line must realize that Jackson ’s name adds tens of millions of dollars in value to The Hobbit as a film property .
Its executives know that fans are up in arms about all this .
A poll taken by TheOneRing . net beginning December 18 asked whether fans would go see The Hobbit if it were directed by someone other than Jackson .
“ Definitely No— No way without PJ ! ” garnered 62.5 % of the votes ; “ Not likely — I ca n’t imagine another team involved ” drew 14.1 % ; “ Very likely — Ca n’t wait for any live - action Hobbit film ! ” 10.3 % ; “ Do n’t know — Depends on who directs , ” 10.3 % ; “ Likely — It is time for some fresh creative juices , ” 2.6 % .
10,143 people voted , thousands higher than in other recent TORN polls .
Clearly indignant fans would be more likely to participate in such a poll than would non-indignant ones .
And no doubt many of the fans would change their minds and go to The Hobbit as directed by someone else .
Still , considerable resentment would linger and be volubly expressed right up to the time of the film ’s release .
Any director approached by New Line would doubtless be aware that he ( or possibly she ) would be swimming upstream against a flood of fan opprobrium .
Would any major director agree to it ?
Some of the likeliest candidates are also friends of Jackson’s .
Another relevant factor that New Line would have to consider is whether any of the actors would return to work under a different director .
Jackson creates a fierce loyalty among the people he works with .
During the making and release of LOTR , the actors rallied behind him during a number of disputes with the studio .
On November 22 , Ian McKellen put the Jackson / Walsh letter on his series , “ E - Post : The Lord of the Rings ” and added a comment : “ The LOTR fans are already expressing a sense of betrayal .
On my own account , I am very sad as I should have relished re-visiting Middle Earth with Peter again as team - leader .
It ’s hard to imagine any other director matching his achievement in Tolkien country .
We will have to await developments but being an optimist I am hoping that New Line , MGM and Wingnut can settle outstanding problems so that the long expected ‘ Hobbit ’ is filmed sooner rather than later . ”
Of course not all that many characters in LOTR appear in The Hobbit .
Gandalf is the crucial one , and McKellen strongly implies that he would n’t return under another director .
Elrond appears in two brief episodes .
( The general opinion is that Ian Holm would be too old to play Bilbo , who is 50 in the novel . )
Jackson has mentioned the possibility of showing the White Council meeting , which is only mentioned in the book , and that would involve at least Galadriel and Saruman .
It is quite possible that the relevant actors would refuse to return unless Jackson helms the film .
Important crew members might do the same .
The possibility of the rights reverting to Zaentz remains vague unless someone reveals the length of New Line ’s option .
I suspect that Zaentz would like nothing better than to regain those rights .
He is a formidable producer himself , having three Best Picture Oscars on his mantel ( One Flew over the Cuckoo ’s Nest , Amadeus , and The English Patient ) .
He got a very significant cut of the gross income from Lord of the Rings , as well as loads of money from the licensed products .
By producing The Hobbit himself , he would probably receive a considerably higher cut .
He also would n’t have to depend on New Line ’s accounting practices .
Zaentz himself sued New Line over his share of the box - office take for LOTR .
His suit alleged that although his contract gave him a cut of the gross theatrical income , New Line had calculated his share on net revenues , paying him $ 168 million .
The trial was set to commence on July 19 , 2005 , but New Line entered into negotiations and settled with Zaentz in August , giving him an additional $ 20 million .
Lawsuits like this are n’t uncommon in Hollywood , so the Jackson / Walsh and Zaentz claims against New Line are not extraordinary events .
The Zaentz case does , however , give some indication of the kinds of money involved .
It is notable that New Line has caved as a result of a lawsuit somewhat similar to the one now in contention .
Presumably Jackson and Walsh ’s suit will eventually make it to court if New Line does not do as they did with Zaentz and settle it .
Thus the advantage of shutting Jackson out of the Hobbit project does n’t seem apparent to an outsider .
They ’ll face it at some point — why not bite the bullet , settle , and regain access to the one director virtually guaranteed to make this valuable literary property into a huge hit ?
The success of LOTR went beyond any of its makers ’ most optimistic expectations .
That success was largely due to Jackson and Walsh .
They were the ones who brought the project to New Line , which otherwise would have had no way of getting the novel ’s production rights .
The first film came out in a year that was perhaps the worst the studio had ever endured .
In January , 2001 , cutbacks imposed by AOL Time - Warner , New Line ’s owner , had forced Shaye to let go a hundred employees .
This was not a minor thing for such a small company , and one which was known for its long - term retention of a tight - knit staff .
In the spring of 2001 New Line had two of its most costly failures with the Adam Sandler comedy Little Nicky and the infamous Town and Country .
The December release of Fellowship pulled New Line out of a huge slump .
It is probably not true , as many predicted at the time , that the studio would have ceased to exist had it not been for LOTR .
It does seem likely , though , that Shaye would have had far less autonomy and power in running the company that he had started .
I discuss the events of that period in detail in The Frodo Franchise .
At this point , the fracas seems odd indeed , both from a personal and a financial point of view .
There may be other factors involved that those not apparent to outsiders , and we may well never learn what those were .
In the meantime , the actors involved grow older .
Ian McKellen went to New Zealand and began playing Gandalf in January of 2000 , when he was 60 .
Last year , at 66 , he predicted , “ I ’ve got another 10 years in me , probably , of capering . ”
In the same interview he remarked , “ I would love to do ‘ The Hobbit , ’ yes .
Partly because I would hate to see anybody else playing Gandalf . ”
So would just about anyone else .

I wrote this on the flight out to the Web 2.0 conference .
I hope it stimulates some interesting conversations .
---------------------------------------
One of the central tenets of Web 2.0 thinking is that lightweight " point solutions " that can be stitched together by the consumer are preferable to end to end solutions that are stitched together by the service provider .
I had a conversation with veteran web entrepreneur who challenged that assumption yesterday .
His view , one that I have to admit made me sit back and think , is that the early adopters ( geeks ) of the web 2.0 world prefer to stitch together point solutions , but that the mainstream web user will prefer an end to end solution .
Further , his view is that the leading portals ; Google ( I know they are n't a portal , they are a starbucks store ) , Yahoo ! , MSN , AOL , IAC , etc will stitch together end to end solutions with a combined build and buy strategy .
And it follows from this analysis , that the portals will end up winning the masses and leaving the point solutions either as assets to be purchased or to waste away and die .
Obviously we need to figure out the answer to this question because we either follow the lead of Flickr and look to the portals as our exit strategy or we invest in and build these " point solutions " into viable long term businesses .
I do n't think we have to make this call just yet and we can invest for growth without limiting the option of a sale scenario .
But this is a long term strategic question that everyone starting and investing in web services businesses needs to get a handle on if they want to make the exercise pay off at the end of the day .
Here are a some data points to think about .
Flickr :
Flickr has n't improved in any measurable way now that it is part of Yahoo !.
In fact , I am finding it to be buggier and flakier than usual lately .
Probably due to scaling issues , but being part of Yahoo !
does n't seem to be a magic bullet in that regard .
And some of Flickr 's users are smarting from being forced into Yahoo ! 's registration scheme .
There has n't been any noticeable integration of search , groups , 360 , or MyWeb with Flickr yet .
Yet is probably the operative word and we have to watch this closely to see if these integrations , which must be coming , improve the utility and vitality of the Flickr experience .
As a fanatic Flickr user , I tend to doubt it .
I love Flickr for what it does for me today .
I have done the integration that I want , with my Treo , with my blog , with delicious .
I doubt that Yahoo is going to give me anything more than what I already get from Flickr .
AOL vs. Google :
AOL is the classic end to end solution .
They built everything inside their walled garden and you can't integrate any web service with AOL .
Of course that is changing , about 10 years after it should have .
But you know what I mean .
Google is the classic point solution .
They built the very best web search engine .
Which would you rather own ?
Blogging Platforms :
Each of the major portals has a blogging platform , Blogger , 360 , MSN Spaces , etc .
I do n't see any of them taking a cut out of Live Journal , Xanga , Typepad , Wordpress , or any of the " point solutions " in the blogging world .
In fact , the platform with the most mojo these days seems to be MySpace .
News
Corp does n't have any web services to integrate with MySpace and I suspect they are going to get a fantastic return on this acquisition without any " synergy " .
Craig 's List :
I just shake my head every time I think about Craig 's List .
It has existed as an island all to itself for years and just gets stronger and stronger .
The best web 2.0 mashup I have seen is Google Maps / Craig 's List .
Google is going to launch a Craig 's List killer sometime soon .
Let 's see how it does .
I have my doubts that it will do much more than Yahoo !'s assault on eBay in the Web 1.0 days .
Wikipedia :
This is my favorite of them all .
The same web entrepreneur who got me thinking about this issue suggested that a better wikipedia might be built with a more commercial model .
No way .
Wikipedia is the bomb .
I read a post today on the Socialtext weblog about the way Wikipedia is slowly taking over Google 's page rank algorithm .
Think about that .
No SEO or SEM going on there .
Just lots of link love and internal linking and voila , wikipedia slowly takes over Google 's page rank .
That 's a jujitsu move if I 've ever seen one .
The fact is that these " point solutions " have a vitality that comes from their authenticity , their simplicity , and their sizable and active user bases .
I heard a user of one of these services talk a couple weeks ago about the " emotional connection " he had to one of these services .
I know what he is talking about .
I feel that way about Flickr , Typepad , Google , My Yahoo ! , delicious , and many other web services I use on a daily basis .
I have rolled my own web experience and it is unique to me .
It is mine .
Yahoo ! , Google , MAN , AOL , Ask , and anyone else who wants to try is not going to take it away from me .
And its people like me who make this whole Web 2.0 world so vital .
We are the content creators .
Without us , the services will be empty .
Try my Web 2.0 for example .
The launch of Marc Andreesen 's Ning yesterday makes me think that its quickly going to get easier to build new web services and that we 'll see an explosion of these point solutions over the next ten years which will be even smaller and more lightweight .
So my thesis is that end to end solutions are n't going to work as well as highly integrated but separate services that build and hold emotional connections with their key users .
And those users will provide the lasting value .
But that is just a thesis .
I want to test it .
By blogging it and soliciting comments , links , trackbacks , etc .
And by asking everyone I know what they think .
And by bringing really smart people together to debate issues like this .
As I learn more and develop this thesis or debunk it , I will keep you posted as always .
Being the occassional mutterings of an 'umble student about love , life and the universe
Microsoft said today that it would pay I.B.M. , which it displaced as the world 's premier technology purveyor , $ 775 million to settle a number of outstanding antitrust claims .
The settlement stems from the Justice Department 's antitrust case against Microsoft in the mid-1990's , in which Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found the giant software company 's practices harmed the International Business Machines Corporation , based in Armonk , N.Y .
That case was settled in 2001 .
Under the agreement announced today , I.B.M. will also receive a $ 75 million credit toward using Microsoft software .
It is the latest , and one of the largest , in a string of antitrust settlements totaling more than $ 3 billion between Microsoft , based in Redmond , Wash . , and its rivals .
In April , Microsoft said it would pay Gateway $ 150 million .
Last year , it agreed to pay Sun Microsystems $ 1.6 billion , Microsoft 's largest such payout .
I.B.M. and Microsoft , which issued a joint statement today , came to an agreement just weeks before a deal to extend the statute of limitations on the claims was to expire in July .
The companies said they had been negotiating for the last two months .
IN A cinema hoarding in Peshawar 's Khyber bazaar , Arbaz Khan brandishes a Kalashnikov rifle with a muscular brown arm dripping with scarlet blood .
Two nicely plump , pink - cheeked maidens are arranged on the grey rocks behind the actor , manacled and in chains .
Mr Khan 's roaring , jet - moustachioed mouth bellows the name of the film : “ It is my sin that I am Pushtun ! ”
As an examination of moral equivalence , the film raises difficult questions .
To simplify : Mr Khan 's father is killed in a blood - feud , after which , according to the tribal code of the Pushtuns — or Pakhtuns , or Pathans , as they are also called —
Mr Khan 's uncle should marry his dead brother 's widow and accept Mr Khan as his son .
But Mr Khan 's mother is rather long - in - the - tooth , so Mr Khan 's uncle ( or father ) takes up with a dancing - girl , whom , to satisfy his mother 's honour , Mr Khan kills .
Mr Khan then falls in love .
But , dash it , his uncle ( or father ) makes a play for his girl !
Herein lies a dilemma .
According to the tribal code , which is called Pushtunwali , Mr Khan must honour his father and also slaughter anyone who messes with his lady .
Which way should he choose ?
After brief anguish , Mr Khan slots his randy uncle .
To Western critics , “ Aayeena ” might sound like Bollywood schlock .
But it has real - life resonance in Peshawar , the capital of Pakistan 's North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) .
Your correspondent recently paid a visit there to a politician , Anwar Kamal Marwat , a florid gentleman of military bearing and parliamentary leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz in the NWFP assembly .
By chance , Mr Kamal had that evening returned from a distant jirga , or tribal council , involving several hundred elders from Pakistan and Afghanistan , representing several dozen Pushtun tribes and their constituent clans .
The jirga had been convened to settle a blood - money claim against the Marwat tribe , which Mr Kamal leads , incurred in April 2004 .
For several years previously , the Marwat had been feuding with their neighbours , the Bhattani , another small Pushtun tribe .
The tit - for - tat offences were quite piffling , said Mr Kamal — a spot of thieving or kidnapping of fighting - age males .
Then some Bhattani hotheads abducted two Marwat girls ; and Mr Kamal went Pushtun - postal .
Leading an army of 4,000 Marwat fighters , equipped with artillery , he levelled a Bhattani town , killing 80 people , including the two unlucky , but nonetheless dishonoured , girls .
Neither the bloodletting , nor the jirga that followed it ( which stung Mr Kamal and his tribe for $ 60,000 ) , seem even to have been mentioned in the Pakistani press .
Asked whether he saw any contradiction in a senior lawmaker instigating such extreme violence , Mr Kamal appeared astonished .
“ Well , we do n't claim this is something to be proud of , ” he stuttered .
“ But it is a question of prestige , you see , a question of honour . ”
In other words , he might have said , paraphrasing Mr Khan : it is his sin that he is Pushtun .
It is over 250 years since Afghanistan was cobbled together , from many ethnic groups , and two centuries since British colonisers tried stretching their writ to India 's ( now Pakistan 's ) north - western frontier , where the plains crumple up towards the Hindu Kush .
Yet , in both places , a large part of the population is still wedded to Pushtunwali .
Some 15 m Pushtuns live in Afghanistan , or 50 % of its population ; and 28 m in Pakistan , mostly in NWFP , representing about 15 % of the population there .
Most of them are ruled by their tribal code , the notable exception being where the rival Islamist code , of the stringent Saudi variety which is preached by the Taliban and quite new to Afghanistan , is strong .
Islamism has rivalled Pushtunwali for centuries ; it has often gained prominence , as currently , in time of war .
More typically , the two competing ways have cross-fertilised in Afghanistan , each subtly influencing the other .
Pushtunwali's principles have not changed in centuries — certainly not since they were recorded by Victorian ethnographers , middle - class soldiers and civil servants : players of the Great Game .
Most lionised the fierce tribesmen , who periodically murdered them .
Some even swallowed a delicious Pushtun claim to be descended from a lost tribe of Israel .
But not all Westerners fell for the Pushtun .
As a reporter for the Daily Telegraph , attached to the Malakand Field Force , Winston Churchill wrote : “ Their system of ethics , which regards treachery and violence as virtues rather than vices , has produced a code of honour so strange and inconsistent that it is incomprehensible to a logical mind . ”
Pushtun amateur genealogists ( that is , most Pushtun men ) say Pushtunwali is 5,000 years old .
But as Pushtu was first written less than 500 years ago , the theory is hard to test .
The code 's sine qua non is honour , or nang , a word which , according to Sir Olaf Caroe , an imperial scholar of the Pushtuns , contains a mythical sense of chastity .
According to Khusal Khan Khattak , a great 17th - century Pushtun poet , credited with 45,000 poems : “ I despise the man who does not guide his life by nang , / the very word nang drives me mad ! ”
In dusty Pushtun villages today , few bearded men would not nod approvingly at this .
“ Any man who loses his honour must be completely ostracised , ” said Sandaygul , a long - beard of the Mangal tribe in Afghanistan 's south - eastern Paktia province .
“ No one would congratulate him on the birth of child .
No one would marry his daughter .
No one would attend his funeral .
His disgrace will endure for generations .
He and his family must move away . ”
In Pushtu , to be disgraced means literally to be an outsider .
The insulting Americans
There are infinite ways to slight a Pushtun 's nang , but most involve zar , zan or zamin : gold , women or land .
The search tactics of American troops in Afghanistan , five years after they invaded the country , tend to offend on all counts .
By forcing entry into the mud-fortress home of a Pushtun , with its lofty buttresses and loopholes , they dishonour his property .
By stomping through its female quarters , they dishonour his women .
Worse , the search may end with the householder handcuffed and dragged off before his neighbours : his person disgraced .
America and its allies face a complicated insurgency in Afghanistan , driven by many factors .
But such tactics are among them .
Corbis
None is more equal than others
His honour besmirched — and here 's the problem for the Americans — a Pushtun is obliged to have his revenge , or badal .
Last year , in one of the myriad such examples that arise in conversations in northern Pakistan and Afghanistan , the daughter of a prominent businessman in Gardez , Paktia 's capital , eloped with her beau .
So the businessman sold up his property , moved to Kabul and tracked down and killed his daughter 's lover .
His daughter , whom he must also kill if the stain is to be removed , has been given sanctuary by a human - rights organisation .
Her prospects are not good .
According to a Pushtu saying : “ A Pushtun waited 100 years , then took his revenge .
It was quick work . ”
In addition , the honourable Pushtun embraces two obligations .
He will offer hospitality , malmastai , to anyone needing it .
And he will give sanctuary , nanawatai , to whoever requests it .
Stories of extreme generosity are common in Pushtun places .
Near the village of Saidkhail , in the Zadran tribal area of eastern Khost province , a wandering Islamic student , or talib , killed a man with a knife , recounts Mohammed Omar Barakzai , the deputy minister for tribal affairs .
The talib knocked on the nearest door and said to the woman who opened it : “ I have killed a man .
Shelter me . ”
She let him in .
And sure enough , to trim an elegantly told tale , the murdered man was the woman 's son .
“ I am a Pushtun and have given this man refuge , ” the woman told her blood - lusting husband and brothers .
“ Take him to safety . ”
“ Their system of ethics , which regards treachery and violence as virtues rather than vices ... is incomprehensible to a logical mind ” — Churchill
But Pushtunwali is not all fierce imperatives .
The code also contains many flexible means of preventing conflict through consensus and compromise .
Chief among these is the jirga , of which each of Afghanistan 's main groups , Uzbeks , Tajiks , Pashai , Hazaras and Baloch , has its version .
By one estimate , jirgas settle over 95 % of Afghanistan 's disputes , civil and criminal .
The figure for northern Pakistan is perhaps only slightly lower .
This is not just because the regular courts are incompetent and corrupt ( Afghanistan 's were recently reformed by Italy ) .
It is because , given high levels of illiteracy , many Afghans and Pakistanis find it easier to understand unwritten customary law , in Pushtu called narkh .
And , where authority is contested by a well - armed citizenry , the jirga 's verdicts , delivered with the warring parties ' consent , tend to be more enforceable than off - the - peg legal or Islamic judgments .
AFP
A juddering two - hour drive from Peshawar , at Jamrud , in Khyber Agency , a 60 - strong jirga recently settled half a dozen cases in a day — more than a bent Pakistani magistrate might manage in a week .
Two disputes over money and property , including one involving the murder of five people , were ended with compromises .
A dispute over a murderer who had been given sanctuary by a neighbour was postponed , pending deliberation from the spingeeri— literally , white - beards — who make up the jirga on a forerunning series of killings .
A man accused of “ adultery ” , of rape in fact , was told to pay 1 m Pakistani rupees ( $ 16,500 ) to his victim 's family ; he may thank his stars he had lived so long .
Among the spingeeri sat Adam Khan Afridi , who had himself been judged shortly before .
For 25 years he squabbled with a cousin over which of them would inherit an uncle 's lands , until Mr Khan killed his cousin and his cousin 's sons and grandson .
Then he killed their uncle .
This was excessive , Mr Khan conceded ; he had committed the crime of miratha — annihilating every male in the rival camp .
The jirga decreed that two of Mr Khan 's houses be destroyed , and fined him 500,000 rupees .
He thought this harsh .
Jirgas do even greater service , as with the Marwat and the Bhattani , in ending tribal wars .
On a chill recent morning in Kabul , your correspondent sat with a jirga convened to settle a dispute between two nomadic clans of the Siddiquekhail , a sub-tribe of the powerful Pushtun Ahmedzai .
In 1980 , a 17 - year - old youth of one the clans , named Babur , disappeared while travelling through Pakistan with members of the other ; then in 1992 , a 60 - year - old shepherd of the second clan was found murdered , allegedly killed with an axe by an uncle of Babur .
Previous attempts to settle the dispute had foundered in part on a deposit of $ 10,000 that each tribe had been asked to lodge with the jirga , with a vow to abide by its decision .
“ It is time for this feud to end , ” said Haji Naim Kuchi , the chief mediator , or narkhi , and member of a different Ahmedzai clan .
“ You should be at home sleeping with your wives , not plotting to kill each other ! ”
Mr Kuchi , who is famed for his deep knowledge of customary law , asked the feuders to “ place a stone ” on their dispute — to suspend hostilities while the jirga sat .
“ We all know that if this continues many men will die before you return to the jirga , ” said Mr Kuchi , who had been released from American custody shortly before , after three years ' imprisonment without trial in Guantánamo Bay .
To settle disputes , Mr Kuchi has two main options .
He can order a guilty party to compensate its victim with cash , a practice known as wich pur , “ dry debt ” , or he can order the two parties to exchange women , or lund pur , “ wet debt ” .
By binding the antagonists together — just as in medieval European diplomacy — lund pur is considered more effective .
Typically it involves exchanging a 15 - year - old , a ten - year - old and a five - year - old girl , to be married into three succeeding generations of the enemy clan .
Thereby , and though human - rights groups understandably revile the practice , Pushtuns have peace and happy grandfathers .
“ Blood can not wash away blood , ” runs a Pushtu proverb .
“ But blood can be turned into love . ”
In a land far , far away
If Pushtunwali is about more than killing , its strictures are still remarkably unforgiving .
Many Tajiks , like Pushtuns , would die before they suffered a slight .
But , unlike Pushtuns , they do not fear their peeved neighbours to the extent of living in castles .
A recent European Union analysis of jirgas in eastern Afghanistan found that elopement was the crime most often heard by Pashai jirgas , but Pushtun jirgas rarely considered it .
That could be because few Pushtun lads and lasses elope or , more likely , because they are more likely to be killed when they do .
What makes Pushtunwali so durable and so harsh ?
One reason is remoteness .
At the confluence of civilisations , between Central Asia , ancient Persia and India 's plains , Afghanistan has been contested by marauding armies and strange traders for millennia .
A ruined capital , or two , lies buried in most of its 34 provinces , and each has left its trace in the languages and traditions of today .
Pashto , for example , is believed to have originated in Bactrian , the language spoken by Greek descendants of Alexander the Great .
And yet the wildest Pushtun places , especially along the lofty border where the strictest Pushtunwali is practised , have been relatively untouched by outsiders for centuries .
Waziristan , in Pakistan 's semi-autonomous tribal area , has never been held by any foreign power .
Another reason for Pushtunwali's rude health lies in the nature of Pushtun society .
Once rulers of Delhi , in the ranks of the Mughal emperors , and never vanquished for long , Pushtuns consider their society every bit as superior as Winston Churchill considered his .
And it is defined by Pushtunwali : there is no Pushtun nation or , in fact , ethnicity .
A Pushtun is simply someone who speaks Pushtu and who therefore follows the tribal code : Pushtunwali literally means to “ do Pushtu ” .
A third factor promoting Pushtunwali is one of its most appealing features , egalitarianism .
Leadership among Pushtuns is rarely inherited .
It is more often bestowed by a jirga on merit .
Even then , the most elevated Pushtun elder dares not condescend to another man of his tribe .
When lunch is served at a Pushtun feast , with tasty dishes of mutton , raisins and rice , there are no servants , but servers , of equal status to host and guests .
Where a good name is the cost of social inclusion , Pushtuns will fight to keep it so .
Compensation typically involves exchanging a 15 - year - old , a ten - year - old and a five - year - old girl , to be married into three succeeding generations of the enemy clan
It is above all this political function that makes Pushtunwali so resistant to change ; but it is not unchanging .
Pushtun tribes constantly update their code .
Three years ago , the Mangals of Paktia ended a practice of revenge - taking by proxy , whereby a weak man had only to slaughter a sheep outside the house of his stronger neighbour to make him accept his blood - debt .
“ We were doing too much killing , ” explained Sandaygul , the Mangal in Gardez .
More traumatic change to the code has come from external pressures .
In urban places , where the Pakistani and Afghan states somewhat function , aspects of Pushtunwali have been jettisoned ; jirgas of the Kasi tribe , which is based in the Pakistani city of Quetta , rarely meet .
More powerful opposition has come from political Islam , which seeks to replace the authority of the jirga with the mullah , customary law with Islamic sharia .
AFP
Over the past millennium or so , the Pushtuns ' religious and tribal codes have roughly co-existed .
As a mark of a time - honoured accommodation , Pushtun elders and mullahs often insist there is no contradiction between the two prerogatives .
“ The sharia and jirga systems are not opposed , ” said Maulvi Sayeed , a member of the Muslim council , or shura , in Kandahar , capital of southern Afghanistan .
“ To solve a problem through the use of a shura , a council , is the aim of both .
The jirga is not against sharia law .
If there has been a murder then the aim is to satisfy the relatives of the victim , ” said the mullah , seated cross -legged amid stacks of religious texts , with a vast white turban atop his grizzled head .
In fact , sharia courts , which in Afghanistan are often indistinguishable from regular courts , are an alternative to blood - feuding and jirgas .
Like jirgas , they can urge the victims of a crime to settle the matter through compensation .
But where this is rejected , the courts can issue death sentences , or other harsh penalties , which jirgas do not .
A plaintiff who is unhappy with a jirga 's verdict may seek an alternative ruling from a sharia court .
According to Maulvi Sayeed : “ If the brother of a man who has been murdered does not agree to forgive his killer according to the jirga , then he can go to the sharia court .
If the murder was unjust then the sharia court will say that the killer has to be killed . ”
Another big difference between the codes is in their treatment of women .
In sharia law , there can be no exchange of women as a means to end disputes , and women are guaranteed some rights of inheritance — unlike in Pushtunwali .
Nor does sharia law recognise the Pushtun habit of wife inheritance , wherein a widow is forcibly married to her dead husband 's brother or cousin .
“ Such things happen when people are uneducated , ” sniffed Maulvi Sayeed .
“ We do n't oppose the system of tribal elders but they must follow the way of Islam .
They can convene jirgas and dispense the law , but the law must be that of sharia . ”
Though fiercely religious , Pushtuns have mostly preferred their leaders and law to be tribal .
The great exception has been in times of duress , when a standard is needed to rally their fractious tribes and sub-tribes : then they have tended to hoist the flag of jihad .
Of the 19th - century Masood tribe of Waziristan , Sir Olaf wrote that they wanted “ at all costs to resist subjection and to preserve their own peculiar way of life .
To attain this end they were always prepared to make use of adventitious aids such as appeals with a pan-Islamic flavour . ”
Thus the jihad launched in the 1980s against Soviet invaders united all Afghan tribes .
It was generously backed by Saudi Arabia and America and given sanctuary by Pakistan , which was home to 3 m Afghan refugees .
Yet still its Pushtun leaders found it necessary brutally to suppress their tribal peers , terrorising the refugee camps and murdering the jirga - leaders who defied them there .
In the early 1990s , after the Soviets had been driven out and the former jihadist chiefs were fighting a civil war , Pushtuns again rallied around Islam .
A band of Ghilzai Pushtuns near Kandahar , led by a mullah named Omar , backed by Pakistan and calling themselves the Taliban , raised the black flag .
Gushing with Islamist zeal , Pushtun youths rushed to join them as they swept the feuding militias away .
But once the Taliban restored order to most of Afghanistan , Pushtuns began recoiling against their rulings .
Their public executions and other outrages to public decency were anathema to them .
So too when the Taliban — despite their celebrated chauvinism — outlawed wich pur and advocated female inheritance .
No wonder if the lives of the vast majority of Afghan women have not eased since the Taliban were bombed from power .
AP
For two years after their demise , the Taliban were not mourned in Afghanistan .
But since then an insurgency has gathered pace .
It is not quite clear what is driving it .
An exploding opium harvest , which is providing cash for the Taliban and a reason for Pushtun farmers to keep the government away , is one reason .
Another , as Sir Olaf might have foretold , is the response of the most remote and traditional Pushtuns to a foreign invasion .
In late 2001 , thousands of Taliban and several hundred Arab and Central Asian followers of Osama bin Laden poured into northern Pakistan 's tribal areas — including Waziristan , home of the Masood .
To hunt them , and in a bid to save Western troops in Afghanistan from the same cross - border insurgency that hobbled the Soviet Union , Pakistan sent 80,000 troops into the tribal areas .
Alas , they have achieved the very opposite effect of that intended .
Calling themselves the Pakistan Taliban , fighters of Waziristan 's main tribes have rallied against the army , killing several hundred soldiers .
As in the former refugee camps , jihadist assassins have killed several hundred Pushtun elders , ensuring that sharia , not Pushtunwali , is the law .
If history is any guide , the Pushtun will continue their drift to Islamist militancy until they are defeated , which looks impossible , or the outside forces are withdrawn
If history is any guide , many Pushtuns in northern Pakistan and southern Afghanistan will continue their drift to Islamist militancy until they are defeated , which looks impossible , or the Pakistani and Western forces are withdrawn .
They are then likely to return to their simmeringly murderous tribal ways .
That would be better than the current mess .
But it would also leave millions of people outside the writ of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
If either state is to succeed , the alternative writs of Pushtunwali and jihadist Islam will have to wither .
But that will not be soon .
To imagine quite how long it may take , consider Nakband .
It is a suburb of Peshawar , the most developed Pushtun city , a mere two - hour drive from Pakistan 's smart capital of Islamabad .
Yet it is little different from the craggy and forbidding tribal areas , where Pakistan 's constitution does not apply .
Nakband 's inhabitants have no state services except the electricity they steal from the mains .
There is no half - serious hospital for 20 miles .
Pushtunwali , with a sprinkling of the Koran , is the law in Nakband .
Blood - feuding , as marked by the ratchet of gunfire in the unbroken gloom of night , is routine .
The government makes no effort to intervene in these disputes .
Combing his long black hair beside a baked - mud road , a resident of Nakband said that , in theory , the city police were free to enter his suburb .
But the locals had not permitted them to do so , so far as he could recall , since 1998 .
The love hotel is an icon of Japanese culture , the thought of which warms the hearts ( and loins ) , of both Japanese and foreigners alike .
Stippy.com plans to showcase the most wacky and interesting love hotels in Japan , complete with video footage of the interior of each one , including Alcatraz – The Rock in Gunma Prefecture , the conspicuous Hotel Sexus in Kyoto , and of course the historical Meguro Emperor .
Look out for these original videos and critiques throughout this year !
The rationale and logic behind the creation of love hotels is simple – Japanese houses have traditionally been very small , with thin walls , and , even still in some cases today , all members of the family sleep in the same room lined up in futons along the floor .
Often , the grandparents will also live in the same house .
Thus , there is no place for husband and wife to go , making a love hotel an attractive place , not only just to spend a raunchy time with your spouse , but also to get some time away from the family for a couple of quiet hours !
The demand for hotels increases exponentially when you include singles who still live with their parents , common especially for those born in Tokyo where is does n’t make sense to pay to rent your own apartment as well as those people in Sexless Marriages , a topic which has been discussed at length at Stippy.com .
It appears that in many cases the marriage can be sexless , but not so for the husband and wife individually .
These people form part of the regular clientèle for hotels , and it is no surprise that love hotels are now scattered all throughout Japan , and are a booming business .
The Rock hotel in Gunma – pictured on the right – a major tourist puller !
The idea that hotels are a great business opportunity has not been lost by a company founded by foreigners in Tokyo who have formed a Leisure Hotel fund , and are buying up hotels around the Tokyo region .
They have had great success in entering an industry that has been notoriously difficult for reputable companies to enter .
Anyway , back to the good stuff , the way it works is simple :
You pay for either a “ rest ” , usually 2 or 3 hours , or for the evening , usually until 10 am the next morning .
The costs are around 3,000 yen for a rest , and 10,000 yen for the entire evening , although it gets much more expensive for more popular and wacky the hotel gets .
The larger size of the room , the more expensive also .
Most hotels do not take bookings .
For an overnight stay , you usually need to arrive between 8 - 10 pm on weeknights , and 10 - 12 am on Fridays and Saturdays .
In some hotels , leaving the room forfeits your access and you cant get back in .
However once you are in , you definitely will not be bothered !
In the lobby of the hotel is a big board with pictures of each room , with differing price depending on the size and “ amenities ” etc .
When you arrive at the hotel , you can select the type of room which takes your fancy and fits your budget by looking at the pictures on the board .
Check - in is done ( almost ) anonymously by pressing lit up button on the board which corresponds to the room you want .
If the button and back lighting behind the picture on the board is not lit , it means that room is taken .
Once the button is pressed , a gender - neutral old lady will come to the reception with a key .
The reception is basically a hole in the wall , at about waist height to ensure secrecy .
You pass the money through , and receive the key .
In some hotels payment can be made by a automatic machine in each room , or by using an “ air - chute ” which connects to the reception .
The irony of the price of a night in a hotel is that it is often cheaper than a regular hotel , and regular hotels do n’t usually come with plasma TVs , full - sized beer vending machines , spa baths , rotating beds , PlayStations , and karaoke !
Love hotels also can come equipped with any of : water bed , SM chair , wardrobes of costumes , disco balls hanging from the roof , pachinko machines , massage chairs , spa baths , and even sometimes a sauna !
Now thats what I can leisure …
Weird Hotels :
You can choose to be locked in this thing .. whatever it is !
Love hotels tend to be clustered in the big cities , and a local pastime is “ love hotel shopping ” , where couples can be seen walking in and out of the lobbies of adjacent hotels looking to see what types of rooms there are .
From a foreign perspective an area of clustered love hotels would seem to be a seedy environment inhabited by pimpy old men with unsavoury women in tow , however this is not the case .
On a Friday or Saturday night in these areas , many a young happy couple can be spotted hand in hand darting in and out of hotels with enjoyable and fun expressions on their faces .
They are just normal people who have nowhere else to go , and the area can have quite a romantic atmosphere .
The interior of many hotels has an element of fantasy , to help people escape from the Taihen Cloud which hovers over their regular lives .
The elaborate decor can range from semi-normal , to simulated subway or religious bondage , with also sorts of kink in between .
A Kitty - chan theme ( pictured on left ) .
One for Paris Hilton perhaps ?
There are a number of interesting books already out in English such as Pink Samurai , which covers the history of love hotels and this aspect of Japanese culture in details , as well as Love Hotels , in which American photographer Misty Keasler portrays some of the newest , most creative love hotels in Japan , or aggregated introduction websites such as the Love - Guide ( Japanese ) .
We will also be posting interesting videos and our thoughts on the newest , coolest , and weirdest love hotels in Japan over the coming year , so do n’t forget to check back with us when you have a free few minutes every now and then .
We would also love to hear some suggestions from people of hotels that we must include , as well as peoples interesting love hotel stories !
We are prepared to go and do a video shoot of certain hotels that you loved , if you recommend them enough !

CLORB : CORBA for Lisp December 31 , 2006
Well , I thought about it for awhile and decided I would post something about CLORB in particular .
Where I work we use CORBA as the transport for our grids .
I have always wanted to be able to use Lisp as a client– yay !
CLORB .
Now , I know there are other CORBA implementations for Lisp– but this one is free .
That last word there – free– is very , very important when you are trying to establish a foothold for Lisp in the corporate IT world .
I use SBCL on Linux and CLISP on Windows because they are free .
That means I do n’t have to go through the entire process of requesting funds for LispWorks or ACL .
Which , also means , I do n’t have to justify an expense for something no one else in the company for which I work is using .
So , now that I have free Lisp tools and CLORB I can interoperate with all of the other services that have been developed in other languages at the company I work .
The interesting thing about this use of free tools is that once I have a few projects / services in place using Lisp I can justify actually buying LispWorks or ACL if needed .
Now back to CLORB– I was very happy at how easy it was to get a client up and talking to a python service .
I am using OmniNames as my nameservice .
The following snippet will enable the connection and use of a corba service– in this case the python corba service provides a single method called getsyphs .
( require : asdf ) ( require : sb-bsd- sockets ) ( require : clorb ) ( defvar * orb * ( CORBA:ORB_init ( list " - ORBInitRef " " NameService=corbaloc : :10.85.90.144:2809 /NameService " ) ) ) ( corba:idl " syph.idl " ) ( defvar * obj * ( op:resolve_initial_references * orb * " NameService " ) ) ( defvar *rc * ( op:narrow ' cosnaming:namingcontextext * ob j * ) ) ( defvar syph ( op:resolve " BCS.syph/BCSSyph.Object " ) ) ( defvar rt ( op:narrow ' BCS : Syph syph ) ) ( op:getsyphs rt " 014600 AIR CANADA " )
The only downside I have experienced with CLORB is that it depends on cpp to preprocess idl .
This is a small problem if you are on Windows and do n’t have a cpp .
I got around it by having CLORB generate all of the Lisp code to a single file for the idl on Linux .
( CORBA : IDL " syph.idl " : output " syph.lisp " )
Then in CLISP on my Windows box I replaced
( corba:idl " syph.idl " )
with
( load " syph.lisp " )
and all was happy .

President Pervez Musharraf 's immediate threat may no longer be militants , or nuclear rival India , or an American Congress that is increasingly skeptical of the general 's rate of return when it comes to the US - led war on terrorism .
This week , it is the ordinary citizens laying siege to his regime that could be more potent than any other threat , analysts say .
In an unexpected show of force , hundreds of lawyers and opposition politicians clashed with police on Friday and Saturday in Islamabad and Lahore , protesting the removal of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammed Chaudhry .
Some of Musharraf 's own party members have turned on him , and more protests are on the way .
Few say that they expect this to prove the undoing of the Musharraf regime .
But the rattled opposition , long dismissed as ineffective or dead , has a new rallying cry .
In championing constitutional rule , their united stance is quickly winning public opinion to their favor , considerably weakening Musharraf 's reelection bid , observers say .
" If anybody thinks maintaining a dictatorship is easy – this is not Burma or Egypt .
People will stand up , " says Shafqat Mahmood , an independent political analyst in Lahore .
More than 100 protesters arrested
For almost a full week , Pakistan 's major cities have seen a surge of violent protests against Musharraf 's regime , pitting lawyers and intellectuals in bloody confrontation with the police .
The spontaneous political reaction surprised many Pakistanis ; given how carefully Musharraf 's regime divided political parties over the years , many in the country 's political establishment had written off the opposition 's ability to push back against the president .
After years of building or burning bridges of political convenience , and working loopholes in the Constitution , the president has left the opposition and most political institutions stymied by apathy , internal conflict , or both .
" This is the cleverness of Musharraf 's regime , the use of intelligence agencies and state institutions to scatter the political parties so there is no unity , " says Mustak Ali Khan , a member of the provincial council of Jemaat - Islami , one of Pakistan 's largest opposition Islamist parties .
The protests , now a week old , come at a critical juncture , observers say , and could snowball into an even larger movement .
At their core is a new middle class which , with greater access to electronic media and more wealth , could prove instrumental in inspiring others to join the fray .
" They 're the ones who have sacrificed their lives for democracy in the past .
And I think they 're ready to take bullets again , " says Rasul Bahksh Rais , a professor of political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences .
So far , as many as 100 people have been arrested .
On Saturday , police injured 55 lawyers during a violent protest in Lahore .
But the more the Musharraf regime cracks down , the more it appears to fan the fires of resentment and depletes whatever shreds of goodwill remain , according to observers .
But leaving the protests alone could prove more damaging for Musharraf .
After seven years of military rule , Musharraf has a lot of enemies that could come out of the woodwork .
The man who took Musharraf to task
Attacking the judiciary appears to have been a serious miscalculation .
Although weakened , it is considered the most sacred institution in Pakistan .
Chief Justice Chaudhry has proved to be an outspoken member of an institution known for its acquiescence .
His abrupt checks on government power – including chastising the regime for failing to trace disappeared terrorism suspects – suggested that he alone might , if so inclined , rebuke Musharraf 's bid to run for reelection in uniform , observers say .
His removal last week , on charges of misconduct that have so far not been made public , seemed designed to pave the remaining way for Musharraf 's reelection , critics say , which the constitution technically prevents .
Chaudhry 's hearing before a Supreme Court panel began on Friday .
He denies the charges .
The government dismisses allegations of foul play , saying that Chaudhry was legally removed according to constitutional provisions , since charges of misconduct have been building against him for months .
It remains unclear how these convulsions will affect the elections scheduled for later this year , although the government insists it will have no impact .
Some believe that , greatly embarrassed by this episode , Musharraf will face even more dismal support at the polls .
Many also fear that , given his eroding political support , Musharraf will attempt aggressive measures to hold onto power , including postponing elections or declaring a state of emergency .
" It 's a new kind of tension of two imperatives , " says Mr. Mahmood , adding that the unprecedented display of opposition may invite unprecedented forms of backlash from the regime .
The only way out for Musharraf , some say , is to apologize and reinstate Chaudhry – though such a move , they add , is highly unlikely .
Ms Royal and Mr Sarkozy represent a break with old - style French politics
Centre - right candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Segolene Royal defeated 10 others in Sunday 's ballot , with a record voter turnout of nearly 85 % .
Mr Sarkozy garnered 31 % of the vote , while Ms Royal , bidding to be France 's first female leader , took nearly 26 % .
Opinion polls after the result showed Mr Sarkozy would win the run-off .
On Monday , Mr Sarkozy is due to address a rally in the eastern city of Dijon and Ms Royal is due in Valence , in southern France .
Middle ground
Voters are now faced with a clear left - right choice .
That political divide may be a return to French tradition , but both candidates are something new for France , says the BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Paris .
Mr Sarkozy , the son of a Hungarian immigrant , has a free market stance that sometimes seems closer to that of Britain or the US and an aggressive image that is also a departure from the patrician style of past presidents .
He is hated by the left as a reformer who many fear would change the French way of life by making the nation work harder and longer and by cutting back on its generous welfare state .
Ms Royal is a woman who fought her way to the candidacy against the will of her senior Socialist colleagues , our correspondent says .
Her campaign has been dogged by wrangles over policy and a series of gaffes .
She is a regional leader whose presidential pledges include a higher minimum wage along with a new form of youth job contract , to ensure that the young in France have a chance of entering the tough job market that all but the best - qualified feel excluded from .
But the run -off could be won by an appeal to the middle ground - and the 18 % of voters who supported the centrist Francois Bayrou on Sunday , our correspondent says .
Mr Sarkozy addressed a cheering crowd at his election headquarters , after winning the highest number of votes for a candidate in the first round since 1974 .
He said France had chosen to have a real debate between two different types of politics and asked people to rally behind him .
Ms Royal said she represented those who wanted to " reform France without brutalising it " .
NEXT STAGE OF ELECTION 27 April : Campaigning restarts 2 May : Televised debate 6 May : Second round poll 10 May : Final official results
Q&A : French election
In depth : France decides
She is said to have already received pledges of support from the other six left - wing candidates who won a total of about 10 % .
But the far - right National Front , whose leader Jean - Marie Le Pen failed to reach the second round as he did in 2002 , said their voters " were not for sale " - an apparent warning shot to Mr Sarkozy .
Opinion polls taken after Sunday 's results gave Mr Sarkozy between 52 and 54 % of the vote - against 46 and 48 % for Ms Royal .
And only 14 % were uncertain of who they wanted to cast their ballot for .

Fooling most of the people all of the time is standard job procedure for Washington 's state managers , who could no more level with the common citizen than would the CEO of a giant corporation level with the temporary help .
Compared to the replicating managerial class the citizenry is temporary , lacking the insights and having none of the tools necessary to interpret , let alone affect , public and foreign policy .
Government does not have the right to privacy , yet it enjoys it .
The Bill of Rights specifically and diametrically affords the people that right , " extending the ground of public confidence in the Government " , but increasingly the people lack it .
The powerful in every age and place entitle themselves to secrecy for some higher good - that there are some things it would n't do for the public to know , that the rabble has to be protected from themselves .
This is far from unique to our neoconservative shadow government , although there 's a case for their abusing the privilege .
The population is kept informed just enough to be able to follow their cues .
Please your superiors , stand erect when the national anthem is played and salute when that flag goes by .
Genuflect to leaders who mouth words like liberty , justice , and democracy .
Following the cues will lead one in the desired direction of conformity where ideas are framed in ways that assure American motivations are cast in the most favorable light .
Consider the adjectives used to describe the Cheney team 's handling of Iraq - mistake , folly , misadventure , blunder - terms used equally by critics from the left and right .
These terms seem to convey more than they actually do because they overlook the initial motivation for the attack and deal only with its aftermath .
The cat burglar does not blunder in pulling off the gem heist , only when tripping up and getting caught .
On the surface , the current situation pits those who are weary of the losing struggle ( loss of life , limb , wealth , and reputation with nothing to show for it ) against those who feel that hunkering down may still save the day ( American pride and honor in not letting it " get worse " ) .
Superficial talk aside , attempting to describe the Iraq situation without an understanding of the original motivation for our attack is like trying to figure out how far away you are without knowing what you were heading for .
The Cheney team cannot state clearly why they want to stay because that would reveal the truth about why they wanted to go .
At stake are Middle East energy resources , the control of which transcends this particular administration and has been fundamental US policy since after the second World War , now an even greater imperative due to peak oil scenario ( Recall the vice president 's still - secret energy meetings ) .
The issue is not access to the oil - it is control - and the enemies are not Iraq , Iran , and Syria but China , in the main , and to lesser degrees Russia , India , Japan , possibly even a united Europe .
The Middle East is either going to be linked up to the " West " ( meaning the US ) or go over to the Asian bloc ( meaning China ) , and the power that goes with this control is enough to make or break a superpower .
That 's why we went , that 's why we 're staying , and that 's what can not be stated in the polite circles of influential opinion .

Here 's a comprehensive and idiot - proof guide for utilizing NdisWrapper .
It 's extracted from Beginning Ubuntu Linux , Second Edition .
The guide is part of Chapter 8 , which provides a full guide to hardware configuration under Ubuntu ( including network devices , printers , scanners , 3D cards , and more ) .
In addition to detailing how to install / remove NdisWrapper drivers , this massive 3,500 word guide includes the vital steps of precisely matching the correct driver to the hardware , and then extracting the necessary files from Windows driver archive files .
These steps are frequently overlooked by other guides and are a brick wall for many users .
The guide is aimed at Ubuntu Edgy Eft ( 6.10 ) users , although it should work on other versions of Ubuntu , including Feisty Fawn ( 7.04 ) .
In fact , with the application of some common sense , it should work on most other distros ( a modified version of the guide is included in my other recent book , Beginning SUSE Linux , Second Edition ) .
Without further ado , let 's get on with it .
Using NdisWrapper
NdisWrapper is effectively an open - source driver ( technically described as a kernel module ) that allows Linux to use standard Windows XP drivers for wireless network devices .
You might describe NdisWrapper as being a translation layer between the Linux kernel and the Windows drivers , which can be installed using NdisWrapper ’s configuration tools .
You should only use NdisWrapper in one of two situations :
Your wireless network hardware simply is n’t recognized by Ubuntu , which is to say , no entry for the wireless hardware appears in the list of network devices in the Network Settings configuration dialog .
Your network hardware is recognized by Ubuntu but fails to work correctly when you configure it .
Perhaps it is unable to associate with wireless base stations , for example .
If this is the case , in addition to installing NdisWrapper , you ’ll have to undertake an additional step in order to blacklist the existing Ubuntu driver .
This is explained later .
Using NdisWrapper is relatively simple and just a handful of commands are required .
However , getting hold of the necessary Windows driver files is harder work because , unfortunately , NdisWrapper is n’t designed to work with the usual method of driver distribution : . exe files .
Instead , NdisWrapper needs the specific .inf and .sys files that constitute the driver — effectively , the Windows system files .
In many cases , these are contained within the .exe file and must be manually extracted .
Note
Of course , sometimes drivers are distributed as .zip files , in which case the relevant files are easy to get at .
Keep your fingers crossed that this will be the case for your particular hardware !
NdisWrapper is far from perfect .
Not all wireless devices have been proven to work with it , and it ’s not necessarily the case that a driver available for Windows will work under Linux .
Sometimes trial and error is required .
Annoyingly , Windows drivers sometimes appear to work but then prove unreliable .
Some might stop working .
Some might even crash your system .
The best plan is simply to give it a try .
Tip NdisWrapper gets better and better with every new release .
This is why it ’s a good idea to update your system on a regular basis .
I give full details of how this can be done in Chapter 9 of Beginning Ubuntu Linux , Second Edition .
I 'm going to explain how to make an Asus 802.11g wireless network device that ’s built into an Asus A6R notebook work under Ubuntu using NdisWrapper .
The instructions remain essentially the same for all types of wireless network hardware .
However , some specific details , such as download addresses , will obviously differ .
First , I explain how to install the NdisWrapper software .
Next , I explain how to discover what Windows drivers you need .
Following this , I explain how to extract the necessary files from the driver archive , and finally , how to actually install the Windows drivers under Ubuntu .
You might also need to blacklist the existing Linux driver , which I also cover .
These steps merely make your wireless network device available under Ubuntu .
Once completed , you should use the standard network configuration utilities to associate with your router or base station .
This is covered in detail in Chapter 8 of Beginning Ubuntu Linux , Second Edition .
Installing the NdisWrapper Configuration Tools
NdisWrapper consists of two components : a kernel module and configuration tools .
The kernel module comes as part of the default kernel package , so is installed by default .
Therefore , all you have to do is install the configuration tools .
Start Synaptic Package Manager , and search for and install ndiswrapper - utils - 1.8 .
You ’ll be told that ndiswrapper - common also needs to be installed .
This is fine .
Note Ensure that you select ndiswrapper - utils - 1.8 if you 're using Edgy Eft ( 6.10 ) , and not any other version of NdisWrapper !
A packaging bug means that other versions wo n't work correctly .
Installing the Windows XP Drivers
Once the NdisWrapper configuration software is installed , you can install the Windows XP wireless network device drivers .
There are three parts to the procedure :
Identify the wireless network hardware in your computer and then source the appropriate Windows driver .
Extract the necessary .sys and .inf files from the driver archive ( and possibly .bin files , although this is rare ) .
Use the NdisWrapper configuration tools to install the Windows driver , and tweak a configuration file so that the NdisWrapper kernel module loads each time you boot .
All three steps are dealt with separately in the following sections .
In later stages , you will need another computer that ’s already online to download some files and check the NdisWrapper web site for information .
If your computer dual - boots , you can use your Windows setup to do this .
Identifying Your Wireless Network Hardware and Sourcing Drivers
To identify the wireless network hardware for use with NdisWrapper , it ’s necessary to discover two pieces of information : the make and model of the hardware , and the PCI ID number .
The former is the make and model of the hardware , as identified by Ubuntu as a result of system probing , rather than what ’s quoted on the packaging for the wireless network device or in its documentation .
These details discovered by Ubuntu will usually relate to the manufacturer of the underlying components , rather than the company that manufactured the hardware .
The PCI ID is two four - digit hexadecimal numbers used by your computer to identify the device internally .
The same PCI ID numbering system is used by both Windows and Ubuntu , which is why it ’s so useful in this instance .
Follow these instructions to discover the information you need :
You can find both the PCI ID and the make / model information using the Device Manager tool .
Start System -> Administration -> Device Manager .
What you do now depends on whether your wireless hardware is recognized by Ubuntu ( which is to say , it appears in Network Settings but does n’t work properly ) .
If the device is n’t recognized , skip to the next step .
If it is recognized , look in the list of hardware that appears , and find the entry that reads WLAN Interface .
Then look at the entry immediately above this in the list , where you ’ll find listed the make and model of the hardware .
Write this down .
On my test notebook , containing an ASUS wireless network device , this read BCM4318 [ AirForce One 54g ] 802.11g Wireless Lan Controller .
As anticipated , these details do n’t relate to those listed in the wireless network device ’s documentation ( the notebook ’s manual lists the hardware simply as an ASUS 802.11g device ) .
This is because Ubuntu is identifying the hardware generically , reading information from its component hardware .
Select the WLAN Interface entry , and click the Advanced tab on the right side of the program window .
Then look through the information there for the line that begins net .
physical_device .
Look at the end of the line , and make a note of the two sets of letters and numbers that are separated by underscore characters and are preceded by pci_ .
On my test notebook , these were 14e4 and 4318 , as shown in the screenshot below , in which the relevant areas are highlighted .
If the wireless hardware is n’t recognized by Ubuntu ( which is to say , it does n’t appear in the Network Settings dialog box ) , look in the Device Manager list of hardware for an entry mentioning 802.11 , WLAN , or possibly simply " wireless " .
This entry in the list will be the make and model details you need , so write them down .
Next , select the wireless device ’s entry in the list , and click the Advanced tab on the right side of the window .
Look through the information there for a line that reads info.udi .
Look at the end of the line , and make a note of the two sets of letters and numbers that are separated by underscore characters and are preceded by pci_ .
Look at the screenshot below for guidance .
Note
These two clusters of letters and numbers are actually hexadecimal digits .
For more details on hexadecimal , see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal.
When written alongside each other , the two sets of digits you noted in step 2 or 3 become the PCI ID number .
In written form , they ’re usually separated by a colon , so in my case , the PCI ID of the wireless network device is 14e4:4318 .
If either of the sets of letters or numbers is less than four characters long , simply add zeros before them in order to make four characters .
For example , on my desktop PC , the end of the net .
physical_device line read 1814_201 .
I added a zero before 201 , making the complete PCI ID of 1814:0201 .
On another of my test PCs , the end of the line read 168c_13 .
I , therefore , added two zeros before the 13 to make a PCI ID of 168c:0013 .
Using another computer that ’s able to go online , visit http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List.
This is a community - generated listing of the wireless network devices that have been proven to work with NdisWrapper .
Using the search function of your browser ( Ctrl+ F within Firefox ) , look for the PCI ID number you noted earlier , in the format described in step 4 .
For example , with the PCI ID I discovered on my test notebook , I searched for 14e4:4318 .
In the list , look to match the following things , presented in order of importance :
- The PCI ID .
- The manufacturer and model name of the wireless hardware , as reported by Device Manager ; this will be listed in the Card : part of the entry in the list and / or within the Chipset : section too .
- The manufacturer and model of the notebook , as mentioned on its case or within its documentation .
This will be mentioned in the Card : or Chipset : sections or possibly within the Other : section .
It ’s likely many entries in the list may match your PCI ID , so search until you find the one that best matches the manufacturer and model of the hardware .
If there are still many matches , search until you find an entry that matches the manufacturer and model of the notebook .
You might not be lucky enough to find an exact match for the notebook manufacturer and model , however , and you might have to select the most likely choice .
Use your common sense and judgment .
If your notebook is manufactured by Asus , for example , but you ca n’t find the drivers for the exact model , then choose drivers for another Asus model .
Caution Unless you 're using a 64 - bit version of Ubuntu , watch out for any mention of x86_64 in the description of the driver file .
If you have n't specifically chosen to use 64 - bit Linux , you 'll probably be using 32 - bit .
If you encounter an entry relating to x86_64 , keep searching .
Look within the entry in the list for a direct link to the driver file .
Sometimes this is n’t given , and a manufacturer web site address will be mentioned , which you can visit and navigate through to the driver download section ( usually under the Support section within the web site ) .
Download the Windows XP driver release .
Extracting the Driver Components
Once the drivers are downloaded , you ’ll have to extract the .sys and .inf file relevant to your wireless network hardware .
These are all that NdisWrapper needs , and the rest of the driver files can be discarded .
However , extracting the files can be hard to do , because often they ’re contained within an .exe file .
Note Most driver .exe files are actually self - extracting archive files .
Additionally , the driver file might contain drivers for several different models of hardware , and it ’s necessary to identify the particular driver .inf file relevant to your wireless network device :
If the driver you ’ve downloaded is a .zip file , then your task will probably be much easier .
Simply double - click the downloaded .zip file to look within it for the directory containing the actual driver files .
Often this directory is called " driver " , or sometimes it ’s named after the OS for which it contains files , such as Win_XP .
If you ’ve ever installed Windows drivers then this will sound familiar .
Once you ’ve found the relevant directory , click and drag the .inf , .sys , and .bin files to a separate folder ( there probably wo n’t be any .bin files , however ) .
You can ignore any other files , such as .cab and .cat files .
Then go to step 4 .
If the driver is an .exe file , it ’s necessary to extract the files within it .
With any luck you might be able to do this using an archive tool like WinZip ( www.winzip.com), assuming that you ’ve downloaded the file using Windows .
Simply open the archive using the File ->
Open menu option within WinZip .
You may have to select All Files from the File Type drop - down list in order for the .exe file to show up in the file list .
However , if you ’re using Windows , I recommend an open - source and free of charge program called Universal Extractor , which can be downloaded from http://www.legroom.net/software/uniextract.
This program can extract files from virtually every kind of archive , including most driver installation files .
Once it is installed , simply right - click the installation .exe file , and select UniExtract to Subdir .
This will then create a new folder in the same directory as the downloaded file , containing the contents of the installer file .
As mentioned in step 1 , it ’s likely the driver files you need will be contained in a folder called something like Driver or Win_XP .
Once you ’ve found the relevant directory , look for .inf , .sys , and .bin files ( although you may not find any .bin files ; they ’re only used in a handful of drivers ) .
Click and drag the files to a separate folder .
You can ignore any other files , such as .cab and .cat files .
The task now is to find the .inf file for your hardware .
If there ’s only one .inf file , then you can move to the next step .
If there ’s more than one , you ’ll need to search each until you find the one you need .
You need to look for text that corresponds to the PCI ID you noted earlier .
Open the first .inf file in a text editor ( double - clicking will do this in Windows ) , and using the search tool , search for the first part of the PCI ID , as discovered earlier .
For example , I searched for 14e4 .
If this is n’t found within the file , move on to the next .inf file , and search again .
When you get a search match , it will probably be in a long line of text and to the right of the text VEN_ .
Then , look further along that line to see if the second part of the PCI ID is mentioned , probably to the right of text that reads DEV_ .
In the case of the driver file I downloaded , the entire line within the .inf file read as follows ( I ’ve highlighted the two component PCI ID parts in bold ) :
Code : %BCM430B_DeviceDesc % = BCM43XX , PCI \VEN_14E4&DEV_4318&SUBSYS_12F3103C
You must now transfer the .inf file , along with the .sys and .bin files ( if any .bin files were included with the driver ) to the computer on which you want to install the drivers .
This can be done by putting them onto a floppy disk , by burning them onto CD , or using a USB memory stick .
Blacklisting Existing Drivers
Your progress from this point onward depends on if Ubuntu recognized your wireless networking device when you first booted but was unable to make it work correctly .
If it did then you will have to blacklist the built - in driver , so that NdisWrapper can associate with the hardware .
If the device was n’t recognized , you can skip straight to the “ Using NdisWrapper to Install the Drivers ” heading .
To blacklist the existing driver , you need to find out the name of the kernel module and then add it to the /etc / modprobe.d/ blacklist file .
Here are the steps :
Open Device Manager ( System -> Administration -> Device Manager ) , and select the entry in the list for your wireless network device .
Click the entry mentioning the make and model of your network hardware .
Click the Advanced tab on the right - hand side of the window , and look for the line that begins info.linux .driver .
Then look in the value column , and make a note of what ’s there .
For example , on my test notebook , the value column read bcm43xx .
Close Device Manager , and open a terminal window ( Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal ) .
Type the following to open the blacklist configuration file in the Gedit text editor :
Code : gksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
At the bottom of the file , type the following on a new line :
Code : blacklist < modulename >
Code : blacklist bcm43xx
Using NdisWrapper to Install the Drivers
On the Ubuntu computer on which you wish to install the drivers , you should now have the .inf file from the previous steps , plus the .sys and possibly .bin files that constitute the driver .
Copy the files from the removable storage device into an empty folder on the desktop .
Name the new folder " driver " .
Note
If you ’ve used a USB memory stick to transfer the files , it should appear automatically on the desktop as soon as it ’s inserted .
When you ’ve finished with it , right - click the desktop icon , and select Eject .
You must do this before physically removing any kind of USB memory device .
I describe how to handle removable storage devices in Chapter 8 of Beginning Ubuntu Linux , Second Edition .
To install the driver using NdisWrapper , follow these instructions :
Open a terminal window ( Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal ) .
In the window , type the following to switch to the directory containing the driver files :
Code : cd /home /< username >/ Desktop/driver
To install the driver , type the following :
Code : sudo ndiswrapper –i filename.inf
Next , type the following :
Code : sudo ndiswrapper –m gksu gedit /etc / modules
Code : ndiswrapper
Save the file , close Gedit , and reboot your computer .
Following this , you should find the network device is available for configuration , such as associating with a wireless base station and configuring WEP / WPA .
I explain how to configure both WEP and the newer WPA in Chapter 8 of Beginning Ubuntu Linux , Second Edition .
Removing NdisWrapper Drivers
As mentioned earlier , although NdisWrapper can solve a lot of headaches with nonworking wireless hardware , it is n’t perfect .
You might find that the Windows driver you install simply does n’t work .
In such a case , you can download a different version of the driver and try again .
But first you ’ll need to uninstall the existing driver .
Open a terminal window , and type the following , which will cause NdisWrapper to list currently installed Windows drivers :
Code : sudo ndiswrapper –l
Code : bcmwl5 driver installer , hardware present
Code : sudo ndiswrapper –e < drivername >
Code : sudo ndiswrapper –e bcmwl5
Note The Broadcom BCM4318 wireless device , used as an example here , is extremely common in modern notebooks .
Although work is being undertaken to make it work under Ubuntu , at the time of this writing , support is patchy .
Therefore , a lot of Ubuntu users with notebooks containing this hardware utilize NdisWrapper to make it work .
In fact , a handful of community members got together and created an installation script to make the process a lot easier .
The script will automatically blacklist the existing driver and install a new one .

April 25 , 1953 - Francis Crick and James Watson publish their classic paper describing the double helix structure of the DNA .
James Dewey Watson ( born April 6 , 1928 ) is an American molecular biologist , best known as one of the discoverers of the structure of the DNA molecule .
Watson , Francis Crick , and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine " for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material " .
Born in Chicago , Illinois on April 6th , 1928 , Watson has been fascinated with bird watching since he was a child due to the influence of his father , James D. Watson , a businessman .
At the age of 12 , he starred on the Quiz Kids , a popular radio show that challenged precocious youngsters to answer difficult questions .
Thanks to the liberal policy of Robert Hutchins , he enrolled at the age of 15 at the University of Chicago .
During his years as a student , he avoided chemistry classes as often as he could .

DIGG THIS
Yes , we begin today where we think we might all end up — in Zimbabwe .
The wretched country is suffering the highest inflation rates in the world — over 1,000 % .
But do n’t worry , the government and central bank that caused the inflation have now decided to do something about it .
Lucky Zimbabweans .
Project Sunrise is billed as part of a fresh government drive to stop inflation and black market trading .
As of today , you can no longer use your old Zimbabwean dollar bills .
You have to use the new bills , with three fewer zeros .
Billboards advertised the facts as though it would save consumers money .
" More bang for your buck , " is one slogan .
And , an advertisement shows a loaf of bread with the caption : " Was $ 85,000 , now only $ 85 . "
You can imagine the glee with which the typical housewife anticipated the changeover .
But the program got off to a rocky start .
This weekend , there were reports of chaos …scuffles .
People tried to spend their old money on anything and everything they could get their hands on , which was n’t necessarily much .
Inflation and price controls have made many consumer items vanish already .
But people were desperate to get rid of the old currency before today , because the government had limited the amount that could be traded for new currency to no more than $ 400 U.S. per transaction , per week .
In the new currency regime , there will even be one - cent notes we are told .
Students at the local university calculate that it will be cheaper to heat your house burning bundles of the new notes than using coal or wood .
We turn to the " Dark Continent " not to laugh , but to weep .
For there are we bound …
Empires are expensive .
Bread and circuses at home … foreign wars .
Eventually , the bills grow so large they ca n’t be paid .
After the Roman Empire peaked out in the second century , its emperors repeatedly staged financial schemes like Project Zimbabwe .
Until then , their monetary system had been based on gold and silver coins , which acted as a restraint on inflation — the mints could turn out only a limited supply of coins .
But then , Emperor Aurelian decreed that his coins were two and a half times as valuable as their actual worth , effectively jacking up the money supply by 250 % overnight !
With more than $ 70 trillion in the hole and most of that money owed — in the form of Social Security and Medicare benefits — to voters at home ( and the rest to nervous foreigners ) , the American government might want to consider Aurelian as a model .
For , as in Rome or Harare , the financial authorities can get away with almost anything .
And now , the temptation to inflate has grown just too great … irresistible , in fact .
But is it that simple ?
If it were , would n’t it be easy for you to know what to do , dear reader ?
Just take out the biggest mortgage over the longest period possible … and wait for inflation to reduce it to nothing .
We remember how we envied people with old 6 % mortgages in the 1970s .
When inflation rates headed over 10 % in the late ’ 70s , they practically got their houses for free .
Could the same thing happen again ?
Corporate America seems to be thinking along those lines .
A Wall Street Journal piece tells us that businesses are taking on more and more debt .
Money is cheap , they reckon .
Get it while you can .
Bonds are going up .
The yield on the 10 - year T - note is only 4.83 % .
Mortgage rates , too , have gone down over the last four weeks .
Declining lending rates are not usually a sign of inflation , but deflation , which is why the strategy of taking on more debt now may be premature .
Yes , in the long run , inflation may lighten your debt load and make you feel like a financial genius .
But in the short run , the load could grow a lot heavier … making you feel like the village idiot .
Orange juice is at a 16 - year high , but most commodities seem to be trending downwards — along with bond yields .
Housing prices , too , are beginning to soften .
Gradually , people are coming to realize that they do n’t have as much money as they thought .
What ’s worse , people with ARMs are getting their financial legs knocked out from under them .
As much as a half trillion worth of adjustable rate mortgages are to be reset in the coming year , says the Los Angeles Times .
Many of these were Neg Am contracts , meaning that the principal amount is larger now than it was when the mortgage was taken out .
The L.A. Times report :
" In order to head off potential problems , the largest mortgage originator in the United States , Countrywide Home Loans , has begun sending out letters to thousands of borrowers who have been making only the minimum payments on the company ’s popular PayOption adjustable - rate mortgages .
" The letters explain that u2018 this is an early message to alert you that , based on your current payment trends and potential future interest rate changes , the monthly payment you will be required to pay may increase significantly . ’
" A model letter provided to me by Countrywide includes this hypothetical example of what could be ahead for a California homeowner currently making only minimum payments monthly on a $ 402,000 loan .
" The current full interest rate on the loan is 7.6 % , but the borrower has been paying only $ 1,348.47 monthly , far less than what ’s needed to fully amortize the mortgage over its 30 - year term .
" If the loan reset at today ’s rates , the letter explains , the full payment required would be $ 2,887.50 — more than double what the homeowner has been paying .
Future reset rates could be even steeper , making the payment crunch much worse . "
Yes , dear reader , inflation could eventually wipe out much of the real value of those loans , but in the meantime , there are mortgage payments to be made .
And many people will not be able to make them .
They will walk away …or go belly up .
Mortgages will be worked out , re-negotiated , stretched out or foreclosed .
House prices will fall .
At the margin , people will stop spending so much money and push the economy into a slump .
Jobs will be lost and overtime curtailed .
Payments on debt will be even harder to make .
Debtors will default and go bust .
In short , there will be a dark night of reckoning before the " Sunrise Project " comes to America .
Borrowers are likely to deeply regret their mortgages , before they wish they had a bigger one .
u2022
We spent the weekend working on our gypsy wagon while part of the family was off on a jaunt around France .
We had no guests and scarcely left home .
It was the first peaceful weekend all summer .
Examining our tools , we expected to find that they were all made in Asia .
Not at all .
The Bosch drills were made in Germany and Switzerland .
The circular saw , too .
We have another drill , Black and Decker , which seems to have been made in England .
Black and Decker is a Maryland company ; at least , we thought it was , with a headquarters near Baltimore .
We were surprised to find that our Ryobi router was made in Pickens , South Carolina …or so it appears from the nameplate .
The pine siding , meanwhile , came from Scandinavia , but at least the oak was cut locally .
Maybe we are just old - fashioned , but when we think of spending money , we ca n’t help but think of things made of wood , steal , plastic or other tangible materials .
We might have bought a gypsy wagon , for example .
Instead , we bought the tools and materials to build it .
We might want to buy a painting , a new automobile , or some windows to replace those that are falling apart .
Or , perhaps , a piece of sculpture to put in the garden .
Certainly , more fruit trees and flowering bushes to fill out the garden .
What was in the back of our mind was the item about how house prices were going down in areas that were losing manufacturing industries .
Of course , that ’s just what you ’d expect .
As incomes go down , so should the prices — in real terms — of the houses people live in .
And since , speaking very broadly , lower - and middle - income labor rates are going down because of Asian competition , you ’d expect housing to go down , too .
And in Detroit , or in Pittsburgh , where such jobs are dying , housing is indeed cheap .
Many economists tell us that it is a new world .
" Making things " is old economy .
The new economy is in " Services . "
What we ca n’t understand is what these services are …and why anyone would want them .
We are told , for example , that financial services are the growth industry of the 21st century .
Young people graduate from college and want to go into finance , because that is where the money is .
Manufacturing ?
Yecch .
Let the Asians do that .
But never in our entire lives have we felt the slightest need for financial services .
Granted , a person may need financial services , but where does he get the money for the financial industry to manage ?
u2022 " Dad , you should watch this , " said Jules .
" Oh , what are you watching ? " asked grandmother , who is spending the summer with us .
The poor dear is getting frail , but always cheerful and alert .
" It ’s a dumb movie , Grandma .
I do n’t think you ’d like it .
In fact , I do n’t think you should watch it , " replied Jules .
Saturday night , with nothing better to do , we sat down to watch a movie .
Jules is a movie fanatic .
So much so that he has dropped out of his classics program at St. John ’s College to take up film at another university in Boston .
" You have to see this movie to understand my generation , " he continued .
It was called Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .
We watched it , appalled .
It was puerile .
Sophomoric .
Vulgar .
Disgusting .
And , amusing at various points .
There is very little in the way of plot .
Two low - life New Jersey comics make for Hollywood to have their book made into a movie .
A long genetic sequence of F - words , D - works , S - works and every other kind of word you hope your children never say or hear pervade the film .
We doubt that our mother has ever heard these words spoken in her entire life .
We presume the language was used ironically ; we ’re not sure .
Nor do we have any idea what it means to the under - 25 set .
But we fear for the future .

Hubble sees extreme star birth in the Carina Nebula
HUBBLE NEWS RELEASE
Posted : April 24 , 2007

One of the largest panoramic images ever taken with Hubble 's cameras has been released to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the launch and deployment of the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
The image shows a 50 light - year - wide view of the tumultuous central region of the Carina Nebula where a maelstrom of star birth - and death - is taking place .
Hubble 's new view of the Carina Nebula shows the process of star birth at a new level of detail .
The bizarre landscape of the nebula is sculpted by the action of outflowing winds and scorching ultraviolet radiation from the monster stars that inhabit this inferno .
These stars are shredding the surrounding material that is the last vestige of the giant cloud from which the stars were born .
This immense nebula contains a dozen or more brilliant stars that are estimated to be at least 50 to 100 times the mass of our Sun .
The most opulent is the star eta Carinae , seen at far left .
Eta Carinae is in the final stages of its brief eruptive lifespan , as shown by two billowing lobes of gas and dust that presage its upcoming explosion as a titanic supernova .
A series of so - called Bok globules from a mosaic of the Carina Nebula assembled from 48 frames taken with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys .
The island - like clumps of dark clouds scattered across the nebula are nodules of dust and gas that have so far resisted being eaten away by photoionisation .

The fireworks in the Carina region started three million years ago when the nebula 's first generation of newborn stars condensed and ignited in the middle of a huge cloud of cold molecular hydrogen .
Radiation from these stars carved out an expanding bubble of hot gas .
The island - like clumps of dark clouds scattered across the nebula are nodules of dust and gas that have so far resisted being eaten away by photoionisation .
The hurricane - strength blast of stellar winds and blistering ultraviolet radiation within the cavity is now compressing the surrounding walls of cold hydrogen .
This is triggering a second stage of new star formation .
Our Sun and Solar System may have been born inside such a cosmic crucible 4.6 billion years ago .
In looking at the Carina Nebula we are seeing star formation as it commonly occurs along the dense spiral arms of a galaxy .
This immense nebula is an estimated 7,500 light - years away in the southern constellation Carina , the Keel of the old southern constellation Argo Navis , the ship of Jason and the Argonauts from Greek mythology .
This image is an immense ( 29,566 x 14,321 pixels ) mosaic of the Carina Nebula assembled from 48 frames taken with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys .
The Hubble images were taken in the light of ionized hydrogen .
Colour information was added with data taken at the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory in Chile .
Red corresponds to sulphur , green to hydrogen , and blue to oxygen emission .
These three snapshots reveal nuggets of cold molecular hydrogen in the Carina Nebula .

In its 17 years of exploring the heavens , NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has made nearly 800,000 observations and snapped nearly 500,000 images of more than 25,000 celestial objects .
Hubble does not travel to stars , planets and galaxies .
It takes pictures of them as it whirls around Earth at 17,500 miles an hour .
In its 17 - year lifetime , the telescope has made nearly 100,000 trips around our planet .
Those trips have racked up plenty of frequent - flier - miles , about 2.4 billion , which is the equivalent of a round trip to Saturn .
The 17 years ' worth of observations has produced more than 30 terabytes of data , equal to about 25 percent of the information stored in the Library of Congress .
Each day the orbiting observatory generates about 10 gigabytes of data , enough information to fill the hard drive of a typical home computer in two weeks .
The Hubble archive sends about 66 gigabytes of data each day to astronomers throughout the world .
Astronomers using Hubble data have published nearly 7,000 scientific papers , making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built .
The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA .
The Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 just hit the streets last night , and it is my pleasure to introduce you guys to the upcoming features of the final version ( due for release on April 19 ) .
In this preview , we will look over the new features you 'll find in the upcoming version of Ubuntu ( which is based on the GNOME desktop environment ) and also the features from Kubuntu ( same as Ubuntu , but based on the popular KDE desktop environment ) .
I have to admit that I prefer Kubuntu over Ubuntu because it 's based on KDE ( K Desktop Environment ) and I am a sucker for KDE .
But I like to install Ubuntu first and then the Kubuntu desktop ; having them both is much better .
If you 're wondering " Did he test this beta on a real machine ? " , then the answer is Yes !
I decided to become a tester starting with the Alpha 5 of Feisty Fawn and I am pretty impressed how Ubuntu is evolving .
I should warn you though not to install this Beta version of Ubuntu because it 's still buggy and it's not suitable for production machines .
In the new version of Ubuntu / Kubuntu Linux you will find amazing new stuff , a lot of system improvements and surprises .
Let 's take a quick tour over the new features .
New installer with Windows migration and new partitioning tools .
I think most of the Windows users who are thinking to give Ubuntu a try this April , have their eyes pointed on " Windows migration " words right now and I should let them know that Ubuntu can now migrate Firefox bookmarks , wallpapers , Internet Explorer favorites , Yahoo Messenger and AOL Messenger contacts from the Windows partitions .
It 's extremely easy to activate your Nvidia or ATI video driver with the brand new Restricted Drivers Manager , a tool that pops up in the system tray when on your first login , letting you know that the computer can function properly if you activate " unsupported " drivers .
Basically , with a single click , you will install the proper driver for your video card .
Network Improvements by implementing a new network manager tool that sits in tray and it will help you find and connect to wired and wireless networks .
It also includes WPA support .
I really love this one : when you open a video or audio file in Ubuntu , it will immediately try to find all the necessary codecs automatically .
How about that ?
Easy multimedia codecs installation at its best !
Plug and play network sharing with the help of Avahi , a Zeroconf implementation that allows applications to publish and discover hosts and services running on the local network .
In other words , it will make sharing files and printers over a network very easy .
Both Kubuntu and Ubuntu are face lifted with new artwork , starting from the boot splash and continuing with the splash screen and the desktop wallpaper .
You probably saw those astonishing new 3D effects that Linux has and you wanted to try them or even have them on your desktop .
Ubuntu has made them extremely accessible ; just a single click and you 're in a new futuristic 3D world .
And if we 're still trying here to convince the new users to use Ubuntu , here is another new feature : Redesigned Help Center that makes it easier than ever to find information about Ubuntu and how to use included applications .
You can now easily search for files , conversations , bookmarks , images , basically any file on your computer , with Beagle desktop search application which appears on your system tray every time you enter the session .
In conclusion , expect a LOT of new features and changes from this new version of Ubuntu , expect improved boot speed and applications starting faster .
Please enjoy some more screenshots from both Kubuntu ( with the Oxygen icon theme ) and Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn Beta release .

I wish I 'd invented that quote , but it was Democratic strategist Paul Begala , speaking of FOX News ' conservative bias .
Hell , that 's like saying the DNC has a liberal bias .
FOX News is a propaganda arm of the Republican party , period .
And it 's about time the Democrats stood up to FOX and said they 're no longer going to enable the network 's racist , homophobic , sexist agenda .
And that 's what Democrats did when they canceled a planned presidential primary debate to be hosted by FOX this summer .
Begala has more :
As a loyal Democrat and paid commentator on CNN , I am hopelessly biased -- but at least I admit it .
The folks at Fox News , on the other hand , are just as hopelessly biased -- and they deny it .
While I openly admit that I love all things Clinton , think House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is strong and brave , see Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as Harry Truman reincarnated and do n't believe George W. Bush would know the truth if it bit him on the ass , Fox insults our intelligence by feigning fairness ....
For those who need reminding of Fox 's agenda -- using its " fair and balanced " credibility to smear Democrats and help Republicans -- here 's the bill of particulars :
* Fox News ' founder and guiding genius , Roger Ailes , was the chief media strategist for President George H.W. Bush .
When you have a Republican political consultant running a news network , do n't be surprised if that network becomes a propaganda tool for the Republican Party .
* After the 2006 elections , Fox Senior Vice President John Moody sent a memo to news staff instructing them : " Be on the lookout for any statements from the Iraqi insurgents ... thrilled at the prospect of a Dem- controlled Congress . "
* Robert Greenwald 's film " Outfoxed " exposed 33 similar memos from Moody before the 2004 elections .
On Bush : " His political courage and tactical cunning are worth noting in our reporting through the day . "
On Iraq : " Do not fall into the easy trap of mourning the loss of U.S. lives and asking out loud ' Why are we there ? ' "
* Fox 's Iraq coverage was so biased that a university study showed 80 percent of Fox viewers believed one of these three falsehoods : Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11 ; WMDs were found in Iraq ; or most of the world supported Bush 's Iraq war .
Fox is entitled to its own opinions , but not its own facts .
* Fox hired George W. Bush 's first cousin , John Ellis , to chair its Election Night desk in 2000 .
Not surprisingly , Ellis spoke with Bush five times that night , and Fox was the first network to " call " Florida for Bush .
* Fox identified alleged pervert and GOP Congressman Mark Foley of Florida as a Democrat .
* Fox 's headline when Lewis " Scooter " Libby was convicted on four of five felony counts was straight out of Pravda : " Scooter Libby Found Not Guilty of Lying to FBI Investigators . "
* Fox reported that Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) was educated in a Muslim madrassa -- and then tried to pin the smear on Hillary .
It was a twofer that went for naught , thanks to solid reporting by CNN .
The network sent real journalists to Indonesia , interviewed people , gathered facts and reported the news : Obama 's school was public and nondenominational .
* More Fox smears and misinformation are captured in the YouTube videos at www.FoxAttacks.com.

Note :
This post seems dated now as tablets , smartphones , etc. have changed the debate somewhat .
However , there is still too much focus on tools themselves ( which are ephemeral and rather easy to use ) rather than on deeper issues of learning , creativity , communication , and so on .
A PZ reader recently back in 2006 pointed me to an article on the growing debate about issuing laptop computers to young students .
I found these two snippets in the article on the positives of laptop programs interesting :
" ... the laptop has helped her twelve - year - old son master critical professional skills like how to compile a PowerPoint presentation . " " ... proponents of the programs argue that constant computer access teaches students skills critical to their success in college and at work , such as how to organize multimedia presentations and conduct research online . "
Here 's one citing a typical downside noticed by many parents today :
" ... having a laptop has encouraged her thirteen - year - old son to spend more time dazzling up presentations with fancy fonts instead of digging through library books .
" They need to be able to learn to research beyond what is accomplished by Googling a word or phrase . "
Whether or not young kids issued laptops in elementary school get a better overall education by the time they graduate high school compared to students who never had their own laptop to carry around is debatable .
To me it comes down to a question of whether or not we 're asking the young students to use laptops to learn ephemeral applications ( pull this menu down , copy here , paste there , etc. ) out of our fear that they 'll be " left behind , " or whether we believe / know that all the time with the computer really helps improve a young student 's mind , her critical and analytical thinking , her creativity , her knowledge of science and of the world , in addition to improving basic important math and reading / writing skills .
If it 's the latter , then I say fine .
But does all that time with slideware as a kid teach her about design fundamentals , storytelling , how best to display data , how to edit effectively , etc ?
With the right teacher , perhaps it does .
But I also wonder how much has changed since Alan Kay expressed these concerns in 1994 :
" I think the thing that surprised me is that computers are treated much more like toasters , [ with ] predefined functions mainly having to do with word processing and spreadsheets or running packaged software , and less as a material to be shaped by students and teachers . "
— Alan Kay ( 1994 interview )
There 's no question that a kid and a laptop * can * be a very good thing , but does time spent with an app like PowerPoint as a sixth - grader make it more likely that when the student is , say , 25 she 'll be a better thinker and a better presenter , especially when the electricity goes off and she 's left with nothing but a whiteboard and some pens ?
Or think of it this way : does a personal laptop in the school function as a bicycle for the mind , amplifying the student 's own capabilities and new knowledge or is it more like a car with pre-packaged formulas that allow the student to become soft in the head while appearing to really go places ?
I suspect much depends on the specifics of the particular school and program , of course .
I am by no means the best judge since I teach university and do not have children yet , so I 'd love to hear your own personal experiences with this issue .
Whether you are a teacher , student , or parent , what has been your experience ?
The audience laughed at the Microsoft slide ( right ) , but it was not a jab at only MS but at all software developers ( including Apple ) and us consumers as well .
We can not rely only on the tools to show us the way much like a car with a navigation system .
The best software in many cases does not so much point the way as it does a great job of getting out of the way , helping us to " amplify " our own abilities .
Are you using your computer like a bike or like a car ?
This was my question to the audience .
" Most ideas you can do pretty darn well with a stick in the sand . "
— Alan Kay
The computer is like a bicycle for the mind
More than twenty years ago , Steve Jobs and others at Apple were talking about the great potential of computers and how the tool should be designed and used in a way that enhances the potential that exists within each of us .
Take a look at this video clip of Steve Jobs from Memory and Immagination .
" What a computer is to me is it 's the most remarkable tool that we 've ever come up with , and it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds . ”
— Steve Jobs
( Watch video of Steve Jobs talking about how the bicycle is like a computer for the mind . )
Can computers teach kids how to think ?
Is the application of computer technology today helping kids learn how to think , reason , and create better than their parents or grandparents did when they were the same age ?
Picasso said that computers are " useless " because they can only give answers .
I tell my college students that I am more interested in their own questions and their analysis than in their answers memorized from a book .
The genius often lies in the questions students ask not in the answers they 've learned from others .
" Most computers today are sold like cars , where as many things as possible are done for you .
You do n't have to understand how it works and , in fact , you do n't have to understand how to think because the most popular stuff is prepackaged solutions for this and that . "
— Alan Kay
" Understanding how it works " does n't necessarily only mean knowing the nuts and bolts of hardware or writing software , etc. ( although some understanding there too would not hurt even for non-techies ) .
What I am suggesting is that in the realm of presentations it 's important for students to understand principles of design not merely software application rules to be obediently followed or the " tips and " tricks " of the day .
The fundamental principles of design and visual communication , etc. can be applied broadly and not limited to the narrow world of presentation design only .
Teaching students about design from an early age , challenging them , and exposing them to wonderful examples from around the world from several disciplines such as graphic design , art , architecture , industrial designs , etc. is something that they can really build on as they develop .
" It 's absolutely important to challenge [ students ' ] internals — challenge their internal musculature , their internal ability to make images , their internal ability to think about things and to make representations of things . "
— Alan Kay
Today business people are accustomed to enduring some pretty awful so - called PowerPoint presentations .
I think there is hope for otherwise smart and talented adults who present badly .
But the real hope long - term resides in the young students of today who have not yet learned the bad habits of their parents .
As Alan Kay said over ten years ago , we 've got to challenge the kids not just give them formulas and " time - saving " shortcuts to mediocrity .
If a laptop in the hands of a 10 - year - old child helps her develop her " internal musculature " long - term — if it serves like a bicycle for her mind — then a laptop is a very good thing .
What say you ?
A note about Japan
I teach one marketing class to about 25 Japanese students , all about 20 - years - old .
Only four have a computer of their own and most have never used PowerPoint .
As freshman they even " lack basic computing skills " by US standards ( though their cell phone surfing aptitude surpasses anything in the US ) .
But it does not matter .
By the end of the semester most of the students give presentations ( using PowerPoint for visuals ) that are as good or better than those of foreign students here who may have had their own computer since childhood .
The PPT tool itself is easy to learn , especially when students realize that they can ignore about 90 % of its menu options and focus more on research and putting their findings together in a strong , compelling way .
And given the freedom , Japanese students can be quite creative indeed .
The so - called " PPT savvy " students have to struggle initially to unlearn bad habits such as presenting with slideuments .
The business students with no real previous PPT knowledge spend more time on research and internalizing ( not memorizing ) their material ; the visuals tend to serve a stronger supporting role .
Expanding waistlines , unsightly bulges : people will gladly remove excess body fat to improve their looks .
But unwanted fat also contains stem cells with the potential to repair defects and heal injuries in the body .
A team led by Philippe Collas at the University of Oslo in Norway has identified certain chemical marks that allow him to predict which , among the hundreds of millions of stem cells in liposuctioned fat , are best at regenerating tissue .
Uncovering the nature and location of these molecular tags could allow scientists to pull off the ultimate trick of taking a patient ’s own fat cells and using them for therapy , Collas told researchers gathered at the EuroSTELLS Workshop ‘ Exploring Chromatin in Stem Cells ’ held on January 23 - 24 , in Montpellier , France .
" Fat tissue is an underappreciated source of stem cells , " Collas pointed out .
Unlike other sources of adult stem cells , such as bone marrow , fat is abundant and there is no shortage of donors .
" It ’s wonderful , we have litres and litres of material from cosmetic surgery clinics and end up with bucketfuls of stem cells to work with , " he notes .
EuroSTELLS
Project Leader Cesare Galli , from the University of Bologna , Italy has high hopes that transplanted fat stem cells will restore injured sports horses to their former glory .
" Our aim is to regenerate the tendon structure that does not repair spontaneously , " says Galli .
Once scar tissue is formed , it hinders the animal ’s recovery .
" If you intervene , with cell transplants , within one week , you can repair the lesion , " Galli notes .
Like horses , humans are also vulnerable to joint injuries , and rehabilitations are long and costly .
Now experience with horses is paving the way to cell therapies for sport - related tendon injuries in humans .
Therapies using bone marrow stem cells , similar to fat stem cells , have achieved some successes , but the focus is shifting to fat , since the tissue is easier to access and extract than the bone marrow .
That fat - based methods work is not surprising , perhaps , because adipose tissue is closely related to bone , cartilage , muscle and other connective tissue .
But some say it is impossible to re-programme adult cells to become nerve or liver cells , for example , without using embryos .
Adult stem cells , such as those from fat , are thought to have more limited potential .
Collas insists that the transformation is possible .
The hurdle lies not with the genes but with a cell ’s epigenetic status , the subtle chemical modifications of DNA and its surrounding histone proteins .
Epigenetic marks contribute to switching genes on and off , and stem cells rely on them heavily as they divide and mature .
The Oslo team has found that low rates of DNA methylation , for instance , boost the chances of transforming fat stem cells from one cell type into another .
" Look at a cell ’s epigenetic profile , " says Collas , " and you may be able to predict what that cell is likely to turn into . "
These epigenetic signatures have grabbed everyone ’s attention , acknowledges Ernest Arenas , a EuroSTELLS researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden .
" Scientists in the stem cell field are starting to realise that for cell manipulations to succeed they need to pay attention to their epigenetic marks .
Cells ca n’t be pushed along to become a different cell type unless they start out with the right set of [ epigenetic ] conditions . "
It is a complex area but one that is loaded with promise .
" Everyone is talking about epigenetics , " says Collas .
If he has his way , people may soon be visiting plastic surgeons not just for cosmetic reasons , but for therapy .

Linux unter der GPL
Wenn man sich die Nachrichten auf Pro-Linux im letzten Monat anschaut , fällt einem schnell eine Meldung ins Auge , die eine besonders hohe Anzahl an Kommentaren provoziert hat : Den Bericht über eine Änderung im USB - Subsystem , welche bestimmte Funktionen nur noch GPL - Modulen zur Verfügung stellt .
Diese veranlasste einen Entwickler der Firma AVM zum Kommentar , dann in Zukunft verschiedene Hardware nicht mehr unter Linux unterstützen zu können , für die die Firma AVM momentan proprietäre Closed - Source - Module zur Verfügung stellt .
Zu diesem Artikel entwickelte sich im Kommentarbereich dazu eine lebhafte Diskussion , die den Anstoß zu diesem Editorial gab .
Denn der größte Teil der Diskussion bestand zum einen aus Postings enttäuschter Besitzer von betroffener Hardware , die den Kernelentwicklern die Schuld an dieser Entwicklung zuwiesen , zum anderen aus Meinungen , dass proprietäres Modul oder nicht vollkommen egal sei - Hauptsache , die Hardware läuft .
Die GPL ( General Public License , Wikipedia - Eintrag zur GPL ) wurde dazu häufig kritisiert , denn da der Kernel unter dieser Lizenz verbreitet werde , gäbe es erst diese Schwierigkeiten .
Auf welcher Seite der Diskussion man auch stehen mag , es sollte klar geworden sein , dass die Tatsache , dass der Linux - Kernel und auch ein sehr großer Anteil Open - Source - Software ( OSS ) der GPL unterliegt , nicht vernachlässigt werden darf .
Was bezwecken die Entwickler nun mit dieser GPL ?
Salopp gesagt , jeder soll Linux für seine Zwecke einsetzen dürfen .
Es soll sogar jeder den Linux - Kernel für seine Zwecke anpassen , verändern oder erweitern können .
Wenn allerdings das Ergebnis dieser Arbeit weiter verbreitet werden soll , müssen die Änderungen / Erweiterungen im Quellcode verfügbar gemacht werden , und zwar wiederum unter der GPL .
Auf diese Weise » bezahlt « jeder mit seinen eigenen Verbesserungen für den freien Zugriff auf die Linux - Quellen .
Diese Änderungen kommen nun allen Linux - Anwendern zu Gute und können durch diese weiter fehlerbereinigt oder weiterentwickelt werden .
Software , die nach diesem Modell entwickelt wird , kann sich durch diese Feedback - Schleife stetig verbessern , sei es in der Leistungsfähigkeit , der Stabilität , der Anwendbarkeit auf anderen Architekturen und vielem anderen mehr .
Betrachten wir nun den Fall AVM .
Statt eines unter GPL stehenden freien Moduls , welches auch in den Kernel direkt hätte aufgenommen werden können , entschied sich die Firma , diverse Hardware nur durch ein Closed - Source - Kernelmodul ( CS - Kernelmodul ) zu unterstützen .
Auf den ersten Blick scheint doch alles wie gewünscht zu sein : Die Hardware funktioniert unter Linux .
Aber schon an dieser Stelle kann man den Entwicklern den Vorwurf machen , den Linux - Kernel zwar einzusetzen , aber nicht dafür » bezahlen « zu wollen .
Linus
Torvalds selbst räumt aber ein , dass es eine Grauzone gibt , ob ein Kernelmodul im Sinne der GPL ein » abgeleitetes Werk « darstellt .
( Weitere interessante diesbezügliche Mails . )
Daher wird dieses Verhalten bisher toleriert , dabei jedoch ausdrücklich betont , dass auf proprietäre Module in der Weiterentwicklung des Kernels keine Rücksicht genommen wird .
Dies weiß jeder Entwickler , der die Linux - Kernel - Mailing - List mitliest oder sich zumindest auf Seiten wie lwn.net , kerneltrap.org oder kerneltraffic.org ( die leider vor kurzem den aktiven Betrieb eingestellt hat ) auf dem Laufenden hält .
Aus technischer Sicht bemerkt man schnell , dass die Unterstützung nur für kleine Mengen von » Linux « gilt .
Das Kernelmodul ist , da nur in Binärform verfügbar , auf die angebotene Hardware - Plattform beschränkt und das sind meist nur die x86 - kompatiblen Prozessoren .
Doch Linux läuft auch auf PowerPC - Prozessoren , auf SPARC - Rechnern und weiteren Architekturen ...
Dass es sich für eine Firma nicht lohnen mag , für diese vergleichsweise kleine Anwenderzahl mehrere CS - Module für die jeweiligen Architekturen anzubieten , ist unbestritten .
Doch muss sich die Firma daran messen lassen , was möglich ist , wenn ein Modul im Sourcecode verfügbar ist : Jeder Besitzer der passenden Hardware kann es dann für sein System übersetzen , ganz egal , auf welcher Plattform .
Sollten Anpassungen nötig sein , reicht es , wenn ein einzelner Programmierer - der nicht bei der Firma angestellt sein muss !
- sie vornimmt .
Alle anderen Anwender der » exotischen « Plattform wären Nutznießer .
Wobei die Portierung eines Treibers auf eine andere Plattform schon einen Spezialfall darstellt .
Im rauhen Alltag ist es viel wahrscheinlicher , dass einfach nur ein Bug im Treiber auftritt .
Bei einem CS - Modul ist kein Kernelentwickler außer dem Hersteller in der Lage , den Fehler zu beheben .
Da Module den Kernel nicht unerheblich beeinflussen können , weigern sich die meisten Kernelentwickler , einen Linux - Bugreport zu bearbeiten , wenn ein proprietäres Modul geladen und der Kernel damit » befleckt « wurde ( tainted ) .
Das ist kein Schmollen oder Zanken , sondern es fehlen ihnen schlicht die Möglichkeiten , dem Fehler auf den Grund gehen zu können .
Auf der anderen Seite entwickelt sich der Kernel selbst natürlich auch weiter .
Die im Kernelsource enthaltenen Treiber können bei - die Möglichkeit , die interne Arbeitsweise des Kernels umstellen zu können , wenn es notwendig oder besser erscheint - ist im Übrigen ein Ergebnis der offenen Quellen .
( Weshalb der in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder auftauchende Vorschlag eines stabilen Binär - APIs innerhalb des Linux - Kernels Unsinn ist , hat Greg Kroah - Hartmann in » stable-api-nonsense.txt « übrigens sehr schön dargelegt .
Diese Datei ist Bestandteil der Linux - Dokumentation ! )
Außerhalb des Kernels gepflegte OS - Module können ebenfalls angepasst werden - nicht nur durch den eigentlichen Programmierer , sondern auch durch andere Entwickler .
Ein CS - Modul dagegen ist darauf angewiesen , dass der Hersteller die notwendigen Änderungen vornimmt .
Das mag nach einer Selbstverständlichkeit klingen , aber was passiert , wenn der Hersteller dieser Verpflichtung nicht nachkommt ?
Dafür kann es leider viele Gründe geben : Die Hardware wird nicht mehr hergestellt , also auch der Treiber dazu nicht mehr gepflegt .
Oder der Hersteller ist pleite gegangen .
Oder eine Unterstützung wurde für neuere Versionen nie zugesagt und daher auch nicht programmiert .
Oder der zuständige Programmierer hat die Firma verlassen oder er ist unabkömmlich in anderen Projekten beschäftigt oder , oder , oder ...
by Michael Dimock , Associate Director , Pew Research Center for the People & the Press
The Republican Party has traditionally garnered it strongest backing among wealthier voters .
But the recent overall decline in Republican Party affiliation nationwide has taken a toll even on GOP support among affluent voters .
The latest Pew surveys find Democrats pulling even with Republicans among registered voters with annual family incomes in excess of roughly $ 135,000 per annum .
Overall , while remarkably high voter enthusiasm is undoubtedly the key factor in the Democratic Party ’s fundraising success in 2006 and thus far this year , the pool of potential campaign donors is also less tilted toward the GOP today than it has been in the past .
Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past 13 years reveals a stark change in the party identification among the wealthiest voters – defined here as those in the top 10 % of household incomes .
In 1995 , the year after the Republicans took control of the House and Senate , there were nearly twice as many Republicans ( 46 % ) as Democrats ( 25 % ) among the most affluent 10 % of registered voters ( household incomes of approximately $ 84,000 or more at the time ) .
By comparison , there are just as many Democrats ( 31 % ) as Republicans ( 32 % ) among this class of voters today ( household incomes of approximately $ 135,000 or more ) .
As has been the case nationwide , the shifting balance has had more to do with Republican losses than Democratic gains .
Within the past two years , Republican Party identification has fallen nine percentage points among the wealthiest voters ( from 41 % to 32 % ) , while Democratic identification is up just three points .
This mirrors the overall pattern nationwide , which shows a sizeable decline in GOP identification , and only modest growth in Democratic Party identification .
( For details , see March 22 , 2007 : Political Landscape More Favorable to Democrats . )
While much of the shifting balance among affluent voters reflects changes in the national mood , two important demographic changes among high income voters are related to the parties ’ fortunes .
First , members of minority groups constitute a greater share of high - income voters than at any time in the past .
The proportion of top - income voters who are black , Hispanic , or from another racial minority background has doubled from 10 % in 1995 to 21 % today , while the proportion who are white has dropped from 90 % to 79 % .
Secondly , a greater share of top - income voters have a post - graduate education than in the past — 35 % up from 24 % in 1995 .
In general , Americans with post - graduate training are more likely to be Democrats than those with four - year degrees or who attended but did not complete college .
Despite these shifts , affluent voters remain more Republican than low - income voters .
In the data Pew collected in the first quarter of 2007 , Democrats have a nearly three - to - one identification advantage ( 48 % vs. 18 % Republican ) among voters earning $ 20,000 or less , an advantage that shrinks as income increases .
Among voters earning between $ 40,000 and $ 100,000 neither party has a clear advantage , while Republicans have a 34 % to 27 % identification edge among those in the $ 100 - $ 150,000 household income range .
But at the very top — among the 7 % of voters with household incomes of $ 150,000 or more — Democrats once again run even ( 33 % Democrat vs. 31 % Republican ) .
The ability of Democratic presidential candidates to out - raise the GOP field in the first quarter of 2007 was almost certainly driven by high levels of enthusiasm among Democratic voters .
Throughout the past few months
Pew surveys have consistently found that Democrats are tracking campaign news far more closely than are Republicans , and a March survey by CBS News and the New York Times showed that Democrats are both more satisfied with their slate of candidates and more optimistic about victory in 2008 than are Republicans .
This is comparable with the high enthusiasm and optimism about the chances of victory that allowed the Democrats to compete with , and even exceed , Republican fundraising efforts in the 2006 midterm .
At the same time , the GOP ’s fading fortunes may have weakened the Republicans ’ traditional advantage in having a broader pool of potential donors .
This combination of factors has the potential to reshape the traditional expectations for fundraising in 2008 .
Methodology
This analysis is based on compiled data from all Pew Research Center surveys conducted in each calendar year that included measures of income , party identification and voter registration .
The top 10 % income category is based on self - reported household income among registered voters who gave their income .
To capture the top 10 % , a special weight is used to adjust the relative share of voters from each income category .
For example , in 2007 the top decile includes all voters reporting a household income of $ 150,000 or more , while voters reporting a household income of $ 100,000 - $ 150,000 are weighted down to approximate the estimated cutoff of $ 135,000 in that year .
The 2007 estimates are based on data from five surveys conducted in January , February and March , with an overall sample size of 6,902 registered voters and an estimated sample size of 662 voters in the top income decile .
The margin of error for this top - decile subsample is plus or minus 4.5 % .
In all previous years sample sizes are larger because data from the full calendar year are available for analysis .
Researchers believe they have solved a mystery that has puzzled evolutionary scientists for years ... if ' good ' genes spread through the population , why are individuals so different ?
The so - called ' lek paradox ' , that sexually - selecting species like humans should have much less individuality than is the case , has been seized upon by creationists as an argument that Darwin 's theories are fundamentally flawed .
The problem is that if females select the most attractive mates , the genes responsible for attractive features should spread quickly through a population , resulting in males becoming equally attractive , to the point where sexual selection could no longer take place .
However , new research by Professor Marion Petrie and Dr Gilbert Roberts at Newcastle University , England , suggests that sexual selection can in fact cause greater genetic diversity by a mechanism not previously understood .
Professor Petrie theorized that since genetic mutations can occur anywhere in the genome , some will affect the ' DNA repair kit ' possessed by all cells .
As a result , some individuals have less efficient repair kits , resulting in greater variation in their DNA as damage does unrepaired .
Although unrepaired DNA is generally harmful - causing tissue to degenerate or develop cancers - it is useful in some parts of the genome , such as those parts responsible for disease defense where variation can help in the resistance to disease .
It has long been known that greater variation of DNA in the disease defending regions makes it more likely that an individual can resist attacks by bacteria and viruses .
Using a computer model to map the spread of genes in a population , Petrie showed that the tendency towards reduction in genetic diversity caused by sexual selection is outweighed by the maintenance in greater genetic diversity generated by mutations affecting DNA repair .
Petrie , of the Evolution and Behaviour Research Group in the School of Biology at Newcastle University , said , " We started this research ten years ago and our model has now produced a good fit with what we observe in terms of genetic variation , which leads us to believe that our theory is correct .
" We find that sexual selection can promote genetic diversity despite expectations to the contrary . "
In 2005 , Petrie and colleagues showed that men with greater genetic diversity in disease defense regions of the genome , and therefore better prospects of passing disease resistance to their offspring , had a number of physical features which women found attractive .
The research involved testing men for genetic diversity and showing photographs of them to women , who allocated scores for attractiveness .
These scores were found to correlate strongly to genetic diversity .

Really , I did .
You , too , can create a surreally attractive male or female by using the Face Laboratory run by two experimental psychologists working at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland .
Your hyper - attractive face will actually be made by a computer .
You ’ll help by choosing the “ ingredients ” ( a few or many faces ) , and the program averages them into a final product .
This averaging process downplays imperfections and results in exquisite symmetry .
What ’s amazing to me is that strikingly attractive averaged faces result even when ( maybe especially when ) you choose some of the faces that might initially appear relatively unattractive .
As explained in the site ’s FAQ’s :
Symmetry is one aspect of faces that has been extensively studied by many researchers in relation to attractiveness .
The most common method used to investigate the effect symmetry has on the attractiveness of faces involves manipulating the symmetry of face images using sophisticated computer graphic methods and assessing the effect that this manipulation has on perceptions of the attractiveness of the faces .
But why should we be attracted to symmetry .
Evolutionary psychologists suggest an answer : symmetry is a token for health , and therefore fitness to reproduce :
But why would cognitive averaging have evolved ?
Evolutionary biology holds that in any given population , extreme characteristics tend to fall away in favor of average ones .
Birds with unusually long or short wings die more often in storms .
Human babies who are born larger or smaller than average are less likely to survive .
The ability to form an average - mate template would have conveyed a singular survival advantage .
Inclination toward the average is called koinophilia , from the Greek words koinos , meaning “ usual , ” and philos , meaning “ love . ”
To Langlois , humans are clearly koinophiles .
The remaining question is whether our good - mate template is acquired or innate .
To help solve the mystery , Langlois ’s doctoral student Lisa Kalakanis has presented babies who are just 15 minutes old with paired images of attractive and homely faces .
“ We ’re just starting to evaluate that data , ” says Langlois .
But koinophilia is n’t the only - or even supreme - criterion for beauty that evolution has promoted , other scientists argue .
An innate yearning for symmetry is a major boon , contend biologists Anders Moller and Randy Thornhill , as asymmetry can signal malnutrition , disease , or bad genes .
The two have found that asymmetrical animals , ranging from barn swallows to lions , have fewer offspring and shorter lives .
So get going , now !
Go create somebody .
No !
Wait !
First , a thought .
Is it possible that one ’s life would look more attractive if a bunch of our lives were averaged together ?
Any one person ’s life is often disjointed , with moments of stumbling , error and bad judgment ( that is certainly and often the story of my life ) .
But what if we could somehow average together a particular life with the lives of 20 other people picked at random , then run some sort of “ averaged ” video of the result ?
Would there result be graceful , confident , sublime ?
Or would we miss the edges and the pimples ?
And what if the whole world were full of people that looked like the super - averaged computer results from this site , but then along came some regular people with their lack of perfect symmetry ?
Would they be seen as ugly or as distinctively attractive ?
Who would that society choose to be its models and movie stars , the non-symmetrical or the symmetrical ?
The Missouri legislature will soon consider Senate Bill 285 to protect the right of pharmacists who refuse to dispense birth control pills .
Here ’s the text of the bill :
This act protects the conscience rights of pharmaceutical professionals .
Such pharmaceutical professionals shall not be required to perform , assist , recommend , refer for , or participate in any service involving a particular drug or device that they have a good faith belief is used for abortions .
In these instances , the pharmaceutical professional shall be immune from civil or criminal liability and will not have their license suspended or revoked .
As I ’ve discussed before , many conservatives argue that birth control pills cause “ abortions ” because it is possible that they could cause a fertilized egg to fail to implant .
This is the reason that the hundreds of “ Pregnancy Resource Centers ” that dot the country refuse to tell their clients about the existence of birth control pills ( and see here ) .
Instead , such fake pregnancy clinics recommend only “ natural family planning ” ( formerly known as rhythm ) , which has a failure rate of 20 % per year .
Is that the kind of birth control you want for your wife , girlfriend or daughter ?
It ’s important to note that anti-abortion sites freely admit that the “ vast majority of women ” using birth control pills are not causing “ abortions , ” however defined .
This proposed Missouri law , if passed , would invite the following conversation between an adult woman customer and a pharmacist :
[ Woman ] : I ’d like you to fill this prescription for birth control pills .
My doctor wrote this prescription for me .
[ Pharmacist ] : I wo n’t do that .
I have a good faith belief that you are using those pills to have abortions .
I ’m the only pharmacist on duty at this store , so that ’s the final answer .
[ Woman ] :
This is ridiculous .
Tell me where I can find another pharmacy that will fill this perfectly legal prescription .
[ Pharmacist ] : I refuse to refer you to such an evil place , as I am entitled to do pursuant to Senate Bill 285 . [ Woman ] : I need to talk to your boss .
[ Pharmacist ’s Boss ] : I ’d like to fire this guy , but Senate Bill 285 provides that if I fire him , he can sue me for triple damages plus attorneys fees .
To top off this insanity , many women take birth control pills for reasons other than avoiding pregnancy .
The hormones in “ the Pill ” can be used to treat some medical conditions , such as polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , endometriosis , adenomyosis , anemia related to menstruation , and painful menstruation ( dysmenorrhea ) .
In addition , oral contraceptives are often prescribed as medication for mild or moderate acne .

This bill is likely to be heard at the following place and time :
PyCon Wireless Network
By Sean Reifschneider Date March 15 , 2007
Also see my related articles on networking I set up for PyCon 2008 2010 , and 2012
How do you make 600 Python geeks happy ?
Well , wireless network access is a good start ...
Last year at PyCon 2006 , the hotel ran the wireless network .
Despite our repeatedly telling them that we were going to be heavily using the wireless network ( " No , really , we 're going to beusing the wireless network . " ) , they really were n't prepared for our level of use .
We also had problems with their technical support , things like the DHCP server giving out leases with a gateway in a different network from the lease , and their support people rebooting APs to " fix " it ( which , not surprisingly , it did n't ) .
Last Year
It was so bad last year , that we decided to run our own wireless network this year .
The wired network last year worked reasonably well , though there were some issues with DHCP there as well .
So , I volunteered to run the network for 2007 .
The wireless networking for PyCon 2006 was amazingly bad .
The survey results break it down as a satisfaction of 44 % " very low " and 38 % " low " , 15 % " high " and 3 % " very high " .
Those people in the latter categories were probably using wired , I 'd imagine .
I took charge last year of helping people with the network , and the largest problems we had were that people could n't associate .
Some of these people were probably running into issues on their client , but I suspect some of them were not able to get associated because the APs were n't able to handle any more associations .
This Year
The largest issue was that people who were associated were seeing huge amounts of loss pinging the gateway .
I do n't think I ever saw less than 10 % loss pinging the gateway , and usually more like 50 %
This was probably due to having only 4 APs , all sharing the same 802.11 b channel , so there was a huge contention in the RF spectrum .
This year things were almost entirely reversed from last year .
The survey the satisfaction with the network was 22 % " very high " and 48 % " high " , with 20 % " low " and 1 % " very low " .
Despite having 41 % more attendees than last year ( and probably an even larger number of people using wireless , just because more people have 802.1a / b/g devices ) , well over half the people were happy with the networking .
Were they just happy because in comparison with last year it was so much better ?
Maybe , but a full third of attendees were n't at last years conference .
Maybe that 's the third that was n't happy with it . :-)
Another side effect of running our own networking was that we were able to collect all sorts of stats .
Last year the hotel only gave us MRTG graphs which included not only our network utilization but the hotel in total , including guest rooms .
They had the huevos to claim that , based on the usage on these graphs , that there was no problem with our networking .
We did n't know last year that these stats included guest rooms .
Total attendees 593 Total unique DHCP clients 623 Total DHCP requests 24,400 Max DHCP requests from a single client 4,537 Peak number of clients connected 340 ( Saturday at 4:44 pm ) 95th percentile number of clients connected 263 Peak number of 802.11a clients connected 92 ( Friday at noon ) Peak number of 802.11b clients connected 47 ( Friday at 9:10 am )
Peak number of 802.11g clients connected 198 ( Saturday at 4:44 pm )
Max number of clients on a single AP 85 ( Rear of ballroom , Saturday at 9:55 am )
Here are some statistics :
Access Point Map
So , our peak number of attendees connected at any given time was 57 % of attendees .
The 95th percentile number is the number of associations we have to handle to work 95 % of the time , which was 44 % of attendees .
802.11a ?
The wireless network access point locations and the peak number of clients .
One thing that surprised many people is that we had fairly high numbers of 802.11a users .
Part of this is that we had better coverage for 802.11a , because of the number of available channels , than we did for b/ g .
Because 802.11a has more channels , we could run those APs on higher power , and so a user who saw both 802.11a and 802.11b+g
APs would probably see the 802.11a AP as having a better signal .
Mostly , I did this so that the 802.11a users would just get out of the way of the 802.11b users , where the spectrum is very scarce .
WEP
had an 802.11a user that asked me for help .
Every person who asked me for help was running 802.11 b or g.
I 'm not sure if that 's because the 802.11a users more more sophisticated , or that the 802.11a service was that much better .
I also set up WEP with a trivial hex key .
At the Python Need for Speed sprint , we basically spent the week with really bad network connection .
We only had around 256 kbps of bandwidth there , and other people in the hotel were using the network .
We could n't track down who among us was hammering it , so it must have been someone around or on another floor .
We even had people come right into the room we were having the sprint in and sit down and start computing away ...
We used a hex key , because there are two different algorithms for converting a text key into a hex key .
So , we just used a couple of hex digits repeated 5 times .
Mostly just to keep the random other people off the network .
Probably better on the sprint days , when there were other events going on and we did n't have the WEP key posted anywhere .
The Problems ...
Though the shaping probably would have prevented problems with the random users abuse our network , it was nice to make sure our scarce bandwidth was n't spread any more thinly .
It was n't completely rosy though .
We did have some problems .
The first problem we deliberately created .
For the tutorials we put out too few APs , to see how they would work under the weight of many connections .
It did n't work super well was the answer .
At lunch I doubled the number of APs , and that solved those issues .
The bigger problem became apparent on the tutorial day though ...
We had based our predictions on the amount of network usage on two false assumptions : that the number of attendees was going to be roughly the same as the previous year , and that the bandwidth usage would be similar .
Tuesday morning I realized that basing our bandwidth speculation on the previous years usage was just wrong .
The previous year , something around 82 % of the attendees had severe problems connecting , and therefore they were n't sucking up the bandwidth .
Last year we had 3 mbps of bandwidth ( again , shared with the hotel ) , this year 4.5 mbps .
Next year I 'm recommending we get 10 or preferably 20 mbps .
Another problem we had was that someone was wandering around with their laptop set up on our ESSID , with our WEP key , running in AdHoc mode .
Meaning that users close to that person would associate with that user instead of our network .
This was reported to me on Friday , but it was n't until late Saturday afternoon that he found me and asked for help getting connected .
The problem here was a faulty network configuration program .
The system was running Windows , with this busticated NetGear program for configuring the wireless .
You 'd tell it you wanted to connect to an existing network , and it would set itself up in Ad - Hoc mode .
It would n' tyou that it was doing this , you had to dig through the advanced information .
You also could n't change this , you had to use the " expert " configuration to tell it not to do that .
The number one problem we had with users connecting to the network ?
It 's called a " hardware radio switch " .
That 's right , our most serious problem was with users who had their laptops firmware configured to disable the wireless radio .
This is like " airplane mode " on cell phones .
From the software , it looks like the WiFi card is working , but it can never associate .
A Mac User , Stephan Deibel , reported that setting the " Use interference robustness " option helped .
It was impossible , even searching on the Internet , to find details on what exactly this option configures .
I speculated that it might reduce the " RTS " setting , but it was impossible to tell for sure .
Another problem was APs getting unplugged .
The worst problem was with them getting unplugged from the Ethernet , because then users would still try to associate with them , but it would n't work .
That only happened once .
The APs had the ability to watch the Ethernet link and disable the wireless if they got disconnected .
I did n't set that up because I did n't have a chance to test it before the show .
I had initially expected to run a number of the APs not connected to the Ethernet , so I could n't have used that anyway .
3 or 4 times an AP was unplugged from power , probably people banging into them or the like .
We did n't , in most cases , have safe places to mount the APs , I just set up a chair for them to sit on .
The last problem was with our shaping .
I had set up fancy shaping using the HTB shaping rules .
This should have allowed users to burst up to the full line speed if capacity was available , but push heavy users down to 128 kbps as others used bandwidth .
In my testing at home , it worked exactly as I had hoped .
However , at the conference it eventually became clear that it was just restricting all users to 128 kbps .
I 've been over it several times , and as far as I can tell , this was a bug in the Linux traffic shaping .
Considering the overall scarcity of the bandwidth , it was probably for the best that users were limited , providing fair sharing even when users were hitting the network .
Like the one person I saw in Guido 's keynote , who was streaming a Google video of another talk Guido gave , and ignoring the streaming video .
I was mostly concerned about users with a virus , worm , or doing file sharing swamping the bandwidth .
This is based on my experiences at coffee shops with users doing this and just killing the network because they were swamping the fairly limited outbound bandwidth .
It 's easy to bring a coffee shop network to it 's knees by just sending 50 to 90 KB / sec outbound .
DHCP
We never had an instance during the conference where the network was bad because someone or a few people were hammering it .
So , in general I 'd call it a success .
We had our own router , running NAT to the hotel network .
On this server we ran our own DHCP .
Our private network was a / 22 network of 1024 addresses .
I set up DHCP to give out 760 - ish of these in a pool of dynamic addresses , with an 8 hour lease time .
I set aside another 250 - ish of these addresses to be outside the pool .
I used the " glabel " program to print out a bunch of slips of paper , one of each of these 250 IPs , including DNS , netmask , and gateway information .
People who reported problems getting an address were given one of these slips of paper , effectively giving them a lease on an address .
One person suggested that 8 hours was way too long a lease and that we 'd probably run into problems because of this long lease time .
I explained that we had way more IPs available in the DHCP pool than we had attendees , so the long lease time should n't be a problem .
As far as I know , it never was .
Based on a review of the logs , we never allocated all the IPs available in the pool .
DNS
I 'msurprised that we had more DHCP leases than we had attendees .
I figured there would be some attendees with more than one wireless device , with cell phones and PDAs having it now .
Transparent HTTP
Proxy
I set up dnscache on the NAT router and published this machine as the DNS server .
I 've had incredibly good luck with running dnscache in the past , and in particular have found it to work well with little memory usage .
This was running on a small machine with only 256MB of RAM , and was easy to set up , so I threw it into the mix .
When it became apparent that we did n't have nearly enough network bandwidth , I tried setting up a Squid transparent proxy .
The iptables REDIRECT target was just never matching , despite my double - checking the rules 4 or 5 times .
I finally gave up on it .
I believe this may have been related to the bug causing the shaping not to work properly , because I 've successfully set up transparent proxy before , and several other references I checked showed that I was doing it right .
The AP Setup
I would consider setting up a proxy if I did this again in the future , but I 'd probably use Apache to do it .
I 've found Squid to be very complicated to configure , Apache is much easier to deal with .
Last year the hotel provided around 4 APs .
This year we had 24 APs with 12 more in reserve .
These were actually 12 " dual channel " APs , with both an 802.11a and 802.11b+g AP built into it .
The remaining 12 were because I ordered the wrong model initially , and since I had 30 days to return them I decided to just ship them to the conference in case we ended up needing them .
I did n't know initially if we'd get access to the hotel wiring infrastructure , so one of the options was that we could set up the dual - channel APs to run meshing on 802.11a as our backbone to distribute the other APs around for 802.11b+g as primary access .
We did end up getting access to the wiring infrastructure of the hotel , so all the APs we ran in dual AP mode , acting as both an 802.11a and 802.11b+g AP .
I set up 802.11b+g to run in the second to lowest power mode , and using the 3 available non-overlapping channels .
I also mounted the APs around 2.5 feet above ground , so that peoples bodies would absorb the signal and help reduce interference between adjacent APs on the same channel .
I tried to organize the APs such that APs on the same channel were not close together .
802.11a has like 9 non-overlapping channels , so I set up APs on different channels as much as possible , and ran 802.11a in it 's highest power setting .
After the main conference , I set up two of the APs to use the 802.11a radios in WDS mode , and put the WDS client AP out by the lobby ( where we did n't have a wired port ) , to provide repeater service for users in the lobby , bar , and restaurant .
" Mission - critical bar coverage has been set up " I joked .
RTS ?
So , in the end we had a dozen 802.11a APs , and another dozen 802.11b+g APs , to cover the conference .
I had asked Jamie Gansead of ThinAirNet , who just sold off his 802.11 b - based terrestrial wireless ISP , to review my plan for the wireless network .
His biggest suggestion was to set the " RTS " parameter low .
However , this is a client - side setting , not something I can push from the server side .
802.11a/b/g wireless works by listening on the channel to see if anyone else is sending , and if the packet is below the RTS , and the radio does n't hear anyone else sending , it will send the packet .
However , if there are two clients that can both see the AP but can't see each other , this mechanism does n't work .
If the packet is larger than the RTS , the client will ask the AP to reserve a time for it to send the packet , the AP will announce to everyone within hearing that the radio is reserved , and the client will send .
This extra overhead hurts in small networks where all the clients can see each other most of the time , but really helps when you have users who can't see other stations .
The default RTS setting is the maximum value .
I noticed some high latency on my laptop , and then set RTS down to the minimum and the latency dropped way off .
Again , this was n't something I could centrally dictate though .
I set up a wireless networking page which in the Wiki which included this hint , but I do n't know how many users actually used this setting .
We used the D - Link DWL - 7200 AP , which is a less than $ 200 " enterprise " access point .
It had some problems , like enabling the " Load Balancing " feature seemed to cause it to break , even if the number of associations was below the specified limit .
Also , every page you change in the configuration required that you reboot the AP , meaning every page of changes required 30 seconds to save .
It included the ability to save off and load a config file , so I just made a base config that I saved , then uploaded that config to a new AP and changed a couple of values including IP address and channel , so it went much faster .
The config file was text format , meaning in theory I could have changed it in a text editor , but there was a checksum value at the end that I figured would have caused that to break .
Dang .
I had originally brought in a couple of Proxim " enterprise AP "s , but the sheer price of these would n't have allowed me to get my target number of APs ( 15 ) within my budget .
The Proxim APs seem to have a few more features , including a nice " mesh " auto - configuration that would have been nice if we ended up doing meshing for the backhaul .
However , they also took a good 20 to 30 seconds per page of changes to make .
The web interface was amazingly slow .
Costs
The Proxims cost $ 450 each new ( compared to $ 180 - ish for the DLink ) .
I had originally looked at ebay and found they could be had for under $ 200 , but there just were n't enough of these auctions available in the weeks leading up to the conference for me to have gotten them at this price .
At full price , the Proxims alone would have been over twice my budget for the number of APs I was hoping to get .
I spent around $ 800 getting hardware in to evaluate .
This included 4 Proxim APs ( of which one was just broken , one was somehow a dual 802.11a AP and did n't have the b+g radio ) and would have covered getting 2 of the DLinks .
In the end I just ordered a dozen of the DLinks because time was getting short .
I had a 1.5 week long business trip a week before PyCon which blew my schedule .
Next Year
Total cost spent on APs was around $ 2200 for the APs we used for the conference .
Time required to architect the network , evaluate and select the hardware , set up test and deploy the network , was around 70 hours .
The hotel in Chicago where we are holding PyCon next year has already said , flat out , that they will not allow us to hook our network gear to their network .
We are trying to make sure they understand the magnitude of the job they are taking on .
They are also offering an SLA .
As a contingency , we are keeping the wireless gear from this year , so if the poo hits the fan next year we will have the hardware on hand to fix it , even if the hotel can't .
We are also getting competitive quotes from other providers for what it 'll cost to bring in our own network line for the event .
Hotels charge tens of thousands of dollars for providing a network , and a full DS - 3 ( 45 mbps ) can cost $ 2500 / month for a year term , so we may be in the ballpark .
Especially if we are going to use the connection two years in a row ( paying off the build - out for the first year over two events ) .
I suspect the hotel is n't up to dealing with the networking requirements of PyCon because they have told us they are using T1 lines .
10 years ago , a T1 line was a mighty Internet connection .
Today , it 's pretty sad .
I have over 6 x that bandwidth into my house .
My recommendation for bandwidth next year would require 7 to 14 T1s , which is just silly .
In Conclusion
I also hope that the hotel networking folks at least read this to get an idea of what they 're committing to .
I 'm also going to ask them to run their network design past me , just so we can assure their plans are mighty enough to handle the reality of PyCon .
I went into this saying " It 'd be hard to make it as bad as last year . "
I was hoping for a perfect network experience for all , but admit I did n't quite meet that .
The biggest issues being the upstream network and shaping that did n't work as I 'd hoped .
However the " better than last year " target was undeniably achieved .
If I were to do it again , I 'd add even more APs , particularly in the center of the ballroom ( I had them around the outside ) .
My initial estimate of 15 APs was probably spot on , I reduce it to 12 to try to stay in budget , despite AMK saying that I could go over budget .
Last minute FedExing cost nearly 20 % of my budget and was responsible for nearly my entire overrun .
the big applause when AMK thanked me for the networking made all the time and effort worth it .
But , to be honest , the reduction in problems over last year , which meant that I could spend more time enjoying the conference , was the big payoff .
I 'll admit I was kind of floored by AMK saying in the closing address " If Sean can do this for the conference , imagine what tummy.com can do for your business . "
That waskind of him .
People stopping me in the hall and saying " Yay " was also quite uplifting .
Literally , I spent most of my time on the network helping people who were having problems with their machine rather than the problem being related to the network .
Shameless Plug
So , overall I 'd call it a total success , though with a few things I 'd do differently .

Why Iranians of all stripes are packing the cinemas to see it
Illustrations
The troubadours of Tollywood
FOR a man who used to beat up reform - minded students , Masoud Dehnamaki comes across as deceptively mellow .
Once a militia leader , he has put away his cudgel and directed one of Iran 's biggest - ever cinema hits .
After two successful documentaries , about prostitution and football violence , Mr Dehnamaki 's first feature film , now filling cinemas in the capital , Tehran , is an irreverent comedy called Ekhrajiha ( “ The Outcasts ” ) .
By portraying a gang of Tehran thieves and junkies as war heroes , it took the authorities by surprise .
At the start of the film , the hero , Majid , is imprisoned for attacking a man who makes salacious comments to a virtuous young woman .
Despite the authorities ' unwillingness to accept Majid and his unsavoury friends as volunteers in the war against Iraq ( all of whom were meant to be devout ) , they reach the front line to be redeemed by sacrifice .
When Ekhrajiha failed to win any of the prizes at the recent Fajr International Film Festival in Tehran , Mr Dehnamaki hinted that the authorities wanted to suppress it for being subversive .
But his dismissive attitude to the revolution 's sacred cows has won him wide admiration , among both liberal intellectuals and Muslim fundamentalists .
His first documentary , about prostitution , was equally provocative , breaking an official taboo by suggesting that the Islamic republic 's veneer of virtue hid a society marred by corruption and poverty .
Mr Dehnamaki was traumatised by the war .
Until a few years ago his office looked like a trench , with sandbags and ammunition boxes .
After his return from the front , he joined Ansar-e Hizbullah ( “ Followers of the Party of God ” ) , a violent vigilante group that reveres Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader .
Later , as editor of the group 's magazine , he advocated political violence .
The group stands for a small core of extremists .
Many fought in the war and were dismayed by what they deemed a betrayal of revolutionary ideals during the economic reforms of the 1990s .
Now unattached to any political group , he still rages against poverty and corruption .
Such feelings infuse Ekhrajiha , which is nonetheless an odd mix of slapstick humour and mawkish sentimentality .
Mr Dehnamaki may have changed his political methods and may mock the Islamist establishment , but Iran 's liberals are wary of him , knowing they are still his biggest natural enemies .

Naughtiness can be fun More and more badly behaved children are being diagnosed with conditions like ADHD .
Latest figures show global use of ADHD drugs has nearly tripled since 1993 .
In England and Wales alone , prescriptions for the standard treatment , a drug called Ritalin , rocketed from just 4,000 in 1994 to 359,000 in 2004 .
At least one in 20 schoolchildren - 360,000 in total - is thought to have some degree of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Some experts say this is the tip of the iceberg and there are many more children out there going undiagnosed .
But what ever happened to sheer naughtiness ?
There is a temptation to use it as a get out - by doctors as well
Dr Sami Timimi
Child and adolescent psychiatrist Critics argue bad behaviour in children is being over - medicalised , and even that the labels are being used to excuse unruly behaviour .
Indeed , the US psychiatrist who identified attention deficit disorder says up to 30 % of youngsters classified as suffering from disruptive and hyperactive conditions could have been misdiagnosed .
Dr Robert Spitzer , professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York , says many may not really be ill and may simply be showing perfectly normal signs of being happy or sad .
" Ain't misbehaving " Dr Sami Timimi , a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist in Lincolnshire , says there is a real danger that the diagnosis is becoming a dumping ground for simple bad behaviour .
" There is no test for ADHD .
It is diagnosed on the basis of a questionnaire , which is subjective .
" We are creating ADHD out of behaviours that would previously have been perceived as normal .
" There is a temptation to use it as a get out - by doctors as well . "
He suggested undesirable behaviour might be more common because family life had changed .
" We have had the demise of the extended family , increasing separation and divorce and more working parents .
" It is harder than ever to be a normal parent these days .
The expectations are higher . "
Disobedient or disorder
But he said parents should not be held solely to blame - many other factors could also be involved .
Children are living more sedentary lifestyles , sitting in front of TVs and computers for much of the day , and are eating more additive - laden foods .
He said education systems had also become more target - driven .
There is always a danger of over - labelling , but in the UK in the main it 's under - recognition
Dr David Coghill
Senior lecturer in child and adolescent psychiatry
He pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry had profited from rising cases of ADHD , by selling more stimulant drugs .
Vivienne Streeter , director of family services for the British Institute for Brain Injured Children , says disorders such as ADHD can be distinguished easily from simple naughtiness .
" ADHD is a definite medical condition .
It 's there from birth , is lifelong and present in all situations .
You can't get a child who is just ADHD at school or at home .
" Compare that with a naughty child - they can be very good in one setting but chose to be naughty or push the boundaries in another .
That 's when poor parenting , housing and diet come into play . "
But she conceded that it could be hard for an outsider merely observing bad behaviour to separate the two .
Antisocial Indeed , there have been cases where children diagnosed with conditions like ADHD have been hauled before the courts and given anti-social behaviour orders ( ASBOs ) .
On the flip - side , medical diagnoses are also abused .
Ms Streeter explained : " There are certainly some people who will use it as an excuse .
" A lot of parents will say their child is hyperactive or has ADHD .
I have even had medical people who have said a child is ADHD and they are not . "
But Dr David Coghill , senior lecturer in child and adolescent psychiatry at Dundee University , says in the UK the main problem is under-recognition of behavioural disorders .
ADHD SYMPTOMS
Easily distracted Restlessness Difficulty remaining seated when required Difficulty awaiting turn in group situations Difficulty following instructions Difficulty in playing quietly Often shift from one incomplete activity to another Often interrupts others
Often engages in physically dangerous activities without considering the consequences Andrea Bilbow , chief executive of ADDISS , the national attention deficit disorder information and support service , agrees .
" We are only just touching the tip of the iceberg .
Not even one in every hundred children with ADHD is being picked up .
" Parents do not take their child to see psychiatrists or paediatricians unless they have a problem .
" Why would you want to use a label for a child who does not have a problem ? "

EFT is destined to be a top healing tool for the 21st Century
Cheryl Richardson
Author of The Unmistakable Touch of Grace .
This essay describes the surprising results of a brief trial with a group of new computer users about the relative ease of the command line interface versus the GUIs now omnipresent in computer interfaces .
It comes from practical experience I have of teaching computing to complete beginners or newbies as computer power - users often term them .
Introduction
Around 2001
I spent some time working part - time at a local adult - education centre teaching CLAIT , a beginners computing course , to a wide variety of people .
These were complete beginners ; many had never turned on a machine before .
It was as much an education to myself as it was to them .
The key thing to remember about these newbies that I taught is that they were not in any way stupid or slow .
Many of them had mastered complex technical jobs and excelled in their chosen field .
All these people felt that they were being left behind by IT and that there was some percieved intellectual barrier to entering the computer - enhanced world .
This initial assumption on their part is key to the following discussion .
These people are technophobic both in that they fear being left behind by the rapid advance of technology and that they fear the technology itself .
The former fear is best addressed at the social level but the latter fear may have some justification based on their mental model of the world .
This essay describes some of the observations I made when giving some of the more advanced members tow brief session with a Linux session over SSH .
A PuTTY window was made full screen and the users told that the computer was “ now running in discussion mode ” .
No mention of alternate operating systems was made until the end of the trial .
The users were given a brief talk at the beginning of each session and a ‘ cheat - sheet ’ of common commands .
The advanced users were encouraged to work with each other while I spent time with the rest of the class .
A day in the life of Aunt Tillie
Human beings are simply not brought up to deal with the GUIs of modern day computing systems .
Consider the level of training that used to be involved with teaching one worker how to correctly interpret and operate a single control panel on some machine .
To master modern GUIs , one must recall the operation , layout and relation to each other of hundreds , if not thousands , of such panels .
The hardest skill being recalling or discovering the correct sequence of operations on one control panel to access a control panel relating to a desired operation .
Compare this to modern day life .
Such nested control panels are rare and single ones at least are uncommon ( one example being ATMs ) .
Instead , to discover the appropriate interface metaphor , we should consider one day in the life of the subject of many of Eric S. Raymond ’s famous thought experiments , Aunt Tillie .
Aunt Tillie has spent all her life coping quite well without computers .
She has , no doubt , had a high - flying intellectual job and now in her twilight years she has moved into retirement .
Aunt Tillie is not stupid .
She is perfectly capable of dealing with people , places and things that arise in her life .
A typical day for Aunt Tillie involves getting up , walking downstairs and checking for any post that may have been delivered .
To do this she simply walks to the wicker box hanging under a slot in her door and opens it .
She sees two envelopes and takes them to the breakfast table in the kitchen .
Being a typical English lady , she likes to start the day with a refreshing cuppa .
Putting on the kettle to boil she sits down and opens the envelopes one - by - one reading the contents of each letter before opening the next .
One is a letter from her nephew Eric letting her know that all is well in America and that he is enjoying himself .
Aunt Tillie places the letter on the side - table to remind her to write a reply later in the day .
The second is some circular advertising some credit card Aunt Tillie neither wants , nor needs .
She opts to throw it in the bin .
By this point she realises that the kettle has boiled by the little click it made as it turned itself off .
She goes to it and makes a nice cup of tea .
Once she has finished her breakfast , Aunt Tillie sets off to do some shopping .
Tillie always goes to the little corner grocer because she likes being able to talk about what products are on special offer and what she wants with the grocer .
The conversations are usually restricted to fruit and veg but Tillie feels less intimidated talking to the grocer than having to go to the supermarket out of town and try to choose her shopping from the thousands of products on offer .
Once she has finished shopping she goes home and unpacks .
She sees the letter from Eric in the kitchen and is reminded to write him a note .
She does so and pops it next to the letter box in the hall to remind her to take it out to the post box tomorrow .
Features of Tillie ’s mental model of the world
This is a natural day for most people and everyone is confident of how things in real life like letter boxes , kettles and grocers work .
Let us try to extract some of the features about Tillie ’s life that make her comfortable and attempt to match them to some user interface for a computer system .
Firstly , Tillie does n’t do more than one thing at a time .
Certainly she ‘ multitasks ’ , putting the kettle on while reading mail for example , but her attention is focused in one place at any one time .
The indication to Tillie that the kettle has boiled is unobtrusive and effective but she defers dealing with it until after she has read her letters .
Another feature of Tillie ’s life is known locations for known things .
Letters have a certain place when they should be replied to and when they should be sent .
Tillie does these things at different times during the day .
Finally we notice the importance of dialogue in her life , both implicit and explicit .
Tillie has an implicit dialogue with the letter box , opening and looking for letters is equivalent to asking the box ‘ Have you any letters ’ and it replying , in this case , ‘ Yes , two ’ .
Tillie has explicit dialogue with the grocer while retrieving information about today ’s products .
Tillie ’s life is rarely control panel driven .
We do n’t see Tillie ticking items on a list of products in the grocers and giving it to the grocer .
We do n’t see Tillie having to locate the open door button , navigate to the destination panel in her garden and remembering if she has to type ‘ grocers ’ or ‘ grocer ’ to get to the right place .
Throughout the entire day there is an implicit element of discoverability , be it road signs at the appropriate places , notices placed prominently or things in expected or known places .
This feature of day - to - day life is often one we overlook but it becomes painfully clear when we are placed in an environment which is not readily discoverable , such as a foreign country with unreadable notices and signs , or one which is unexpected , again a different culture provides different norms of behaviour to which we are not used .
One could consider a newbie a tourist in the land of the computer .
We must remember the neither know the language or the culture .
Application of Tillie ’s model to user interfaces
Before discussing a computer interface for Tillie , we need to find out why she is using a computer .
She has heard that computers can make her life easier and quicker .
She has heard she could communicate with Eric without paying international postage .
Someone told her that she could get groceries delivered to her door using something called ‘ online ’ .
Basically she wants to see if she can do broadly the same tasks she does every day but quicker and easier .
Tillie is not a gamer , a power - user or a hacker .
She wants an interface that assumes you will be using the computer as much like a domestic servant as like a tool .
We may assume that some knowledgeable user has initially set up her machine and Internet connection since Tillie will use the computer much like her washing machine , dishwasher and cooker .
All of them are appliances installed , connected and tested by a qualified Engineer .
We may now design an interface for Tillie to allow her to move some of her daily tasks to the computer .
Referring to the previous section we can specify the desirable properties of a hypothetical ‘ perfect ’ computer interface from the point of view of mapping easily onto Tillie ’s existing model of the world :
Dialogue Tillie is used to having dialogues with things or people .
Such dialogues make her feel in control of what is happening and puts her at her ease .
Like most humans she ( perhaps somewhat unfairly ) feels happier when she perceives herself to be the most intelligent or knowledgeable person in the dialogue .
Tasks
At any one time , Tillie ’s attention is focused on one particular task .
Other tasks may be progressing in the background but Tillie need not have to give them her attention until she wants to .
Discoverable
The interface must , from first switch on , provide a clear direction for a new user to go .
At each stage it should encourage experimentation while providing adequate notice of important or key features .
Locations Different task elements or objects have a place or method of access that is either well known or readily discoverable .
Related tasks should be in nearby places .
Tasks are related both by similarity and by concurrency ; the letter to
send is placed near the door so that Tillie sees it when exiting the house .
Appropriate Notifications
When tasks wish to inform Tillie of an event , the
notification level should match the importance of the event .
The kettle boiling is a small audible click , the fire alarm is a constant loud ringing .
Tillie may choose to ignore any of these without interrupting her task but is aware of the relative risks in each case .
The Command line – a ‘ perfect ’ solution ?
In the remainder of this essay I will discuss why I believe that a command line interface ( CLI ) similar to that found in Unix and Unix - like operating systems is a surprisingly good match for Tillie .
I will use some examples from the trial I conducted .
I shall also describe how the existing Unix - like interface matches and extensions which could make it even better for Tillie .
I ’ll discuss each of the desirable properties above individually .
Dialogue
The command line is all about dialogue .
Newbies communicate with the computer by giving it commands / asking it questions and reading the response .
All interaction is done via the keyboard , something familiar to the users in the CLAIT class , often from their experience of typewriters .
One can give the users the mental model of writing the computer notes , or talking to it via Instant Message ( depending on the experience of the newbie , quite a few middle aged newbies were familiar with MSN ) .
The mouse was avoided initially .
The command line is one - dimensional with a single point of concentration : the cursor .
The vertical axis of the screen is always time and provides the newbie with a constant reminder of what they did along with a record to show their instructor when they have problems .
Introducing a mouse causes the vertical axis to be both time and space depending on the nature of the program running .
Also the users must get used to using a mouse , not easy for a new user let me assure you .
Users find the model of CLI dialogue with the computer natural .
Indeed one user has , when instructed in the basics of the Unix command line , said “ Oh I see !
I talk to the computer in text [ speak ] ” referring to the common practise of removing vowels from SMS messages sent to and from mobile phones , especially in the UK .
Once she had noticed this , she progressed rapidly in remembering the command names now pronouncing commands like ‘ mkdir ‘ as ‘ muk - dear ’ as opposed to ’ em - kay - dee - eye - ah ’ .
Experience with the CLAIT class above showed two things about the CLI method .
One was that it mapped very naturally onto existing models for interaction .
Users very quickly picked up on the ‘ < verb > < subject > ’ syntax for commands and found it very useful .
The second , most important , thing was that users reported that they felt more ‘ in control ’ with the CLI .
This should possibly be discussed further .
It was explained to the users that computers were stupid and would only do as you told them .
They understood a special restricted form of language “ as if you were talking to a child ” .
“ Much like children , ” it was said , “ they should be told specifically what to do and if they do n’t understand they will ask for more detail ” .
Users were assured that no effect they could have on the computer by typing could harm the PCs and that any accidental “ removals ” of files could be repaired .
With this knowledge in place , the users immediately felt more in control as they perceived themselves as more intelligent , having to phrase their request in simple enough terms for the computer .
This was opposed to their experiences with GUIs where they were the ones that felt like children pushing buttons at random on control panels .
Since they were afraid that pushing the wrong button could cause disaster they were less inclined to experiment .
With the CLI they could experiment secure in the knowledge that if the computer did n’t understand , it would complain .
This superior attitude encouraged experimentation because it gave the users the impression that they would actually have to state specifically how to break the computer if they were to make the machine do something wrong , something they were confident they were unlikely to do .
Tasks
It was noted by the users that the CLI was less confusing because “ not everything is on the screen at once ” .
The CLI allows the user to concentrate on one task at a time and they were happy not to have interruptions from other tasks .
The users reported that with a GUI they were always getting distracted by having to swap between the mouse and keyboard and click carefully less they bring up the wrong window and interrupt what they were doing .
Some users asked if it were possible to make the computer do some tasks “ without waiting for them to be done ” .
These users were introduced to the job control features of the bash shell .
Here a small script was written by myself called ‘ inbg ‘ which was functionally equivalent to the ampersand ( & ) modifier in bash .
It is worth noting that the user who made the “ text speak ” remark immediately started pronouncing this “ in background ” .
The users were initially confused by the termination messages given by bash when a background task terminated but once it was explained that this was the computer saying that it had finished the task they found it very useful .
At this point the users started to diverge between those who wanted their finish notifications to be printed as soon as the task finished and those that liked the way “ the computer waited for me to finish what I was doing before telling me ” .
This will be discussed further in the section dealing with extensions .
Discoverable
This was the most pleasing part of the trial .
Here the users were instructed that they could get help on a particular command with the ‘ man ’ command and were given a brief description of how to read them .
They particularly liked the clear , consistent layout and references to other useful commands .
Many users went ‘ man - page surfing ’ by looking at interestingly named commands referenced in other man pages .
This increased their knowledge of the commands immensely .
A message of the day was set up informing the users that the command “ man commands ” would get them a list of commands to get started with .
An appropriate man page was written with a list of useful file access , modification and documentation commands along with information on how to move up and down in the file and to “ get back to the discussion ” ( exit the man page reader and return to the command prompt ) .
This was an important bootstrapping step as it got the users over the ‘ what - do - I - do - now ’ question when first confronted with the machine .
Users were encouraged to maintain a list of interesting commands using the pico editor in their “ personal space ” ( home directory , see ‘ Locations ’ ) .
A brief competition arose between the users for who could find the “ coolest ” command .
This also encouraged users to explore the system .
All users reported that they found the pico editor easier to use than Word or Notepad because “ it just tells you what to press ” .
It is worth noting that earlier in their teaching they had been informed of the Control + key method of accessing menu options and the caret ( ^ ) notation .
If I had been more brave perhaps some variant of the vi editor with its two modes would have been better — remember secretaries used to use it in AT&T to type patent applications .
The mnemonic nature of Unix commands was surprisingly easier to remember than if they had been spelt out in their entirety .
Apparently the vowel - less words and phrases gave the command names a “ quirkiness ” that was easier to remember .
I suspect the wide - use of shortened mnemonic words in “ text speak ” helped here .
Finally , all users were given a “ rule of thumb ” that often if they forgot how a command worked , the option ‘ – help ’ or ‘- h’ would print out a mini manual .
The users were also very happy when told about Tab - complete .
Especially the ability of bash to list all possible completions .
Users reported that this was really useful when they forgot how to spell a command .
One likened it to looking a word up in a dictionary where you know how is starts but forget some spelling in the middle .
Locations
Users were at first unsure of a hierarchical file system .
They all seemed to adopt the room and mentality for file access .
They understood the concept of a “ file ” as a name of a box where the computer will store some data which is placed in their personal “ room ” but directories proved a difficult concept for them to handle .
One user grasped the concept rather early on and usefully described it to the others as “ a box with other boxes in ” .
He nicely demonstrated it by showing them he had created a “ Remember box ” with files inside outlining things he had to do .
He illustrated how he could “ look in the box ” to remember what he had to do and could “ open one of the boxes inside with pico ” to remind himself of the details .
This is something akin to Tillie placing letters near the door to remind her to post them ; if you put things to remember in a single place then you only need remember where to look .
When asked if the user did this at home he replied that he did n’t because he never sees any “ boxes ” unless he opens “ My Computer ” and he would have to remember to do that every time he switched the machine on .
He said that the “ discussion mode [ was ] better because [ he kept ] seeing the Remember box as [ he did ] things ” .
A small addition was made to the user ’s .login file which listed the contents of the Remember directory on login .
The user was very pleased with this .
The user asked how I had done it and I pointed him to the file .
I said “ this box holds a list of commands for the computer to do when you first turn it on ” .
He was extremely excited by this new toy and the rest of the users quickly customised their own files to print out various messages and perform various tasks .
It was pointed out that GUIs often have features to allow them to perform actions on login but the users were unaware of this .
The could n’t visualise how to configure it because “ you ca n’t just tell the computer to click the right buttons in a file ” .
Appropriate Notifications
For the second brief session users were set up with mail accounts which could send messages to other users of the system .
Their familiarity with pico lead me to attempt to use pine as their email client .
This went well although users complained that they had lost some of the discussion ability .
They asked if there was some program that could read mail “ by discussion ” .
Time constraints meant I avoided attempting to teach them old - school Unix mail but I suggested they read the man page .
By this point the users had come to enjoy the command line interface because they “ always know whats going on ” as opposed to GUI or GUI - like interfaces where “ everything happens at once ” .
The e-mail system is easy for users to accept as it is has a direct analogy to the usual postage system .
One interesting thing that I saw a few users do independently is to save important e-mails into their Remember directories .
This strongly showed the importance of a known location for different classes of object in the interface .
The culture of human - readable files in Unix helped here a lot because the users got used to just opening the Remember files in pico to check what to do .
The bash shell has the option to inform users of the presence of new mail in a similar manner to how it notifies users of task termination .
Again the users split into those who liked it that way and those who wanted to know immediately .
All users preferred the bash notification to the alert box style used in GUIs .
The users seemed to dislike sudden unexpected interruptions of what they were doing , preferring the computer to ask for clarification or repetition in its reply .
Indeed many users said they were actually frightened when an alert box appeared .
The large number of times the alert box was for some small , unimportant thing also annoyed users leading to the habit of just clicking ‘ OK ’ to get rid of them .
The users reported that they often did n’t read the alert boxes but always read notices on the command line because “ they do n’t interrupt what you are doing ” .
Conclusions
So what can we conclude from these experiments ?
Certainly the CLI had many advantages to the GUI in terms of the important areas I identified .
The CLI had certain drawbacks to the GUI however which were reported by the users .
Chiefly was the lack of any graphics or pictures .
Should time and resource have allowed I would have liked to test the users with the graphics enabled version of the links web - browser to see if the hybrid CLI / GUI it provides would be better .
All users , after an initial bootstrapping phase , preferred the CLI “ discussion ” method for interacting .
All reported that they felt more in control and better able to find things out .
This probably was due to the higher amount of interface consistency and more task - based interface that the CLI tends to encourage .
It is far easier for programmers , naturally task based people , to code a useful , easy CLI program than a GUI .
GUIs take more work to code than standard command line option processing and this is often reflected in the relative quality of interface between them .
CLI options force the programmer into a more restrictive interface which is actually good for the newbie .
Also the barrier to providing self - documenting discoverable programs is smaller .
Documentation for each option is , in many cases , written as a side - effect of implementing the command processing .
Extensions
That being said , there is room for improvement in the CLI .
A general notification system would be useful , much like bash ‘s mail and task notification system whereby background tasks could communicate events to users without interrupting their flow .
Such a system would present the notifications either when the current command terminates like bash currently does or in some ‘ status area ’ of the terminal display , probably based on user preference .
Perhaps these things could be combined into a new shell .
One that also had a more unified method of job control , perhaps introducing ‘ inbg ‘ as a built in function .
The trial also highlighted the need for a ‘ bootstrapping ’ step in the CLI to provide new users with a command or list of commands they can use to get started .
The hypertext - like nature of man pages also encouraged discoverability by referencing other commands for the users to investigate .
Perhaps some search command for man pages would be useful here ( not apropos , that has never produced sensible answer for me ) .
For the future
I would ideally like to extend my little trial into a full newbie computing course where I teach the command line first before moving up into GUIs .
I feel that my experiences here show that the CLI provides a far better environment for first - time computer users to find their feet .
I believe it also gives them a better idea of what is actually happening inside their computer .
Subsequently many of the users in the trial contacted me with questions of how to get their computers at home into discussion mode .
It appeared that while , in the space of two sessions , they had become quite the CLI power - user they were still struggling with the GUI .
At that time the Mandrake Linux distribution seemed a useful suggestion and I burnt a few CDs to take into the next class .
What became of these after they left I do n’t know .
I hope that at least one is still a CLI power - user .
If I were to hold the trial now , I would probably recommend the Knoppix Linux live - CD so they could just “ reboot into discussion mode ” .
Please note that I made very few notes during these trials and they were a couple of years ago .
They were never expected to be particularly scientific so please note that your newbies may vary .
However the conclusions I draw here are the same ones I drew at the time and I would expect a similar trial to give similar results today .

RICHMOND , Virginia ( CNN ) --
The FBI is taking a preliminary look at allegations that some voters in eight Virginia counties received deceptive phone calls before Election Day , law enforcement sources said .
State election officials expressed concern about the calls Monday but said they were hesitant to launch an immediate investigation for fear of politicizing the vote .
The Virginia State Board of Elections notified the U.S. Justice Department and state attorney general 's office on Monday , said James Alcorn , the board 's policy adviser .
He said neither state nor federal officials were likely to " get involved " until after the election .
The immediate response to the allegations was voter education , he said .
Alcorn said the state board had received a " handful " of calls and complaints about alleged deceptive phone calls made to potential voters .
Jean Jensen , secretary of the board , said it had received two notarized complaints , one from a voter in Arlington and the second from Northampton County .
The affidavit from Timothy Daly of Arlington , provided by the Board of Elections , said he got a message on his answering service Sunday in which the caller claimed to be from the Virginia elections commission .
The caller said that it had been determined Daly was registered to vote in New York and would not be allowed to cast a vote Tuesday in Virginia .
If he did , he would be criminally charged , the caller reportedly said .
Jay Meyerson , an attorney advising Virginia Democrats , said late Tuesday it was determined Daly had been the victim of a hoax .
The Democrats notified the FBI agent in charge of the investigation , Meyerson said .
In another affidavit , Lawrence Baumann stated that he was contacted Friday by a woman who said she worked for the campaign of Democrat Jim Webb , who is running for the Senate against Republican Sen. George Allen .
The woman told Baumann that his polling place had changed to West Reed Street .
Baumann told her there was no such street in his city , and " that if she was supposed to be helping Webb , she needed to give correct information . "
The woman did n't give the correct precinct or offer to get back to him with that information , Baumann stated .
She said she was calling from California .
The Webb campaign said it does not make calls of that nature .
Jensen , the election board secretary , said that any such communication would come in writing from election officials .
" Voters should not be intimidated or deceived by phone messages purporting to be from election officials , " Jensen said .
" Any communication from federal , state or local election officials will always be in written form clearly identifying the official source . "
By Tuesday , reports had come from voters or elections board officials in eight counties about similar calls , the State Board of Elections said .
CNN 's Kelli Arena and Ronni Berke contributed to this report
Hairless , clawless , and largely weaponless , ancient humans used the unlikely combination of sweatiness and relentlessness to gain the upper hand over their faster , stronger , generally more dangerous animal prey , Harvard Anthropology Professor Daniel Lieberman said Thursday ( April 12 ) .
Just days before Monday ’s 111th running of the Boston Marathon , Lieberman presented his theories of the importance of running to ancestral humans to explain why we ’re the only species that voluntarily runs extraordinarily long distances , such as the 26.2 miles in the marathon .
The talk , “ Why Humans Run : The Biology and Evolution of Marathon Running , ” was delivered at the Geological Lecture Hall as part of the Harvard Museum of Natural History ’s spring lecture series , “ Evolution Matters . ”
While more than a million humans run marathons voluntarily each year , most animals we consider excellent runners — antelopes and cheetahs , for example — are built for speed , not endurance .
Even nature ’s best animal distance runners — such as horses and dogs — will run similar distances only if forced to do so , and the startling evidence is that humans are better at it , Lieberman said .
Modern humans and their immediate ancestors such as Homo erectus sport several adaptations that make humans , instead of some ferocious , furry , or fleet creature , the animal world ’s best distance runners .
“ Humans are terrible athletes in terms of power and speed , but we ’re phenomenal at slow and steady .
We ’re the tortoises of the animal kingdom , ” Lieberman said .
That evidence belies the long and firmly held belief that humans are the animal world ’s biggest wimps and , if not for our big brains and advanced weapons , we ’d be forced to subsist on fruits and vegetables , always in danger of being gobbled up by fiercer predators .
The problem with that theory , Lieberman said , is that we began adding meat to our diets around 2.6 million years ago , long before we developed advanced weapons like the bow and arrow , which was developed as recently as 50,000 years ago .
While some of our ancestors ’ meat - eating may have been due to scavenging , Lieberman said the appearance about 2 million years ago of physical adaptations that have no impact on walking but that make humans better endurance runners provide evidence that early scavengers became running hunters .
Specifically , we developed long , springy tendons in our legs and feet that function like large elastics , storing energy and releasing it with each running stride , reducing the amount of energy it takes to take another step .
There are also several adaptations to help keep our bodies stable as we run , such as the way we counterbalance each step with an arm swing , our large butt muscles that hold our upper bodies upright , and an elastic ligament in our neck to help keep our head steady .
Even the human waist , thinner and more flexible than that of our primate relatives allows us to twist our upper bodies as we run to counterbalance the slightly - off - center forces exerted as we stride with each leg .
Once humans start running , it only takes a bit more energy for us to run faster , Lieberman said .
Other animals , on the other hand , expend a lot more energy as they speed up , particularly when they switch from a trot to a gallop , which most animals cannot maintain over long distances .
Though those adaptations make humans and our immediate ancestors better runners , it is our ability to run in the heat that Lieberman said may have made the real difference in our ability to procure game .
Humans , he said , have several adaptations that help us dump the enormous amounts of heat generated by running .
These adaptations include our hairlessness , our ability to sweat , and the fact that we breathe through our mouths when we run , which not only allows us to take bigger breaths , but also helps dump heat .
“ We can run in conditions that no other animal can run in , ” Lieberman said .
While animals get rid of excess heat by panting , they ca n’t pant when they gallop , Lieberman said .
That means that to run a prey animal into the ground , ancient humans did n’t have to run further than the animal could trot and did n’t have to run faster than the animal could gallop .
All they had to do is to run faster , for longer periods of time , than the slowest speed at which the animal started to gallop .
All together , Lieberman said , these adaptations allowed us to relentlessly pursue game in the hottest part of the day when most animals rest .
Lieberman said humans likely practiced persistence hunting , chasing a game animal during the heat of the day , making it run faster than it could maintain , tracking and flushing it if it tried to rest , and repeating the process until the animal literally overheated and collapsed .
Most animals would develop hyperthermia — heat stroke in humans — after about 10 to 15 kilometers , he said .
By the end of the process , Lieberman said , even humans with their crude early weapons could have overcome stronger and more dangerous prey .
Adding credence to the theory , Lieberman said , is the fact that some aboriginal humans still practice persistence hunting today , and it remains an effective technique .
It requires very minimal technology , has a high success rate , and yields a lot of meat .
Lieberman said he envisions an evolutionary scenario where humans began eating meat as scavengers .
Over time , evolution favored scavenging humans who could run faster to the site of a kill and eventually allowed us to evolve into persistence hunters .
Evolution likely continued to favor better runners until projectile weapons made running less important relatively recently in our history .
“ Endurance running is part of a suite of shifts that made Homo [ the genus that includes modern people ] human , ” Lieberman said .

What I want for Christmas »
... so it takes less time
Tomorrow I 'm making a post on speed ( or rather , the benefits of doing certain things quickly ) .
So I thought I 'd balance it out with one on the importance of slowing down .
I wrote earlier on the myths ( and inefficiency ) of multitasking .
But despite knowing that , my default is to do it anyway .
I 've always had a problem with patience ... but then I got my horse .
A 100 pound person can't make a 1,000 pound animal do anything it does n't want to do .
But horseman Pat Parelli has a great saying about horse training and patience that I think applies to almost anything : " Take the time it takes so it takes less time . "
It 's a hokey phrase , I know .
But it 's easy to remember , surprisingly tough to implement , and incredibly valuable when applied .
Since I know far more about going fast than going slow , I have nothing else to offer other than a few of my favorite slow / time - related links
Adrian Savage has a new blog on Slow Leadership .
I really love what he 's got up there so far ... you 'll wish your boss was a subscriber .
My co-author Beth , and my daughter Skyler , are both into the Slow Food movement , which is surprisingly ( for me , anyway ) popular .
Evelyn Rodriguez ' blog .
There 's nothing slow about her work , but I somehow always come away from Evelyn's writing with that energized - yet - somehow - more - peaceful feeling .
Of course , we can't forget the life - changing GTD ( Getting Things Done ) ( life - changing for those who are as disorganized and chaotic as myself ) , and these helpful life support sites :
Lifehack.org
Lifehacker.com
And as many of you know , I 'm a huge fan of 43 folders
Tomorrow , we 're back on internet time , baby .
( And if you have any other links on anything related to the beauty of slow , please post them ! )

I 'm also having a blog about those subjects .
It 's very interesting how GTD has become in the ultimate " nerd / geek " tool for time management .
A couple of months ago I could ask my most geek friends about GTD and they would n't have a clue .
Today , I can ask even the less informed guy about GTD and he " might " saw it on a website or someone told him about a system named like that .
My guess ?
over the next year we will se a lot of GTD ( and hopefully , our beloved HPDA )
Awesome blog Kathy .

I remember a wonderful quote when I was working for a former employer .
It may not have been original , but it was very applicable .
The company manufactures a diagnostic ultrasound machine , which is a huge , expensive , complicated project .
A new generation machine takes something like a hundred engineers ( majority programmers ) , working for five years .
Of course , there are a lot of schedule pressures , including the pressure to patch things to make them work quickly without making high - risk BIG changes .
The quote was a direct response to that conflict :
" If we do n't have time to do it right the first time , how will we find time to fix it later ? "

Hi Kathy ,
Another fun something " related to the beauty of slow " is slowLab ( http://www.slowlab.net/about.html), an organization supported by the NY Foundation for the Arts , which promotes ' slowness ' as an aspect of personal and community well - being thru creative , collaborative projects and design .
And your post reminds me of this challenging bit from a piece by writer Deena Metzger :
" .. There is time only to work slowly
There is no time not to love . "
Thank you ( and your co-writers ) for your fun and inspiring blog !

Slowness is key to personal and interpersonal development .
Speed is key to working with objects and systems .
Stephen Covey likes to say that Efficiency ( speed ) is for things and Effectiveness ( slow ) is for relationships .
My CohesiveIntegrity.com blog is all about the slow development of internal strength .

To speed up , slow down .
Working with and training a horse will convince a horseman quickly of the merit of slowing down .
Five trailer loading training sessions lasting 10 minutes each trumps two hours of hurry up , we 've got to get this horse on the trailer for the horse show now sessions .
My attention span is about the same as my horses '- twenty minutes .

I would characterize the common theme that runs through many of the excellent slowness - related observations and links you ( and your other readers ) provide as " mindfulness " , " attentiveness " or " presence " .
One of my favorite evangelists of this theme is Jon Kabat - Zinn , author of " Wherever You Go , There You Are " and other inspiring books ( http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/297958/102-0942719-0092166).
At his Center for Mindful Medicine , he leads his students through an exercise of mindfully eating a single raisin :
" You look at the raisin - - feel it , smell it , and with awareness bring it to the mouth gradually , and see that saliva starts to get secreted just as you bring it up .
Then you take the raisin into the mouth , and you begin to taste this thing that we usually eat automatically .
From there it's a very short jump to realize that you may not actually be in touch with many of the moments of your life , because you 're so busy rushing someplace else . "
Another evangelist of mindfulness is Oriah Mountain Dreamer ( http://www.oriahmountaindreamer.com), who writes in her book " The Invitation " :
" It is not the being , not even the doing that exhausts .
It is the trying …
I am afraid that if I am not accomplishing something I will disappear , I will have nothing to offer when we meet .
I want to be able to live for a day , a month , a year – even a life – that would n’t make a good story .
If I have nothing to tell you when we met and you ask me what has been happening , I want to be fully content with this .
I want to be able to occupy my life right to the corners and for this to be enough . … "
She also shares a mindfulness restoring meditation wherein she simply says to herself " slow down " on an inhalation , and " let go " on an exhalation .
I hope you enjoyed a nice , slow respite ... before gearing up for your speed post !

Thanks for mention !
I do n't know where I read it first , but " go slow to go fast " is my new motto last few years ( I used to be a chaotic , frenzied , stress kitten ) .
But the slow is more a matter of being present than languid laziness .
I 'm still on Internet time .
The difference is now it 's not killing me .
The most helpful book I 've read on being present is Eckhart Tolle 's " The Power of Now . "
There 's a section in there ( pages 68 - 72 in the hardcover version ) titled : Wherever You Are , Be There Totally .
That right there sums it up .
This is my fav snippet :
" Stress is caused by being " here " but wanting to be " there , " or being in the present but wanting to be in the future .
It 's a split that tears you apart inside .
To create and live with such an inner split is insane .
The fact that everyone else is doing it does n't make it any less insane .
If you have to , you can move fast , work fast , or even run , without projecting yourself into the future and without resisting the present .
As you move , work , run - do it totally .
Enjoy the flow of energy , the high energy of that moment .
Now you are no longer stressed , no longer splitting yourself in two .
Just moving , running , working - and enjoying it .
Or you can drop the whole thing and sit on a park bench .
But when you do , watch your mind .
It may say : " You should be working .
You are wasting time . "
Observe the mind .
Smile at it . "
I know when I read that and then applied it , it truly rocked my world .
p.s. I love http://whiskeyriver.blogspot.com.
It always manages to still me and sweep me away .

Slow is very much about NOT doing .
And being fine with it .
Quote :
... procrastination is a " disease " only from the point of view of the heroic ego , which believes it can and should control everything -- first discipline the self , then save the world .
( " Enormous inner strength and will ! " " The fight of your life , for the rest of your life ! " )
Procrastination is one of the signs of the soul at work , undermining and sabotaging the grandiose aspirations of the hero - ego , perhaps so that something real can happen , or not happen , as it , not I , wish .

A video â€ œcamera trapâ€ positioned inside the jungle has captured rare footage of an elusive Borneo rhino , WWF and Malaysiaâ€™s Sabah Wildlife Department announced today .
This two - minute video â€ “ showing the animal eating , walking to the camera and sniffing the equipment â€ “ is the first - ever footage of observing the behaviour in the wild of one of the worldâ€™s rarest rhinos .
Well sniffing the camera might not be giving this video full justice .
I have a feeling that if this had been anything other than a camera that this rhino would have messed it up pretty good .
That big black horn on its head does n’t look like its used to pick its teeth .
The Borneo Rhino is closely related to this Indian Rhino
Scientists estimate there are only between 25 and 50 rhinos left on the island of Borneo .
These last survivors of the Bornean subspecies of Sumatran rhinos are believed to remain only in the interior forests of Sabah , Malaysia â€ “ an area known as the â€œHeart of Borneo.â€ 
The rhinos are so secretive that the first - ever still photo of one was captured last year .
â€ œThese are very shy animals that are almost never seen by people , â€ said Mahedi Andau , director of the Sabah Wildlife Department .
â€
œThis video gives us an amazing opportunity to spy on the rhinoâ€™s behaviour.â€ 
The rhinos in Sabah spend their lives in dense jungle where they are rarely seen , which accounts for the lack of any previous photographs of them in the wild .
The video camera trap that captured the rhino footage was developed by Stephen Hogg , Head of Audio Visual at WWF - Malaysia .
After successfully testing the newly developed camera trap on Malayan tigers in Peninsula Malaysia , it was set up in Sabah to capture the Sumatran rhino .
Photos and video footage can determine the condition of rhinos , help identify individual animals and show how they behave in the wild .
â€ œWe did a pilot test with two of my video cameras in an area that the field team had determined was used by rhinos .
The first time we checked them , after four weeks , there were these fantastic images , â€ 
Hogg said .
â€
œThis is further proof that these video cameras do work and are of value to our conservation work .
This footage is awesome and could not have been better.â€ 
On Borneo , there have been no confirmed reports of rhinos apart from those in Sabah for almost 20 years , leading experts to fear that the species may now be extinct on the rest of the island .
Major threats include poaching , illegal encroachment into key rhino habitats , and the fact that the remaining rhinos are so isolated that they may rarely or never meet to breed .
â€ œThe photos and video footage will be used to determine the condition of the rhinos in the wild , â€ said Raymond Alfred , project manager for WWFâ€™s Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy ( AREAS ) .
â€ œBut we have to realize that these rhinos could face extinction in the next ten years if their habitat continues to be disturbed and enforcement is not in place .â€ 
Recently , the ministers of the three Bornean governments â€ “ Brunei Darussalam , Indonesia and Malaysia â€ “ signed an historic Declaration to conserve and sustainably manage the Heart of Borneo .
This has put the area on the global stage of conservation priorities .

This is why “ This Is Why I ’m Hot ” is hot : Because it ’s hot .
There are of course other reasons the breakout single from Mims , a Washington Heights rapper who intends to carry New York hip - hop on his back and restore us to glory , is hot .
It ascended to number one on Billboard ’s Hot 100 , for example , and topped iTunes ’ singles chart as well .
But consider these other , purer , more intangible reasons why it ’s hot , best explained by Mims himself over the course of the song .
Where appropriate , we will back him up with visual aids .
The most amazing line in “ This Is Why I ’m Hot ” — and , even at this early a juncture , quite possibly the most amazing line of any song to see release in 2007 — is “ I ’m hot ’ cause I ’m fly / You ai n’t ’ cause you not . ”
Brutal and unassailable in its simplicity .
Consider the reasoning , first , of just “ I ’m hot ’ cause I ’m fly ” :
Mims is hot because he ’s fly .
But it raises the question :
Does being hot guarantee one ’s being fly ?
“ You ai n’t ’ cause you not ” would seem to clear that up :
It would appear that fly and hot are interchangable .
If you are one , you are both ; if you are n’t at least one , you are neither .
If you find completely overlapping Venn diagrams visually unhelpful , consider this tautology :
If that ’s a bit pretentious , then maybe a blunt flowchart works best :
The other remarkable , oft - quoted line in “ This Is Why I ’m Hot ” is “ I could sell a mil ’ sayin ’ nothin ’ on a track . ”
Critics gibe that “ This Is Why I ’m Hot ” proves precisely that ; others muse on what Mims would sell if he deigned to actually say something on a track .
Would he sell less than a mil ’ ?
Exactly a mil’ , as when he said nothing ?
Or a great deal more than a mil ’ ?
The song does not elaborate .
In any event , note that he can do those things , not will , which suggests he might not .
As these claims and predictions are speculative , there are more possible outcomes ; it seems reasonable to assert that Mims ca n’t sell more than a mil ’ sayin ’ nothin’ .
Though we would love to see him try .
Sonically , the most entertaining part of “ This Is Why I ’m Hot ” is the first verse , in which Mims underscores his hotness by touting his skill at adapting to regional styles , as the slow , minimal , eerie beat morphs beneath him , sampling both “ Nuthin ’ But a G Thang ” and “ Jesus Walks . ”
In the Dirty Dirty ( South ) he makes the ladies bounce .
He slows it down in the Midwest per their preference .
He does it the Cali way in L.A. , and in Chi , in addition to adeptly moving the crowds from side to side , everyone loves his fashion sense .
( If you enjoy nothing else about “ This Is Why I ’m Hot , ” acknowledge the rakish , immensely appealing way Mims says the word attire . )
Our quarrel lies with “ If you need it hyphy / I take it to the Bay , ” an homage to the Oakland –San Francisco Bay Area ’s relentlessly knuckleheaded and sorta wonderful hyphy movement , with its proclivities for going dumb , making thizz faces , ghost - riding the whip , etc. ( Yahdidabooboo . )
But unlike Mims ’s other geographical shout - outs , that ’s all he says here — ” I take it to the Bay / ’ Frisco to Sac - town / They do it e’y ’day . ”
First of all , no one calls it “ Frisco ” except rhyme - starved rappers , and the only worthwhile MCs living anywhere near Sacramento are in prison .
But even worse , there ’s no style adjustment here — he just takes it to the Bay .
This is wholly insufficient for hotness — several entities that take it to the Bay do not qualify :
The song ’s other two verses are a relative letdown —
Mims can get chopped birds by the flock , he ’s got money in the bag , he coordinates his outfits , he compels you to Google the word guap , people tend to like how he records , he ’s into big spendin ’ , bah .
He does intimate that we will find him “ with different women ” that we personally have “ never had , ” which is awfully gentlemanly of him , really .
Since we ’re feeling charitable we ’ll assume all of Mims ’s women are hot ; with regard to our own conquests , it ’s best to be honest with ourselves .
Though a fantastic song , “ This Is Why I ’m Hot ” verily reeks of Skee - Lo .
It ’s so distinctive and goofy that no follow - up could possibly do it justice .
But even if Mims is not built for endurance , he has given us an invaluable gift nonetheless — reclaiming and re-energizing the word hot after years of abuse .
Plumbing one ’s memory ( with a bit of Internet aid ) reveals how even reputable musicians have overused the “ I ’m hot like _____ ” construction .
Behold :
Yes .
Mere mortals are hot like other people or things ; having ascended to a higher plane , Mims is hot like Mims .
It does n’t get hotter than that .
Construction of the first - ever vault to protect the world 's agricultural seeds is scheduled to get underwayin March on an island in the Arctic archipelago between the North Pole and Norway .
The $ 5 - million vault , funded by the Norwegian government , will be built deep inside the permafrost of a mountain on Svalbard .
Referredtoas the " Noah 's Ark " for seeds , the vault will protect more than 1.5 million different seed types from crops such as wheat and rice , including Canadian seeds , saysNina Due , who is with Norway 's Agriculture Department .
" It 's remote and therefore more secure than other places in the world today and , of course , you have the permafrost , " Due told CBC News .
The vault will be operated by the Rome - based Global Crop Diversity Trust , says spokesperson Cary Fowler .
In the last few years irreplaceable seed banks have been destroyed by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and by typhoons , he said .
Now climate change is also a threat , he said .
" So the seed vault in Svalbard really provides a safety net , the ultimate security for what is arguably the most valuable natural resource on earth , " Fowler said .
Retired University of Saskatchewan professor Bryan Harvey applauds the establishment of the vault .
" The idea being that if anything happens , heaven forbid , to the original sample , we still have the backup in Svalbard , " he said .
The seed vault is expected to be ready for operation by the winter of 2008 .
Ms. Hatto usually stole from younger artists who were not household names , although on the basis of the reviews she received , they richly deserved to be .
Her recording of Chopin mazurkas seems to be by Eugen Indjic ; the fiendishly difficult transcription of Chopin studies by Leopold Godowsky are actually recordings by Carlo Grante and Marc - André Hamelin ; her Messiaen recordings were by Paul S. Kim ; her version of the “ Goldberg ” Variations of Bach at least in part by Pi-Hsien Chen ; the complete Ravel piano music by Roger Muraro .
As reports come in , the rip - off list grows daily .
Her concerto recordings are even more brazen .
The CD labels say they were made with the National Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra , always conducted by one René Köhler .
Mr. Barrington - Coupe told a reporter that this was his name for a pick - up orchestra of Polish émigrés whom , he said , came out from London to record at a venue he now refuses to reveal .
He declined to further discuss the orchestra on the grounds that they were employed “ below union rates . ”
No one has yet been able to find a single reference to this René Köhler outside of the Joyce Hatto recordings , nor have any members of the orchestra come forward to confirm Mr. Barrington - Coupe ’s story .
In a rapturous review of Ms. Hatto ’s playing of Rachmaninoff ’s Third Concerto , one critic said of the orchestra musicians : “ It does n’t matter who they are , their playing is tight and hot . ”
Actually , it did matter , since they have turned out to be the Philharmonia Orchestra of London , conducted by Esa - Pekka Salonen , performing with the formidable Yefim Bronfman .
Her version of the Brahms Second Concerto is Vladimir Ashkenazy ’s , with the Vienna Philharmonic under Bernard Haitink laboring in the name of René Köhler and his non-union Poles .
Since the news broke , some have likened the exploits of Joyce Hatto to the notorious 20th - century Vermeer forger Han van Meegeren .
But the differences are significant .
Van Meegeren ’s success was based as much on presentation — stories of old Italian families impoverished before World War II and needing quick cash — as on artistic plausibility .
After he confessed , it was not hard for anyone to see that his dreadful fakes had more in common with each other than with any original Vermeers .
Joyce Hatto , however , was not a pianistic forger .
In order to forge a piano performance , she would have had to record Beethoven ’s “ Hammerklavier ” herself and sell it to the world as a lost recording by , say , William Kapell .
She was instead a plagiarist : she stole other pianists ’ work and , with only a few electronic alterations , sold it as her own .
Although the critics who praised Van Meegerens ’s “ Vermeers ” as masterpieces were in the end rightly humiliated , the same should not be true of those who praised Ms. Hatto ’s recordings .
They may have been fooled , but their opinions were not foolish , because the artists she ripped off played beautifully .

We may have seen it all before in science - fiction films .
But the bionic warrior is in fact a vision of real - life warfare in the 21st century .
U.S. defence chiefs hope to have their troops kitted out in the outlandish combat gear as soon as 2020 .
Included in the Pentagon 's Future Warrior Concept are a powerful exoskeleton , a self - camouflaging outer layer that adapts to changing environments and a helmet which translates a soldier 's voice into any foreign language .
Scroll down for more ...
The future soldier will also benefit from ' intelligent ' armour , which remains light and flexible until it senses an approaching bullet , then tenses to become bulletproof .
Perhaps worryingly , several of the planned enhancements seem to owe more than a little to Hollywood blockbusters such as Robocop , Aliens and Predator .
But officials are quick to point out that many of these systems are already working in prototype form , or are refinements of proven technologies .
Some of the blueprints will be unworkable without eagerly awaited advances in nanotechnology , but researchers remain confident .
And perhaps with good reason .
The sheer scale of U.S. military research spending and the pace of recent advances in aircraft stealth technology and guided precision bombs are staggering .
Project specialist Jean - Louis DeGay , a former captain in 75th Ranger Regiment , said : " We 're already trialling equipment and technologies that did not exist a few years ago .
" The air force has just debuted its new stun gun and five years after the concept of an exoskeleton was first discussed , we have fully functioning prototypes . "
He told Soldier magazine : " Five years ago , nobody thought we'd have a portable hydrogen fuel cell , but we 've got them now .
" They 're functioning , and we 're just trying to make them smaller .
And if I 'm honest , nothing speeds up the development of technology like war . "
If the U.S. military 's vision of the future is even half - right , Britain 's armed forces will have their work cut out trying to keep up .
Even comparatively understated attempts to improve our troops ' battlefield technology , such as the Bowman digital battlefield radio system , have been blighted by years of delays and embarrassing technical blunders .

Sometimes what seems like a good idea at the time actually turns out to be a pretty bad one in the end .
Such is the case with ethanol .
Ethanol is not the answer to either global warming or reducing our dependence on foreign oil .
Ethanol has huge physical and economic drawbacks , is inefficient , and produces more harmful emissions than gasoline .
A Minnesota study in 2005 revealed that one gallon of ethanol required 4.5 gallons of water , while a new ethanol plant can use up to 1.3 million gallons of water and produce 400,000 gallons of contaminated water every day .
This type of pumping has recently shown a negative impact on Greene County , Missouri 's aquifer which has dropped 140 feet in some places , and has led to more than half of the 300 well owners in the county to report problems with their wells .
- St. Louis Post Dispatch
Currently , ethanol is being made primarily from corn .
The U.S. does not produce enough corn to meet the demand , and even if it did , would we really want to rely on it .
Current methods for producing ethanol require 450 pounds of corn to produce 25 gallons of ethanol , enough calories to feed one person for an entire year , which has resulted in an 80 % increase in corn prices in 2006 .
Continuing increases in corn prices would obviously result in an increase in the production price of ethanol , but aside from this , it would also result in an increase in virtually every food item consumed in this country .
Why ?
The answer is simple .
Corn is found in virtually all food products produced in the U.S. in the form of Corn Syrup .
Thus , as the price of corn rises , so does the price every product made from it , which does not bode well for the American consumer .
At our current rate of corn consumption , both from food and ethanol , we all better hope that nothing happens to our corn harvests , because if anything did , it would make the Irish Potato Famine look like a walk in the park .
Scientists are working to produce ethanol from substances other than corn and that cost less than corn ; however , unless these methods can make production and use of ethanol more efficient , they will do little good .
Based on my assessment of information relating to ethanol , ethanol at best is as efficient as gasoline , yet requires much more energy make and produced more greenhouse gases than gasoline to produce ( due to the use of farm equipment and processing needs ) .
That being said , ethanol also produces more harmful emissions than gasoline .
Results show that a high blend of ethanol poses an equal or greater risk to public health than gasoline , which already causes significant health damage ( because ) E85 vehicles reduce atmospheric levels of two carcinogens , benzene and butadiene , but increase two others — formaldehyde and acetaldehyde ( but ) E85 significantly increased ozone , a prime ingredient of smog ( and ) inhaling ozone — even at low levels — can decrease lung capacity , inflame lung tissue , worsen asthma and impair the body 's immune system ( which would likely ) increase the annual number of asthma- related emergency room visits by 770 and the number of respiratory - related hospitalizations by 990 .
- See Science Daily
There are alternatives , such as battery - electric , plug - in - hybrid and hydrogen - fuel cell vehicles , whose energy can be derived from wind or solar power .
These vehicles produce virtually no toxic emissions or greenhouse gases and cause very little disruption to the land — unlike ethanol made from corn or switchgrass , which will require millions of acres of farmland to mass - produce .
It would seem prudent , therefore , to address climate , health and energy with technologies that have known benefits .

If the girl who kept it knew that anyone was reading it , anybody cared , perhaps she would not have taken her own life .
She even wrote about what she was going to do , the pills , the Nembutal and Seconal and the rest , that she had stolen a few at a time over the months from her stepfather ’s bathroom , the plastic bag , the loneliness , and wrote about it in a flat , pragmatic way , explaining that while she knew that suicide attempts were cries for help , this really was n’t , she just did n’t want to live any longer .
She counted down to the big day , and I kept reading , uncertain what to do , if anything .
There was not enough identifying information on the Web page even to tell me which continent she lived on .
No e-mail address .
No way to leave comments .
The last message said simply , “ Tonight . ”
I wondered whom I should tell , if anyone , and then I shrugged , and , best as I could , I swallowed the feeling that I had let the world down .

I remember the first time I found myself in New York for Halloween .
The parade went past , and went past and went past , all witches and ghouls and demons and wicked queens and glorious , and I was , for a moment , 7 years old once more , and profoundly shocked .
If you did this in England , I found myself thinking in the part of my head that makes stories , things would wake , all the things we burn our bonfires on Guy Fawkes ’ to keep away .
Perhaps they can do it here , because the things that watch are not English .
Perhaps the dead do not walk here , on Halloween .
Then , a few years later , I moved to America and bought a house that looked as if it had been drawn by Charles Addams on a day he was feeling particularly morbid .
For Halloween , I learned to carve pumpkins , then I stocked up on candies and waited for the first trick - or - treaters to arrive .
Fourteen years later , I ’m still waiting .
Perhaps my house looks just a little too unsettling ; perhaps it ’s simply too far out of town .

Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station South Pole Radio Telescopes South Pole Radio Telescopes
A Black and White Photo of the Atmospheric Research Observatory ( ARO ) The South Pole Station Webcams
There are two South Pole Station webcams , one is mounted on the Atmospheric Research Observatory ( ARO ) building and is directed at the elevated Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station building .
The Amundsen - Scott Station webcam focuses on the USAP station building , dedicated in 2008 , and allows USAP participants , scientists , and the general public to view activity , weather , and geography near and around the South Pole .
The Vertical Link can be seen on the left side of the station , allowing access to the A - Pod .
B - Pod , the right half of the station , is connected via the elevated walkway and can be used as the station 's " lifeboat " during emergencies .
A second webcam is mounted on the corner of the station showing a view of the radio telescopes in the area known as the Dark Sector , so named for its restrictions on light and radio interference that might affect the sensitive instruments installed there .
The BICEP3 and South Pole Telescope ( SPT ) installation can be seen on the right and the Martin A. Pomerantz Observatory ( MAPO ) building appears on the left .
Both webcams are used to monitor activities around the South Pole Station and to support international scientific efforts .
Due to the extreme cold and darkness during the Antarctic austral winter , both webcams may experience downtime or even be disabled to protect the hardware .
For information about current research conducted at the South Pole , see the NSF South Pole Research Projects page .
For a comprehensive look at the Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station , visit the National Science Foundation 's South Pole Station Special Report page .
Image Availability Live webcam images from the Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station are based on two conditions : communications availability and the Antarctic seasons .
Communications Availability Live images of the South Pole are carried to the U.S. via communications satellites .
Satellite coverage of South Pole Station is available for roughly 9 hours each day , during which time live images are sent to the USAP.gov web site .
The daily satellite communications window occurs approximately four minutes earlier each day .
To view time frames for the daily satellite communications window , see the South Pole Station Satellite Communications page .
Antarctic Seasons
At the South Pole , the sun rises and sets based on seasons rather than days as it does in mid-latitudes ; hence the famous polar six months of daylight and six months of darkness .
When moonlight and ambient temperatures become too low for the webcams to produce usable images , alternative content is sometimes substituted .
South Pole Station Weather Fetching Weather Data ... Temperature Wind Chill Wind Speed Air Pressure More Antarctic Webcams McMurdo Station Webcams
Palmer Station Webcams
NOTE : Webcam images are often obscured due to harsh and unpredictable weather conditions .
The South Pole station is one of three year - around stations operated by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
The other two United States Antarctic Program stations are McMurdo Station on the Ross Island and Palmer Station on Anvers Island near the Antarctic Peninsula .
Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station sits at the Earth 's axis on a shifting continental ice sheet several miles thick .
The South Pole is a unique research site that supports projects ranging from cosmic observations to seismic and atmospheric studies .
The extremely dry , cold air is perfectly suited for observing Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) radiation - the faint light signature left by the Big Bang that brought the universe into being nearly 14 billion years ago .
Another large astrophysical project at the pole is IceCube — a one - cubic - kilometer international high - energy neutrino detector built in the clear ice , 1.25 - 2.5 kilometers below the South Pole Station .
Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station , dedicated in January 2008 , begins austral summer operations in October of each year .
The station typically remains in summer operating mode until early February , at which point the eight - month long winter season begins .
At an elevation of 2,835 meters ( 9,300 feet ) , South Pole has an average monthly temperature in the austral summer of - 28 °C ( - 18 °F ) ; in the austral winter , the average monthly temperature is - 60 °C ( - 76 °F ) .

Three thoughts to make you shudder : - Merced / Irix . - McKinley / HP - UX. - Itanium / VMS .
It has long been said that history repeats itself .
It has more recently been mentioned that history is speeding up .
But who knew that it had gotten so fast that giant corporations would line up to blow their brains out exactly the same way within three years of one another ?
April 1998 : a horrible accidental suicide begins , a suicide which will take upwards of three years to run its gory course .
It begins as a strategic alliance .
The victim is SGI which , seduced by Intel , decides to streamline its operations by focusing on making systems and software ; SGI intends to cut hardware development costs by turning to Intel for all its processor needs .
64 - bit MIPS chips look dull compared to the Intel Powerpoint - performance specs for IA64 , so SGI spins off its MIPS business and bets the farm on IA64 being out by late 1999 .
Intel sure pushes good crack .
Craig Barrett , president and CEO of Intel : " We 'll work closely with SGI to help them produce best - of - class Intel - based systems throughout their product line - from personal through high - end workstations to servers and supercomputers ...
Both Intel and SGI will work further on 64 - bit systems as Intel 's Merced processor becomes available in 1999 and SGI ports the IRIX operating system to Merced . "
Midway through 2001 SGI still has n't shipped an IA64 system because , well , Intel has n't really shipped a usable IA64 just yet .
SGI 's 1997 assets of $ 3.3 billion have , by now , been whittled away to $ 1.5 billion , with almost $ 800 million in losses reported in 2000 alone .
Since the 2000 annual report came out , in fact , SGI has sold off another $ 100 million in property and yet , in spite of that , has burned through half its cash in about six months .
The writing is on the wall .
SGI is bleeding out .
And this is why it 's so surprising that history is repeating itself so dramatically , so soon ...
June , 2001 : a horrible accidental suicide begins , a suicide which will take upwards of three years to run its gory course .

64 - bit Alpha chips look dull compared to the Intel Powerpoint - performance specs for IA64 , so Compaq gives all the Alpha technology to Intel and bets the farm on a high - performance IA64 being out well before 2004 .
Intel sure pushes good crack .
Craig Barrett , president and CEO of Intel : " This agreement with Compaq furthers our shared vision of delivering customer value by advancing high - performance , high - volume building blocks .
Our agreement will bring higher levels of performance , availability and scalability to systems based on the Itanium processor family . "
The writing is on the wall .
Compaq 's wrists are slit .
On top of these hideous reports , of course , we should also note that HP is pretty much out of the PA - RISC business , desperately trying to get itself onto the IA64 bandwagon , pretending along with everyone else that the bandwagon has wheels and a horse to pull it .
Check out that bloodflow !
To change metaphors abruptly , it looks like Intel stuck a plastic fin on its head marked " IA64 " , jumped into the 64 - bit processor pool way in back of the other racers , shouted about how big the shark was under the fin , and HP , SGI , and now Compaq have all jumped out of the pool because , well , they 're afraid that there might maybe someday be a shark grown up under that piece of plastic , and besides they think it 'll be easier to just throw money at Intel to do all the racing in spite of the sudden absence of motivating competition .

Projects
In my spare time , I ’ve developed several side projects to explore ideas that I ’m interested in .
A few notable ones are described here .
Scrolling­Content­View­Controller
This open source Swift library simplifies the creation of a scrolling view controller filled with arbitrary content .
In Interface Builder , Scrolling­Content­View­Controller exposes a view controller outlet that specifies a content view that should be made scrollable .
Everything else is taken care of automatically .
Although Scrolling­Content­View­Controller has a singular purpose , its creation required a deep exploration of the mechanics of keyboard presentation handling on iOS , which can be surprisingly involved .
This library correctly handles many undocumented special cases , including device orientation changes , sequences of view controllers with shared keyboards under a navigation controller , and additional safe area insets .
The Fourth Dimension
This iOS app explains the mathematical concept of a tesseract , which is the four ‑dimensional analog of a cube .
The Fourth Dimension is a 30 ‑ page interactive book written in simple , everyday language to target a wide audience .
Instead of static illustrations or videos , the user engages with a four ‑dimensional geometric model .
This app has a 4.8 star average from 5,600 ratings worldwide .
It has been featured in the App Store several times , and is particularly popular in China .
Despite the fact that The Fourth Dimension is an educational app about abstract mathematics , 50,000 copies have been sold at $ 2.99 .
Special Relativity
I ’m now designing an app to explain Einstein ’s theory of special relativity , which describes the surprising , unintuitive ways in which time and distance behave for fast ‑moving objects .
As with The Fourth Dimension , this app will be built around interactive models .
My goal is that the user will be able to develop an intuitive feel for the mathematics of spacetime by playing with it directly , instead of learning the underlying equations and struggling to visualize them .

If It 's Not Nailed Down , Steal It
Pattern Matching , S - Expressions , and Domain Specific Languages in Ruby

Summary
There 's a whole world of language features that we sometimes miss out on as Rubyists , such as pattern matching , S - expressions , and external domain - specific languages .
But the good news is that we can have them , too , as long as we 're not afraid to steal a few things first .
There 's a whole world of language features that we sometimes miss out on as Rubyists , such as pattern matching , S - expressions , and external domain - specific languages .
But the good news is that we can have them , too , as long as we 're not afraid to steal a few things first .
Theft # 1 : Pattern Matching
Pattern matching is a relatively rare language feature found in Standard ML , OCaml0 , Haskell , Common Lisp ( CLOS ) , and a handful of others .
It ’s a form of multiple dispatch , so pattern matching functions run different code when called with different arguments .
Pattern Matching lets you do this dispatch based on type , value , and even internal structure of the function ’s arguments .
If there was ever a time to steal Pattern Matching , it ’s now .
Long rumored but now visible in the distance , Perl6 will be making heavy use of Multiple Dispatch .
Casing the Joint
In Haskell ( a pattern matching language ) , a function to return the nth Fibonacci number looks like this :
fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib n = ( fib n - 1 ) + ( fib n - 2 )
In this recursive function , the base cases ( when the function argument is either 0 or 1 ) are explicitly given the value of 1 .
Meanwhile , the recursive case is written generically , so if the argument is not 0 or 1 , it is named ‘ n ’ , and ‘( fib n - 1 ) + ( fib n - 2 ) ’ is recursively evaluted .
The Heist
The good news for the heist is that we only need to run the goods the last mile .
They ’re waiting safely bundled in a Ruby gem on Rubyforge .
Let ’s make off with them now while no one ’s looking .
$ gem install -r multi
Phew .
Okay , let ’s see what we got .
Pattern Matching in Ruby
The Fibonacci function above looks like this in normal Ruby :
def fib ( n ) return 1 if n == 0 || n == 1 return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) end
Which really is n’t so bad .
But let ’s rewrite the above function using multi.rb anyways :
multi ( : fib , 0 ) { 1 } multi ( : fib , 1 ) { 1 } multi ( : fib , Integer ) { |n| fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) }
For better or worse there it is : Pattern matching in Ruby .
We ’ll inspect our acquisition in a moment , but first let ’s look at the example above .
Dissection
There are three calls to the multi function above .
The first parameter to each of them is the symbol : fib .
We already know this is a Fibonacci function , so we appear to be calling the multi function with the first argument being the name of the function as a symbol .
Using the Haskell fib function as a template , the rest of the Ruby one is not hard to decipher .
The parameters to multi after the method name are the pattern to match .
The fib method does two kinds of matching .
We see in the top two declarations that it is matching instance values like 0 or 1 .
But in the last declaration , we see a class instead of an instance .
Actually , it ’s a little more complicated than that under the hood .
In Ruby , the class Integer is actually an instance of class Class , but multi does some hand waving here .
It assumes you probably were n’t really hoping somebody called your fib method with the parameter Integer , and were instead hoping to matching a parameters of type Integer .
The other interesting features of the declarations are the blocks following each multi .
These blocks form the bodies of the multi-methods .
When a multi-method call finds an implementation match , it passes in the matching parameters to the block .
Of course , Ruby lets us ignore block parameters when we feel like it , so in the first two method bodies we do n’t even give them names .
But in the third implementation we match any Integer parameter and we probably want to hang onto that value .
We name it n , like the Haskell example , and then we can use it directly in our method body .
Taking It Around the Block
Do n’t forget to require the gem and it ’s components before trying multi .
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w require ' rubygems ' require ' multi ' require ' amulti ' require ' smulti '
Now , let ’s define our Fibonacci method and try calling it .
fib ( 0 ) ===> 1 fib ( 1 ) === > 1 fib ( 4 ) ===> 5 fib ( 5 ) === > 8
It works !
So far we ’ve been using multi to write what are essentially free functions .
However , we ’ll probably want to do methods that are part of objects as well .
Using Multi in Classes
A multi method is not entirely the same as a method defined using def.
multi is a actually a method call , while def is a keyword .
If multi and def were the same , we ’d be able to write something like this :
class Example def method1 ( x ) return 0 if x == 0 return @a + x end multi( : method2 , 0 ) { 0 } multi( : method2 , Integer ) { |x | @a + x } end
Unfortunately , because of the difference , this does n’t work .
But why ?
Here ’s a hint : Ruby blocks are closures .
Normally this is great , but here it means that @a captures a reference to the @a variable in the class Example .
Not the instance , but the class itself .
So calls to method2 ( ) on instances of the class will all use the same @a variable ( located in the Example class ) , while calls to method1 ( ) will use the unique instance variable in each instance .
How can we get around this ?
Well , we need to perform the multi definition someplace where the context for a block is the instance , not the class .
Someplace that gets run for each instance :
class Example def initialize ( ) multi( : method2 , 0 ) { 0 } multi( : method2 , Integer ) { |x | @a + x } end def method1 ( x ) return 0 if x == 0 return @a + x end end
By putting the code in the initialize method we get the proper block scope and make sure every instance gets the method .
This slows us down a little , but dispatch with multi is n’t blazingly fast anyways , so this is n’t such a big deal .
But this approach does have some drawbacks .
One problem in particular is that if a subclass forgets to call super then the subclass ’ instances will lack the multi-methods of the superclass .
This also makes it difficult to add multi-methods at runtime to all instances of a class without using ObjectSpace .
Destructuring
Destructuring is a fairly common operation .
For example , Ruby performs implicit Array destructuring on mulitple assignment :
one , two , three = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
Ruby can also do explicit Array destructuring on method invocation .
[ ].push ( *[ 1 , 2 , 3 ] )
produces [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] instead of [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ] .
You can start to see what ’s going on here .
Destructuring means taking apart a complex data structure , piece by piece .
The Multiple Dispatch library contains two destructuring implementations , ‘ amulti ’ and ‘ smulti ’.
amulti destructures arrays , smulti destructures strings .
Let ’s have a look at amulti .
amulti( : foo , Integer ) { |i , rest| puts i ; foo( rest ) } amulti( : foo ) { puts " DONE " } foo ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] )
Produces :
1 2 3 DONE
Methods defined using amulti must take only a single list as a argument .
The first elements of the list will be matched against the various patterns of the available dispatches , until one is found that fits .
Then those elements are removed from the list and passed in as the first parameters while the rest of the list is passed in as the last parameter .
In the example above , the first rule matches if the first item in the list is an Integer .
It then passes that Integer into the block with a list containing the rest of the list .
When there are no more Integers to be removed , the final body is called .
smulti works just the same except that it uses Regexp and String literals to tear chunks off the front of strings .
It can be used to do simple parsing and other exercises .
Behind the Scenes
So how does multi work ?
Multi is built with two kinds of objects , Dispatches which represent a pattern along a method body , and a singleton Dispatcher that handles all calls to all multiply dispatched functions .
The definition of the multi function itself is quite trivial .
def multi( method_name , * patterns , &body ) Multi:: DISPATCHER.add ( Multi:: Dispatch , self , method_name , patterns , body ) end
This instructs the singleton dispatcher to create a new Dispatch of type Multi : : Dispatch which is registered inside the dispatcher under that method name for that object .
Multi defines methods on a per object basis to get around the scope problem described earlier .
The registration process must therefore store the dispatch in a manner that it is associated with the object .
Multi does something pretty sleazy here , and uses , along with the method name , the object ’s object_id to store the dispatch in a hash table .
Since there can be multiple dispatches per method , the dispatch is actually stored in a list in that particular location of the hash table , as seen below .
key = [ obj.object_id( ) , method_name ] @map[key ] ||= [ ] @map[key ].push(type.new ( patterns , body ) )
If this is the first time a multimethod pattern has been added , a stub method must also be installed that will ask the dispatcher to run the right dispatch if the method is ever called .
if ! obj.methods.include ?( method_name ) obj.instance_eval << -" DONE " def #{method_name} ( * params , & block ) Multi:: DISPATCHER.call ( self , \ " #{method_name}\ " , params , block ) end DONE end
Then if the method is ever called , it calls the dispatcher , which runs through the list of possible dispatches searching for the first match .
dispatches = @map[ [obj.object_id , method_name ] ] dispatch = dispatches.find{|dispatch| dispatch.match ?( params ) } dispatch.call ( params , block )
Some languages that use multiple dispatch search for the “ best ” dispatch ( for example , classes closest in the inheritence hierarchy to the actually method arguments ) .
Multi is strictly in order .
One nice you can do with Multi , though , is define new Dispatch classes .
smulti is implemented using a class named StringDispatch and a wrapper ‘ smulti ’ that looks almost identical to the definition of regular ‘ multi ’ .
def smulti( method_name , * patterns , &body ) Multi:: DISPATCHER.add ( Multi:: StringDispatch , self , method_name , patterns , body ) end
We ’ll look at smulti some more in a bit .
But for now , having successfully nabbed pattern matching , let ’s move on to the next heist .
Theft # 2 : S - Expressions
Symbolic expressions , or , more commonly , S - expressions , are a rarity found almost exclusively in the land of Lisp .
Here ’s are some examples :
(+ 8 (- 4 2 ) ) ( if ( not nil ) t ( and nil t ) )
Both of these s-expressions are Lisp code .
The first is just math expressed in prefix notation common to Lisp code .
The second uses an if statement and some logical operators .
The if statement is not so different from a ruby statement , though the use of ‘ t ’ for truth and ‘ nil ’ for false may seem a bit strange a first .
And here ’s a more complicated example of S - expressions used as data , not code :
( content ( title " S - Expression Demo " ) ( rated 5.0 ) )
In it ’s simplest form , an S - expression is a list of symbols .
Lists look like the contents of parenthesis separated by spaces .
Symbols are barewords .
So :
( this is an sexpression )
is a list containing the symbols ‘ this ’ , ‘ is ’ , ‘ an ’ , ‘ sexpression ’ .
Most Lisp implementations also accept string and number literals , so we can write things like in the example s-expressions above .
Ruby gives us everything we need to represent S - expressions .
Ruby list literals are written in enclosing brackets ( [... ] ) and use commas as separators .
Symbols are written as barewords proceeded by a colon ( : ) .
Given that information , what does our simple example look like in Ruby ?
[ : this , : is , :an , : sexpression ]
Not nearly as pretty , especially when things get more complicated .
[ : content , [ : title , " S - Expression Demo " ] , [ : rated , 5 ] ]
The commas are what really kill it for me , but the colons are n’t so hot either .
Luckily , there ’s a Ruby gem to let us write Ruby S- expressions in Lisp syntax .
Another Gem
First install the gem :
$ gem install -r sexp
Then , remember to require the gem :
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w require ' rubygems ' require ' sexp '
Now let ’s take it for a test run :
" ( this is an sexpression ) " .parse_sexp === > [ : this , : is , :an , : sexpression ] '( content ( title " S - Expression Demo " ) ( rated 5 ) ) '.parse_sexp === > [ : content , [ : title , " S - Expression Demo " ] , [ : rated , 5.0 ] ]
Can it also do the reverse ?
[ : this , :is , :an , : sexpression ] .to_sexp === > " ( this is an sexpression ) "
It sure can .
S - Expressions are Built with smulti
The S - Expression parser is built almost entirely using the smulti mechanism we talked about earlier .
It uses regular expressions to tear chunks off the front of strings and builds objects out of them .
As described above , it parses lists , symbols , strings , and numbers .
Let ’s look at the parse ( ) method for SExpressionParser :: Main .
smulti( : parse , /\s+/) {|c , rest| parse ( rest ) } smulti( : parse , /\(/ ) {|c , rest| @res = List.new ( rest ) } smulti( : parse , /\ " / ) {|c , rest| @res = String.new ( rest ) } smulti( : parse , NumberRE ) {|c , rest| @res = Number. new ( rest , c ) } smulti( : parse , SymbolRE ) {|c , rest| @res = Symbol.new ( rest , c ) }
The top dispatch says if the first character is any whitespace character , to ignore it and parse the rest of the string minus that character .
However , the second and third dispatch are much more interesting .
They match the opening character for lists and strings accordingly .
If they are triggered , then the text after the opening character will be passed into a specialized parser .
The same happens for Numbers and Symbols , although their regexps are seperated out for readability .
While the leading characters to lists and strings are typically thrown away , we identify symbols and numbers when we see a character or a digit accordingly .
Well , actually a digit or a leading period for decimal numbers .
These first characters are part of the symbol or number , so we ca n’t just throw them out .
That ’s why there are passed in to their specialized parsers , unlike the others .
smulti( : parse , NumberRE ) {|c , rest| @res = Number. new ( rest , c ) } smulti( : parse , SymbolRE ) {|c , rest| @res = Symbol.new ( rest , c ) }
We do n’t need to look at all the sub parsers , but let ’s peak into the List parser class .
It ’s parse method is very simple .
smulti( : parse , /\ ) / ) {|s , rest| leave ( rest ) } smulti( : parse , /\s+/ ) {|s , rest| parse ( rest ) } smulti( : parse , // ) {|s , rest| item = Main.new ( rest ) add( item.value ) parse ( item.unwanted ) }
As in the main parser , white space is thrown away and parsing continues .
smulti( : parse , /\s+/ ) {|s , rest| parse ( rest ) }
If at any point we find the closing parenthesis , we call the inherited leave ( ) method .
leave ( ) is our way of telling the List parser that we ’re done .
It stores the remaining text in an instance variable where it can be retrieved by someone else ( in this case the Main parser that called us ) and returns .
smulti( : parse , /\ ) / ) {|s , rest| leave ( rest ) }
However , in all other situations , the text is actually passed of to a new Main parser that can handle any of the basic s-expression types that we could encounter anywhere , even inside a list .
This parser ’s task is to make sense of the numbers , strings , symbols , or nested lists that this list might contain .
And when the Main parser completes , we add the newly created item to our list of contents and continue parsing whatever comes next .
As parsing goes , s- expressions are not a difficult exercise .
But it ’s nice to see we can use multiple dispatch to quickly throw together a parser .
And the fact of the matter is , the real fun of s-expressions is not parsing them , but using them .
So shall we put our previous heists to work for us and steal just one more thing ?
Theft # 3 : External Domain Specific Languages
DLSs , or domain specific languages , are hot .
Sometimes a general - purpose programming language just is n’t the clearest or shortest way to solve some problem .
Creating a sub-language that can solve the problem more elegantly is one of the best ways to get around this .
Martin Fowler , an advocate of object - oriented programming , patterns , and agile software development , divides DSLs into two types .
In his own words [ 1 ] , “ External DSLs are written in a different language than the main ( host ) language of the application and are transformed into it using some form of compiler or interpreter …
Internal DSLs morph the host language into a DSL itself . ”
Internal DSLs
Most Ruby DSLs are Internal DSLs .
Here ’s an example from the Dwemthy ’s Array DSL in the infamous and terrifying Chapter 6 of Why ’s Poignant Guide to Ruby2 :
class TeethDeer < Creature life 655 strength 192 charisma 19 weapon 109 end
This code describes the fearsome TeethDeer creature , known for it ’s deadly bite .
There ’s no magic here , just some class methods .
It ’s nice that this code is only Ruby .
Ruby on Rails also uses some small Internal DSLs in Ruby .
David Heinemeier Hansson extends some of the core Ruby classes to let you write 3.days.ago and have it do the right thing .
Unfortunately , coding these kinds of DSLs can get complex , and the Ruby syntax may ultimately feel limiting .
External DSLs
External DSLs are n’t as common in Ruby , but they do show up .
For example , the Ruby DBI library uses embedded SQL :
sth = dbh.prepare ( " SELECT * FROM users " ) ;
So , as a point of comparison , 3.days.ago is still all Ruby code , but “ SELECT * FROM users ” is not .
Logo
Okay , enough talk , let ’s implement a simple version of the Logo programming language in Ruby .
Remember Logo3 ?
That language with the silly turtle that draws ?
Logo code is very simple and traditionally looks like this :
repeat 4 [ forward 100 right 90 ]
This produces :
Our logo will differ only in that instead of square brackets for blocks , we ’ll use parenthesis :
repeat 4 ( forward 100 right 90 )
The “ good old days ” of just flipping bits in video memory are long gone , so let ’s draw SVG ( scalable vector graphics ) images instead .
SVG is an XML drawing format , and since it ’s just text , it should be relatively easy for us to generate .
We ’ll start by creating a Logo class , and giving it a render ( ) method
def render return <<- END < ?xml version = " 1.0 " standalone = " no " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20010904//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd " > < svg width = " 100 % " height = " 100 % " xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2000/svg " > < g stroke= " black " stroke - width= " 1 " >
#{@buffer}</g> </svg > END end
This is an alarming snippet , but it just creates the headers and root element destined for our SVG file , and dumps the instance variable @buffer as part of the output .
The real trick is going to be turning the Logo commands into SVG lines and storing them in that buffer .
The Turtle
Just to refresh your memory , the little Logo turtle drags a pen with him , so every time he moves , he draws a line .
The most basic commands he listens to are ‘ left ’ , ‘ right ’ , and ‘ forward ’ .
Left and right ask him to turn some number of degrees left or right , and forward tells him to walk some number of pixels forward .
Therefore , we ’ll have three other instance variables : @x , @y , and @angle .
In order to keep @angle between 0 and 360 ( not strictly necessary , but it ’s cleaner this way ) , let ’s make a setter for angle .
def turn ( num ) @angle = ( @angle + num ) % 360 end
Now , when the turtle moves forward , we ’ve got to actually draw a line .
Using the standard polar to cartesian conversion , the move ( ) method computes the turtle ’s new position and draws a line between there and his old position ( so long as the @pen instance variable is set ) .
Of course , he does n’t actually draw the line , he just puts the text representing it into our @buffer .
def move ( distance ) oldx , oldy = @x , @y radians = @angle * Math : : PI / 180 @x += distance * Math.cos ( radians ) @y += distance * Math.sin( radians ) return unless @pen @buffer += <<- END < line x1= " #{oldx} " y 1 = " #{oldy} " x 2= " #{@x} " y 2= " #{@y} " />
END end
We ’d have enough now to actually render something if we had an initialize ( ) method to setup @x , @y , @angle , and @pen .
Then we could write :
logo = Logo.new logo.move( 100 ) logo.turn ( 90 ) logo.move ( 100 )
That ’s just Ruby though , so let ’s add an eval method .
Note that we wrap the string in parenthesis , so that the ‘ sexp ’ library will return us a list of all the commands .
def eval ( string ) run ( "( #{string} ) " .parse_sexp )
end
Go , Turtle .
Go !
Okay , let ’s put multi to use again and build a method to run Logo S- expressions .
We can put this in the initialize method along with the code to initialize our instance variables .
def initialize @x , @y = 100 , 100 @angle = 0 @buffer = " " @pen = true amulti( : run , : right , Numeric ) { |sym , r , rest| turn ( r ) ; run( rest ) } amulti( :run , : left , Numeric ) { |sym , l , rest| turn ( - l ) ; run( rest ) } amulti( :run , : forward , Numeric ) { |sym , f , rest| move ( f ) ; run( rest ) } amulti( :run , : penup ) {|sym , rest| @pen = true ; run( rest ) } amulti( :run , : pendown ) {|sym , rest| @pen = false ; run( rest ) } amulti( :run , : repeat , Numeric , Array ) do |sym , i , code , rest| i.to_i.times { run( code ) } run( rest ) end amulti( :run ) {} end
So what ’s going on here ?
The ‘ run ’ function takes a list of commands and arguments and consumes them as appropriate .
The first two definitions pull the : right or : left command off the list along with a number of degrees to rotate .
The turn ( ) function does the dirty work .
Note that all of the ‘ run ’ bodies recurse on the remaining arguments .
The definition that matches : forward moves the turtle , : penup and : pendown sets the value of @pen , and , finally , : repeat takes a number of times to repeat and an array of code to run .
So let ’s try this out .
( You can download the complete source here )
Testing Time
Running this code …
logo = Logo.new logo.eval %q{ repeat 4 ( forward 100 right 90 ) forward 50 right 90 forward 100 } puts logo.
render
... gives us :
Looks right !
Let ’s Quit While We ’re Ahead
Pattern - matching multiple dispatch , S - expressions , and Logo , that ’s a pretty good haul .
So next time you ’re missing Haskell , or Lisp , or something really weird like Logo , why not just stick with Ruby ?
Of course , you might have to steal a few things first …

Republican presidential hopeful , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani responds to a question at a town hall meeting during a campaign stop at New England College in Henniker , N.H. Giuliani warns of ' new 9/11 ' if Dems win
MANCHESTER , N.H. —-
Rudy Giuliani said if a Democrat is elected president in 2008 , America will be at risk for another terrorist attack on the scale of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
But if a Republican is elected , he said , especially if it is him , terrorist attacks can be anticipated and stopped .

“ If any Republican is elected president —- and I think obviously I would be the best at this —- we will remain on offense and will anticipate what [ the terrorists ] will do and try to stop them before they do it , ” Giuliani said .
The former New York City mayor , currently leading in all national polls for the Republican nomination for president , said Tuesday night that America would ultimately defeat terrorism no matter which party gains the White House .
“ But the question is how long will it take and how many casualties will we have ? ” Giuliani said .
“ If we are on defense [ with a Democratic president ] , we will have more losses and it will go on longer . ”
“ I listen a little to the Democrats and if one of them gets elected , we are going on defense , ” Giuliani continued .
“ We will wave the white flag on Iraq .
We will cut back on the Patriot Act , electronic surveillance , interrogation and we will be back to our pre-Sept. 11 attitude of defense . ”
He added : “ The Democrats do not understand the full nature and scope of the terrorist war against us . ”

After his speech to the Rockingham County Lincoln Day Dinner , I asked him about his statements and Giuliani said flatly : “ America will be safer with a Republican president . ”
Giuliani , whose past positions on abortion , gun control and gay rights have made him anathema to some in his party , believes his tough stance on national defense and his post - Sept. 11 reputation as a fighter of terrorism will be his trump card with doubting Republicans .
“ This war ends when they stop coming here to kill us ! ” Giuliani said in his speech .
“ Never , ever again will this country ever be on defense waiting for [ terrorists ] to attack us if I have anything to say about it .
And make no mistake , the Democrats want to put us back on defense ! ”
Giuliani said terrorists “ hate us and not because of anything bad we have done ; it has nothing to do with Israel and Palestine .
They hate us for the freedoms we have and the freedoms we want to share with the world . ”
Giuliani continued : “ The freedoms we have are in conflict with the perverted , maniacal interpretation of their religion . ”
He said Americans would fight for “ freedom for women , the freedom of elections , freedom of religion and the freedom of our economy . ”
Addressing the terrorists directly , Giuliani said : “ We are not giving that up , and you are not going to take it from us ! ”
The crowd thundered its approval .
Giuliani also said that America had been naive about terrorism in the past and had missed obvious signals .
“ They were at war with us before we realized it , going back to ’90s with all the Americans killed by the PLO and Hezbollah and Hamas , ” he said .
“ They came here and killed us in 1993 [ with the first attack on New York ’s World Trade Center , in which six people died ] , and we did n’t get it .
We did n’t get it that this was a war .
Then Sept. 11 , 2001 , happened , and we got it . ”
“ All our activities were legal and were subject in advance to Handschu review , ” Mr. Browne said .
Before monitoring political activity , the police must have “ some indication of unlawful activity on the part of the individual or organization to be investigated , ” United States District Court Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. said in a ruling last month .
Christopher Dunn , the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , which represents seven of the 1,806 people arrested during the convention , said the Police Department stepped beyond the law in its covert surveillance program .
“ The police have no authority to spy on lawful political activity , and this wide - ranging N.Y.P.D. program was wrong and illegal , ” Mr. Dunn said .
“ In the coming weeks , the city will be required to disclose to us many more details about its preconvention surveillance of groups and activists , and many will be shocked by the breadth of the Police Department ’s political surveillance operation . ”
The Police Department said those complaints were overblown .
On Wednesday , lawyers for the plaintiffs in the convention lawsuits are scheduled to begin depositions of David Cohen , the deputy police commissioner for intelligence .
Mr. Cohen , a former senior official at the Central Intelligence Agency , was “ central to the N.Y.P.D. ’s efforts to collect intelligence information prior to the R.N.C. , ” Gerald C. Smith , an assistant corporation counsel with the city Law Department , said in a federal court filing .
Balancing Safety and Surveillance
For nearly four decades , the city , civil liberties lawyers and the Police Department have fought in federal court over how to balance public safety , free speech and the penetrating but potentially disruptive force of police surveillance .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , Raymond W. Kelly , who became police commissioner in January 2002 , “ took the position that the N.Y.P.D. could no longer rely on the federal government alone , and that the department had to build an intelligence capacity worthy of the name , ” Mr. Browne said .
Mr. Cohen contended that surveillance of domestic political activities was essential to fighting terrorism .
“ Given the range of activities that may be engaged in by the members of a sleeper cell in the long period of preparation for an act of terror , the entire resources of the N.Y.P.D. must be available to conduct investigations into political activity and intelligence - related issues , ” Mr. Cohen wrote in an affidavit dated Sept. 12 , 2002 .

Heather Mills has taken her one - woman show to the skies .
The Dancing With The Stars contestant performed an impromptu mid-air dance act in a failed attempt to entertain fellow passengers .
During a flight from LA to London , the literally captive audience were subjected to the routine after Virgin Atlantic 's in - flight entertainment system failed to work , according to a report in London 's Metro .
Heather , who suggested the idea to cabin crew , took to the aisle with her Dancing with the Stars dance partner Jonathan Roberts .
But after a 10 hour flight , fellow passengers proved difficult to impress , with her performance failing to even rouse a round of applause .
Mills was back in London to visit Bea , her daughter with estranged husband Paul McCartney .
Dubliners have reason to be cheerful , the survey finds
The country 's combination of increasing wealth and traditional values gives it the conditions most likely to make its people happy , the survey found .
Ireland was followed by Switzerland , Norway and Luxembourg .
All but one of the top 10 were European countries .
The USA languished in 13th , while Britain was 29th - the lowest of the pre-expansion EU nations .
' TOP TEN COUNTRIES ' 1 Ireland 2 Switzerland 3 Norway 4 Luxembourg 5 Sweden 6 Australia 7 Iceland 8 Italy 9 Denmark 10 Spain
The survey was prepared for the Economist 's World in 2005 publication , with the remit : " Where will be the best place to live in 2005 ? "
Researchers took into account not just income , but other factors considered important to people 's satisfaction and well - being .
They included health , freedom , unemployment , family life , climate , political stability and security , gender equality and family and community life .
The Economist said : " Ireland wins because it successfully combines the most desirable elements of the new , such as low unemployment and political liberties , with the preservation of certain cosy elements of the old , such as stable family and community life . "
The magazine admits that measuring quality of life is not a straightforward thing to do , and that its findings will have their critics - " except , of course , in Ireland " .
Breakdown in Britain
The Republic has made significant gains from its membership of the EU , earning the soubriquet Celtic Tiger for its economic progress .
Commentators say it is widely admired by the EU 's newest members , and has become a model for what they hope to achieve .
Although European nations generally do well in the survey , the continent 's major industrial powers of France , Germany and Britain finish 25th , 26th and 29th respectively .
The researchers said although the UK achieved high income per head , it had high levels of social and family breakdown .
The worst of the 111 countries to live in was considered to be Zimbabwe , " where things have gone from bad to worse under [ President ] Robert Mugabe " .
Back in the mid-19th century , a certain naturalist , having spent a great deal of time sailing around the world , collecting and documenting animal specimens , and thinking very hard about why certain species turned out the way they did , came up with a notion that was — and in some quarters , still is — considered heretical : the idea of survival of the fittest , or as it is more properly known , natural selection .
That description may evoke the name Charles Darwin , but it could apply equally to one of his contemporaries , Alfred Russel Wallace .
One could argue , in fact , argue that Wallace was the true originator of the idea for which Darwin was to become famous .
The two were at least working on the same general problem at the same time though in different parts of the world , and Wallace ’s discoveries prompted Darwin to publish his own findings sooner than he had intended .
Darwin was an honorable scholar and gave due credit to Wallace , including a mention in the second paragraph of On the Origin of Species .
But because of Darwin ’s considerably greater influence , Wallace ’s contributions to the science of evolution were given far less fanfare .
( Interestingly , although Wallace did n’t invent the expression natural selection , there is some evidence that he coined the phrase survival of the fittest , though he was not the first to publish it , and so even that honor goes to someone else : a British economist named Herbert Spencer . )
Father of Evolution Zoogeography
Wallace is , however , remembered for something that has tremendous implications not only for biology but for geology too : an imaginary line that divides what is now Indonesia roughly in half .
Islands to the west of the line include Sumatra , Borneo , Java , and Bali ; to the east are Lombok , Sulawesi , Timor , and many others .
What Wallace noticed during his extensive travels in the area was that the islands in the western part of the archipelago had animal life similar to that found in continental Asia , while the islands in the eastern part of the chain had species resembling those found in Australia .
The Wallace Line was his attempt to draw a boundary between these two regions with very different fauna .
What particularly struck Wallace about his discovery was that some islands that were very far apart had the same distribution of animal species , while some that were close together had much different species .
Nowhere was this more striking than between the islands of Bali and Lombok , which are separated by only 22 miles ( 35 km ) of water .
And yet , numerous species of plants and animals — especially birds — that are found on Bali and other , more distant islands to the north and west were absent on Lombok , which had species found on other islands far to the south and east .

In 1859 , when Wallace originally drew and publicized the line , he could n’t explain in any detail why these nearby areas had such different species .
His theories about natural selection suggested that quite the opposite should have been the case , and Wallace speculated that ancient geological changes must have been the cause .
It would be more than a century before the theory of plate tectonics was developed , but Wallace would have been pleased to know that his line closely matches the boundary between two continental plates that were once far apart .
Because some of the islands on each of the plates were once connected to each other and to the mainland by land bridges , animals could freely migrate between them , but no such bridge ever existed between the two plates .
It just so happens that in some spots these two geological regions have , over many centuries , moved to within spitting distance of each other .
Wallace himself redrew the line with greater precision in 1863 .
Since then , it ’s been subject to a great deal of discussion , controversy , and additional refinement , as researchers have uncovered more detailed data .
It ’s also been discovered that the zoogeographical division is n’t quite as clear cut as it once seemed .
But the fundamental insight that the division between areas of animal species must have been connected to massive geological shifts put Wallace far ahead of his time and remains a remarkable achievement to this day .

This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on February 23 , 2007 .
New York Times article text Permission has been granted by The New York Times and the author to reprint the article on this website .
BRAMA is grateful to both for raising this issue , and for permitting the distribution of this article as a means for informing the Ukrainian public of the gravity of this situation .
ONLY THE UKRAINIAN TRANSLATION OF THE ARTICLE COMES WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR REDISTRIBUTION IN PRINT FORM .
THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH VERSION APPEARS HERE STRICTLY FOR INDIVIDUAL READERSHIP . Traffickers ' New Cargo : Naive Slavic Women by MICHAEL SPECTER RAMLE , Israel -- Irina always assumed that her beauty would somehow rescue her from the poverty and hopelessness of village life .
A few months ago , after answering a vague ad in a small Ukrainian newspaper , she slipped off a tour boat when it put in at Haifa , hoping to make a bundle dancing naked on the tops of tables .
She was 21 , self - assured and glad to be out of Ukraine .
Israel offered a new world , and for a week or two everything seemed possible .
Then , one morning , she was driven to a brothel , where her boss burned her passport before her eyes .
" I own you , " she recalled his saying .
" You are my property , and you will work until you earn your way out .
Do n't try to leave .
You have no papers and you do n't speak Hebrew .
You will be arrested and deported .
Then we will get you and bring you back . "
It happens every single day .
Not just in Israel , which has deported nearly 1,500 Russian and Ukrainian women like Irina in the past three years .
But throughout the world , where selling naive and desperate young women into sexual bondage has become one of the fastest - growing criminal enterprises in the robust global economy .
The international bazaar for women is hardly new , of course .
Asians have been its basic commodity for decades .
But economic hopelessness in the Slavic world has opened what experts call the most lucrative market of all to criminal gangs that have flourished since the fall of Communism : Eastern European women with little to sustain them but their dreams .
Pimps , law - enforcement officials and relief groups all agree that Ukrainian and Russian women are now the most valuable in the trade .
Because their immigration is often illegal -- and because some percentage of the women choose to work as prostitutes -- statistics are difficult to assess .
But the United Nations estimates that 4 million people throughout the world are trafficked each year -- forced through lies and coercion to work against their will in many types of servitude .
The International Organization for Migration has said that as many as 500,000 women are annually trafficked into Western Europe alone .
Many end up like Irina .
Stunned and outraged by the sudden order to prostitute herself , she simply refused .
She was beaten and raped before she succumbed .
Finally she got a break .
The brothel was raided , and she was brought here to Neve Tirtsa in Ramle , the only women 's prison in Israel .
Now , like hundreds of Ukrainian and Russian women with no documents or obvious forgeries , she is waiting to be sent home .
" I do n't think the man who ruined my life will even be fined , " she said softly , slow tears filling her enormous green eyes .
" You can call me a fool for coming here .
That 's my crime .
I am stupid .
A stupid girl from a little village .
But can people really buy and sell women and get away with it ?
Sometimes I sit here and ask myself if that really happened to me , if it can really happen at all . "
Then , waving her arm toward the muddy prison yard , where Russian is spoken more commonly than Hebrew , she whispered one last thought : " I 'm not the only one , you know .
They have ruined us all . "
Traffic Patterns : Russia and Ukraine Supply the Flesh Centered in Moscow and the Ukrainian capital , Kiev , the networks trafficking women run east to Japan and Thailand , where thousands of young Slavic women now work against their will as prostitutes , and west to the Adriatic Coast and beyond .
The routes are controlled by Russian crime gangs based in Moscow .
Even when they do not specifically move the women overseas , they provide security , logistical support , liaison with brothel owners in many countries and , usually , false documents .
Women often start their hellish journey by choice .
Seeking a better life , they are lured by local advertisements for good jobs in foreign countries at wages they could never imagine at home .
In Ukraine alone , the number of women who leave is staggering .
As many as 400,000 women under 30 have gone in the past decade , according to their country 's interior ministry .
The Thai Embassy in Moscow , which processes visa applications from Russia and Ukraine , says it receives nearly 1,000 visa applications a day , most of these from women .
Israel is a fairly typical destination .
Prostitution is not illegal here , although brothels are , and with 250,000 foreign male workers -- most of whom are single or here without their wives -- the demand is great .
Police officials estimate that there are 25,000 paid sexual transactions every day .
Brothels are ubiquitous .
None of the women seem to realize the risks they run until it is too late .
Once they cross the border their passports will be confiscated , their freedoms curtailed and what little money they have taken from them at once .
" You want to tell these kids that if something seems too good to be true it usually is , " said Lyudmilla Biryuk , a Ukrainian psychologist who has counseled women who have escaped or been released from bondage .
" But you can't imagine what fear and real ignorance can do to a person . "
The women are smuggled by car , bus , boat and plane .
Handed off in the dead of night , many are told they will pick oranges , work as dancers or as waitresses .
Others have decided to try their luck at prostitution , usually for what they assume will be a few lucrative months .
They have no idea of the violence that awaits them .
The efficient , economically brutal routine -- whether here in Israel , or in one of a dozen other countries -- rarely varies .
Women are held in apartments , bars and makeshift brothels ; there they service , by their own count , as many as 15 clients a day .
Often they sleep in shifts , four to a bed .
The best that most hope for is to be deported after the police finally catch up with their captors .
Few ever testify .
Those who do risk death .
Last year in Istanbul , Turkey , according to Ukrainian police investigators , two women were thrown to their deaths from a balcony while six of their Russian friends watched .
In Serbia , also last year , said a young Ukrainian woman who escaped in October , a woman who refused to work as a prostitute was beheaded in public .
In Milan , Italy , a week before Christmas , the police broke up a ring that was holding auctions in which women abducted from the countries of the former Soviet Union were put on blocks , partially naked , and sold at an average price of just under $ 1,000 .
" This is happening wherever you look now , " said Michael Platzer , the Vienna , Austria - based head of operations for the U.N. 's Center for International Crime Prevention .
" The Mafia is not stupid .
There is less law enforcement since the Soviet Union fell apart and more freedom of movement .
The earnings are incredible .
The overhead is low -- you do n't have to buy cars and guns .
Drugs you sell once and they are gone .
Women can earn money for a long time . "
" Also , " he added , " the laws help the gangsters .
Prostitution is semilegal in many places and that makes enforcement tricky .
In most cases punishment is very light . "
In some countries , Israel among them , there is not even a specific law against the sale of human beings .
Platzer said that although certainly " tens of thousands " of women were sold into prostitution each year , he was uncomfortable with statistics since nobody involved has any reason to tell the truth .
" But if you want to use numbers , " he said , " think about this .
Two hundred million people are victims of contemporary forms of slavery .
Most are n't prostitutes , of course , but children in sweatshops , domestic workers , migrants .
During four centuries , 12 million people were believed to be involved in the slave trade between Africa and the New World .
The 200 million -- and many of course are women who are trafficked for sex -- is a current figure .
It 's happening now .
Today . "
Distress Calls : Far -Flung Victims Provide Few Clues
The distress call came from Donetsk , the bleak center of coal production in southern Ukraine .
A woman was screaming on the telephone line .
Her sister and a friend were prisoners in a bar somewhere near Rome .
They spoke no Italian and had no way out , but had managed , briefly , to get hold of a man 's cell phone .
" Do you have any idea where they are , exactly ? " asked Olga Shved , who runs La Strada in Kiev , Ukraine 's new center dedicated to fighting the trafficking of women in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union .
The woman 's answer was no .
Ms. Shved began searching for files and telephone numbers of the local consul , the police , anybody who could help .
" Do they know how far from Rome they are ? " she asked , her voice tightening with each word .
" What about the name of the street or the bar ?
Anything will help , " she said , jotting notes furiously as she spoke .
" We can get the police on this , but we need something .
If they call back , tell them to give us a clue .
The street number .
The number of a bus that runs past .
One thing is all we need . "
Ms. Shved hung up and called officials at Ukraine 's Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry .
Her conversations were short , direct and obviously a routine part of her job .
That is because Ukraine -- and to a lesser degree its Slavic neighbors Russia and Belarus -- has replaced Thailand and the Philippines as the epicenter of the global business in trafficking women .
The Ukrainian problem has been worsened by a ravaged economy , an atrophied system of law enforcement , and criminal gangs that grow more brazen each year .
Young European women are in demand , and Ukraine , a country of 51 million people , has a seemingly endless supply .
It is not that hard to see why .
Neither Russia nor Ukraine reports accurate unemployment statistics .
But even partial numbers present a clear story of chaos and economic dislocation .
Federal employment statistics in Ukraine indicate that more than two - thirds of the unemployed are women .
The government also keeps another statistic : employed but not working .
Those are people who technically have jobs , and can use company amenities like day - care centers and hospitals .
But they do not work or get paid .
Three - quarters are women .
And of those who have lost their jobs since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 , more than 80 percent are women .
The average salary in Ukraine today is slightly less than $ 30 a month , but it is half that in the small towns that criminal gangs favor for recruiting women to work abroad .
On average , there are 30 applicants for every job in most Ukrainian cities .
There is no real hope ; but there is freedom .
In that climate , looking for work in foreign countries has increasingly become a matter of survival .
" It 's no secret that the highest prices now go for the white women , " said Marco Buffo , executive director of On the Road , an antitrafficking organization in northern Italy .
" They are the novelty item now .
It used to be Nigerians and Asians at the top of the market .
Now it's the Ukrainians . "
Economics is not the only factor causing women to flee their homelands .
There is also social reality .
For the first time , young women in Ukraine and Russia have the right , the ability and the willpower to walk away from their parents and their hometowns .
Village life is disintegrating throughout much of the former Soviet world , and youngsters are grabbing any chance they can find to save themselves .
" After the wall fell down , the Ukrainian people tried to live in the new circumstances , " said Ms. Shved .
" It was very hard , and it gets no easier .
Girls now have few opportunities yet great freedom .
They see ' Pretty Woman , ' or a thousand movies and ads with the same point , that somebody who is rich can save them .
The glory and ease of wealth is almost the basic point of the Western advertising that we see .
Here the towns are dying .
What jobs there are go to men .
So they leave . "
First , however , they answer ads from employment agencies promising to find them work in a foreign country .
Here again , Russian crime gangs play a central role .
They often recruit people through seemingly innocuous " mail order bride " meetings .
Even when they do not , few such organizations can operate without paying off one gang or another .
Sometimes want ads are almost honest , suggesting that the women can earn up to $ 1,000 a month as " escorts " abroad .
Often they are vague or blatantly untrue .
Recruiting Methods : Ads Make Offers Too Good To Be True
One typical ad used by traffickers in Kiev last year read : " Girls : Must be single and very pretty .
Young and tall .
We invite you for work as models , secretaries , dancers , choreographers , gymnasts .
Housing is supplied .
Foreign posts available .
Must apply in person . "
One young woman who did , and made it back alive , described a harrowing journey .
" I met with these guys , and they asked if I would work at a strip bar , " she said .
" Why not , I thought .
They said we would have to leave at once .
We went by car to the Slovak Republic where they grabbed my passport .
I think they got me new papers there , but threatened me if I spoke out .
We made it to Vienna , then to Turkey .
I was kept in a bar and I was told I owed $ 5,000 for my travel .
I worked for three days , and on the fourth I was arrested . "
Lately , the ads have started to disappear from the main cities -- where the realities of such offers are known now .
These days the appeals are made in the provinces , where their success is undiminished .
Most of the thousands of Ukrainian women who go abroad each year are illegal immigrants who do not work in the sex business .
Often they apply for a legal visa -- to dance , or work in a bar -- and then stay after it expires .
Many go to Turkey and Germany , where Russian crime groups are particularly powerful .
Israeli leaders say that Russian women -- they tend to refer to all women from the former Soviet Union as Russian -- disappear off tour boats every day .
Officials in Italy estimate that at least 30,000 Ukrainian women are employed illegally there now .
Most are domestic workers , but a growing number are prostitutes , some of them having been promised work as domestics only to find out their jobs were a lie .
Part of the problem became clear in a two - year study recently concluded by the Washington - based nonprofit group Global Survival Network : Police officials in many countries just do n't care .
The network , after undercover interviews with gangsters , pimps and corrupt officials , found that local police forces -- often those best able to prevent trafficking -- are least interested in helping .
Gillian Caldwell of Global Survival Network has been deeply involved in the study .
" In Tokyo , " she said , " a sympathetic senator arranged a meeting for us with senior police officials to discuss the growing prevalence of trafficking from Russia into Japan .
The police insisted it was n't a problem , and they did n't even want the concrete information we could have provided .
That did n't surprise local relief agencies , who cited instances in which police had actually sold trafficked women back to the criminal networks which had enslaved them . "
Official Reactions : Best - Placed To Help , but Least Inclined Complacency among police agencies is not uncommon .
" Women 's groups want to blow this all out of proportion , " said Gennadi Lepenko , chief of Kiev 's branch of Interpol , the international police agency .
" Perhaps this was a problem a few years ago .
But it 's under control now . "
That is not the view at Ukraine 's parliament -- which is trying to pass new laws to protect young women -- or at the Interior Ministry .
" We have a very serious problem here , and we are simply not equipped to solve it by ourselves , " said Mikhail Lebed , chief of criminal investigations for the Ukrainian Interior Ministry .
" It is a human tragedy , but also , frankly , a national crisis .
Gangsters make more from these women in a week than we have in our law - enforcement budget for the whole year .
To be honest , unless we get some help we are not going to stop it . "
But solutions will not be simple .
Criminal gangs risk little by ferrying women out of the country ; indeed , many of the women go voluntarily .
Laws are vague , cooperation between countries rare and punishment of traffickers almost nonexistent .
Without work or much hope of a future at home , an eager teen - ager will find it hard to believe that the promise of a job in Italy , Turkey or Israel is almost certain to be worthless .
" I answered an ad to be a waitress , " said Tamara , 19 , a Ukrainian prostitute in a massage parlor near Tel Aviv 's old Central Bus Station , a Russian - language ghetto for the cheapest brothels .
" I 'm not sure I would go back now if I could .
What would I do there , stand on a bread line or work in a factory for no wages ? "
Tamara , like all other such women interviewed for this article , asked that her full name not be published .
She has classic Slavic features , with long blond hair and deep green eyes .
She turned several potential customers away so she could speak at length with a reporter .
She was willing to talk as long as her boss was out .
She said she was not watched closely while she remained within the garish confines of the " health club . "
" I did n't plan to do this , " she said , looking sourly at the rich red walls and leopard prints around her .
" They took my passport , so I do n't have much choice .
But they do give me money .
And believe me , it 's better than anything I could ever get at home . "
Yitzhak Tyler , the chief of undercover activities for the Haifa police , is a big , open - faced man who does n't mince words .
" We got a hell of a problem on our hands , " he said .
The port city of 200,000 has become the easiest entryway for women brought to Israel to work as prostitutes -- though by no means the only one .
Sometimes they walk off tour boats , but increasingly they come with forged documents that enable them to live and work in Israel .
These have often been bought or stolen from elderly Jewish women in Russia or Ukraine .
" This is a sophisticated , global operation , " Tyler said .
" It 's evil , and it 's successful because the money is so good .
These men pay $ 500 to $ 1,000 for a Ukrainian or Russian woman .
Do you understand what I am telling you ?
They will buy these women and make a fortune out of them . "
To illustrate his point , Tyler grabbed a black calculator and started calling out the sums as he punched them in .
" Take a small place , " he said , " with 10 girls .
Each has 15 to 20 clients a day .
Multiply that by say 200 shekels .
So say 30,000 shekels a day comes in to each place .
Each girl works 25 days a month .
Minimum . "
Tyler was busy doing math as he spoke .
" So we are talking about 750,000 shekels a month , or about $ 215,000 .
A man often owns five of these places .
That 's a million dollars .
No taxes , no real overhead .
It 's a factory with slave labor .
And we 've got them all over Israel . "
The Tropicana , in Tel Aviv 's bustling business district , is one of the busiest bordellos .
The women who work there , like nearly all prostitutes in Israel today , are Russian .
Their boss , however , is not .
" Israelis love Russian girls , " said Jacob Golan , who owns this and two other clubs , and spoke willingly about the business he finds so " successful . "
" They are blonde and good - looking and different from us , " he said , chuckling as he drew his hand over his black hair .
" And they are desperate .
They are ready to do anything for money . "
Always filled with half - naked Russian women , the club is open around the clock .
There is a schedule on the wall next to the receptionist -- with each woman 's hours listed in a different color , and the days and shifts rotating , as at a restaurant or a bar .
Next to the schedule a sign reads , " We do n't accept checks . "
Next to that there is a poster for a missing Israeli woman .
There are 12 cubicles at the Tropicana where 20 women work in shifts , eight during the daytime , 12 at night .
Business is always booming , and not just with foreign workers .
Israeli soldiers , with rifles on their shoulders , frequent the place , as do business executives and tourists .
Golan was asked if most women who work at the club do so voluntarily .
He laughed heartily .
" I do n't get into that , " he said , staring vacantly across his club at four Russian women sitting on a low couch .
" They are brought here and told to work .
I do n't force them .
I pay them .
What goes on between them and the men they are with , how could that be my problem ? "
Deterrent Strategies : A System that Fails Those Who Testify Every once in a while , usually with great fanfare and plenty of advance notice , Golan gets raided .
He pays a fine , and the women without good false documents are taken to prison .
If they are deported , the charges against them are dropped .
But if a woman wants to file a complaint , then she must remain in prison until a trial is held .
" In the past four years , " Betty Lahan , prison director of Neve Tirtsa here , said , " I do n't know of a single case where a woman chose to testify . "
Such punitive treatment of victims is the rule rather than the exception .
In Italy , where the police say killings of women forced into prostitution average one a month , parliament tried to create a sort of witness protection program .
But it only allowed women to stay in the country for one year and did nothing to hide their identities .
" The deck is just so completely stacked against the women in all this , " said Daniella Pompei , an immigration specialist with the community of Sant ' Egidio , the Catholic relief agency in Rome .
" The police is the last place these women want to go . "
She said that only 20 women had ever used the protection program .
It is not clear who will stop the mob .
On a trip to Ukraine late last year , Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke out about the new slave trade that has developed so rapidly there .
The United States and the European Union have plans to work together to educate young women about the dangers of working abroad .
Other initiatives , like stays of deportation for prisoners , victims ' shelters and counseling , have also been discussed .
" I do n't care about any of that , " said Lena , a young Latvian , one of the inmates waiting to be deported here .
" I just want to know one thing .
How will I ever walk down the street like a human being again ? "

And since I 'm basically average , my behavior conforms to fairly average standards .
Which means that like most social phenomena , my behavior is affected by my perception of my incentives and disincentives to act , and the laws of supply and demand .
So , guys .
The fact that you 're a nice guy is not what 's keeping me from sleeping with you on the second date .
In fact , since I 'm fairly emotionally healthy , if you were n't a nice guy I would n't sleep with you at all .
No , instead , it 's just that it 's not worth it after the second date -- nice guy or not .
Why not ?
1 . Because I 'm pretty damn sure that sleeping with you -- after the second date -- will not be as sexually satisfying as masturbation .
Frankly , I 'm not going to be that attracted to you after the second date .
Waiting until the fifth date just means that I was attracted enough to you on the second date to keep dating you in hopes that I might be attracted enough to you on the fifth date to get some sexual satisfaction out of sleeping with you .
( All date time lines are approximate , of course .
Fifth could mean third or seventh , depending on you and me and our chemistry ) .
Believe me , I wish I were as attracted to you on the second date as the fifth .
But I 'm not .
And I wish that that the physiology of sex were such that any stick in any hole would do the job for me .
But it wo n't .
So if we make it to five dates , it 's because there 's some actual chemistry there that builds enough for me to overcome all the other disincentives to sleep with you .
What are these other disincentives ?
2 .
The chance that you 're a psycho3 .
The chance that you have an STD4 .
The chance that I 'll get pregnant5 .
The inevitable awkwardness after sleeping with someone you do n't really know that well .
6 .
The absence of the ego - gratification incentive .
It 's something of an accomplishment -- albeit a minor one -- for a guy to get laid .
Not so for women .
So , Mr. Nice - But - Not - Really guy .
The next time you do n't get laid on the second date , you should not assume that I want to have a relationship with you , and that I imagine that not sleeping with you is the way to get it .
Or that I really WANT to sleep with you , but am stifled by " society 's norms . "
Or -- sillier still -- that I 'd be willing to spend three long hours of my life with someone I do n't find all that interesting in exchange for a free dinner .
Realize instead that my body is not like your body , and my incentives and disincentives for sex are not like yours .
And that if we have so little in common and so little chemistry that there 's " no incentive " for you to see me after a second date because I did n't sleep with you -- trust me .
It 's no loss for either of us .
Because realizing this may make you less hostile and bitter , which may in turn make you more attractive and get you laid more often !

Independent artificial intelligence researcher Jeff Hawkins has an article in this month ’s IEEE Spectrum magazine asking the question ‘ why ca n’t a computer be more like a brain ?’.
Hawkins argues that while we hope that machines will be able to simulate human intelligence , we ignore the thing that makes us so – the brain .
He suggests that we need to create artificial intelligence systems that closely match the architecture of the brain to achieve this task .
Hawkins has outlined his arguments , and his own theories of simulated brain architecture , in his book On Intelligence , but if you want a whistle - stop tour of his theories , this article is a great summary .

AMD ’s restructuring is being accompanied by dramatic drops in the prices of its microprocessors , according to new official information released Monday .
In an update to its microprocessor pricing page , AMD announced high - end price cuts on the AMD Athlon 64 FX and Athlon 64 X2 microprocessors .
The fastest Athlon 64 X2 processor , the 3.0 - GHz 6000 + , is now priced at $ 241 , slightly more expensive than Intel ’s midrange E6400 , a 2.13 - GHz chip that sells for $ 224 .
AMD said Monday that it plans to cut 2007 capital expenditures by about $ 500 million , limit hirings to “ critical ” positions , and report revenues that will be significantly less than Wall Street estimates .
Further details of the restructuring will be made available on April 19 .
AMD has eliminated the AMD FX - 62 and FX - 70 from its product portfolio , selling the AMD FX - 74 and AMD FX - 72 chips at $ 799 and $ 599 , respectively , eliminating the $ 999 price tier .
Most of the remaining chips on AMD ’s price list use the Socket AM2 or Socket F form factor , rather than the older Socket 939 interfaces .
AMD ’s flagship Athlon 64 X2 line , meanwhile , received significant cuts .
The price of the 6000 + was cut by 48 percent , while the 5600 + , now priced at $ 188 , was lowered by 42 percent .
The AMD 5400 + was removed from the price list , while the price of the 5200 + dropped from $ 232 to $ 178 , a more modest 23 percent decrease .
Cuts were made down to the slowest 3600 + part , which was reduced in price from $ 102 to $ 73 .
AMD also trimmed the prices of its older Athlon 64 chips , which previously ranged from $ 102 for an AMD 4000 + part to $ 78 for the AMD Athlon 64 3200 +.
Today , those prices now range from $ 94 to $ 58 .
Slight cuts were made to the Sempron line as well .
AMD left the prices for its Turion chips unchanged .
While the processor prices generally refer to lots of 1,000 units , the lowered pricing generally trickles down to single - unit retail sales .
The lower prices also affect the prices and configurations of PCs , although price adjustments can occur over a period of weeks .
Like any legislation , this resolution [ authorizing military force in Afghanistan and against Al Qaeda ] is not perfect .
I have some concern that readers may misinterpret the preamble language that the President has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism as a new grant of power ; rather it is merely a statement that the President has existing constitutional powers . . . .
Congress owns the war power .
But by this resolution , Congress loans it to the President in this emergency .
In so doing , we demonstrate our respect and confidence in both our Commander in Chief and our Constitution .
. . .
Our response will be judged by friends and foes , by history , and by ourselves .
It must stand up to the highest level of scrutiny :
It must be appropriate and constitutional .
Within this confusing scenario , it will be easy to point fingers at an ever increasing number of enemies , to believe that the ``the enemy '' is all around us , that the enemy may even be our neighbor .
The target can seem to grow larger and larger every day , before the first strike even occurs .
And this , of course , is exactly what the terrorists want .
They seek to inflate their numbers and their influence by retreating into the shadows .
They seek to turn us against each other , and to turn us against our friends and allies across the world , but we will not allow this to happen .
i.e .
While only two Democrats in the Senate have embraced Sen .
Russ Feingold 's call for censuring President Bush , the idea is increasing his standing among many Democratic voters as he ponders a bid for the party 's presidential nomination in 2008 .
. . .
Feingold 's move is not one of moral courage , but raw political ambition .
In the words of Democratic senator Mark Dayton , Feingold 's move is " an overreaching step by someone who is grandstanding and running for president at the expense of his own party and his own country . "
" This is such a gift , " Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show .
The National Review came to the same conclusion .
In an online editorial titled , " Feingold 's Gift to the GOP , " the conservative magazine wrote that Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman would hug Feingold if given the chance .
The Moose avers that Russ Feingold is the GOP 's man of the hour .
. . . .
Here is the bottom line - the American people are not going to penalize the President for being overly zealous in preventing a destruction of an American city .
That is what the Republicans know and they are gleeful about a debate on this issue .
And they are co-dependent on the Democratic left to keep this issue alive .
Republicans finally had something to celebrate this week when Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold called for censuring George W. Bush .
Democrats must have a death wish .
Just when the momentum was going against the president , Feingold pops up to toss the GOP a life raft .
It ’s brilliant strategy for him , a dark horse presidential candidate carving out a niche to the left of Hillary Clinton .
. . . .
There is a vacuum in the heart of the party ’s base that Feingold fills , but at what cost ? . . . .
The broader public sees it as political extremism .
Just when the Republicans looked like they were coming unhinged , the Democrats serve up a refresher course on why they ca n’t be trusted with the keys to the country .
UPDATE
Feingold is mystified by the reaction .
Democrats , he said this week , are " cowering with this president 's numbers so low . "
The liberal blogosphere , aghast at how wimpy Democrats are being , has risen up in a chorus of outrage : . . . .
The nature of the split is obvious .
Feingold is thinking about 2008 .
Harry Reid , Charles Schumer , and other Democrats are thinking about 2006 .
Feingold cares about wooing the anti-Bush donor base on the web and putting some of his '08 rivals -- Hillary Clinton , Joe Biden , and Evan Bayh - - in uncomfortable positions .
Reid and Schumer care about winning the six seats it will take for Democrats to win control of the Senate . . . .
So the partisans on the left cheering Feingold appear to have both the policy and the politics wrong .
Censure is meaningless .
Changing the FISA law is the way to address Bush 's overreach .
And the only way for Democrats to change FISA is for them to take back the Senate .
This week , Feingold 's censure petition has made that goal just a little bit more difficult to achieve .
What an ass .
When Russ Feingold announced in March that he would introduce a resolution to censure President Bush for breaking the law by eavesdropping on Americans without warrants , a clear two - pronged consensus immediately arose among Beltway pundits and politicians -- including Republicans and many Democrats as well : (1) Feingold had just disastrously handed a huge " gift " to Republicans , because opposition to Bush 's warrantless eavesdropping would doom the Democrats politically , and , (2 ) Feingold had introduced this resolution not because he really believed anything he was saying about it , but only as a " political stunt , " selfishly designed to advance his own political interests ( at the expense of his party ) by shoring up the " liberal base " for his 2008 presidential run .
As for premise ( 1 ) , Democrats spent all year opposing warrantless eavesdropping ( mostly mild and reluctant opposition , though in some cases passionate ) .
That opposition culminated in a House vote just 6 weeks before the election where 85 % of Democrats voted against a bill to legalize warrantless eavesdropping .
Thereafter , Republicans did everything possible to make that an issue in the campaign , and Democrats just crushed Republicans in the election .
As but one example , 12 - term GOP incumbent Nancy Johnson made her support for warrantless eavesdropping ( and her challenger 's opposition to it ) a centerpiece of her campaign .
She was easily defeated .
As for premise ( 2 ) , Russ Feingold announced today , definitively , that he is not running for President in 2008 .
It is hard to overstate how ignorant and wrong Beltway pundits are about everything , and how barren and corrupt inside - Washington conventional wisdom is .
Russ Feingold has spent his entire idiosyncratic political career espousing views because he believes them , even when those views are so plainly contrary to his political interests .
He infuriated his entire party by being the only Democratic Senator to vote against dismissal of the Clinton impeachment charges prior to the Senate trial .
He pursued campaign finance reform hated by incumbents in both parties .
And in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , he seemed to be the only elected official immune from irrational pressures , as he not only was the only Senator to vote against the " Patriot Act , " but was also the only Senator who refused to blindly pledge his loyalty to limitless presidential power , emphasizing on the Senate floor as early as September 14 , 2001 : Despite all of that , when Feingold stood up and advocated censure -- based on the truly radical and crazy , far leftist premise that when the President is caught red - handed breaking the law , the Congress should actually do something about that -- the soul - less , oh - so - sophisticated Beltway geniuses could not even contemplate the possibility that he was doing that because he believed what he was saying .
Beltway pundits and the leaders of the Beltway political and consulting classes all , in unison , immediately began casting aspersions on Feingold 's motives and laughed away -- really never considered -- the idea that he was motivated by actual belief , let alone the merits of his proposal .
That 's because they believe in nothing .
They have no passion about anything .
And they thus assume that everyone else suffers from the same emptiness of character and ossified cynicism that plagues them .
And all of their punditry and analysis and political strategizing flows from this corrupt root .
Not only do they believe in nothing , they think that a Belief in Nothing is a mark of sophistication and wisdom .
Those who believe in things too much -- who display political passion or who take their convictions and ideals seriously ( Feingold , Howard Dean ) -- are either naive or , worse , are the crazy , irrational , loudmouth masses and radicals who disrupt the elevated , measured world of the high - level , dispassionate Beltway sophisticates ( James Carville , David Broder , Fred Hiatt ) .
They are interested in , even obsessed with , every aspect of the political process except for deeply held political beliefs -- the only part that really matters or that has any real worth .
For that reason , when Feingold announced his censure resolution , the merits of it were virtually ignored ( , should something actually be done about the President 's deliberate lawbreaking ?
What are the consequences for our country for doing nothing ? ) .
Instead , Feingold 's announcement was immediately cast as a disingenuous political maneuver and discussed only in cynical terms of how it would politically harm the Democrats .
This was the first line of the AP article on Feingold 's resolution :
And as is so often the case , Beltway Republicans and Democrats worked in tandem with this cynical , substance - less storyline -- because it's how they all really think .
Thus , the Post reported that Republicans " denounced the censure resolution as a political stunt by an ambitious lawmaker positioning himself to run for president in 2008 .
" Many Democrats ( though not all ) , petrified by Feingold 's stand , made the same accusation .
As David Limbaugh gleefully recounted
And the AP article also reported this : Marshall Wittmann insisted that Feingold was dooming the Democrats and if Democrats did n't drop the whole issue of warrantless eavesdropping , it would ensure GOP victory :
And then there was this most wretched column by Eleanor Clift , vividly echoing all of those brilliant Beltway insights with one textbook case study on how our Beltway political class , across the board , " thinks " :
[ The same thing happened when Feingold announced that he favors same - sex marriages .
He can't possibly be motivated by actual belief , so AP tells us why he really did it : " Sen. Russ Feingold , a potential presidential candidate , said Tuesday he supports giving gays and lesbians the right to marry , again positioning himself to the left of possible 2008 rivals . " ]
All of this Beltway certainty about the motives of Feingold 's Censure Resolution and the political consequences of it could not have been any more wrong .
Feingold obviously had n't decided to run for President and apparently was n't planning on it .
And 2006 saw endless controversy over the NSA program -- from hearings to court cases to Feingold 's resolution to a final House vote in which Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the President 's NSA program -- and Americans stomped on the Republicans and put the Democrats in power .
The Beltway pundit class and the premises which generate conventional Washington wisdom are corrupt to their core and always wrong .
And this Feingold announcement illustrates a major reason why that it so .
They operate from a set of completely unexamined , empty premises that reflect their own character and belief system , but nobody else 's .
They have no core convictions and no passion and think that those attributes are the marks of sober , responsible people .
And they project those character flaws onto everyone else and assume that nobody other than unserious lunatics are motivated by real belief .
All of that combines to produce a worldview that is as inaccurate as it is bereft of integrity and principle .
The excitement over new politicians like Jim Webb and Jon Tester -- and the passion inspired by Russ Feingold and even Howard Dean -- has nothing to do with long - standing and increasingly obsolete liberal / conservative stereotypes ( the only prism through which the media can analyze the election results , which is why they are so confused ) .
Instead , the excitement is due to a widespread hunger for people who are outside of and immune to the entire , soul - less Beltway machinery -- a system which , in every aspect , is broken and empty at its core . :
One of the best / worst examples of this emptiness comes , unsurprisingly , from The New Republic , courtesy of Ryan Lizza , who chortled at the political stupidity of Feingold 's censure resolution but -- of course -- knew exactly why Feingold was doing it ( h/t Michael ) : So knowing and sophisticated .
So wise and insightful to the hard - core political realities .
Always above the lowly impassioned masses and their misguided , simplistic notions ( such as the belief that there should be consequences for presidential lawbreaking -- how excitable and stupid that is ) .
TNR is always so cleverly restrained and calculating .
And the stupid liberal blogosphere -- cheering on Feingold 's stand against the President .
As though that 's about anything other than Feingold 's '08 presidential run .
How " obvious " that is .
And all of that is to say nothing about the complete incoherence of Lizza 's " argument . "
How could " changing FISA " -- what Lizza calls " the way to address Bush 's overreach " -- possibly be a solution to the president 's lawbreaking when the whole point is that the President claims he has no obligation to comply with FISA because Congress can't limit his eavesdropping activities ?
Censure was the only way ( short of impeachment ) for Congress to force the President to comply with the law and to express its objections to the President 's lawbreaking .
" Changing FISA " was -- and still is -- a complete non-sequitur to the President 's conduct , which is based on the premise that FISA ( like all laws that limit the President 's conduct concerning national security ) is a nullity .
But to Lizza , that 's the more moderate , passionless and less disruptive course .
Therefore , by definition , it 's the best one -- the only one that responsible and sophisticated political experts like him would ever consider .
An international team of over 2,000 scientists , led by Professor Tejinder Virdee from Imperial College London 's Department of Physics is stepping up preparations for the world 's largest ever physics experiment , starting next year at CERN near Geneva , Switzerland .
Professor Virdee is the lead scientist on the Compact Muon Solenoid ( CMS ) particle detector experiment , which will aim to find new particles , detect mini black holes and solve some of the mysteries of the universe such as where mass comes from , how many dimensions there are and what constitutes dark matter .
Particles are the building blocks of matter and are even smaller than atoms .
Scientists hope the CMS experiment may also help them progress towards a unified theory to explain all physical phenomena – a theory that has eluded scientists up until now .
The CMS experiment has so far involved thousands of scientists and engineers working for 15 years to design and build the massive particle detector , which is currently being lowered – huge bit by huge bit - into a chamber 100 metres below the French town of Cessy , near the Swiss border .
Next year , CERN 's Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator will be switched on for the first time , accelerating beams of particles around a 27 km circular tunnel underneath the Swiss / French countryside .
These particles then collide with each other – with higher energies than in any experiment ever before – at the precise location where the particles are passing through the CMS detector .
Professor Virdee explains :
" When the particles smash into each other inside the CMS detector the high energy conditions created in these collisions will be similar to those that occurred in the first instants of the universe , immediately after the Big Bang .
The unique conditions created by these collisions will create many new particles that would also have existed in those early instants .
Resultant particles will fly away from the site of the collision in all directions .
The different layers of our complex detector will measure the properties of these particles , track their paths , and measure their energies .
An extremely powerful magnet built into the detector will bend the paths of electrically charged particles , which will help us identify the different types of particles produced in the collisions . "
One of the particles that Professor Virdee and his colleagues are hoping to detect is the Higgs - Boson , a particle which has been theorised but never actually recorded .
" It would be a real coup if we recorded , for the first time ever , the existence of the Higgs - Boson particle , " says Professor Virdee .
" Scientists believe the Higgs - Boson is the particle that gives the property of mass to other particles such as electrons and so on .
If we can prove that it exists and that this is the case , we will have taken a big step towards a much fuller understanding of how the universe works , and indeed , what happened in the instants immediately after it was formed . "
The CMS detector is one of four experiments sited at different locations on the 27 km ring of CERN's Large Hadron Collider .
The construction of CMS is an international effort , with different parts of the various layers of the detector being made by scientific collaborators from 37 different countries .
Constituent parts of CMS , weighing up to 2000 tonnes , are currently being lowered , by a specially - adapted shipbuilding crane , down 100 metres into the cavern where they will be re-assembled and prepared for data taking over the course of the next year .
It is anticipated that the particle accelerator will be switched on just before Christmas 2007 , at which time data will begin to be recorded .
Microsoft could be facing hefty fines by 25 January
Brussels said the software giant had failed to supply adequate information about its server programs .
Microsoft has five weeks to provide improved documentation before the daily penalties are imposed .
But the company pledged to contest the EU's " unjustified " demands by whatever means possible .
' Changing demands '
" We will contest today 's statement to the full extent permitted under EU law , including a full oral hearing on these issues , " Microsoft legal chief Brad Smith said in a statement .
I have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure Microsoft 's compliance
Neelie Kroes , EU
Check Microsoft 's shares
He added that the firm had done its utmost to comply with the EU 's demands , but Brussels kept changing the goalposts .
" We 've shipped a new version of Windows , we 've paid a historic fine , and we 've provided unprecedented access to Microsoft technology to promote interoperability with other industry players , " Mr Smith added .
" In total , we have now responded to more than 100 requests from the Commission . "
In a landmark ruling in March 2004 , the world 's biggest software firm was found guilty of abusing its position , hit with a record fine and told to open up its operating systems .
Data demand
Microsoft was also ordered " to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers " .
Microsoft says EU demands will allow competitors to copy its work
The EU 's second highest court - the Court of First Instance - later rejected an appeal by Microsoft and warned it to comply with the order by 15 December 2005 , or face a daily fine .
But following two reports from a monitoring trust that has been checking information supplied by Microsoft , the European Commission says the software giant has failed to provide all the necessary detail .
It quoted the reports as saying the technical documentation was " totally unfit at this stage for its intended purpose " .
Appeal plea
In September this year , Microsoft launched a second appeal against the March 2004 ruling - which included a 497 m euro fine - in an effort to avoid giving more information on its server programs .
The firm argues that doing so would violate intellectual property rights .
" I have given Microsoft every opportunity to comply with its obligations , " EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement as the five - week deadline was issued .
" However , I have been left with no alternative other than to proceed via the formal route to ensure Microsoft 's compliance . "
The EU also warned that if Microsoft failed to provide the necessary information by 25 January , the daily fines would be backdated to 15 December 2005 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Striking a subdued tone on the fourth anniversary of the Iraq war , President George W. Bush pleaded for patience on Monday and warned skeptical Americans of dire consequences of a swift troop withdrawal .
Bush defended his Iraq policy in the face of new polls showing Americans increasingly oppose the war and Iraqis with little or no confidence in U.S. forces seemingly unable to halt sectarian bloodshed bordering on civil war .
With his approval ratings near the low point of his presidency , Bush made a brief televised appearance at the White House , appealing for more time for his plan to send in nearly 30,000 additional troops , mostly to stabilize Baghdad .
He acknowledged , however , that “ prevailing in Iraq is not going to be easy . ”
Bush ’s cautious tone contrasted sharply with the swagger shown when he stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier weeks after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and declared major combat operations in Iraq over .
As the war entered its fifth year on Monday , insurgents carried out deadly bombings in Kirkuk and Baghdad .
“ Four years after this war began , the fight is difficult but it can be won , ” Bush said after a teleconference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
“ It will be won if we have the courage and resolve to see it through . ”
Bush said the Baghdad security plan is “ in its early stages , and success will take months , not days or weeks . ”
Bush did not repeat his earlier vow to achieve outright victory .
But he stuck to his refusal to set a timetable for a withdrawal , despite stepped - up pressure from the Democratic - led Congress .
“ It can be tempting to look at the challenges in Iraq and conclude our best option is to pack up and go home .
That may be satisfying in the short run , but I believe the consequences for American security would be devastating , ” he said .
The House of Representatives plans to debate a proposal that would tie approval of emergency war funds to a troop pullout by September 2008 .
Bush , who has threatened a veto , urged lawmakers to approve funding “ without strings . ”
‘ WAR WITHOUT END ’
“ The American people have lost confidence in President Bush ’s plan for a war without end in Iraq , ” Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
House Republican Leader John Boehner accused the Democrats of a “ slow - bleed scheme ” to choke off support to the troops .
Bush said in January he was sending 21,500 more troops to Iraq , mostly to secure Baghdad , a number that has since climbed to around 30,000 with the addition of support troops .
A CNN poll showed support for the war had fallen to 32 percent , with 63 percent opposing it .
Anti-war protests were mounted in U.S. cities over the weekend .
Some 40 protesters were arrested outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday .
Another poll showed four in five Iraqis have little or no trust in U.S. - led forces and most think their presence is making security worse .
Despite that , only about a third want them to leave now .

The poll , commissioned by the BBC , ABC News , USA Today and ARD German television , showed faith in U.S. - led forces was highest in the north , at 46 percent , and non-existent in Baghdad , where 100 percent said they had not very much or no confidence .
Overall , just 18 percent of Iraqis expressed confidence .
Americans ’ frustration over the Iraq war cost Bush ’s Republicans control of Congress in November and is the main reason his public approval ratings are stuck near 30 percent .
Bush reiterated that premature withdrawal from Iraq would endanger the United States .
“ The terrorists could emerge from the chaos with a safe haven in Iraq , ” he said .
His critics contend Iraq has distracted Washington from the war in Afghanistan , which they see as a more important fight .
The Iraq war has killed more than 3,200 U.S. military personnel and tens of thousands of Iraqis .
Bombers struck in Kirkuk , to the north , on Monday , killing at least 12 people , and near a Shi’ite mosque in Baghdad , killing four .
Nearly three months after Saddam was executed , legal sources said his former vice president , Taha Yassin Ramadan , would be hanged on Tuesday for crimes against humanity .
The US used AC - 130 gunship in raids over Somalia
In its first official comment on the air strikes , the Pentagon said a raid was carried out on Sunday but declined to say if it had hit its target .
The US has long said al - Qaeda suspects linked to the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa took refuge in Somalia .
At least 19 people were killed in US air raids , local Somali elders say .
Fresh air raids were reported near the town of Afmadow on Monday and Tuesday , but it is not clear if these were carried out by the US , or by Ethiopian forces which back the transitional Somali government .
The air strikes are taking place days after the Union of Islamic Courts , which had taken control of much of central and southern Somalia during the past six months , was routed by soldiers from Ethiopia and Somalia 's government .
Latest reports from Mogadishu say unknown assailants have fired rocket propelled grenades at a building housing Ethiopian troops and Somali government forces .
Two explosions were heard , followed by a brief but heavy exchange of automatic gunfire .
' No safe haven '
The US air strikes were carried out by an Air Force AC - 130 , a heavily armed gunship that has detection equipment and can work under the cover of darkness .

" This administration continues to go after al - Qaeda , " he said .
" We are interested in going after those who have perpetrated acts of violence against Americans , including bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . "
Somalia 's interim President , Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed , said the US had the right to bomb those who had attacked its embassies .
But Italy - the former colonial power in central and southern Somalia - condemned the US strikes .
Italian Foreign minister Massimo d'Alema said Rome opposed " unilateral initiatives that could spark new tensions " .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed " concern " that the air strikes could lead to an escalation of hostilities .

Electronics giant Sony has sparked a major row over animal cruelty and the ethics of the computer industry by using a freshly slaughtered goat to promote a violent video game .
The corpse of the decapitated animal was the centrepiece of a party to celebrate the launch of the God Of War II game for the company ’s PlayStation 2 console .
Scroll down for more
Guests at the event were even invited to reach inside the goat ’s still - warm carcass to eat offal from its stomach .
Sickening images of the party have appeared in the company ’s official PlayStation magazine – but after being contacted by The Mail on Sunday , Sony issued an apology for the gruesome stunt and promised to recall the entire print run .
Critics condemned the entertainment giant , which produces scores of Hollywood blockbusters each year , for its " blood lust " and said the grotesque " sacrifice " highlighted increasing concerns over the content of video games and the lengths to which the industry will go to exploit youngsters .
At the event , guests competed to see who could eat the most offal – procured elsewhere and intended to resemble the goat ’s intestines – from its stomach .
They also threw knives at targets and pulled live snakes from a pit with their bare hands .
Topless girls added to the louche atmosphere by dipping grapes into guests ’ mouths , while a male model portraying Kratos , the game ’s warrior hero , handed out garlands .
The International Fund for Animal Welfare said it was " outrageous " that the animal ’s death had been used " to sell a few computer games " .
A spokesman said : " We are always opposed to any senseless killing of an animal and this sounds like a gruesome death .
We condemn Sony ’s actions .
It is stupid and completely unjustified . "
The party features across two pages of the latest edition of the company ’s PlayStation magazine , which was due to hit newsstands on Tuesday but has already been sent to subscribers .
We have reproduced the spread – headlined Sony ’s Greek Orgy – here , but have pixellated the image to spare readers the sight of the goat ’s decapitated head hanging by a thread of tissue from its corpse , with blood dripping to the floor .
But the magazine ’s readers were shown the picture in its full horror .
The article , based on a Sony Press release , shows more vivid pictures from the event under headlines such as Topless Girls ! and Flesh Eating ?
It asks readers how far they would go to get hold of Sony ’s next - generation console , the PlayStation 3 .
" How about eating still warm intestines uncoiled from the carcass of a freshly slaughtered goat ?
At the party to celebrate God Of War II ’s European release , members of the Press were invited to do just that . . . "
In God Of War II , which is so violent it has been given an 18 certificate , players follow Kratos into battle against a series of fearsome characters from Greek mythology .
Sony describes it as " an adult - rated , fast - paced bloodbath – and enormous fun to boot " , adding that it is " bigger , better and as brutal as ever " .
One reviewer said the title featured " the most brutal , visceral combat of any action game " .
Former Minister Keith Vaz , Labour MP for Leicester East and a long - time campaigner against violent computer games , branded the stunt " distasteful and irresponsible " .
He said : " The slaughter of animals is not something that should be done to advertise a product .
" Sony as a global entertainment company has a social responsibility .
At this event it failed in that responsibility .
" I think people should think very carefully before bringing games like this into their homes .
" I would understand if customers wanted to boycott other Sony products such as their televisions because of this controversy . "
Sony , based in Japan and run by Welshman Sir Howard Stringer , is one of the largest media organisations in the world , boasting global revenues of £ 40 billion from electronics , video games , music , television programmes and feature films – including Spider - Man 3 and Casino Royale .
It is regarded , along with Coca - Cola , Nike and Mercedes - Benz , as one of the world ’s most valuable brands .
The company , which released the game in the UK on Friday , admitted that the stunt had been a mistake .
In a statement it said : " Sony does not condone or sanction any inappropriate behaviour by its staff or sub - contracted staff .
" It has come to our attention that at the God Of War II launch showcase , an element of the event was of an unsuitable nature .
" We are conducting an internal inquiry into aspects of the event in order to learn from the occurrence and put into place measures to ensure that this does not happen again . "
The party was held last month in Athens in homage to the game ’s Greek mythology themes .
Revellers partied against the floodlit backdrop of the Parthenon .
The Sony spokesman said the animal had not been slaughtered for the event but had been bought from a local butcher by the Greek company hired to stage the event .
What purported to be warm intestines was actually warm offal .
He said Sony ’s UK office had been shocked to see the report in the official PlayStation magazine , which the company licenses to publishing house Future .
Sony is this weekend recalling the entire 80,000 print run of the magazine .
The offending article will be removed because of the " sensitivity of the general public over issues of animal welfare " .
The firm refused to say how the goat died .
It is unusual for animals in modern Greece to be killed by having their throats cut , let alone by being decapitated .
It is not the first time Sony has been involved in controversy over its games .
In 2004 , the PlayStation 2 game Manhunt was banned by High Street stores in the UK after it was linked to the murder of a 14 - year - old Leicester boy .
Last September the relatives of a family massacred by a New Mexico teenager addicted to Grand Theft Auto : Vice City launched a £ 317 million lawsuit against the entertainment company .
And in November , Europe ’s justice commissioner Franco Frattini was so shocked by the " obscene cruelty and brutality " of Sony ’s Rule Of Rose PlayStation game that he wrote to all EU governments urging tighter controls on the " dreadful game " .
Canadian coastguards were last night battling to rescue hundreds of seal hunters trapped in thick ice off the country 's Newfoundland east coast .
Some 100 sealing vessels became stuck in drifting pack ice on Wednesday and the crews of at least four boats have already been flown to safety .
An ice - breaking coastguard ship sent to the area has also become stuck in the worst ice conditions seen in the region for 15 years , Canadian officials said .
Another five rescue boats are smashing their way through ice more than a metre thick to reach the stricken vessels .
But not all of the sealers are expected to be freed before the weekend .
Three coastguard helicopters are dropping food and supplies , and are on standby to evacuate more hunters if conditions worsen .
About 15 vessels are in danger of ice piercing their hulls .
The Newfoundland phase of Canada 's controversial seal hunt is the third and largest , in which 270,000 animals are killed for pelts and blubber .
Brian Penney , a superintendent with the coastguard in Newfoundland and Labrador , said : " There are vessels disabled , there are vessels damaged .
There are crews that are out on the ice because there 's quite a possibility that their vessels may sink or the vessels are out on their sides . "
The coastguard is trying to get supplies to those vessels that are in the most dire straits , he said .
" Supplies are starting to run very low , in addition to fuel , " he added .
Many sealer crews are reluctant to abandon their vessels .
In some cases boats could be crushed by the thick ice and their hulls cracked open .
Reduced ice conditions further to the south meant this year 's total seal quota had been cut back from the 335,000 hunted last year .
The seals use the normally widespread ice floes in the Gulf of St Lawrence and in the Atlantic Ocean to give birth to their young .
" Conditions have deteriorated over the last few days as a result of the wind pressing the ice floes into the land , " a Canadian coastguard , Windross Banton , told CBC television from an icebreaker .
" There 's quite a few different pockets of vessels all about the area ... unfortunately the weather conditions forecast right up until the end of this week are probably going to cause conditions to even deteriorate more so than they are now . "
The hunters earn about £ 39 for each seal pelt - most of them destined for the fashion industry in Norway , Russia and China .
But seal blubber is also sold to produce oil .
The hunt has been condemned as cruel and unnecessary by campaigners and high - profile figures including Paul McCartney .
The United States has banned Canadian seal products since 1972 and the European Union banned the white pelts of baby seals in 1983 .
Canada 's Fisheries and Oceans Department said about two - thirds of this year 's quota had already been filled .
Fikk et brev i posten denne helgen , fra advokatene til Bedriftsguiden .
no – eller skal jeg heller si , fra Gunnar Andreassen – ettersom Bedriftsguiden .
no er et enkeltmannsforetak registrert på ham .
I brevet som omhandler følgende artikkel om Bedriftsguiden .
no ( så langt jeg har kunnet forstå , ettersom det ikke refereres til noen bestemt artikkel i brevet ) påstår Gunnars advokat at jeg driver konkurrerende virksomhet og at min omtale om Bedriftsguiden .
no dermed kommer inn under markedsføringslovens § 1 , og spesielt denne delen : « I næringsvirksomhet må det ikke foretas handling som strider mot god forretningsskikk næringsdrivende imellom , eller er urimelig i forhold til forbrukere eller som for øvrig strider mot god markedsføringsskikk » .
Det kommer også frem trusler om erstatning .
Jeg siterer
Vi henstiller herved om at opptredenen i strid med god forretningsskikk næringsdrivende imellom opphører umiddelbart gjennom at De uten ubegrunnet opphold fjerner Deres negative omtale fra internett .
Vi forbeholder oss retten til å kreve erstatning for det økonomiske tap Bedriftsguiden .
no har lidt som følge av Deres handlinger .
Vi gjør i den forbindelse oppmerksom på at erstatningskravets størrelse vil avhenge av hvor lenge Deres brudd på markedsføringsloven § 1 vedvarer .
Jeg må innrømme at jeg har begynt å bli så vant til slike brev nå at det er såvidt pulsen min stiger når jeg mottar dem , og jeg lurte et øyeblikk på om jeg skulle skrive noe om det i det hele tatt .
Men jeg klarer ikke å holde kjeft om enda et forsøk på å kneble de som ønsker å sette søkelys på en relativt useriøs katalogbransje – og jeg NEKTER å la advokatbrev og sure nettkataloger stoppe meg fra å skrive hva jeg mener om dem .
For dem som ikke kjenner meg og det jeg holder på med : Jeg driver IKKE konkurrerende virksomhet til Bedriftsguiden .
no – og jeg har aldri hatt interesser i noe katalogselskap , men har sett dem fra innsiden når jeg jobbet for et par av dem for ca. 10 år siden .
Jeg jobber ikke for noe katalogselskap i dag og kommer neppe til å gjøre det i fremtiden .
I det utvidede innlegget har jeg postet mitt tilsvar til Bedriftsguiden .

Personal blogger Mrs. Ronk posted about trying to keep her house clean :
“ I ’ve just been frustrated ( once again ) by the fact that my house does n’t stay clean longer than five minutes .
I do n’t have a system set up , and I also have bad habits such as putting my clothes in a pile by the side of my bed at night instead of hanging them up or putting them in the laundry hamper .
I ’m tired of it .
The clutter gets to me and I feel unsettled .
And I feel like I ca n’t start a new project or do anything fun until I get the house in order .
But my house is never fully in order , so I never really get any projects done . ”
I totally understand where she ’s coming from .
A messy house can be overwhelming , and the habits required not only to get it cleaned but to keep it that way can seem like too much to tackle .
But here ’s the key : I ’ve found that it ’s best to use small steps in getting where you want to go .
Try these habits for at least two weeks each before going onto the next :
hang your clothes up or put them in hamper immediately
put all papers ( including school papers , post - in notes , bills , etc ) in one in basket , and process at the end of each day ( use the steps in Clearing Your Desk )
keep you sink clean and shiny ( wash dishes immediately , clean sink after )
pick up before you go to bed and before you leave the house
empty your trash daily
15 minutes decluttering sessions each day ( see How to Declutter )
clean your shower , toilet and bathroom sink after each use ( only takes a couple minutes ! )
have a place for everything , and put everything in its place immediately
make your bed each morning
keep flat surfaces ( counters , tables , desks ) clear of clutter
put away your stuff as soon as you get home
Now , these are a lot of habits , and it might seem overwhelming , but if you tackle one at a time ( in whatever order you like ) , it wo n’t be that hard .
Give yourself several months to get there – do n’t expect overnight change !
Here ’s how to tackle each habit :
Write down your goal .
Post it up somewhere visible .
Keep a log and make sure you write in it each day , noting whether you were successful or not for that day .
Post your daily results on your blog or on an online forum , or email to family and friends .
Reward yourself for each day of success .
Give yourself electric shocks if you fail that day ( just kidding ! ) .
Actually , if you fail that day , take a minute to see what went wrong , and how to correct it .
Now forgive yourself for failing , and tell yourself that you will do better starting now !
Find a way to keep yourself focused on this goal for at least 2 - 3 weeks .
Celebrate when you ’re done .
If you can conquer that habit ( and it may take a month or more ) , then move on to the next .
Do not try to do them all at once !
Take baby steps , and you ’ll get there .
Who would have thought the inner workings of a white blood cell could be visually stunning ?
For those who fell asleep during high school biology classes , David Bolinsky 's presentation at the TED conference was a revelation .
Bolinsky , former lead medical illustrator at Yale , screened a three - minute version of a computer - generated film , The Inner Life of the Cell , that he and colleagues at his company Xvivo created for Harvard 's Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology .
The film animation , also shown at Siggraph last summer , has caused quite a stir , leading museums , universities and even Hollywood 's Wachowski brothers to come calling .
Xvivo recently created all the animation in a one - hour pilot for the new PBS science show 22nd Century and parts of the company 's cell film may be used in a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers .
Bolinsky , who was two years into a medical degree when he launched his first illustration company in 1983 , has long wanted to use computers to animate science but says the technology only recently caught up with his vision .
He spoke with Wired News about the discovery process .
Wired News : Warner Bros. contacted you , right ?
David Bolinsky : A couple of days before TED we got a call from Warner Bros .
Pictures .
Apparently the Wachowski brothers , the guys who did The Matrix , are doing a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and they had come across our animation and they wanted to know if we'd be interested in re-rendering it at film resolution so it could be included in some way as ( part ) of the special effects they 're planning for the movie .
So right now their lawyers are talking with the Harvard lawyers about the possibility of this .
( Press reports say the Wachowski brothers , though not directors of the film , have been brought in to re-work the film 's ending . )
WN : So this entire 8.5 - minute film depicts what 's going on inside one white blood cell ?
Bolinsky : Yes .
We needed to have a starting point .
Something small enough so we could actually accomplish it and show it around and get feedback from the academic community – so we could see if it was a worthwhile direction and use it as a teaser to get funding so we could really do a proper job on this subject .
So we decided on a cellular - motility theme and what happens to a white blood cell patrolling the capillary when there 's an inflammation outside the capillary .
WN : How did Inner Life of the Cell come about ?
Bolinsky : ( We ) wanted to make something that would give people a strong sense of a cell – not as a list of topics to be studied , not as a compendium of tables and graphs and charts , ( but ) as a bustling , immensely purposeful metropolis populated very , very densely by these micro machines that do a huge amount of work at great speed and great precision and purposefulness .
WN : How did people outside Harvard learn about it ?
Bolinsky :
We unleashed it on the world for the first time by entering it ... in Siggraph's ( contest for ) the best animations of the year .
Special effects from Pixar and Sony pictures and all the large Hollywood companies that make fancy commercials are entered .
WN : What was the reaction to it there ?
Bolinsky :
We started receiving tens of thousands of e-mails and phone calls , the hits on our website went from 200 a week to 650,000 a week and it was picked up by ABC News .
We were getting e-mails from major universities all over the world asking if they could use this for their students ( and ) calls from high school teachers wanting it for advanced biology classes ... and museums that want us to work on museum exhibits because they want to modernize how they teach science .
This is what I hoped when I started this company – that it could change how people saw things .
We ( thought ) this great academic animation would be shown at Harvard and would disappear forever under the Ivy dome of silence ....
We did n't really anticipate that it would go anywhere and when it did it took us all by surprise .
WN : How long did it take to produce the Inner Life of the Cell ?
Bolinsky : It 's an 8.5 - minute piece and that took us 14 months .
Nobody at the outset knew how complicated we needed to make each scene to make it really work .
We had to figure out how to take a cell that is so packed with molecules and to edit out visually about 90 to 95 percent of those molecules and still keep in all the kinds of structure that would indicate to the student what 's going on .
WN : How did you get started using computers in your animation ?
Bolinsky : After I started my own company ( in 1983 ) , I found out what was available and ended up buying an 8 - bit computer .
You could get only 256 colors on screen – not the millions you get now .
And it was really slow and really expensive and I had to mortgage my house .
My fiancé at the time , who is now my wife , was totally freaked out .
But I knew what I wanted to do and knew that I only had one way to do it .
So I started to do animation and figured out how to do programming and write scripts ....
Then about a year after I started I heard about a new company called Wavefront Technologies – a bunch of hippie surfers in Santa Barbara .
With Wavefront I was able to do 3 - D animation .
I had to learn Unix .
There was no GUI so if I needed to change a color I had to go into a special text editor and edit all the colors numerically with text , and then save that and get back into the program and render to see if the color was right , and back and forth .
The frames took an hour apiece to render .
It was a chore .
I put about 100 hours a week for a decade into that to figure out how to make it work .
WN : Are you still writing any of your software ?
Bolinsky : Some of it we write but we use two off - the - shelf film packages – Lightwave and XSI .
They both do modeling and motion .
We also have internal software writing so when we need it to do something that it does n't do we just write it .
WN : What got you interested in medical animation ?
Bolinsky :
When I was four years old some friends of my family took me to see Fantasia and I was totally blown away .
From that minute on I wanted to be an animator .
My father ( a sculptor and art historian who taught at New York University ) taught me how to animate using serial drawings in a flipbook .
Then when 8 - mm movie cameras came around you could do a single shot ( with them ) .
I learned how to do stop - frame animation and I experimented with that a lot and pretty much that was my mode of animating through high school .
I had always really loved sciences as well ....
And I was fortunate enough when I was in junior high school that my pediatrician introduced me to Frank Netter 's artwork .
I guess you could call him the father of modern medical illustration .
He had an MD but he was also a painter ....
Anyone having to do with medicine will have looked at Frank Netter 's art work ....
I decided I would make him my model ... getting my degree in medical illustration and then going on to medical school .
The shrimp did what to the cabbage ?
Welcome , BoingBoing readers .
A few Language Log posts have been linked in a recent BoingBoing discussion about the mysterious appearance of the word fuck in Chinese menus seeking a translation - equivalent for GAN ' dry ' ( 干 ) .
The issue first came up here in " Engrish Explained , " and then again in two guest posts by Victor Mair , " A Less Grand Chinglish " and " GAN : Whodunnit , and how , and why ? "
The Language Log links were provided by a reader responding to a Flickr photo showing a sign at a buffet reading , " The shrimp fucks the cabbage . "
Once again , the polysemy of GAN ( translatable as either ' to dry ' or ' to do , ' with the latter sense used as a colloquialism for ' to fuck ' ) leads to a very unfortunate English rendering .
( A proper translation would be " stir - fried dried shrimp with bok choy . " )
Based on an update to Victor Mair 's second post , Xeni Jardin of BoingBoing speculates that " a possible source for all these misplaced F - words on Chinese menus " is " a bug in a popular translation software app , perhaps intentionally placed by a mischievous person . "
The more likely story , as given by a Sinologist going by the handle " xiaolongnu " in this guest post , is the reliance in China on dictionaries claiming to provide " real idiomatic American English . "
The more slipshod of these dictionaries may give fuck — a true - blue American idiom — as the only translation - equivalent for GAN .
( An earlier BoingBoing entry links to a 2002 article from the London Telegraph reporting that authorities in Beijing were cracking down on incomprehensible Chinglish signage , with the objective of achieving " linguistic perfection " in time for the 2008 Olympic Games .
I wonder how that campaign is going ! )

What are the different areas of Grand Canyon ?
North Rim
The North Rim has lodging , restaurants and shops that are open May 15 through October 15 each year .
A worthwhile trip for those who enjoy the road less traveled , the North Rim , or " other side " of the Grand Canyon is visited by only 10 % of all Grand Canyon visitors .
The North Rim is over 8000 feet / 2438 m. in elevation .
There is one lodge , the Grand Canyon Lodge and one campground operated by the NPS .
The hike across the canyon from South Rim to North Rim is 21 miles ( 34 km ) .
However , driving from the South Rim to the North Rim by automobile requires a five - hour drive of 220 miles ( 354 km ) .
South Rim
Most people visit Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim .
The South Rim is located 60 miles north of Williams , Arizona ( via route 64 from Interstate 40 ) and 80 miles northwest of Flagstaff ( via route 180 ) .
The South Rim of Grand Canyon averages 7000 feet / 2134 m above sea level .
This area includes Grand Canyon Village with a campground , an RV park with full hook - ups , several lodges , restaurants , a grocery store , visitor centers , museums , gift shops , backcountry information center , and shuttle system .
Tusayan , the gateway community to the south entrance also has many services , including lodging , food and more .
The South Rim is open 24 hours a day , 365 days a year .
All visitor services ( camping , lodging , and food ) are available year round .
The least crowded time is November through February .
However , winter weather is a major consideration when planning a trip during these months .
Desert View
Desert View is a small settlement on the South Rim located 25 miles / 41 km east of Grand Canyon Village , and near the eastern edge of Grand Canyon .
Arizona Highway 64 , also known as Desert View Drive , is a scenic road that connects Desert view with Grand Canyon Village .
For visitors coming into the park via the East Entrance , a stop at Desert View provides the first views of Grand Canyon .
Attractions include views of the Colorado River and canyon geology , the historic Watchtower designed by Mary Colter , the nearby Tusayan Museum highlighting the story of American Indians of the region .
Facilities include visitor contact station and bookstore in the watchtower , restrooms , seasonal campground ( mid - April through mid-October ) , service station , gift shops , and general store .
Lodging is not available at Desert View .
Remote Tuweep
A remote and primitive area , known as Tuweep , is located on the northwest rim of Grand Canyon on the Arizona Strip .
A visit to this area can be challenging , but rewarding .
Since the National Park Service manages the area for its primitive values , services are non-existent : there is no water , gas , food , lodging , or phone service at Tuweep .
Havasupai Indian Reservation
Spectacular waterfalls and an isolated community within the Havasupai Indian Reservation attract thousands of visitors each year .
The area is not accessible by road .
The Havasupai Tribe administers the land , which lies outside the boundary and jurisdiction of Grand Canyon National Park .
Grand Canyon West and Skywalk
Grand Canyon
West is run by the Hualapai Tribe and is at the far western end of Grand Canyon - about 250 miles ( 400 km ) by road , a five hour drive , from the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park .
A variety of visitor services are offered , including the Skywalk .
Food service is limited , usually as part of a package tour .

Carl Zimmer has written a fascinating piece on a study that simulated the evolution of communication in artificially intelligent robots .
The robots were small and mobile , were controlled by artificial neural networks , and could send and receive signals via infrared .
A group of robots was put into an arena with a light - emitting ‘ food source ’ and a ‘ poison source ’ .
The robots could only tell the difference when they got close enough to see coloured paper that the ‘ sources ’ were resting on .
Robots gained a point when they found the ‘ food ’ and lost a point when they stumbled across the ‘ poison ’ .
Crucially , the researchers could electronically ‘ breed ’ the robots to improve their neural networks , so they could compare how the offspring of different combinations of best and worst performing robots would behave .
Zimmer notes some of the interesting results :
Here , however , is where the experiment got really intriguing .
Each robot wears a kind of belt that can glow , casting a blue light .
The scientists now plugged the blue light into the robot circuitry .
Its neural network could switch the light on and off , and it could detect blue light from other robots and change course accordingly .
The scientists started the experiments all over again , with randomly wired robots that were either related or unrelated , and experienced selection as individuals or as colonies .
At first the robots just flashed their lights at random .
But over time things changed .
In the trials with relatives undergoing colony selection , twelve out of the twenty lines began to turn on the blue light when they reached the food .
The light attracted the other robots , bringing them quickly to the food .
The other eight lines evolved the opposite strategy .
They turned blue when they hit the poison , and the other robots responded to the light by heading away .
Two separate communication systems had evolved , each benefiting the entire colony .
The researchers have made some Quicktime video available if you want to see this in action and the scientific paper is available as a pdf file .
The research was led by Prof Laurent Keller , a biologist who specialises in understanding the evolution of communication networks .
There ’s much more about this fascinating experiment and the other surprising types of behaviour that emerged from it over in Zimmer ’s article .

Ron Paul : More Guns Will Deter Shootings
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) has a simple solution to future shooting massacres such as the one that ripped apart Virginia Tech university Monday : more guns .
Advertisement
" People are a little more cautious if somebody might have a gun there , " the GOP presidential candidate told Politico reporters Tuesday .
" A concealed gun carried by a responsible person -- that might have ended the problem that they had at Virginia Tech with one person being killed or two people being killed . "
Paul , 71 , is the kind of lawmaker , and presidential candidate , gun control advocates love to hate at moments like this .
And , based on public opinion polls and reader feedback at Politico.com , he 's far from alone .
Echoing the views of many Americans , he sees calls for restriction on guns as an affront to freedom .
The libertarian - minded Texan is one of the most outspoken defenders of gun rights in Congress .
Since the obstetrician was first elected to Congress in 1976 , he has never voted for a bill restricting gun ownership .
And he said the tragedy in Blacksburg , Va. , could have been prevented if the school allowed students and professors to carry concealed weapons on campus .
Paul , who ran for the Libertarian presidential nomination in 1988 , is well known on Capitol Hill for his outspoken , maverick positions .
He opposed authorizing federal funding to victims of Hurricane Katrina .
He wants to abolish the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of Education .
He has called for a return to the gold standard .
He argues that tighter gun control laws would have no impact on gun crime .
" It 's the lack of access to law - abiding citizens to have guns in many places that increases our crime rate , " he said .
" We just can't prevent every tragedy of a maniac .
So to pretend this happened because of lack of laws would be the wrong thing to assume . "
Politico.com is co-host of the Republican presidential debate on May 3rd , and candidates will be answering our readers ’ favorite questions .

Despite his pro-gun rhetoric , Paul also often finds himself voting with Democrats , particularly in the area of civil liberties .
He was one of only three Republican lawmakers to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001 .
He expressed concern that the Virginia Tech shootings would be exploited to crack down on civil liberties .
" I know there will be a call for , ' Boy , we 've got to take hold of every single gun and register the gun . '
It 's sort of like after 9/11 , we had to worry about terrorists , but what we 've done is register every American , " he said .
" With national ID cards , inspection and loss of our liberties , warrantless searches , we 've attacked law - abiding citizens .
So , no , I do n't think we need more gun control for law - abiding citizens . "
Paul suggested that the Sept. 11 attacks could have been avoided if the pilots on the hijacked airliners had been armed .
" If terrorists knew that every pilot had a gun in the cockpit , they would n't have done it , " he said .
" They would have all been shot and would n't have accomplished their mission . "
Who would have thought that such a small article on a Matrix Optimization and its impact on execution time would generate that many comments in such a short time , thanks for all of them !
The original point I was trying to make in that article was to always check , if an optimization actually improves matters before you employ it .
But I guess most of you found the question about why it was going wrong more interesting to discuss .
And since I do n’t want to disappoint my readers ( thats you : P ) , I decided to put some of your suggestions to the test and see what actually caused the slowdown on the Intel Compiler .
The first thing that came to my mind when I saw the code was the additional branch and how it may be causing problems .
As many readers have suggested , one can avoid it like this :
for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++ ) { A [ i ] [ 0 ] = 2 * i + 1 ; for ( j = 1 ; j < N ; j++ ) { A[ i ] [j ] = A[ i ] [j - 1 ] + 3 ; } } [ / c ]
Who would have thought , this gives a small but noticeable improvement .
But the program is still about 20 times slower than the original one on the Intel compiler ( all these numbers are just rough measurements , of course ) .
So let 's see if by using a temporary variable we can improve performance : [ c ] for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++ ) { for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; j++ ) { if ( j == 0 ) { temp = 2 * i + 1 ; A [ i ] [j ] = temp ; } else { temp += 3 ; A[ i ] [j ] = temp ; } } } [ / c ]
The if - branch is still left in there to stick to one change per program .
This program is about as fast as the original one .
Wow .
Who would have thought that todays compilers still have issues with register allocation .
If my students had presented me with this program first , I would also have had issues with it , because they had obfuscated a perfectly fine loop - nest for an optimization that I thought every compiler did today .
I guess I was wrong .
P.S. : I am looking for a solution to the code disappearing in comments - problem that bit many of you , but have not found anything yet .
If you have an idea how to solve this and allow people to post code ( including

Life may be the ultimate in planetary stress relief , a new theory claims .
What do lightning and life have in common ?
Getty
The appearance of life on Earth seems to face so many obstacles — sourcing the right ingredients , for example , and arranging them into living things ( while being bombarded by meteorites ) — that scientists often feel forced to regard it as almost miraculous .
Now two US researchers suggest that , on the contrary , it may have been inevitable .
They argue that life was the necessary consequence of available energy built up by geological processes on the early Earth .
Life sprang from this environment , they say , in the same way that lightning relieves the accumulation of electrical charge in thunderclouds .
In other words , say biologist Harold Morowitz of George Mason University in Fairfax , Virginia , and physicist Eric Smith of New Mexico 's Santa Fe Institute , the geological environment " forced life into existence " .
This view implies not only that life had to emerge on the Earth , but that the same would happen on any similar planet .
Smith and Morowitz hope ultimately to predict the first steps in the origin of life based on the laws of physics and chemistry alone .
Inspiring life
Morowitz and Smith admit that they do n't yet have the theoretical tools to clinch their arguments , or to show what form this " inevitable life " must take .
But , they argue , it probably used the same chemical processes that now drive our own metabolism — but in reverse .
“ Life would emerge on any sunny , wet rocky planet . ” Michael Russell , California Institute of Technology .
One source of geological energy would have been compounds called polyphosphates , made in volcanic processes .
These are ' battery molecules ' , similar to those that now supply living cells with energy .
Another source would have been hydrogen molecules , which were probably abundant in the early atmosphere , even though they are almost absent today .
Hydrogen would have been generated , for example , by reactions between seawater and dissolved iron .
Energy - releasing reactions between hydrogen and carbon dioxide , belched into the atmosphere by volcanoes , can produce complex organic molecules , the precursors of living systems .
In our metabolism , a series of biochemical reactions called the citric - acid cycle breaks down organic compounds from food into carbon dioxide .
Horowitz and Smith say that the energy reservoirs of the young Earth could have driven a citric - acid cycle in reverse , spawning the building blocks of life while relaxing the ' energy pressure ' of the environment .
Eventually these processes will have become encapsulated into cells , making the energy flows more efficient .
Morowitz and Smith present their ideas in a Santa Fe working paper1 .
The right chemistry
The idea is " instructive and inspiring " , says Michael Russell , a specialist in the origin of life at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
Life , he agrees , is " a chemical system that drains and dissipates chemical energy " .
Russell has used similar ideas to argue that " life would emerge using the same pathways on any sunny , wet rocky planet " 2,3 .
The most likely place for it to occur , he believes , is at miniature undersea volcanoes called hydrothermal vents , where the ingredients and conditions are just right for energy - harnessing chemical machinery to develop4 .
The biochemical processes of living organisms are highly organized .
Scientists have long puzzled over how such systems can come spontaneously into being , when the second law of thermodynamics says that the universe as a whole generates increasing disorder .

The answer , broadly speaking , is that local clumps of order come at the expense of increasing the disorder around them .
Horowitz and Smith think that such order happens because it is a better ' lightning conductor ' for discharging excess energy .
Thus , they say , despite several major extinctions throughout geological time , each of which almost obliterated every living thing , life itself was never in danger of disappearing — because an Earth with life is always more stable than one without .
The researchers call this process a " collapse to life " , which in their view is as inevitable as the appearance of snowflakes in cold , moist air .

You may lack confidence because you 're convinced that everyone else has it better than you do .
However , at the end of the day , it only matters if you 're happy by your own standards .
If you have no idea what those are , then it 's time to do some soul searching before you move forward .
Additionally , studies have found that spending time on social media often encourages people to compare themselves with others .
Because people tend to post only their triumphs and not their realities of daily life , it can seem as though the lives of others are more wonderful than your own . [ 14 ]
This is likely not true !
Everyone has ups and downs in their lives .
If you want to build your self - confidence , then you have to focus on improving your own life for the better , not on making your life more like your best friend 's , your older brother 's , or like those of the celebrities you see on television .
If you want to build up your confidence , then you need to know that there will always be someone who is prettier , smarter , and richer than you , just like there will always be someone who is less attractive , less intelligent , and less wealthy than you are ; all of this is irrelevant , and what is relevant is caring about advancing your own goals and dreams .
Writing Tips for Non-Writers
Who Do n’t Want to Work at Writing
A writing question :
What writing tips would you whisper to those who are n’t aspiring professionals , but would like to write better ?
If I asked you about losing weight and you said “ Diet and Exercise ” you ’d be a ) correct and b ) ignored .
So no ideas that take work .
We want the quick fix !
Tips like “ Edit your work ” are n’t useful .
“ Gerunds are your friend ” are .
So , the task here :
Tell y’all how to write better without you actually having to make an effort .
Fine .
Here ’s how I would do it .
( NB : These work pretty well for people who do want to be pro writers , too . )
0 . Speak what you write :
This is rule zero because all other rules follow on this .
Basically :
If what you ’re writing is hard to speak , what makes you think it ’s going to be easy to read ?
It wo n’t be .
So speak out loud what you write .
If you ca n’t speak it naturally , rewrite it .
Simple .
1. Punctuate , damn you :
For God ’s sake , is it really so hard to know where to put a comma ?
When people read , even in their brains , there ’s usually some part of them that is sounding out the words .
Without appropriate punctuation , especially commas , that word - speaking part will eventually choke on the sentence .
Having said that , there ’s a tendency to over - punctuate as well , particularly with exclamation points .
Too little punctuation makes it seem you want to collapse someone ’s lung , too much makes it look like you ’re a 14 - year - old girl writing an IM .
You want to avoid both .
Here ’s a quick and dirty guide when to use punctuation :
Periods :
When you ’re writing down a thought and you ’re at the end of that thought , put a period .
Commas :
When you ’re writing down a thought and you want to take a breath , whether mental or physical , put in a comma .
Semi-colon :
Put these in your writing in the place where , in conversation , you ’d arch your eyebrow or make some other sort of physical gesture signalling that you want to emphasize a point .
Colon :
Use when you want to make an example of something :
For example , just like this .
Question Mark : Quite obviously , when you have a question .
Exclamation point :
When you ’re really excited about something .
You almost never need to use more than one in a paragraph .
Use more than one in a sentence and you damn well better be using it for humorous and / or ironic effect .
Dashes :
You can use these when you ’ve already used a colon or a semi-colon in a sentence , but be aware that if you have more than one colon or semi-colon in a sentence , you ’re probably doing something wrong .
Somewhat related :
Use capitals when you should ( beginning of sentences , proper nouns ) , do n’t use them when you should n’t ( pretty much every other time ) .
Lots of people think not using capitals makes them look arty and cool , but generally it just makes the rest of us wonder if you ’ve not yet figured out the magical invention known as the shift key .
Alternately , the random appearance of capitals in inappropriate places makes us wonder if you do n’t secretly wish the Germans won World War II ( and even the Germans are cracking down on wanton capitalization these days , so there you are ) .
2 . With sentences , shorter is better than longer :
If a sentence you ’re writing is longer than it would be comfortable to speak , it ’s probably too long .
Cut it up .
This is one I ’m guilty of ignoring ; I tend to use semi-colons when I should be using periods .
In fact , I ’d say the largest single editing task I have after writing a piece is to go in and turn semi-coloned sentences into two sentences ( or more , God forgive me ) .
Shorter is also better with paragraphs , but there ’s such a thing as too short :
Take a look at a not - particularly - well - edited newspaper and you ’ll see a lot of single - sentence paragraphs , generally preceded or followed by other single - sentence paragraphs that should have been compressed into one paragraph .
Good rule :
One extended idea or discrete event per paragraph .
3. Learn to friggin’ spell : I ’m not talking typos here , because everyone makes them , and I make more than most .
I mean genuine “ gosh I really do n’t know how this is spelled ” mistakes .
This is particularly the case with basic spelling errors like using “ your ” when you ’re supposed to be using “ you ’re ” or “ its ” for “ it ’s ” ( or in both cases , vice - versa ) .
Here ’s a good rule of thumb :
For every spelling error you make , your apparent IQ drops by 5 points .
For every “ there , they ’re , their ” type of mistake you make , your apparent IQ drops by 10 points .
Sorry about that , but there it is .
What ’s truly appalling is that even people with advanced degrees ( I ’m looking at you , scientists ) screw these particular pooches .
I look at some of the writing I see from people with MAs and PhDs after their names and I think no wonder China ’s poised to kick our ass .
Look , spelling is n’t hard .
Nearly every single computerized writing tool has a built - in spellcheck that will catch 90 % of your spelling errors , and as for the rest of them , well , it is n’t too much to ask adults to know the difference between “ their ” and “ there . ”
It ’s really not .
Also , here ’s a handy tip for those of you with Internet access ( which , by definition , would be all of you reading this on my site ) .
If you have a word , the spelling of which you ’re not sure , and you do n’t have a dictionary handy ( either bound or online ) , copy the word , paste it into Google ’s search engine , and hit “ search . ”
If you ’ve spelled it incorrectly , chances are really excellent that when your search results come up , up at the top Google will ask “ Did you mean : ” and present whatever word it is that you ’re failing to spell .
There ’s no shame in doing this .
Bottom line : Typos aside , there ’s no reason not to spell things correctly ( and you really should get on those typos , too , although I note that I ’m the last person in the world to ride folks on that one ) .

4 . Do n’t use words you do n’t really know :
It ’s nice to use impressive words from time to time , but if you use an impressive word incorrectly , everyone who does know what the word means will think of you as a pathetic , insecure dork .
I ’m just saying .
Bear in mind that this is not limited only to “ impressive ” Latinate words , but also ( indeed especially ) to slang .
Use slang incorrectly — or even use last year ’s word — and you ’ll look like teh 1am3r .
Unless you ’re using the slang ironically , in which case you might be able to get away with it .
But generally : stick to words you know you know , or make real good friends with that there dictionary thingie .
5. Grammar matters , but not as much as anal grammar Nazis think it does :
The problem with grammar is that here in the US at least , schools do such a horrible job of teaching the subject that most people are entirely out to sea regarding correct usage .
It ’s the calculus of liberal arts subjects .
But grammar need not be stupendously complicated ; in the final reduction the point of grammar is to make the language as clear to as many people as possible .
Frankly , I think if most non-writers can manage to get agreement between their verb and their subject , I ’m willing to spot them the whole “ who / whom ” conundrum .
Now , obviously , you should know as much grammar as you can ; the more grammar you know , the better you can write .
But the bottom line is just this :
Be as clear as possible .
If you ’re not confident about the grammar of a sentence , re-write it and strive for clarity .
Yes , it ’s possible that in doing so the resulting sentence will lack style or something .
But it ’s better to be plain and understood than to have people admire your style and have not the slightest idea what you ’re trying to say .
6. Front - load your point :
If you make people wade through seven paragraphs of unrelated anecdotes before you get to what you ’re really trying to say , you ’ve lost .
Yes , Mark Twain and Garrison Keillor pull that stunt all the time .
But : Surprise !
You ’re not them .
Also , there were lots of times when Twain just needed to get to the goddamn point , already .
Now , sometimes people write to find out what their point is ; I think that ’s fine because I do that myself .
But most of the time after I ’ve figured out my point , I ’ll go back and re-write .
Because that ’s the magic of writing :
You can do that .
It ’s not actually a live medium .
No , not even in IM , since you can still re-write before you hit “ send . ”
This point is more flexible than some of the others ; sometimes you want to go the long way around to make your point because doing so makes the point stronger .
I took the long way around in my “ Being Poor ” essay , for example .
However , most of the time it ’s better to let people know what you ’re doing than not , if only because then you have a better chance of them sticking around until the end .
7 . Try to write well every single time you write : I have friends who I know can write well who send me the most awful e-mail and IMs because they figure it does n’t matter how many rules of grammar and spelling they stomp on because it ’s just e-mail and IM .
But if you actually want to be a better writer , you have to be a better writer every time you write .
It wo n’t kill you to write a complete sentence in IM or e-mail , you know .
The more you do it , the better you ’ll get at it until it will actually be more difficult to write poorly in e-mail and IM than not ( mobile text messaging I understand has more limitations .
But I tend to look at text messaging as the 21st Century equivalent of semaphore , which is to say , specialized communication for specialized goals ) .
There really is no excuse for writing poorly in one ’s blog .
At least with IMs and e-mail your terrifying disembowelment of the language is limited to one observer .
But in your blog , you ’ll look stupid for the whole world to see , and it will be archived for as long as humanity remembers how to produce electricity .
Maybe you do n’t think anyone who reads your blog will care .
But I read your blog — yes indeed I do — and I care .
Madly .
Truly .
Deeply .
8. Read people who write well :
Do n’t just read for entertainment , but also look to see how they do their writing — how they craft sentences , use punctuation , break their prose into paragraphs , and so on .
Doing so takes no more time than reading what they write anyway , and that ’s something you ’re doing already .
If you can see what they ’re doing , you can try to do it too .
You probably wo n’t be able to re-create their style , since that ’s something about that particular person .
But what you can do is recreate their mechanics .
Do n’t worry that your own “ voice ” will get lost .
Be readable first and your own style will come later , when you ’re comfortable with the nuts and bolts of writing .
9 . When in doubt , simplify : Worried you ’re not using the right words ?
Use simpler words .
Worried that your sentence is n’t clear ?
Make a simpler sentence .
Worried that people wo n’t see your point ?
Make your point simpler .
Nearly every writing problem you have can be solved by making things simpler .
This should be obvious , but people do n’t like hearing it because there ’s the assumption that simple = stupid .
But it ’s not true ; indeed , I find from personal experience that the stupidest writers are the ones whose writing is positively baroque in form .
All that compensating , you know .
Besides , I ’m not telling you to boil everything down to “ see spot run ” simplicity .
I am telling you to make it so people can get what you ’re trying to say .
Ultimately , people write to be understood ( excepting Gertrude Stein and Tristan Tzara , who were intentionally being difficult ) .
Most people are , in fact , capable of understanding .
Therefore , if you ca n’t make people understand what you write , most of the time it ’s not just because the world is filled with morons , it ’s also because you are not being clear .
Downshift .
People will be happy to know what you ’re saying .
10 . Speak what you write :
Yes , I ’ve covered this before .
But now after all the other tips you can see why this makes sense .
If you ca n’t make your writing understandable to you , you ca n’t make it understandable to others .
And now I ’m off to speak this to myself .
If I can do it with my writing , you can do it with yours .
An image based programming language like Factor stores executable code in an image file .
When Factor starts up it loads the image and starts executing the code stored in it .
I wanted to explore some ideas with images and dynamic code generation so wrote a simple example on how to generate assembly , store it in an image and later load and run it .
The same principle is used to generate machine code at runtime and execute it .
As a start I wanted to generate the equivalent of a simple function in the x86 architecture that returns an integer value .
The equivalent of :
int func( void ) { return 42 ; }
To see the assembly code this generates I used gcc to compile it and saved the temporary files :
gcc -c - save - temps test.c
The relevant part of the output was :
_func : pushl %ebp movl %esp , %ebp movl $ 42 , %eax popl %ebp ret
Using objdump I looked at the generated machine code with :
objdump - D test .o
Giving :
00000000 < _func > : 0 : 55 push %ebp 1 : 89 e5 mov %esp , %ebp 3 : b8 2a 00 00 00 mov $ 0x2a , %eax 8 : 5d pop %ebp 9 : c3 ret
For the first simple test I just wrote some code that output the relevant bytes into a file called ' image.x86 ' .
Now I needed a program to load and execute the code .
Allocating a memory area with ' malloc ' , loading the image into it , and then casting the memory pointer to a function pointer and calling it seems the obvious step but it wo n't work .
Modern CPUs distinguish between code and data .
Code cannot be executed from within a memory area which is not marked as executable .
We need to allocate a memory area specifically marked as being executable .
The way to do this is different between operating systems .
For this example I 'm running on Windows and VirtualAlloc is the needed call :
void* allocate_code_buffer( int size ) { return VirtualAlloc( NULL , size , MEM_COMMIT , PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE ) ; } void free_code_buffer ( void* addr ) { VirtualFree( addr , 0 , MEM_RELEASE ) ; } void flush_icache ( ) { FlushInstructionCache( GetCurrentProcess ( ) , 0 , 0 ) ; }
Also needed is VirtualFree to free the memory area when we no longer need it .
Modern CPUs also cache some memory areas .
If the memory area where the generated code is stored is cached then our new code in that area wo n't be seen by the CPU unless we flush the cache .
That 's what ' FlushInstruction Cache ' does .
This is n't actually needed on x86 machines but on ARM it is .
Windows on x86 provides the function anyway and it's good practice to call it so the code is portable .
The following pseudo - ish code loads the image , and calls it :
void* load_image ( FILE * file ) { void* image = 0 ; image = allocate_code_buffer( 1024 ) ; fread ( image , 1024 , 1 , file ) ; flush_icache ( ) ; return image ; } typedef int ( * entry_func ) ( void ) ; void run_image ( void* image ) { entry_func func = ( entry_func ) image ; printf ( " Result is : %d
" , func ( ) ) ; } FILE * file = fopen ( " image.x86 " , " rb " ) ; void* image = load_image ( file ) ; fclose ( file ) ; run_image ( image ) ; free_image ( image ) ;
Once the small C loader is written it can be used with any generated image files .
Real code is a bit more complicated than that simple function .
It has branches and jumps .
To handle this I made the image file format more structured .
At the beginning is the size of the generated machine code , the machine code data itself and then some relocation records .
The runtime loaded in C loads the image data first , then walks through the relocation records patching up any references in the code to the address where the image was loaded .
This needs to be done if there are any absolute jumps or references in the image to other parts of the image as the image could be loaded at a different address from where it was first generated .
The relocation records exist as a number of ' labels ' .
Each label contains the offset in the image file for that label , and a number of addresses that reference the label .
Those references are updated to be the actual address of the label .
Something like this :
void relocate_image ( FILE * file , void* image ) { unsigned long num_labels = 0 ; int i = 0 ; fread ( &num_labels , sizeof ( num_labels ) , 1 , file ) ; for ( i=0 ; i< num_labels ; ++i ) { unsigned long offset = 0 ; unsigned long num_references = 0 ; int j = 0 ; fread ( &offset , sizeof ( offset ) , 1 , file ) ; fread ( &num_references , sizeof ( num_references ) , 1 , file ) ; for ( j=0;j< num_references ;++j ) { unsigned long ref = 0 ; unsigned char* bimage = ( unsigned char * ) image ; fread ( &ref , sizeof ( ref ) , 1 , file ) ; *( bimage+ref ) =bimage + offset ; } } }
I did n't fully implement jumps in this simple example but to prove the concept I do relocations for ' near relative ' jumps .
These could actually be computed before writing the image but I did it as part of the image relocation as I 'd need to add that for absolute jumps later anyway .
I wrote some Javascript code to generate the machine code .
It 's not a full X86 assembler in Javascript , but just enough to generate the 3 - 4 instructions I use as a proof of concept .
The Javascript to generate the machine code looks like this :
var image = new Image ( LITTLEENDIAN ) ; var assembler = new X86Assembler ( image ) ; assembler.move ( 42 , EAX ) .move ( 5 , EBX ) .jmpNear ( " end " ) .adc( EBX ,EAX ) .label ( " end " ) .ret ( ) ; image.save ( " image.x86 " ) ;
This snippet generates code to load EAX with 42 , EBX with 5 , and jumps to the label ' end ' which results in returning from the function .
If you remove the jump , or comment it out , it adds the two numbers together before returning .
The resulting image file can be run with the C loaded and prints out the integer value returned by this snippet ( which is the result stored in the EAX register ) .
This assembler is very simple .
It basically stores the generated bytes for each instruction in an array in the Image object .
When saved the Image object writes the generated bytes and the relocation data if there is any .
The javascript code is in image.js , x86assembler.js , armassembler.js and generate.js .
It can be run with the Rhino Javascript interpreter .
The full distribution is in image1.tar.gz and includes the Rhino Javascript interpreter JAR file .
A darcs repository with the code if you want to play with it and send patches is at :
darcs get http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/repos/image1
A simple test run is :
java - jar js.jar generate.js gcc -o run_image run.c run_image image.x86
I also did an ARM version which can be tested on a Windows CE machine .
I tested it on the Microsoft Windows Mobile 5 Emulator with run.c compiled with ' cegcc ' .
In that case I ran the test.arm image which is simple code generated with :
var image = new Image ( LITTLEENDIAN ) ; var assembler = new ARMAssembler ( image ) ; assembler.moveRsRd(arm.SP , arm .IP ) .stmfd(arm.SP , [ 1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ] ) .sub( arm.IP , arm .FP , 4 ) .moveImmediate ( 42 , arm.R3 ) .moveRsRd(arm.R3 , arm.R0 ) .ldmfd(arm.SP , [ 1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ] ) ; image.save ( " image.arm " ) ;
This code returns ' 42 ' in the R0 register .
It 's exactly the code generated with the test function described before on x86 , but for ARM , and I worked it out using the same compile / objdump method but using cegcc for the compiler .
It 's an interesting exercise to generate this sort of thing from scratch to get an idea of how systems like Factor do it .
An interesting approach might be to use Factor to generate small images for use on memory constrained devices with a tiny C runtime loader .
Although I have n't tried it this might work on Symbian devices as well .
Symbian devices are ARM based but their applications are really DLLs that are loaded by the main phone application .
By writing a DLL C loader that reads an executes the image file , or different images for each exposed virtual function from the DLL , you could bootstrap a simple Symbian program .
The code I wrote here is very much ' hack away until it worked ' code .
The assemblers in particular are ugly but it should be just enough to give you an idea of how it works if you want to go off and do something similar .
This article was allegedly written by Alexander Litvinenko four months before his assassination .
A few days ago , Russian President Vladimir Putin walked from the Big Kremlin Palace to his Residence .
At one of the Kremlin squares , the president stopped to chat with the tourists .
Among them was a boy aged 4 or 5 .
' What is your name ? '
Putin asked .
' Nikita , ' the boy replied .
Putin kneed , lifted the boy 's T - shirt and kissed his stomach .
The world public is shocked .
Nobody can understand why the Russian president did such a strange thing as kissing the stomach of an unfamiliar small boy .
The explanation may be found if we look carefully at the so - called " blank spots " in Putin 's biography .
After graduating from the Andropov Institute , which prepares officers for the KGB intelligence service , Putin was not accepted into the foreign intelligence .
Instead , he was sent to a junior position in KGB Leningrad Directorate .
This was a very unusual twist for a career of an Andropov Institute 's graduate with fluent German .
Why did that happen with Putin ?
Because , shortly before his graduation , his bosses learned that Putin was a pedophile .
So say some people who knew Putin as a student at the Institute .
The Institute officials feared to report this to their own superiors , which would cause an unpleasant investigation .
They decided it was easier just to avoid sending Putin abroad under some pretext .
Such a solution is not unusual for the secret services .
Many years later , when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for presidency , he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him by the secret services over earlier years .
It was not difficult , provided he himself was the FSB director .
Among other things , Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security Directorate , which showed him making sex with some underage boys .
Interestingly , the video was recorded in the same conspiratorial flat in Polyanka Street in Moscow where Russian Prosecutor - General Yuri Skuratov was secretly video - taped with two prostitutes .
Later , in the famous scandal , Putin ( on Roman Abramovich 's instructions ) blackmailed Skuratov with these tapes and tried to persuade the Prosecutor - General to resign .
In that conversation , Putin mentioned to Skuratov that he himself was also secretly video - taped making sex at the same bed .
( But of course , he did not tell it was pedophilia rather than normal sex . )
Later , Skuratov wrote about this in his book Variant Drakona ( p.p. 153-154 ) .
The WWD is reporting that Anna Wintour has redecorated her office to banish all similarities between her office and the office of the Runway editor in the movie , Devil Wears Prada .
“ Though Meryl Streep took care to say that she was n’t basing her “ The Devil Wears Prada ” performance on Anna Wintour , the film ’s production designer made no such distinctions .
Side - by - side photos of the Vogue editor - in - chief and Streep ’s tyrannical editor in their respective offices yielded a near mirror image , down to the photos on the wall ( though Wintour ’s is the more cluttered ) .
Now Wintour has redecorated to erase any similarity , a Vogue spokesman confirmed Wednesday .
“ Anna has decided to freshen up her office , ” said the spokesman .
“ After this summer ’s film , it ceased to feel personal . ”
The film ’s production designer , Jess Gonchor , told WWD that he had worked off a photo of Wintour at her desk that he found online .
“ I had no way to get into Vogue , ” he recalled .
“ I know they wanted nothing to do with it . ”
P.S. Have you ever wondered who was the real life “ Emily ” ?
Gawker knows .
A particle that may mediate the rare decay of a Sigma - plus hyperon appears to have close affiliations with a light Higgs boson found in one supersymmetric model — an interpretation suggesting unambiguous evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( SM ) , scientists say .
Xiao - Gang
He of the National Taiwan University , Jusak Tandean of the University of La Verne , and German Valencia of Iowa State have investigated the so - called HyperCP result observed at Fermilab a little over two years ago .
While the HyperCP Collaboration began as a search for CP symmetry violation , the rare decay of the Sigma - plus hyperon ( made of a strange quark and two up quarks ) opens the possibility for the existence of a new particle with unusual characteristics .
This unverified particle , which He and colleagues call particle X , would act as the intermediate state when the Sigma - plus decays to its final state , of a proton , muon - plus and muon - minus .
With its extremely light mass ( 214.3 MeV ) , low energy , and smallest - ever branching ratio for a baryon decay , particle X would have less than a 1 % chance of being accounted for within the SM .
Although
He and colleagues showed in an earlier paper that the HyperCP result may be explained by the SM if there is no new particle , the implications of a new particle are considerable .
If scientists find that particle X is indeed a new particle belonging to a different model , the breakdown of the SM would open up new doors for future investigations in many areas , and possibly answer many questions unanswered by the SM .
In their recent paper published in Physical Review Letters , He et al. turned their attention to a model called the “ next - to - minimal sypersymmetric standard model ” ( NMSSM ) that contains seven Higgs bosons .
The scientists showed that the lightest one is the main component of a particle called A0 1 , and that A0 1 satisfies all the constraints of particle X .
“ If the existence of a very light A0 1 is confirmed , other models such as the SM , which do not have any light Higgs bosons , will be ruled out , ” Tandean told PhysOrg.com .
Tandean also explained how , although the SM has withstood many experimental tests , there are some issues that the model does n’t address .
“ One issue is the so - called hierarchy problem : why the electroweak scale ( represented by the W and Z boson masses , of order 100 GeV ) is so much smaller than the Planck scale ( 1019 GeV ) , at which gravity becomes important for elementary particle interactions , ” he said .
“ One aspect of this issue is that quantum corrections to the Higgs mass make its value arbitrarily large , up to the Planck scale .
This clearly contradicts the requirement that the Higgs be lighter than a few hundred GeV . ”
However , as Tandean explained , supersymmetric models ( where every SM particle has a corresponding superpartner ) can provide a natural solution to this problem .
” The presence of the superpartners results in the cancellation of the large quantum corrections , leading to a Higgs mass at the desired level , ” he said .
“ The minimal version of such models is called the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( MSSM ) .
The MSSM is a very attractive model in many ways , but it does not address the question of why the electroweak scale is much smaller than the Planck scale to begin with — this is the so - called mu problem .
“ Interestingly , the Next - to - Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ( NMSSM ) solves this problem by adding a set of two particles to the MSSM in such a way that the electroweak scale can be naturally small .
The NMSSM has been extensively studied in the literature and has many other interesting features .
It is therefore a well - motivated model . ”
Among the constraints that the NMSSM ’s A0 1 can satisfy include explaining why X is very light : the mass of A0 1 can be as low as 100 MeV , and when the mass is 214.3 MeV , the decay into a muon - anti-muon dominates over other possible modes .
Secondly , the interactions of A0 1 can produce the same rate found in the HyperCP observation .
Thirdly , A0 1 explains why previous experiments with kaons and B - mesons that thoroughly explored the same regions where X exists never saw X .
For these reasons , kaon and B - meson decays impose severe constraints on the properties of X , specifically regarding two - quark couplings .
This means that , even though A0 1 could explain the new particle over a wide range of parameters , there are only narrow ranges for which the kaon constraints are also satisfied .
However , the scientists also suggest that revisiting these constraints might reveal some overlooked data .
In the future , two new particle accelerators — the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) and International Linear Collider ( ILC ) — might shed more light on the Higgs hypothesis .
Supersymmetry may determine some parameters of particle X , where investigations of squark and chargino intermediate states in the NMSSM might provide more evidence .
“ The LHC and ILC have the capability of finding the charginos predicted by supersymmetric theories , depending on the chargino masses , ” Tandean said .
“ In our study , we find that in order to explain the HyperCP results , the lighter chargino mass has to be around 100 GeV , which is within the range to be probed by the LHC and ILC .
At the LHC and ILC , it is also possible to study the usual Higgs boson , h , in detail ( or the one playing the role of h in NMSSM ) .
If the A0 1 is the X particle , the process h -->
XX can occur and may become the dominant decay mode if the h mass is relatively small ( 120 to 130 GeV ) .
By studying the properties of h in detail , one may verify that X is the A0 1 . ”

Is this the first two - tailed scorpion ?
Other accounts of two - tailed scorpions exist and several museums and universities have preserved specimens in their collections .
( For a list of other species that have been noted with two tails , see the list below )
In fact , two - tailed scorpions were once thought to be in their own group , apart from scorpions with one tail !
Do both tails move ?
Here at the Sonoran Arthropod Studies Institute , we have observed that both telsons ( tails ) are capable of movement and are held either crossed over one another or arched side - by - side .
Pepe exhibits behaviors similar to other bark scorpions such as walking upside down beneath objects and holding the body very flat on the ground .
Is one tail dominant over the other ?
In one observation of Pepe using her tails to subdue a cricket , the right tail appeared to be the tool of choice .
Upon approaching the cricket , Pepe grabbed its abdomen with the left claw and pierced the cricket with her right tail .
About ten minutes later , Pepe stung the cricket again with the right tail .
More observations are needed to study tail usage and behavior .
Judge leaves SCO 's case vs. IBM on life support ( updated )
Posted November 30 , 2006 @ 11:38 AM

Update
In a hearing held on Thusrday , US Magistrate Judge Brooke C. Wells handed IBM another significant victory in its fight against SCO .
Groklaw 's eyewitness reports indicate that it was a rough day for SCO , with Judge Wells ruling that the company would not be able to add any further claims to its case beyond what it revealed in its final disclosure .
According to one eyewitness , IBM 's counsel accused SCO of " sandbagging " when it came to complying with court orders .
The judge agreed , directing IBM to draft her order on the case .
The end result is that SCO is left with the evidence generated prior to the close of the discovery period .
The company will be unable to introduce new evidence via expert reports , making it difficult if not downright impossible to introduce baseless new allegations or further change its story .
Original story
On Wednesday , US District Court Judge Dale Kimball upheld a magistrate 's ruling that tore the heart out of SCO 's case against IBM while also swapping IBM and Novell 's places in line when it comes trying the cases .
In July , Magistrate Judge Brooke C. Wells dismissed the evidence supporting 182 of the 294 claims SCO had made against IBM .
Predictably , SCO appealed , and Judge Kimball conducted a de novo review ( i.e. , staring from scratch ) that reaffirmed Judge Wells ' finding .
Judge Kimball has harsh words for SCO in his order : " The court finds that SCO failed to comply with the court 's previous discovery - related Orders and Rule 26 ( e ) , that SCO acted willfully , that SCO 's conduct has resulted in prejudice to IBM , and that this result the inability of SCO to use the evidence at issue to prove its claims should come as no surprise to SCO . "
Judge Kimball also reshuffled SCO 's trial dates , moving SCO v. Novell to the front of the line and delaying SCO v. IBM until the Novell case has wrapped up .
The reasoning is simple : Novell is claiming ownership of the copyrights related to Unix .
If the courts agree with Novell , then what little is left of SCO 's case against IBM will collapse , followed shortly thereafter by the collapse of SCO itself .
Novell asserts that when Santa Cruz Operations , the forerunner to the SCO Group , purchased UnixWare back in 1995 , Novell retained the copyrights related to the operating system .
As the owner of all " patents , copyrights , and trademarks " related to Unix , Novell believes that it is " entitled at its sole discretion , to waive its purported claims against IBM " and other licensees , giving it veto power over any enforcement actions SCO might undertake .
Both rulings are bad news for SCO .
Not only has most of what evidence the company has managed to muster in its case against IBM been relegated to the big circular file in the corner , but SCO will now be forced to prove that it has the right to even bring litigation against IBM .
If Novell wins and the evidence produced so far appears to strongly support Novell 's version of the UnixWare sale there 's no basis for SCO v. IBM to go forward .
If it does for some reason , SCO will be left to argue a gutted case .
The fat lady may not be singing yet , but she 's in the green room practicing her scales .
SCO v. Novell is currently scheduled for trial beginning September 17 , 2007 .

Angela and Roberto Casa are looking forward more than most to spending the summer months in their garden .
In truth , it will be something of a novelty .
" For years now we 've avoided coming outside at all , " reveals Mr Casa .
" It 's a shame because the big garden was one of the reasons we wanted this house .
" But my wife has fled back inside in tears too many times to make it a nice thing to do .
When we do venture out we have to bring a tape recorder , just in case it all kicks off again .
Scroll down for more
" Or we 'll have to run inside to check the CCTV , to see if something 's been recorded .
Even when it seems quiet , you are constantly on edge , wondering what is going to happen next .
" I 'm still expecting that woman to appear and start screaming obscenities at me , calling my wife a prostitute and my daughter a witch
or threatening to kill our dog .
" I have n't quite grasped the fact that an afternoon in the garden might not result in us calling the police . "
The sudden arrival of tranquillity in the Casa household - Angela , 40 , Roberto , 54 , and their two children Luciano , 16 , and 13 - year - old Gabrielle - is down to one simple fact .
Last week , their 81 - year - old neighbour Dorothy Evans was sent to prison , convicted of harassment and six breaches of an Asbo .
The court heard how the whitehaired pensioner had waged an extraordinary campaign of intimidation against her neighbours - despite her advanced years and supposed illhealth .
Calling Mrs Casa - a softly - spoken nursery nurse - a prostitute was only the start .
She had also attacked her with her walking stick , flashed her bottom to Mrs Casa 's bewildered mother , told her husband to go back to his native Italy and , in a particularly bizarre incident , got down on her hands and knees to draw round Mrs Casa 's car , with her in it , with chalk .
Scroll down for more
The harassment had been going on for a staggering ten years , and Mrs Evans had a string of previous convictions involving neighbourhood disputes between 1999 and 2005 , including four for harassment and eight for breaching a restraining order .
Exasperated to find her again before a court , Judge Roderick Denyer QC said he had no option but to take the unusual step of sending a woman of her age to jail .
He described her as the " original neighbour from hell " .
Were it not for the police paper mountain relating to this case - and the weary look in Mrs Casa 's eyes - it would be impossible to believe what had been going on in this pretty street in the market town of Abergavenny , South Wales .
It is - or should be - a lovely place to live .
The Mr and Mrs Casa 's house , worth around £ 250,000 , is wellmaintained .
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said for their neighbour's .
Mrs Evans 's home is a ramshackle affair , surrounded by high black wrought iron gates , padlocked to deter intruders .
Still , how the house next door looks is not of such concern to Angela and Roberto .
It is the fact that you can no longer see Mrs Evans - who lives with her daughter Barbara Thomas - at one of her windows , making obscene gestures or clambering out onto her flat roof to hurl abuse , that matters .
They gaze around their suddenly silent garden , savouring the peace , but unsure of exactly how long it will last .
" She got a six - month sentence but we do n't know how long she will have to serve , " says Mr Casa .
" At the most , we 've probably got three months without her .
After that , she 'll be back , and God help us then .
" But for the moment , we 've got our lives back , and we 've got an awful lot of time to make up for . "
By rights , the couple 's story should be a fairytale one of how hard work brings just rewards .
Born in Italy , Roberto Casa moved to Abergavenny with his parents when he was a boy .
Eleven years ago , the builder got his dream house in Park Crescent .
What really upsets the couple now is that for the first year , they truly felt that Mrs Evans was a wonderful neighbour .
" For the first year we had a very good
relationship with her , " Mrs Casa says .
" She seemed a sweet , normal old woman .
We 'd chat a little over the wall .
" I remember her buying my two children presents for their birthday , and she 'd bring us back something when she went on holiday .
We 'd do the same . "
About a year after they moved in , however , things soured quite suddenly .
" One day she came round complaining that water was leaking into her garden , and said it was coming from our property , " recalls Mrs Casa .
" We 'd been made aware from the previous owner that this was something she 'd complained about before . "
More technical investigations followed , but again it was confirmed that the problem was nothing to do with the Casas .
Mrs Evans , however , seemed convinced she was being victimised .
" I do n't know what happened after that , but the whole relationship changed , " says Mrs Casa .
" She became obsessed with our front wall , saying that rain was running down the stones and that we'd have to remove some .
My husband refused , and she called him everything under the sun .
" We were shocked .
She seemed to flip , called him a " b*****d " and said he should go back to Italy .
He was very hurt and angry .
" Then she started on me .
At first it was just swearing for the sake of it , but one day I was sitting on the step , having a cup of tea when she just launched herself at me , calling me a whore and saying she 'd been watching me go with men at all hours of the night .
I was shocked beyond belief . "
For the next ten years , things went from bad to worse .
The caring old lady who brought back presents from her holidays turned into a vicious and vindictive individual who seemed to take delight in haranguing her neighbours publicly .
To this day , none of them can explain the reason for the apparent Jekyll to Hyde transformation .
Although the Casas were n't her only victims - at one point a countywide order banned her from causing trouble in the entire Gwent area - they came in for particularly intensive attention .
" She had a thing about parking , and seemed to think that if we were on the road at all , we were in her way , " recalls Mrs Casa .
" I got home one day to find she 'd called the police because of where my car was parked .
It was on the road , nowhere near her gate , but she wanted it moved .
The officers were explaining I was n't committing an offence .
" When I went to go out later , I got in the car and suddenly she was on the ground , drawing round it .
She was ranting all the time .
I wound down the window and said :
" Mrs Evans , what on earth are you doing ?
Please get up .
You will get hurt . "
By this point , Mr Casa had accepted a job working on the construction of the new terminal at Heathrow Airport , which mean he was away in London for the entire week , returning home only at the weekends .
Back in Wales , the odd behaviour escalated .
" One day , I looked out of one of my windows to see her at hers , making obscene gestures at me , " says Mrs Casa .
" I tried to ignore her , but then she actually came out onto her flat roof and was prancing up and down , giving me a v-sign . "
Then there was the infamous " mooning " incident .
That day , Angela 's mother was with her .
" I looked round to see Mrs Evans pulling faces behind my mother 's back .
I asked what she thought she was doing .
Then she turned round and pulled her trousers down .
My poor mother was horrified .
She said : ' Go away , you disgusting woman ' . "
Slightly odd behaviour is one thing , but with Mrs Evans , things could also be potentially dangerous .
" One day , she tried to run us off the road , " says Mrs Casa .
" Another day , she drove straight into us when my husband was driving .
I was petrified .
I feared for my children 's lives .
" People - even the police - kept telling me ' she 's batty , but she wo n't do you any harm ' , but I knew she could .
Then she struck me with her walking stick , and confirmed it .
" While we were reporting it at the police station , she was there too , complaining about us , and she hit me right in front of the officers . "
And listening to what they have been through it seems perfectly just that Mrs Evans is finally behind bars .
Thanks to her , the Casas ' well - deserved family life has been simply trashed .
Every day is dominated by the need to fill in the " log book " , a vast well - thumbed diary in which every incident , no matter how trivial , is recorded .
The reported incidents run into hundreds .
Quite early on , the police explained to the Casas that addressing anti-social behaviour is
extremely difficult and the courts can take action only with meticulously documented evidence .
Thus , they cannot leave the house without carrying a tape recorder , so that any tirades of abuse can be recorded .
The CCTV cameras outside their house are constantly in use .
" It 's so tiresome .
Every night , I come home and have to watch eight hours of footage to see what she 's been up to , " says Mrs Casa .
" Our friends say she has taken over our lives , that we are obsessed with her , and we are .
But to stop her harassing us , we 've had to document every cough and spit " .
So now they have their evidence - but at what price ?
Mrs Casa has clearly been to the brink .
" My doctor wrote a letter saying I was on the verge of a breakdown , " she says .
" He wanted to put me on anti-depressants .
" My work suffered because I 'd be in such a state .
Once , she told me she was going to call the nursery school where I work and report me for child abuse .
" That terrified me .
If she 'd done that , my career would have been over because they'd have had to suspend me while the allegation was being investigated . "
As the months passed , Roberto , away in London during the week , became increasingly distraught about what his family were going through .
When Mrs Evans started on their 13 - year - old daughter - calling her a witch and threatening to kill her dog - Mr Casa was incandescent .
" It got harder and harder to ignore her , " he admits .
" Every time she went for me , I 'd try to walk away , but it was difficult .
I remember saying to the police : ' You have to do something , because if you do n't I will snap and then you will be arresting me too . '
I was terrified about what she would push me to . "
That the couple 's marriage has survived it all is quite remarkable .
Angela admits they have been close to the edge .
" We did come close to splitting up over it , " she reveals .
" It got to the stage where we were just arguing all the time because we were under so much pressure .
" Family life went out the window and it became all about Mrs Evans - what she 'd done that day , what she was likely to do tomorrow .
" The more it went on , the more I blamed my husband for bringing us here .
He felt guilty for making us move here - then leaving us to work in London .
" We could so easily have lost our marriage in all this .
It 's only because we stepped back and said we can't let her split us up . "
Quite what a decent couple they are is evident when they talk about what has happened to Mrs Evans .
At first they , too , wondered if she was simply ill , or insane , so erratic was her behaviour .
But medical reports concluded that she knew exactly what she was doing .
Still , Mrs Casa says she feels a little guilty that the old woman is now languishing in prison .
" It is no place for someone her age .
I wish they 'd put her in a hospital or something - just anywhere away from us , but I am uneasy at the thought of her in there . "
Her husband is more concerned , though , about her new neighbours - her fellow inmates .
" I only hope she is n't sharing a cell , " he concludes .
" No one deserves to have Mrs Evans thrust on them , whatever they 've done . "
The IRA statement said it would pursue a peaceful path
In a long - awaited statement , the republican organisation said it would follow a democratic path ending more than 30 years of violence .
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said the move was a " courageous and confident initiative " and that the moment must be seized .
Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was a " step of unparalleled magnitude " .
" It is what we have striven for and worked for throughout the eight years since the Good Friday Agreement , " he said .
QUICK GUIDE
Northern Ireland conflict
The IRA made its decision after an internal debate prompted by Mr Adams ' call in April to pursue its goals exclusively through politics .
Mr Adams said Thursday 's statement was a " defining point in the search for a lasting peace with justice " and also presented challenges for others .
" It means that unionists who are for the Good Friday Agreement must end their ambivalence , " he said .
" And it is a direct challenge to the DUP to decide if they want to put the past behind them , and make peace with the rest of the people of this island . "
In a joint communique the British and Irish governments welcomed the statement and said if the IRA 's words " are borne out by actions , it will be a momentous and historic development " .
" Verified acts of completion will provide a context in which we will expect all parties to work towards the full operation of the political institutions , including the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive , and the North - South structures , at the earliest practicable date , " it said .
KEY POINTS OF STATEMENT
All IRA units ordered to dump arms Members ordered to pursue objectives through " exclusively peaceful means "
Arms to be put beyond use as quickly as possible Two church witnesses to verify this Statement followed " honest and forthright " consultation process Strong support among IRA members for Sinn Fein 's peace strategy
There is now an alternative way to achieve goal of united Ireland " Volunteers must not engage in any other activities whatsoever "
IRA statement in full Reaction to IRA statement
The Independent Monitoring Commission , which examines paramilitary activity , has also been asked to produce an additional report in January 2006 , three months after their next regular report .
During the Northern Ireland Troubles , the IRA murdered about 1,800 civilians and members of the security forces .
The IRA statement issued on Thursday said the end of the armed campaign would take effect from 1600 BST .
" All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms .
All Volunteers have been instructed to assist the development of purely political and democratic programmes through exclusively peaceful means .
Volunteers must not engage in any other activities whatsoever .
" The IRA leadership has also authorised our representative to engage with the IICD to complete the process to verifiably put its arms beyond use in a way which will further enhance public confidence and to conclude this as quickly as possible . "
The statement said independent witnesses from Catholic and Protestant churches had been invited to see the decommissioning process .
Gerry Adams said the " moment must be seized "
DUP leader Ian Paisley greeted the statement with scepticism , saying that the IRA had " reverted to type " after previous " historic " statements .
" We will judge the IRA 's bona fides over the next months and years based on its behaviour and activity , " he said .
He said they had also " failed to provide the transparency necessary to truly build confidence that the guns have gone in their entirety " .
Ulster Unionist Party Sir Reg Empey , told the BBC's World at One it would take time to convince the people of Northern Ireland that this was more than just rhetoric .
He said : " People are so sceptical , having been burnt so many times before .
SDLP leader Mark Durkan welcomed the statement , saying it was " clear , clean and complete " , but " long overdue " .
He called on Sinn Fein to commit to the new policing structures in Northern Ireland , as his party had done .
People in Belfast give their reaction to the IRA statement .
In pictures
Taoiseach Bertie
Ahern has said he welcomes the IRA 's statement that it was ending its " armed campaign " .
Mr Ahern said the end of the IRA as a paramilitary group " is the outcome the governments have been working towards " since the 1994 ceasefire .
The IRA pledge was welcomed by the United States administration as " an important and potentially historic statement " .
A White House statement said the words must now be followed by actions and acknowledged there would be scepticism , particularly among victims and their families .
" They will want to be certain that this terrorism and criminality are indeed things of the past , " the statement said .
The statement added that it understood from the IRA communique that " the IRA and its members will no longer have any contact with any foreign paramilitary and terrorist organisations " .
When he made his appeal in April , Mr Adams said it was " a genuine attempt to drive the peace process forward " .
Republicans had been under intense pressure to end IRA activity after the £ 26.5 m Northern Bank raid in December and the murder of Belfast man Robert McCartney in January .
Political talks last year failed to restore devolution , which stalled amid claims of IRA intelligence gathering at Parliament Buildings , Stormont , in 2002 .
The Provisional IRA 's campaign of violence was aimed at forcing an end to the British presence in Northern Ireland , leading to a united Ireland .

Human Nature : Justice versus Power
Noam Chomsky debates with Michel Foucault
1971
ELDERS :
Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the third debate of the International Philosophers ’ Project .
Tonight ’s debaters are Mr. Michel Foucault , of the College de France , and Mr. Noam Chomsky , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Both philosophers have points in common and points of difference .
Perhaps the best way to compare both philosophers would be to see them as tunnellers through a mountain working at opposite sides of the same mountain with different tools , without even knowing if they are working in each other ’s direction .
But both are doing their jobs with quite new ideas , digging as profoundly as possible with an equal commitment in philosophy as in politics : enough reasons , it seems to me for us to expect a fascinating debate about philosophy and about politics .
I intend , therefore , not to lose any time and to start off with a central , perennial question : the question of human nature .
All studies of man , from history to linguistics and psychology , are faced with the question of whether , in the last instance , we are the product of all kinds of external factors , or if , in spite of our differences , we have something we could call a common human nature , by which we can recognise each other as human beings .
So my first question is to you Mr. Chomsky , because you often employ the concept of human nature , in which connection you even use terms like “ innate ideas ” and “ innate structures ” .
Which arguments can you derive from linguistics to give such a central position to this concept of human nature ?
CHOMSKY :
Well , let me begin in a slightly technical way .
A person who is interested in studying languages is faced with a very definite empirical problem .
He ’s faced with an organism , a mature , let ’s say adult , speaker , who has somehow acquired an amazing range of abilities , which enable him in particular to say what he means , to understand what people say to him , to do this in a fashion that I think is proper to call highly creative … that is , much of what a person says in his normal intercourse with others is novel , much of what you hear is new , it does n’t bear any close resemblance to anything in your experience ; it ’s not random novel behaviour , clearly , it ’s behaviour which is in some sense which is very hard to characterise , appropriate to situations .
And in fact it has many of the characteristics of what I think might very well be called creativity .
Now , the person who has acquired this intricate and highly articulated and organised collection of abilities - the collection of abilities that we call knowing a language - has been exposed to a certain experience ; he has been presented in the course of his lifetime with a certain amount of data , of direct experience with a language .
We can investigate the data that ’s available to this person ; having done so , in principle , we ’re faced with a reasonably clear and well - delineated scientific problem , namely that of accounting for the gap between the really quite small quantity of data , small and rather degenerate in quality , that ’s presented to the child , and the very highly articulated , highly systematic , profoundly organised resulting knowledge that he somehow derives from these data .
Furthermore we notice that varying individuals with very varied experience in a particular language nevertheless arrive at systems which are very much congruent to one another .
The systems that two speakers of English arrive at on the basis of their very different experiences are congruent in the sense that , over an overwhelming range , what one of them says , the other can understand .
Furthermore , even more remarkable , we notice that in a wide range of languages , in fact all that have been studied seriously , there are remarkable limitations on the kind of systems that emerge from the very different kinds of experiences to which people are exposed .
There is only one possible explanation , which I have to give in a rather schematic fashion , for this remarkable phenomenon , namely the assumption that the individual himself contributes a good deal , an overwhelming part in fact , of the general schematic structure and perhaps even of the specific content of the knowledge that he ultimately derives from this very scattered and limited experience .
A person who knows a language has acquired that knowledge because he approached the learning experience with a very explicit and detailed schematism that tells him what kind of language it is that he is being exposed to .
That is , to put it rather loosely : the child must begin with the knowledge , certainly not with the knowledge that he ’s hearing English or Dutch or French or something else , but he does start with the knowledge that he ’s hearing a human language of a very narrow and explicit type , that permits a very small range of variation .
And it is because he begins with that highly organised and very restrictive schematism , that he is able to make the huge leap from scattered and degenerate data to highly organised knowledge .
And furthermore I should add that we can go a certain distance , I think a rather long distance , towards presenting the properties of this system of knowledge , that I would call innate language or instinctive knowledge , that the child brings to language learning ; and also we can go a long way towards describing the system that is mentally represented when he has acquired this knowledge .
I would claim then that this instinctive knowledge , if you like , this schematism that makes it possible to derive complex and intricate knowledge on the basis of very partial data , is one fundamental constituent of human nature .
In this case I think a fundamental constituent because of the role that language plays , not merely in communication , but also in expression of thought and interaction between persons ; and I assume that in other domains of human intelligence , in other domains of human cognition and behaviour , something of the same sort must be true .
Well , this collection , this mass of schematisms , innate organising principles , which guides our social and intellectual and individual behaviour , that ’s what I mean to refer to by the concept of human nature .
ELDERS :
Well , Mr. Foucault , when I think of your books like The History of Madness and Words and Objects , I get the impression that you are working on a completely different level and with a totally opposite aim and goal ; when I think of the word schematism in relation to human nature , I suppose you are trying to elaborate several periods with several schematisms .
What do you say to this ?
FOUCAULT :
Well , if you do n’t mind I will answer in French , because my English is so poor that I would be ashamed of answering in English .
It is true that I mistrust the notion of human nature a little , and for the following reason : I believe that of the concepts or notions which a science can use , not all have the same degree of elaboration , and that in general they have neither the same function nor the same type of possible use in scientific discourse .
Let ’s take the example of biology .
You will find concepts with a classifying function , concepts with a differentiating function , and concepts with an analytical function : some of them enable us to characterise objects , for example that of “ tissue ” ; others to isolate elements , like that of “ hereditary feature ” ; others to fix relations , such as that of “ reflex ” .
There are at the same time elements which play a role in the discourse and in the internal rules of the reasoning practice .
But there also exist “ peripheral ” notions , those by which scientific practice designates itself , differentiates itself in relation to other practices , delimits its domain of objects , and designates what it considers to be the totality of its future tasks .
The notion of life played this role to some extent in biology during a certain period .
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the notion of life was hardly used in studying nature : one classified natural beings , whether living or non-living , in a vast hierarchical tableau which went from minerals to man ; the break between the minerals and the plants or animals was relatively undecided ; epistemologically it was only important to fix their positions once and for all in an indisputable way .
At the end of the eighteenth century , the description and analysis of these natural beings showed , through the use of more highly perfected instruments and the latest techniques , an entire domain of objects , an entire field of relations and processes which have enabled us to define the specificity of biology in the knowledge of nature .
Can one say that research into life has finally constituted itself in biological science ?
Has the concept of life been responsible for the organisation of biological knowledge ?
I do n’t think so .
It seems to me more likely that the transformations of biological knowledge at the end of the eighteenth century , were demonstrated on one hand by a whole series of new concepts for use in scientific discourse and on the other hand gave rise to a notion like that of life which has enabled us to designate , to delimit and to situate a certain type of scientific discourse , among other things .
I would say that the notion of life is not a scientific concept ; it has been an epistemological indicator of which the classifying , delimiting and other functions had an effect on scientific discussions , and not on what they were talking about :
Well , it seems to me that the notion of human nature is of the same type .
It was not by studying human nature that linguists discovered the laws of consonant mutation , or Freud the principles of the analysis of dreams , or cultural anthropologists the structure of myths .
In the history of knowledge , the notion of human nature seems to me mainly to have played the role of an epistemological indicator to designate certain types of discourse in relation to or in opposition to theology or biology or history .
I would find it difficult to see in this a scientific concept .
CHOMSKY :
Well , in the first place , if we were able to specify in terms of , let ’s say , neural networks the properties of human cognitive structure that make it possible for the child to acquire these complicated systems , then I at least would have no hesitation in describing those properties as being a constituent element of human nature .
That is , there is something biologically given , unchangeable , a foundation for whatever it is that we do with our mental capacities in this case .
But I would like to pursue a little further the line of development that you outlined , with which in fact I entirely agree , about the concept of life as an organising concept in the biological sciences .
It seems to me that one might speculate a bit further speculate in this case , since we ’re talking about the future , not the past - and ask whether the concept of human nature or of innate organising mechanisms or of intrinsic mental schematism or whatever we want to call it , I do n’t see much difference between them , but let ’s call it human nature for shorthand , might not provide for biology the next peak to try to scale , after having - at least in the minds of the biologists , though one might perhaps question this - already answered to the satisfaction of some the question of what is life .
In other words , to be precise , is it possible to give a biological explanation or a physical explanation … is it possible to characterise , in terms of the physical concepts presently available to us , the ability of the child to acquire complex systems of knowledge ; and furthermore , critically , having acquired such systems of knowledge , to make use of this knowledge in the free and creative and remarkably varied ways in which he does ?
Can we explain in biological terms , ultimately in physical terms , these properties of both acquiring knowledge in the first place and making use of it in the second ?
I really see no reason to believe that we can ; that is , it ’s an article of faith on the part of scientists that since science has explained many other things it will also explain this .
In a sense one might say that this is a variant of the body / mind problem .
But if we look back at the way in which science has scaled various peaks , and at the way in which the concept of life was finally acquired by science after having been beyond its vision for a long period , then I think we notice at many points in history - and in fact the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are particularly clear examples - that scientific advances were possible precisely because the domain of physical science was itself enlarged .
Classic cases are Newton ’s gravitational forces .
To the Cartesians , action at a distance was a mystical concept , and in fact to Newton himself it was an occult quality , a mystical entity , which did n’t belong within science .
To the common sense of a later generation , action at a distance has been incorporated within science .
What happened was that the notion of body , the notion of the physical had changed .
To a Cartesian , a strict Cartesian , if such a person appeared today , it would appear that there is no explanation for the behaviour of the heavenly bodies .
Certainly there is no explanation for the phenomena that are explained in terms of electro - magnetic force , let ’s say .
But by the extension of physical science to incorporate hitherto unavailable concepts , entirely new ideas , it became possible to successively build more and more complicated structures that incorporated a larger range of phenomena .
For example , it ’s certainly not true that the physics of the Cartesians is able to explain , let ’s say , the behaviour of elementary particles in physics , just as it ’s unable to explain the concepts of life .
Similarly , I think , one might ask the question whether physical science as known today , including biology , incorporates within itself the principles and the concepts that will enable it to give an account of innate human intellectual capacities and , even more profoundly , of the ability to make use of those capacities under conditions of freedom in the way which humans do .
I see no particular reason to believe that biology or physics now contain those concepts , and it may be that to scale the next peak , to make the next step , they will have to focus on this organising concept , and may very well have to broaden their scope in order to come to grips with it .
FOUCAULT :
Yes .
ELDERS :
Perhaps I may try to ask one more specific question leading out of both your answers , because I ’m afraid otherwise the debate will become too technical .
I have the impression that one of the main differences between you both has its origin in a difference in approach .
You , Mr. Foucault , are especially interested in the way science or scientists function in a certain period , whereas Mr. Chomsky is more interested in the so - called “ what - questions ” : why we possess language ; not just how language functions , but what ’s the reason for our having language .
We can try to elucidate this in a more general way : you , Mr. Foucault , are delimiting eighteenth century rationalism , whereas you , Mr. Chomsky , are combining eighteenth - century rationalism with notions like freedom and creativity .
Perhaps we could illustrate this in a more general way with examples from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
CHOMSKY :
Well , first I should say that I approach classical rationalism not really as a historian of science or a historian of philosophy , but from the rather different point of view of someone who has a certain range of scientific notions and is interested in seeing how at an earlier stage people may have been groping towards these notions , possibly without even realising what they were groping towards .
So one might say that I ’m looking at history not as an antiquarian , who is interested in finding out and giving a precisely accurate account of what the thinking of the seventeenth century was - I do n’t mean to demean that activity , it ’s just not mine - but rather from the point of view of , let ’s say , an art lover , who wants to look at the seventeenth century to find in it things that are of particular value , and that obtain part of their value in part because of the perspective with which he approaches them .
And I think that , without objecting to the other approach , my approach is legitimate ; that is , I think it is perfectly possible to go back to earlier stages of scientific thinking on the basis of our present understanding , and to perceive how great thinkers were , within the limitations of their time , groping towards concepts and ideas and insights that they themselves could not be clearly aware of .
For example , I think that anyone can do this about his own thought .
Without trying to compare oneself to the great thinkers of the past , anyone can . .
ELDERS :
Why not ?
CHOMSKY :
… look at …
ELDERS :
Why not ?
CHOMSKY :
All right [ laughs ] , anyone can consider what he now knows and can ask what he knew twenty years ago , and can see that in some unclear fashion he was striving towards something which he can only now understand … if he is fortunate .
Similarly I think it ’s possible to look at the past , without distorting your view , and it is in these terms that I want to look at the seventeenth century .
Now , when I look back at the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , what strikes me particularly is the way in which , for example , Descartes and his followers were led to postulate mind as a thinking substance independent of the body .
If you look at their reasons for postulating this second substance , mind , thinking entity , they were that Descartes was able to convince himself , rightly or wrongly , it does n’t matter at the moment , that events in the physical world and even much of the behavioural and psychological world , for example a good deal of sensation , were explicable in terms of what he considered to be physics - wrongly , as we now believe - that is , in terms of things bumping into each other and turning and moving and so on .
He thought that in those terms , in terms of the mechanical principle , he could explain a certain domain of phenomena ; and then he observed that there was a range of phenomena that he argued could not be explained in those terms .
And he therefore postulated a creative principle to account for that domain of phenomena , the principle of mind with its own properties .
And then later followers , many who did n’t regard themselves as Cartesians , for example many who regarded themselves as strongly anti-rationalistic , developed the concept of creation within a system of rule .
I wo n’t bother with the details , but my own research into the subject led me ultimately to Wilhelm von Humboldt , who certainly did n’t consider himself a Cartesian , but nevertheless in a rather different framework and within a different historical period and with different insight , in a remarkable and ingenious way , which , I think , is of lasting importance , also developed the concept of internalised form - fundamentally the concept of free creation within a system of rule in an effort to come to grips with some of the same difficulties and problems that the Cartesians faced in their terms .
Now I believe , and here I would differ from a lot of my colleagues , that the move of Descartes to the postulation of a second substance was a very scientific move ; it was not a metaphysical or an anti-scientific move .
In fact , in many ways it was very much like Newton ’s intellectual move when he postulated action at a distance ; he was moving into the domain of the occult , if you like .
He was moving into the domain of something that went beyond well - established science , and was trying to integrate it with well - established science by developing a theory in which these notions could be properly clarified and explained .
Now Descartes , I think , made a similar intellectual move in postulating a second substance .
Of course he failed where Newton succeeded ; that is , he was unable to lay the groundwork for a mathematical theory of mind , as achieved by Newton and his followers , which laid the groundwork for a mathematical theory of physical entities that incorporated such occult notions as action at a distance and later electromagnetic forces and so on .
But then that poses for us , I think , the task of carrying on and developing this , if you like , mathematical theory of mind ; by that I simply mean a precisely articulated , clearly formulated , abstract theory which will have empirical consequences , which will let us know whether the theory is right or wrong , or on the wrong track or the right track , and at the same time will have the properties of mathematical science , that is , the properties of rigour and precision and a structure that makes it possible for us to deduce conclusions from assumptions and so on .
Now it ’s from that point of view that I try to look back at the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and to pick out points , which I think are really there , even though I certainly recognise , and in fact would want to insist , that the individuals in question may not have seen it this way .
ELDERS :
Mr. Foucault , I suppose you will have a severe criticism of this ?
FOUCAULT :
No … there are just one or two little historical points .
I cannot object to the account which you have given in your historical analysis of their reasons and of their modality .
But there is one thing one could nevertheless add : when you speak of creativity as conceived by Descartes , I wonder if you do n’t transpose to Descartes an idea which is to be found among his successors or even certain of his contemporaries .
According to Descartes , the mind was not so very creative .
It saw , it perceived , it was illuminated by the evidence .
Moreover , the problem which Descartes never resolved nor entirely mastered , was that of understanding how one could pass from one of these clear and distinct ideas , one of these intuitions , to another , and what status should be given to the evidence of the passage between them .
I ca n’t see exactly either the creation in the moment where the mind grasped the truth for Descartes , or even the real creation in the passage from one truth to another .
On the contrary , you can find , I think , at the same time in Pascal and Leibniz , something which is much closer to what you are looking for : in other words in Pascal and in the whole Augustinian stream of Christian thought , you find this idea of a mind in profundity ; of a mind folded back in the intimacy of itself which is touched by a sort of unconsciousness , and which can develop its potentialities by the deepening of the self .
And that is why the grammar of Port Royal , to which you refer , is , I think , much more Augustinian than Cartesian .
And furthermore you will find in Leibniz something which you will certainly like : the idea that in the profundity of the mind is incorporated a whole web of logical relations which constitutes , in a certain sense , the rational unconscious of the consciousness , the not yet clarified and visible form of the reason itself , which the monad or the individual develops little by little , and with which he understands the whole world .
That ’s where I would make a very small criticism .
ELDERS :
Mr. Chomsky , one moment please .
I do n’t think it ’s a question of making a historical criticism , but of formulating your own opinions on these quite fundamental concepts …
FOUCAULT :
But one ’s fundamental opinions can be demonstrated in precise analyses such as these .
ELDERS :
Yes , all right .
But I remember some passages in your History of Madness , which give a description of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in terms of repression , suppression and exclusion , while for Mr. Chomsky this period is full of creativity and individuality .
Why do we have at that period , for the first time , closed psychiatric or insane asylums ?
I think this is a very fundamental question …
FOUCAULT :
… on creativity , yes !
But I do n’t know , perhaps Mr. Chomsky would like to speak about it …
ELDERS :
No , no , no , please go on .
Continue .
FOUCAULT :
No , I would like to say this : in the historical studies that I have been able to make , or have tried to make , I have without any doubt given very little room to what you might call the creativity of individuals , to their capacity for creation , to their aptitude for inventing by themselves , for originating concepts , theories or scientific truths by themselves .
But I believe that my problem is different to that of Mr. Chomsky .
Mr. Chomsky has been fighting against linguistic behaviourism , which attributed almost nothing to the creativity of the speaking subject ; the speaking subject was a kind of surface on which information came together little by little , which he afterwards combined .
In the field of the history of science or , more generally , the history of thought , the problem was completely different .
The history of knowledge has tried for a long time to obey two claims .
One is the claim of attribution : each discovery should not only be situated and dated , but should also be attributed to someone ; it should have an inventor and someone responsible for it .
General or collective phenomena on the other hand , those which by definition ca n’t be “ attributed ” , are normally devalued : they are still traditionally described through words like “ tradition ’ , “ mentality ” , “ modes ” ; and one lets them play the negative role of a brake in relation to the “ originality ” of the inventor .
In brief , this has to do with the principle of the sovereignty of the subject applied to the history of knowledge .
The other claim is that which no longer allows us to save the subject , but the truth : so that it wo n’t be compromised by history , it is necessary not that the truth constitutes itself in history , but only that it reveals itself in it ; hidden to men ’s eyes , provisionally inaccessible , sitting in the shadows , it will wait to be unveiled .
The history of truth would be essentially its delay , its fall or the disappearance of the obstacles which have impeded it until now from coming to light .
The historical dimension of knowledge is always negative in relation to the truth .
It is n’t difficult to see how these two claims were adjusted , one to the other : the phenomena of collective order , the “ common thought ” , the “ prejudices ” of the “ myths ” of a period , constituted the obstacles which the subject of knowledge had to surmount or to outlive in order to have access finally to the truth ; he had to be in an “ eccentric ” position in order to “ discover ” .
At one level this seems to be invoking a certain “ romanticism ” about the history of science : the solitude of the man of truth , the originality which reopened itself onto the original through history and despite it .
I think that , more fundamentally , it ’s a matter of superimposing the theory of knowledge and the subject of knowledge on the history of knowledge .
And what if understanding the relation of the subject to the truth , were just an effect of knowledge ?
What if understanding were a complex , multiple , non-individual formation , not “ subjected to the subject ” , which produced effects of truth ?
One should then put forward positively this entire dimension which the history of science has negativised ; analyse the productive capacity of knowledge as a collective practice ; and consequently replace individuals and their “ knowledge ” in the development of a knowledge which at a given moment functions according to certain rules which one can register and describe .
You will say to me that all the Marxist historians of science have been doing this for a long time .
But when one sees how they work with these facts and especially what use they make of the notions of consciousness , of ideology as opposed to science , one realises that they are for the main part more or less detached from the theory of knowledge .
In any case , what I am anxious about is substituting transformations of the understanding for the history of the discoveries of knowledge .
Therefore I have , in appearance at least , a completely different attitude to Mr. Chomsky apropos creativity , because for me it is a matter of effacing the dilemma of the knowing subject , while for him it is a matter of allowing the dilemma of the speaking subject to reappear .
But if he has made it reappear , if he has described it , it is because he can do so .
The linguists have for a long time now analysed language as a system with a collective value .
The understanding as a collective totality of rules allowing such and such a knowledge to be produced in a certain period , has hardly been studied until now .
Nevertheless , it presents some fairly positive characteristics to the observer .
Take for example medicine at the end of the eighteenth century : read twenty medical works , it does n’t matter which , of the years 1770 to 1780 , then twenty others from the years 1820 to 1830 , and I would say , quite at random , that in forty or fifty years everything had changed ; what one talked about , the way one talked about it , not just the remedies , of course , not just the maladies and their classifications , but the outlook itself .
Who was responsible for that ?
Who was the author of it ?
It is artificial , I think , to say Bichat , or even to expand a little and to say the first anatomical clinicians .
It ’s a matter of a collective and complex transformation of medical understanding in its practice and its rules .
And this transformation is far from a negative phenomenon : it is the suppression of a negativity , the effacement of an obstacle , the disappearance of prejudices , the abandonment of old myths , the retreat of irrational beliefs , and access finally freed to experience and to reason ; it represents the application of an entirely new 8rille , with its choices and exclusions ; a new play with its own rules , decisions and limitations , with its own inner logic , its parameters and its blind alleys , all of which lead to the modification of the point of origin .
And it is in this functioning that the understanding itself exists .
So , if one studies the history of knowledge , one sees that there are two broad directions of analysis : according to one , one has to show how , under what conditions and for what reasons , the understanding modifies itself in its formative rules , without passing through an original “ inventor ” discovering the “ truth ” ; and according to the other , one has to show how the working of the rules of an understanding can produce in an individual new and unpublished knowledge .
Here my aim rejoins , with imperfect methods and in a quite inferior mode , Mr. Chomsky ’s project : accounting for the fact that with a few rules or definite elements , unknown totalities , never even produced , can be brought to light by individuals .
To resolve this problem , Mr. Chomsky has to reintroduce the dilemma of the subject in the field of grammatical analysis .
To resolve an analogous problem in the field of history with which I am involved , one has to do the opposite , in a way : to introduce the point of view of understanding , of its rules , of its systems , of its transformations of totalities in the game of individual knowledge .
Here and there the problem of creativity cannot be resolved in the same way , or rather , it ca n’t be formulated in the same terms , given the state of disciplines inside which it is put .
CHOMSKY :
I think in part we ’re slightly talking at cross-purposes , because of a different use of the term creativity .
In fact , I should say that my use of the term creativity is a little bit idiosyncratic and therefore the onus falls on me in this case , not on you .
But when I speak of creativity , I ’m not attributing to the concept the notion of value that is normal when we speak of creativity .
That is , when you speak of scientific creativity , you ’re speaking , properly , of the achievements of a Newton .
But in the context in which I have been speaking about creativity , it ’s a normal human act .
I ’m speaking of the kind of creativity that any child demonstrates when he ’s able to come to grips with a new situation : to describe it properly , react to it properly , tell one something about it , think about it in a new fashion for him and so on .
I think it ’s appropriate to call those acts creative , but of course without thinking of those acts as being the acts of a Newton .
In fact it may very well be true that creativity in the arts or the sciences , that which goes beyond the normal , may really involve properties of , well , I would also say of human nature , which may not exist fully developed in the mass of mankind , and may not constitute part of the normal creativity of everyday life .
Now my belief is that science can look forward to the problem of normal creativity as a topic that it can perhaps incorporate within itself .
But I do n’t believe , and I suspect you will agree , that science can look forward , at least in the reasonable future , to coming to grips with true creativity , the achievements of the great artist and the great scientist .
It has no hope of accommodating these unique phenomena within its grasp .
It ’s the lower levels of creativity that I ’ve been speaking of .
Now , as far as what you say about the history of science is concerned , I think that ’s correct and illuminating and particularly relevant in fact to the kinds of enterprise that I see lying before us in psychology and linguistics and the philosophy of the mind .
That is , I think there are certain topics that have been repressed or put aside during the scientific advances of the past few centuries .
For example , this concern with low - level creativity that I ’m referring to was really present in Descartes also .
For example , when he speaks of the difference between a parrot , who can mimic what is said , and a human , who can say new things that are appropriate to the situation , and when he specifies that as being the distinctive property that designates the limits of physics and carries us into the science of the mind , to use modern terms , I think he really is referring to the kind of creativity that I have in mind ; and I quite agree with your comments about the other sources of such notions .
Well , these concepts , even in fact the whole notion of the organisation of sentence structure , were put aside during the period of great advances that followed from Sir William Jones and others and the development of comparative philology as a whole .
But now , I think , we can go beyond that period when it was necessary to forget and to pretend that these phenomena did not exist and to turn to something else .
In this period of comparative philology and also , in my view , structural linguistics , and much of behavioural psychology , and in fact much of what grows out of the empiricist tradition in the study of mind and behaviour , it is possible to put aside those limitations and bring into our consideration just those topics that animated a good deal of the thinking and speculation of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and to incorporate them within a much broader and I think deeper science of man that will give a fuller role - though it is certainly not expected to give a complete understanding to such notions as innovation and creativity and freedom and the production of new entities , new elements of thought and behaviour within some system of rule and schematism .
Those are concepts that I think we can come to grips with .
ELDERS :
Well , may I first of all ask you not to make your answers so lengthy ?
[ Foucault laughs . ]
When you discuss creativity and freedom , I think that one of the misunderstandings , if any misunderstandings have arisen , has to do with the fact that Mr. Chomsky is starting from a limited number of rules with infinite possibilities of application , whereas you , Mr. Foucault , are stressing the inevitability of the “ grille ” of our historical and psychological determinisms , which also applies to the way in which we discover new ideas .
Perhaps we can sort this out , not by analysing the scientific process , but just by analysing our own thought process .
When you discover a new fundamental idea , Mr. Foucault , do you believe , that as far as your own personal creativity is concerned something is happening that makes you feel that you are being liberated ; that something new has been developed ?
Perhaps afterwards you discover that it was not so new .
But do you yourself believe that , within your own personality , creativity and freedom are working together , or not ?
FOUCAULT :
Oh , you know , I do n’t believe that the problem of personal experience is so very important …
ELDERS :
Why not ?
FOUCAULT :
… in a question like this .
No , I believe that there is in reality quite a strong similarity between what Mr. Chomsky said and what I tried to show : in other words there exist in fact only possible creations , possible innovations .
One can only , in terms of language or of knowledge , produce something new by putting into play a certain number of rules which will define the acceptability or the grammaticality of these statements , or which will define , in the case of knowledge , the scientific character of the statements .
Thus , we can roughly say that linguists before Mr. Chomsky mainly insisted on the rules of construction of statements and less on the innovation represented by every new statement , or the hearing of a new statement .
And in the history of science or in the history of thought , we placed more emphasis on individual creation , and we had kept aside and left in the shadows these communal , general rules , which obscurely manifest themselves through every scientific discovery , every scientific invention , and even every philosophical innovation .
And to that degree , when I no doubt wrongly believe that I am saying something new , I am nevertheless conscious of the fact that in my statement there are rules at work , not only linguistic rules , but also epistemological rules , and those rules characterise contemporary knowledge .
CHOMSKY :
Well , perhaps I can try to react to those comments within my own framework in a way which will maybe shed some light on this .
Let ’s think again of a human child , who has in his mind some schematism that determines the kind of language he can learn .
Okay .
And then , given experience , he very quickly knows the language , of which this experience is a part , or in which it is included .
Now this is a normal act ; that is , it ’s an act of normal intelligence , but it ’s a highly creative act .
If a Martian were to look at this process of acquiring this vast and complicated and intricate system of knowledge on the basis of this ridiculously small quantity of data , he would think of it as an immense act of invention and creation .
In fact , a Martian would , I think , consider it as much of an achievement as the invention of , let ’s say , any aspect of a physical theory on the basis of the data that was presented to the physicist .
However , if this hypothetical Martian were then to observe that every normal human child immediately carries out this creative act and they all do it in the same way and without any difficulty , whereas it takes centuries of genius to slowly carry out the creative act of going from evidence to a scientific theory , then this Martian would , if he were rational , conclude that the structure of the knowledge that is acquired in the case of language is basically internal to the human mind ; whereas the structure of physics is not , in so direct a way , internal to the human mind .
Our minds are not constructed so that when we look at the phenomena of the world theoretical physics comes forth , and we write it down and produce it ; that ’s not the way our minds are constructed .
Nevertheless , I think there is a possible point of connection and it might be useful to elaborate it : that is , how is it that we are able to construct any kind of scientific theory at all ?
How is it that , given a small amount of data , it ’s possible for various scientists , for various geniuses even , over a long period of time , to arrive at some kind of a theory , at least in some cases , that is more or less profound and more or less empirically adequate ?
This is a remarkable fact .
And , in fact , if it were not the case that these scientists , including the geniuses , were beginning with a very narrow limitation on the class of possible scientific theories , if they did n’t have built into their minds somehow an obviously unconscious specification of what is a possible scientific theory , then this inductive leap would certainly be quite impossible : just as if each child did not have built into his mind the concept of human language in a very restricted way , then the inductive leap from data to knowledge of a language would be impossible .
So even though the process of , let ’s say , deriving knowledge of physics from data is far more complex , far more difficult for an organism such as ours , far more drawn out in time , requiring intervention of genius and so on and so forth , nevertheless in a certain sense the achievement of discovering physical science or biology or whatever you like , is based on something rather similar to the achievement of the normal child in discovering the structure of his language : that is , it must be achieved on the basis of an initial limitation , an initial restriction on the class of possible theories .
If you did n’t begin by knowing that only certain things are possible theories , then no induction would be possible at all .
You could go from data anywhere , in any direction .
And the fact that science converges and progresses itself shows us that such initial limitations and structures exist .
If we really want to develop a theory of scientific creation , or for that matter artistic creation , I think we have to focus attention precisely on that set of conditions that , on the one hand , delimits and restricts the scope of our possible knowledge , while at the same time permitting the inductive leap to complicated systems of knowledge on the basis of a small amount of data .
That , it seems to me , would be the way to progress towards a theory of scientific creativity , or in fact towards any question of epistemology .
ELDERS :
Well , I think if we take this point of the initial limitation with all its creative possibilities , I have the impression that for Mr. Chomsky rules and freedom are not opposed to each other , but more or less imply each other .
Whereas I get the impression that it is just the reverse for you , Mr. Foucault .
What are your reasons for putting it the opposite way , for this really is a very fundamental point in the debate , and I hope we can elaborate it .
To formulate the same problem in other terms : can you think of universal knowledge without any form of repression ?
FOUCAULT :
Well , in what Mr. Chomsky has just said there is something which seems to me to create a little difficulty ; perhaps I understood it badly .
I believe that you have been talking about a limited number of possibilities in the order of a scientific theory .
That is true if you limit yourself to a fairly short period of time , whatever it may be .
But if you consider a longer period , it seems to me that what is striking is the proliferation of possibilities by divergences .
For a long time the idea has existed that the sciences , knowledge , followed a certain line of “ progress ” , obeying the principle of “ growth ” , and the principle of the convergence of all these kinds of knowledge .
And yet when one sees how the European understanding , which turned out to be a world - wide and universal understanding in a historical and geographical sense , developed , can one say that there has been growth ?
I , myself , would say that it has been much more a matter of transformation .
Take , as an example , animal and plant classifications .
How often have they not been rewritten since the Middle Ages according to completely different rules : by symbolism , by natural history , by comparative anatomy , by the theory of evolution .
Each time this rewriting makes the knowledge completely different in its functions , in its economy , in its internal relations .
You have there a principle of divergence , much more than one of growth .
I would much rather say that there are many different ways of making possible simultaneously a few types of knowledge .
There is , therefore , from a certain point of view , always an excess of data in relation to possible systems in a given period , which causes them to be experienced within their boundaries , even in their deficiency , which means that one fails to realise their creativity ; and from another point of view , that of the historian , there is an excess , a proliferation of systems for a small amount of data , from which originates the widespread idea that it is the discovery of new facts which determines movement in the history of science .
CHOMSKY :
Here perhaps again , let me try to synthesise a bit .
I agree with your conception of scientific progress ; that is , I do n’t think that scientific progress is simply a matter of the accumulated addition of new knowledge and the absorption of new theories and so on .
Rather I think that it has this sort of jagged pattern that you describe , forgetting certain problems and leaping to new theories . .
FOUCAULT :
And transforming the same knowledge .
CHOMSKY :
Right .
But I think that one can perhaps hazard an explanation for that .
Oversimplifying grossly , I really do n’t mean what I ’m going to say now literally , one might suppose that the following general lines of an explanation are accurate : it is as if , as human beings of a particular biologically given organisation , we have in our heads , to start with , a certain set of possible intellectual structures , possible sciences .
Okay ?
Now , in the lucky event that some aspect of reality happens to have the character of one of these structures in our mind , then we have a science : that is to say that , fortunately , the structure of our mind and the structure of some aspect of reality coincide sufficiently so that we develop an intelligible science .
It is precisely this initial limitation in our minds to a certain kind of possible science which provides the tremendous richness and creativity of scientific knowledge .
It is important to stress - and this has to do with your point about limitation and freedom - that were it not for these limitations , we would not have the creative act of going from a little bit of knowledge , a little bit of experience , to a rich and highly articulated and complicated array of knowledge .
Because if anything could be possible , then nothing would be possible .
But it is precisely because of this property of our minds , which in detail we do n’t understand , but which , I think , in a general way we can begin to perceive , which presents us with certain possible intelligible structures , and which in the course of history and insight and experience begin to come into focus or fall out of focus and so on ; it is precisely because of this property of our minds that the progress of science , I think , has this erratic and jagged character that you describe .
That does n’t mean that everything is ultimately going to fall within the domain of science .
Personally I believe that many of the things we would like to understand , and maybe the things we would most like to understand , such as the nature of man , or the nature of a decent society , or lots of other things , might really fall outside the scope of possible human science .
ELDERS :
Well , I think that we are confronted again with the question of the inner relation between limitation and freedom .
Do you agree , Mr. Foucault , with the statement about the combination of limitation , fundamental limitation ? .
FOUCAULT :
It is not a matter of combination .
Only creativity is possible in putting into play of a system of rules ; it is not a mixture of order and freedom .
Where perhaps I do n’t completely agree with Mr. Chomsky , is when he places the principle of these regularities , in a way , in the interior of the mind or of human nature .
If it is a matter of whether these rules are effectively put to work by the human mind , all right ; all right , too , if it is a question of whether the historian and the linguist can think it in their turn ; it is all right also to say that these rules should allow us to realise what is said or thought by these individuals .
But to say that these regularities are connected , as conditions of existence , to the human mind or its nature , is difficult for me to accept : it seems to me that one must , before reaching that point - and in any case I am talking only about the understanding - replace it in the field of other human practices , such as economics , technology , politics , sociology , which can serve them as conditions of formation , of models , of place , of apparition , etc .
I would like to know whether one cannot discover the system of regularity , of constraint , which makes science possible , somewhere else , even outside the human mind , in social forms , in the relations of production , in the class struggles , etc .
For example , the fact that at a certain time madness became an object for scientific study , and an object of knowledge in the West , seems to me to be linked to a particular economic and social situation .
Perhaps the point of difference between Mr. Chomsky and myself is that when he speaks of science he probably thinks of the formal organisation of knowledge , whereas I am speaking of knowledge itself , that is to say , I think of the content of various knowledges which is dispersed into a particular society , permeates through that society , and asserts itself as the foundation for education , for theories , for practices , etc .
ELDERS :
But what does this theory of knowledge mean for your theme of the death of man or the end of the period of the nineteenth - twentieth centuries ?
FOUCAULT :
But this does n’t have any relation to what we are talking about .
ELDERS :
I do n’t know , because I was trying to apply what you have said to your anthropological notion .
You have already refused to speak about your own creativity and freedom , have n’t you ?
Well , I ’m wondering what are the psychological reasons for this .
FOUCAULT :
[ Protesting . ]
Well , you can wonder about it , but I ca n’t help that .
ELDERS :
Ah , well .
FOUCAULT :
I am not wondering about it .
ELDERS :
But what are the objective reasons , in relation to your conception of understanding , of knowledge , of science , for refusing to answer these personal questions ?
When there is a problem for you to answer , what are your reasons for making a problem out of a personal question ?
FOUCAULT :
No , I ’m not making a problem out of a personal question ; I make of a personal question an absence of a problem .
Let me take a very simple example , which I will not analyse , but which is this :
How was it possible that men began , at the end of the eighteenth century , for the first time in the history of Western thought and of Western knowledge , to open up the corpses of people in order to know what was the source , the origin , the anatomical needle , of the particular malady which was responsible for their deaths ?
The idea seems simple enough .
Well , four or five thousand years of medicine in the West were needed before we had the idea of looking for the cause of the malady in the lesion of a corpse .
If you tried to explain this by the personality of Bichat , I believe that would be without interest .
If , on the contrary , you tried to establish the place of disease and of death in society at the end of the eighteenth century , and what interest industrial society effectively had in quadrupling the entire population in order to expand and develop itself , as a result of which medical surveys of society were made , big hospitals were opened , etc. ; if you tried to find out how medical knowledge became institutionalised in that period , how its relations with other kinds of knowledge were ordered , well , then you could see how the relationship between disease , the hospitalised , ill person , the corpse , and pathological anatomy were made possible .
Here is , I believe , a form of analysis which I do n’t say is new , but which in any case has been much too neglected ; and personal events have almost nothing to do with it .
ELDERS :
Yes , but nevertheless it would have been very interesting for us to know a little bit more about your arguments to refute this .
Could you , Mr. Chomsky - and as far as I ’m concerned , it ’s my last question about this philosophical part of the debate - give your ideas about , for example , the way the social sciences are working ?
I ’m thinking here especially about your severe attacks on behaviourism .
And perhaps you could even explain a little the way Mr. Foucault is now working in a more or less behaviouristic way .
[ Both philosophers laugh . ]
CHOMSKY :
I would like to depart from your injunction very briefly , just to make one comment about what Mr. Foucault just said .
I think that illustrates very nicely the way in which we ’re digging into the mountain from opposite directions , to use your original image .
That is , I think that an act of scientific creation depends on two facts : one , some intrinsic property of the mind , another , some set of social and intellectual conditions that exist .
And it is not a question , as I see it , of which of these we should study ; rather we will understand scientific discovery , and similarly any other kind of discovery , when we know what these factors are and can therefore explain how they interact in a particular fashion .
My particular interest , in this connection at least , is with the intrinsic capacities of the mind ; yours , as you say , is in the particular arrangement of social and economic and other conditions .
FOUCAULT :
But I do n’t believe that difference is connected to our characters - because at this moment it would make Mr. Elders right , and he must not be right .
CHOMSKY :
No , I agree , and …
FOUCAULT :
It ’s connected to the state of knowledge , of knowing , in which we are working .
The linguistics with which you have been familiar , and which you have succeeded in transforming , excluded the importance of the creative subject , of the creative speaking subject ; while the history of science such as it existed when people of my generation were starting to work , on the contrary , exalted individual creativity . .
CHOMSKY :
Yes .
FOUCAULT :
… and put aside these collective rules .
CHOMSKY :
Yes , yes .
QUESTION :
Ah …
ELDERS :
Yes , please go on .
QUESTION :
It goes a bit back in your discussion , but what I should like to know , Mr. Chomsky , is this : you suppose a basic system of what must be in a way elementary limitations that are present in what you call human nature ; to what extent do you think these are subject to historical change ?
Do you think , for instance , that they have changed substantially since , let ’s say , the seventeenth century ?
In that case , you could perhaps connect this with the ideas of Mr. Foucault ?
CHOMSKY :
Well , I think that as a matter of biological and anthropological fact , the nature of human intelligence certainly has not changed in any substantial way , at least since the seventeenth century , or probably since Cro-Magnon man .
That is , I think that the fundamental properties of our intelligence , those that are within the domain of what we are discussing tonight , are certainly very ancient ; and that if you took a man from five thousand or maybe twenty thousand years ago , and placed him as a child within today ’s society , he would learn what everyone else learns , and he would be a genius or a fool or something else , but he would n’t be fundamentally different .
But , of course , the level of acquired knowledge changes , social conditions change - those conditions that permit a person to think freely and break through the bonds of , let ’s say , superstitious constraint .
And as those conditions change , a given human intelligence will progress to new forms of creation .
In fact this relates very closely to the last question that Mr. Elders put , if I can perhaps say a word about that .
Take behavioural science , and think of it in these contexts .
It seems to me that the fundamental property of behaviourism , which is in a way suggested by the odd term behavioural science , is that it is a negation of the possibility of developing a scientific theory .
That is , what defines behaviourism is the very curious and self - destructive assumption that you are not permitted to create an interesting theory .
If physics , for example , had made the assumption that you have to keep to phenomena and their arrangement and such things , we would be doing Babylonian astronomy today .
Fortunately physicists never made this ridiculous , extraneous assumption , which has its own historical reasons and had to do with all sorts of curious facts about the historical context in which behaviourism evolved .
But looking at it purely intellectually , behaviourism is the arbitrary insistence that one must not create a scientific theory of human behaviour ; rather one must deal directly with phenomena and their interrelation , and no more something which is totally impossible in any other domain , and I assume impossible in the domain of human intelligence or human behaviour as well .
So in this sense I do n’t think that behaviourism is a science .
Here is a case in point of just the kind of thing that you mentioned and that Mr. Foucault is discussing : under certain historical circumstances , for example those in which experimental psychology developed , it was - for some reason which I wo n’t go into - interesting and maybe important to impose some very strange limitations on the kind of scientific theory construction that was permitted , and those very strange limitations are known as behaviourism .
Well , it has long since run its course , I think .
Whatever value it may have had in 1880 , it has no function today except constraining and limiting scientific inquiry and should therefore simply be dispensed with , in the same way one would dispense with a physicist who said : you ’re not allowed to develop a general physical theory , you ’re only allowed to plot the motions of the planets and make up more epicycles and so on and so forth .
One forgets about that and puts it aside .
Similarly one should put aside the very curious restrictions that define behaviourism ; restrictions which are , as I said before , very much suggested by the term behavioural science itself .
We can agree , perhaps , that behaviour in some broad sense constitutes the data for the science of man .
But to define a science by its data would be to define physics as the theory of meter - readings .
And if a physicist were to say : yes , I ’m involved in meter - reading science , we could be pretty sure that he was not going to get very far .
They might talk about meter - readings and correlations between them and such things , but they would n’t ever create physical theory .
And so the term itself is symptomatic of the disease in this case .
We should understand the historical context in which these curious limitations developed , and having understood them , I believe , discard them and proceed in the science of man as we would in any other domain , that is by discarding entirely behaviourism and in fact , in my view , the entire empiricist tradition from which it evolved .
QUESTION :
So you are not willing to link your theory about innate limitations , with Mr. Foucault ’s theory of the “ grille ” .
There might be a certain connection .
You see , Mr. Foucault says that an upsurge of creativity in a certain direction automatically removes knowledge in another direction , by a system of “ grilles ” .
Well , if you had a changing system of limitations , this might be connected .
CHOMSKY :
Well , the reason for what he describes , I think , is different .
Again , I ’m oversimplifying .
We have more possible sciences available intellectually .
When we try out those intellectual constructions in a changing world of fact , we will not find cumulative growth .
What we will find are strange leaps : here is a domain of phenomena , a certain science applies very nicely ; now slightly broaden the range of phenomena , then another science , which is very different , happens to apply very beautifully , perhaps leaving out some of these other phenomena .
Okay , that ’s scientific progress and that leads to the omission or forgetting of certain domains .
But I think the reason for this is precisely this set of principles , which unfortunately , we do n’t know , which makes the whole discussion rather abstract , which defines for us what is a possible intellectual structure , a possible deep - science , if you like .
ELDERS :
Well , let ’s move over now to the second part of the discussion , to politics .
First of all I would like to ask Mr. Foucault why he is so interested in politics , because he told me that in fact he likes politics much more than philosophy .
FOUCAULT :
I ’ve never concerned myself , in any case , with philosophy .
But that is not a problem .
[ He laughs . )
Your question is : why am I so interested in politics ?
But if I were to answer you very simply , I would say this : why should n’t I be interested ?
That is to say , what blindness , what deafness , what density of ideology would have to weigh me down to prevent me from being interested in what is probably the most crucial subject to our existence , that is to say the society in which we live , the economic relations within which it functions , and the system of power which defines the regular forms and the regular permissions and prohibitions of our conduct .
The essence of our life consists , after all , of the political functioning of the society in which we find ourselves .
So I ca n’t answer the question of why I should be interested ; I could only answer it by asking why should n’t I be interested ?
ELDERS :
You are obliged to be interested , is n’t that so ?
FOUCAULT :
Yes , at least , there is n’t anything odd here which is worth question or answer .
Not to be interested in politics , that ’s what constitutes a problem .
So instead of asking me , you should ask someone who is not interested in politics and then your question would be well - founded , and you would have the right to say “ Why , damn it , are you not interested ? ”
[ They lau8h and the audience laughs . ]
ELDERS :
Well , yes , perhaps .
Mr. Chomsky , we are all very interested to know your political objectives , especially in relation to your well - known anarcho - syndicalism or , as you formulated it , libertarian socialism .
What are the most important goals of your libertarian socialism ?
CHOMSKY :
I ’ll overcome the urge to answer the earlier very interesting question that you asked me and turn to this one .
Let me begin by referring to something that we have already discussed , that is , if it is correct , as I believe it is , that a fundamental element of human nature is the need for creative work , for creative inquiry , for free creation without the arbitrary limiting effect of coercive institutions , then , of course , it will follow that a decent society should maximise the possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be realised .
That means trying to overcome the elements of repression and oppression and destruction and coercion that exist in any existing society , ours for example , as a historical residue .
Now any form of coercion or repression , any form of autocratic control of some domain of existence , let ’s say , private ownership of capital or state control of some aspects of human life , any such autocratic restriction on some area of human endeavour , can be justified , if at all , only in terms of the need for subsistence , or the need for survival , or the need for defence against some horrible fate or something of that sort .
It can not be justified intrinsically .
Rather it must be overcome and eliminated .
And I think that , at least in the technologically advanced societies of the West we are now certainly in a position where meaningless drudgery can very largely be eliminated , and to the marginal extent that it ’s necessary , can be shared among the population ; where centralised autocratic control of , in the first place , economic institutions , by which I mean either private capitalism or state totalitarianism or the various mixed forms of state capitalism that exist here and there , has become a destructive vestige of history .
They are all vestiges that have to be overthrown , eliminated in favour of direct participation in the form of workers ’ councils or other free associations that individuals will constitute themselves for the purpose of their social existence and their productive labour .
Now a federated , decentralised system of free associations , incorporating economic as well as other social institutions , would be what I refer to as anarcho - syndicalism ; and it seems to me that this is the appropriate form of social organisation for an advanced technological society , in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools , of cogs in the machine .
There is no longer any social necessity for human beings to be treated as mechanical elements in the productive process ; that can be overcome and we must overcome it by a society of freedom and free association , in which the creative urge that I consider intrinsic to human nature , will in fact be able to realise itself in whatever way it will .
And again , like Mr. Foucault , I do n’t see how any human being can fail to be interested in this question .
[ Foucault laughs . ]
ELDERS :
Do you believe , Mr. Foucault , that we can call our societies in anyway democratic , after listening to this statement from Mr. Chomsky ?
FOUCAULT :
No , I do n’t have the least belief that one could consider our society democratic .
[ Laughs . ]
If one understands by democracy the effective exercise of power by a population which is neither divided nor hierarchically ordered in classes , it is quite clear that we are very far from democracy .
It is only too clear that we are living under a regime of a dictatorship of class , of a power of class which imposes itself by violence , even when the instruments of this violence are institutional and constitutional ; and to that degree , there is n’t any question of democracy for us .
Well .
When you asked me why I was interested in politics , I refused to answer because it seemed evident to me , but perhaps your question was :
How am I interested in it ?
And had you asked me that question , and in a certain sense I could say you have , I would say to you that I am much less advanced in my way ; I go much less far than Mr. Chomsky .
That is to say that I admit to not being able to define , nor for even stronger reasons to propose , an ideal social model for the functioning of our scientific or technological society .
On the other hand , one of the tasks that seems immediate and urgent to me , over and above anything else , is this : that we should indicate and show up , even where they are hidden , all the relationships of political power which actually control the social body and oppress or repress it .
What I want to say is this : it is the custom , at least in European society , to consider that power is localised in the hands of the government and that it is exercised through a certain number of particular institutions , such as the administration , the police , the army , and the apparatus of the state .
One knows that all these institutions are made to elaborate and to transmit a certain number of decisions , in the name of the nation or of the state , to have them applied and to punish those who do n’t obey .
But I believe that political power also exercises itself through the mediation of a certain number of institutions which look as if they have nothing in common with the political power , and as if they are independent of it , while they are not .
One knows this in relation to the family ; and one knows that the university and in a general way , all teaching systems , which appear simply to disseminate knowledge , are made to maintain a certain social class in power ; and to exclude the instruments of power of another social class .
Institutions of knowledge , of foresight and care , such as medicine , also help to support the political power .
It ’s also obvious , even to the point of scandal , in certain cases related to psychiatry .
It seems to me that the real political task in a society such as ours is to criticise the workings of institutions , which appear to be both neutral and independent ; to criticise and attack them in such a manner that the political violence which has always exercised itself obscurely through them will be unmasked , so that one can fight against them .
This critique and this fight seem essential to me for different reasons : firstly , because political power goes much deeper than one suspects ; there are centres and invisible , little - known points of support ; its true resistance , its true solidity is perhaps where one does n’t expect it .
Probably it ’s insufficient to say that behind the governments , behind the apparatus of the State , there is the dominant class ; one must locate the point of activity , the places and forms in which its domination is exercised .
And because this domination is not simply the expression in political terms of economic exploitation , it is its instrument and , to a large extent , the condition which makes it possible ; the suppression of the one is achieved through the exhaustive discernment of the other .
Well , if one fails to recognise these points of support of class power , one risks allowing them to continue to exist ; and to see this class power reconstitute itself even after an apparent revolutionary process .
CHOMSKY :
Yes , I would certainly agree with that , not only in theory but also in action .
That is , there are two intellectual tasks : one , and the one that I was discussing , is to try to create the vision of a future just society ; that is to create , if you like , a humanistic social theory that is based , if possible , on some firm and humane concept of the human essence or human nature .
That ’s one task .
Another task is to understand very clearly the nature of power and oppression and terror and destruction in our own society .
And that certainly includes the institutions you mentioned , as well as the central institutions of any industrial society , namely the economic , commercial and financial institutions and in particular , in the coming period , the great multi-national corporations , which are not very far from us physically tonight [ i.e. Philips at Eindhoven ] .
Those are the basic institutions of oppression and coercion and autocratic rule that appear to be neutral despite everything they say : well , we ’re subject to the democracy of the market place , and that must be understood precisely in terms of their autocratic power , including the particular form of autocratic control that comes from the domination of market forces in an inegalitarian society .
Surely we must understand these facts , and not only understand them but combat them .
And in fact , as far as one ’s own political involvements are concerned , in which one spends the majority of one ’s energy and effort , it seems to me that they must certainly be in that area .
I do n’t want to get personal about it , but my own certainly are in that area , and I assume everyone ’s are .
Still , I think it would be a great shame to put aside entirely the somewhat more abstract and philosophical task of trying to draw the connections between a concept of human nature that gives full scope to freedom and dignity and creativity and other fundamental human characteristics , and to relate that to some notion of social structure in which those properties could be realised and in which meaningful human life could take place .
And in fact , if we are thinking of social transformation or social revolution , though it would be absurd , of course , to try to sketch out in detail the goal that we are hoping to reach , still we should know something about where we think we are going , and such a theory may tell it to us .
FOUCAULT :
Yes , but then is n’t there a danger here ?
If you say that a certain human nature exists , that this human nature has not been given in actual society the rights and the possibilities which allow it to realise itself … that ’s really what you have said , I believe .
CHOMSKY :
Yes .
FOUCAULT :
And if one admits that , does n’t one risk defining this human nature which is at the same time ideal and real , and has been hidden and repressed until now – in terms borrowed from our society , from our civilisation , from our culture ?
I will take an example by greatly simplifying it .
The socialism of a certain period , at the end of the nineteenth century , and the beginning of the twentieth century , admitted in effect that in capitalist societies man had n’t realised the full potential for his development and self - realisation ; that human nature was effectively alienated in the capitalist system .
And it dreamed of an ultimately liberated human nature .
What model did it use to conceive , project , and eventually realise that human nature ?
It was in fact the bourgeois model .
It considered that an alienated society was a society which , for example , gave pride of place to the benefit of all , to a sexuality of a bourgeois type , to a family of a bourgeois type , to an aesthetic of a bourgeois type .
And it is moreover very true that this has happened in the Soviet Union and in the popular democracies : a kind of society has been reconstituted which has been transposed from the bourgeois society of the nineteenth century .
The universalisation of the model of the bourgeois has been the utopia which has animated the constitution of Soviet society .
The result is that you too realised , I think , that it is difficult to say exactly what human nature is .
Is n’t there a risk that we will be led into error ?
Mao Tse - Tung spoke of bourgeois human nature and proletarian human nature , and he considers that they are not the same thing .
CHOMSKY :
Well , you see , I think that in the intellectual domain of political action , that is the domain of trying to construct a vision of a just and free society on the basis of some notion of human nature , we face the very same problem that we face in immediate political action , namely , that of being impelled to do something , because the problems are so great , and yet knowing that whatever we do is on the basis of a very partial understanding of the social realities , and the human realities in this case .
For example , to be quite concrete , a lot of my own activity really has to do with the Vietnam War , and some of my own energy goes into civil disobedience .
Well , civil disobedience in the U.S. is an action undertaken in the face of considerable uncertainties about its effects .
For example , it threatens the social order in ways which might , one might argue , bring about fascism ; and that would be a very bad thing for America , for Vietnam , for Holland and for everyone else .
You know , if a great Leviathan like the United States were really to become fascist , a lot of problems would result ; so that is one danger in undertaking this concrete act .
On the other hand there is a great danger in not undertaking it , namely , if you do n’t undertake it , the society of Indo - China will be torn to shreds by American power .
In the face of these uncertainties one has to choose a course of action .
Well , similarly in the intellectual domain , one is faced with the uncertainties that you correctly pose .
Our concept of human nature is certainly limited ; it ’s partially socially conditioned , constrained by our own character defects and the limitations of the intellectual culture in which we exist .
Yet at the same time it is of critical importance that we know what impossible goals we ’re trying to achieve , if we hope to achieve some of the possible goals .
And that means that we have to be bold enough to speculate and create social theories on the basis of partial knowledge , while remaining very open to the strong possibility , and in fact overwhelming probability , that at least in some respects we ’re very far off the mark .
ELDERS :
Well , perhaps it would be interesting to delve a little deeper into this problem of strategy .
I suppose that what you call civil disobedience is probably the same as what we call extra-parliamentary action ?
CHOMSKY :
No , I think it goes beyond that .
Extra - parliamentary action would include , let ’s say , a mass legal demonstration , but civil disobedience is narrower than all extra- parliamentary action , in that it means direct defiance of what is alleged , incorrectly in my view , by the state to be law .
ELDERS :
So , for example , in the case of Holland , we had something like a population census .
One was obliged to answer questions on official forms .
You would call it civil disobedience if one refused to fill in the forms ?
CHOMSKY :
Right .
I would be a little bit careful about that , because , going back to a very important point that Mr. Foucault made , one does not necessarily allow the state to define what is legal .
Now the state has the power to enforce a certain concept of what is legal , but power does n’t imply justice or even correctness , so that the state may define something as civil disobedience and may be wrong in doing so .
For example , in the United States the state defines it as civil disobedience to , let ’s say , derail an ammunition train that ’s going to Vietnam ; and the state is wrong in defining that as civil disobedience , because it ’s legal and proper and should be done .
It ’s proper to carry out actions that will prevent the criminal acts of the state , just as it is proper to violate a traffic ordinance in order to prevent a murder .
If I had stopped my car in front of a traffic light which was red , and then I drove through the red traffic light to prevent somebody from , let ’s say , machine - gunning a group of people , of course that ’s not an illegal act , it ’s an appropriate and proper action ; no sane judge would convict you for such an action .
Similarly , a good deal of what the state authorities define as civil disobedience is not really civil disobedience : in fact , it ’s legal , obligatory behaviour in violation of the commands of the state , which may or may not be legal commands .
So one has to be rather careful about calling things illegal , I think .
FOUCAULT :
Yes , but I would like to ask you a question .
When , in the United States , you commit an illegal act , do you justify it in terms of justice or of a superior legality , or do you justify it by the necessity of the class struggle , which is at the present time essential for the proletariat in their struggle against the ruling class ?
CHOMSKY :
Well , here I would like to take the point of view which is taken by the American Supreme Court and probably other courts in such circumstances ; that is , to try to settle the issue on the narrowest possible grounds .
I would think that ultimately it would make very good sense , in many cases , to act against the legal institutions of a given society , if in so doing you ’re striking at the sources of power and oppression in that society .
However , to a very large extent existing law represents certain human values , which are decent human values ; and existing law , correctly interpreted , permits much of what the state commands you not to do .
And I think it ’s important to exploit the fact …
FOUCAULT :
Yeah .
CHOMSKY :
… it ’s important to exploit the areas of law which are properly formulated and then perhaps to act directly against those areas of law which simply ratify some system of power .
FOUCAULT :
But , but , I , I …
CHOMSKY :
Let me get …
FOUCAULT :
My question , my question was this : when you commit a clearly illegal act …
CHOMSKY :
… which I regard as illegal , not just the state .
FOUCAULT :
No , no , well , the state ’s …
CHOMSKY :
… that the state regards as illegal …
FOUCAULT :
… that the state considers as illegal .
CHOMSKY :
Yeah .
FOUCAULT :
Are you committing this act in virtue of an ideal justice , or because the class struggle makes it useful and necessary ?
Do you refer to ideal justice , that ’s my problem .
CHOMSKY :
Again , very often when I do something which the state regards as illegal , I regard it as legal : that is , I regard the state as criminal .
But in some instances that ’s not true .
Let me be quite concrete about it and move from the area of class war to imperialist war , where the situation is somewhat clearer and easier .
Take international law , a very weak instrument as we know , but nevertheless one that incorporates some very interesting principles .
Well , international law is , in many respects , the instrument of the powerful : it is a creation of states and their representatives .
In developing the presently existing body of international law , there was no participation by mass movements of peasants .
The structure of international law reflects that fact ; that is , international law permits much too wide a range of forceful intervention in support of existing power structures that define themselves as states against the interests of masses of people who happen to be organised in opposition to states .
Now that ’s a fundamental defect of international law and I think one is justified in opposing that aspect of international law as having no validity , as having no more validity than the divine right of kings .
It ’s simply an instrument of the powerful to retain their power .
But , in fact , international law is not solely of that kind .
And in fact there are interesting elements of international law , for example , embedded in the Nuremberg principles and the United Nations Charter , which permit , in fact , I believe , require the citizen to act against his own state in ways which the state will falsely regard as criminal .
Nevertheless , he ’s acting legally , because international law also happens to prohibit the threat or use of force in international affairs , except under some very narrow circumstances , of which , for example , the war in Vietnam is not one .
This means that in the particular case of the Vietnam War , which interests me most , the American state is acting in a criminal capacity .
And the people have the right to stop criminals from committing murder .
Just because the criminal happens to call your action illegal when you try to stop him , it does n’t mean it is illegal .
A perfectly clear case of that is the present case of the Pentagon Papers in the United States , which , I suppose , you know about .
Reduced to its essentials and forgetting legalisms , what is happening is that the state is trying to prosecute people for exposing its crimes .
That ’s what it amounts to .
Now , obviously that ’s absurd , and one must pay no attention whatsoever to that distortion of any reasonable judicial process .
Furthermore , I think that the existing system of law even explains why it is absurd .
But if it did n’t , we would then have to oppose that system of law .
FOUCAULT :
So it is in the name of a purer justice that you criticise the functioning of justice ?
There is an important question for us here .
It is true that in all social struggles , there is a question of “ justice ” .
To put it more precisely , the fight against class justice , against its injustice , is always part of the social struggle : to dismiss the judges , to change the tribunals , to amnesty the condemned , to open the prisons , has always been part of social transformations as soon as they become slightly violent .
At the present time in France the function of justice and the police is the target of many attacks from those whom we call the “ gauchistes ” .
But if justice is at stake in a struggle , then it is as an instrument of power ; it is not in the hope that finally one day , in this or another society , people will be rewarded according to their merits , or punished according to their faults .
Rather than thinking of the social struggle in terms of “ justice ” , one has to emphasise justice in terms of the social struggle .
CHOMSKY :
Yeah , but surely you believe that your role in the war is a just role , that you are fighting a just war , to bring in a concept from another domain .
And that , I think , is important .
If you thought that you were fighting an unjust war , you could n’t follow that line of reasoning .
I would like to slightly reformulate what you said .
It seems to me that the difference is n’t between legality and ideal justice ; it ’s rather between legality and better justice .
I would agree that we are certainly in no position to create a system of ideal justice , just as we are in no position to create an ideal society in our minds .
We do n’t know enough and we ’re too limited and too biased and all sorts of other things .
But we are in a position - and we must act as sensitive and responsible human beings in that position to imagine and move towards the creation of a better society and also a better system of justice .
Now this better system will certainly have its defects .
But if one compares the better system with the existing system , without being confused into thinking that our better system is the ideal system , we can then argue , I think , as follows :
The concept of legality and the concept of justice are not identical ; they ’re not entirely distinct either .
Insofar as legality incorporates justice in this sense of better justice , referring to a better society , then we should follow and obey the law , and force the state to obey the law and force the great corporations to obey the law , and force the police to obey the law , if we have the power to do so .
Of course , in those areas where the legal system happens to represent not better justice , but rather the techniques of oppression that have been codified in a particular autocratic system , well , then a reasonable human being should disregard and oppose them , at least in principle ; he may not , for some reason , do it in fact .
FOUCAULT :
But I would merely like to reply to your first sentence , in which you said that if you did n’t consider the war you make against the police to be just , you would n’t make it .
I would like to reply to you in terms of Spinoza and say that the proletariat does n’t wage war against the ruling class because it considers such a war to be just .
The proletariat makes war with the ruling class because , for the first time in history , it wants to take power .
And because it will overthrow the power of the ruling class it considers such a war to be just .
CHOMSKY :
Yeah , I do n’t agree .
FOUCAULT :
One makes war to win , not because it is just .
CHOMSKY :
I do n’t , personally , agree with that .
For example , if I could convince myself that attainment of power by the proletariat would lead to a terrorist police state , in which freedom and dignity and decent human relations would be destroyed , then I would n’t want the proletariat to take power .
In fact the only reason for wanting any such thing , I believe , is because one thinks , rightly or wrongly , that some fundamental human values will be achieved by that transfer of power .
FOUCAULT :
When the proletariat takes power , it may be quite possible that the proletariat will exert towards the classes over which it has just triumphed , a violent , dictatorial and even bloody power .
I ca n’t see what objection one could make to this .
But if you ask me what would be the case if the proletariat exerted bloody , tyrannical and unjust power towards itself , then I would say that this could only occur if the proletariat had n’t really taken power , but that a class outside the proletariat , a group of people inside the proletariat , a bureaucracy or petit bourgeois elements had taken power .
CHOMSKY :
Well , I ’m not at all satisfied with that theory of revolution for a lot of reasons , historical and others .
But even if one were to accept it for the sake of argument , still that theory maintains that it is proper for the proletariat to take power and exercise it in a violent and bloody and unjust fashion , because it is claimed , and in my opinion falsely , that that will lead to a more just society , in which the state will wither away , in which the proletariat will be a universal class and so on and so forth .
If it were n’t for that future justification , the concept of a violent and bloody dictatorship of the proletariat would certainly be unjust .
Now this is another issue , but I ’m very sceptical about the idea of a violent and bloody dictatorship of the proletariat , especially when expressed by self - appointed representatives of a vanguard party , who , we have enough historical experience to know and might have predicted in advance , will simply be the new rulers over this society .
FOUCAULT :
Yes , but I have n’t been talking about the power of the proletariat , which in itself would be an unjust power ; you are right in saying that this would obviously be too easy .
I would like to say that the power of the proletariat could , in a certain period , imply violence and a prolonged war against a social class over which its triumph or victory was not yet totally assured .
CHOMSKY :
Well , look , I ’m not saying there is an absolute .. .
For example , I am not a committed pacifist .
I would not hold that it is under all imaginable circumstances wrong to use violence , even though use of violence is in some sense unjust .
I believe that one has to estimate relative justices .
But the use of violence and the creation of some degree of injustice can only be justified on the basis of the claim and the assessment - which always ought to be undertaken very , very seriously and with a good deal of scepticism that this violence is being exercised because a more just result is going to be achieved .
If it does not have such a grounding , it is really totally immoral , in my opinion .
FOUCAULT :
I do n’t think that as far as the aim which the proletariat proposes for itself in leading a class struggle is concerned , it would be sufficient to say that it is in itself a greater justice .
What the proletariat will achieve by expelling the class which is at present in power and by taking over power itself , is precisely the suppression of the power of class in general .
CHOMSKY :
Okay , but that ’s the further justification .
FOUCAULT :
That is the justification , but one does n’t speak in terms of justice but in terms of power .
CHOMSKY :
But it is in terms of justice ; it ’s because the end that will be achieved is claimed as a just one .
No Leninist or whatever you like would dare to say “ We , the proletariat , have a right to take power , and then throw everyone else into crematoria . ”
If that were the consequence of the proletariat taking power , of course it would not be appropriate .
The idea is - and for the reasons I mentioned I ’m sceptical about it - that a period of violent dictatorship , or perhaps violent and bloody dictatorship , is justified because it will mean the submergence and termination of class oppression , a proper end to achieve in human life ; it is because of that final qualification that the whole enterprise might be justified .
Whether it is or not is another issue .
FOUCAULT :
If you like , I will be a little bit Nietzschean about this ; in other words , it seems to me that the idea of justice in itself is an idea which in effect has been invented and put to work in different types of societies as an instrument of a certain political and economic power or as a weapon against that power .
But it seems to me that , in any case , the notion of justice itself functions within a society of classes as a claim made by the oppressed class and as justification for it .
CHOMSKY :
I do n’t agree with that .
FOUCAULT :
And in a classless society , I am not sure that we would still use this notion of justice .
CHOMSKY :
Well , here I really disagree .
I think there is some sort of an absolute basis–if you press me too hard I ’ll be in trouble , because I ca n’t sketch it out - ultimately residing in fundamental human qualities , in terms of which a “ real ” notion of justice is grounded .
I think it ’s too hasty to characterise our existing systems of justice as merely systems of class oppression ; I do n’t think that they are that .
I think that they embody systems of class oppression and elements of other kinds of oppression , but they also embody a kind of groping towards the true humanly , valuable concepts of justice and decency and love and kindness and sympathy , which I think are real .
And I think that in any future society , which will , of course , never be the perfect society , we ’ll have such concepts again , which we hope , will come closer to incorporating a defence of fundamental human needs , including such needs as those for solidarity and sympathy and whatever , but will probably still reflect in some manner the inequities and the elements of oppression of the existing society .
However , I think what you ’re describing only holds for a very different kind of situation .
For example , let ’s take a case of national conflict .
Here are two societies , each trying to destroy the other .
No question of justice arises .
The only question that arises is which side are you on ?
Are you going to defend your own society and destroy the other ?
I mean , in a certain sense , abstracting away from a lot of historical problems , that ’s what faced the soldiers who were massacring each other in the trenches in the First World War .
They were fighting for nothing .
They were fighting for the right to destroy each other .
And in that kind of circumstance no questions of justice arise .
And of course there were rational people , most of them in jail , like Karl Liebknecht , for example , who pointed that out and were in jail because they did so , or Bertrand Russell , to take another example on the other side .
There were people who understood that there was no point to that mutual massacre in terms of any sort of justice and that they ought to just call it off .
Now those people were regarded as madmen or lunatics and criminals or whatever , but of course they were the only sane people around .
And in such a circumstance , the kind that you describe , where there is no question of justice , just the question of who ’s going to win a struggle to the death , then I think the proper human reaction is : call it off , do n’t win either way , try to stop it - and of course if you say that , you ’ll immediately be thrown in jail or killed or something of that sort , the fate of a lot of rational people .
But I do n’t think that ’s the typical situation in human affairs , and I do n’t think that ’s the situation in the case of class - conflict or social revolution .
There I think that one can and must give an argument , if you ca n’t give an argument you should extract yourself from the struggle .
Give an argument that the social revolution that you ’re trying to achieve is in the ends of justice , is in the ends of realising fundamental human needs , not merely in the ends of putting some other group into power , because they want it .
FOUCAULT :
Well , do I have time to answer ?
ELDERS :
Yes .
FOUCAULT :
How much ?
Because . . .
ELDERS :
Two minutes .
[ Foucault laughs . ]
FOUCAULT :
But I would say that that is unjust .
[ Everybody laughs . ]
CHOMSKY :
Absolutely , yes .
FOUCAULT :
No , but I do n’t want to answer in so little time .
I would simply say this , that finally this problem of human nature , when put simply in theoretical terms , has n’t led to an argument between us ; ultimately we understand each other very well on these theoretical problems .
On the other hand , when we discussed the problem of human nature and political problems , then differences arose between us .
And contrary to what you think , you ca n’t prevent me from believing that these notions of human nature , of justice , of the realisation of the essence of human beings , are all notions and concepts which have been formed within our civilisation , within our type of knowledge and our form of philosophy , and that as a result form part of our class system ; and one can’t , however regrettable it may be , put forward these notions to describe or justify a fight which should - and shall in principle –overthrow the very fundaments of our society .
This is an extrapolation for which I can’t find the historical justification .
That ’s the point . ..
CHOMSKY :
It ’s clear .
ELDERS :
Mr. Foucault , if you were obliged to describe our actual society in pathological terms , which of its kinds of madness would most impress you ?
FOUCAULT :
In our contemporary society ?
ELDERS :
Yes .
FOUCAULT :
If I were to say with which malady contemporary society is most afflicted ?
ELDERS :
Yes .
FOUCAULT :
The definition of disease and of the insane , and the classification of the insane has been made in such a way as to exclude from our society a certain number of people .
If our society characterised itself as insane , it would exclude itself .
It pretends to do so for reasons of internal reform .
Nobody is more conservative than those people who tell you that the modern world is afflicted by nervous anxiety or schizophrenia .
It is in fact a cunning way of excluding certain people or certain patterns of behaviour .
So I do n’t think that one can , except as a metaphor or a game , validly say that our society is schizophrenic or paranoid , unless one gives these words a non-psychiatric meaning .
But if you were to push me to an extreme , I would say that our society has been afflicted by a disease , a very curious , a very paradoxical disease , for which we have n’t yet found a name ; and this mental disease has a very curious symptom , which is that the symptom itself brought the mental disease into being .
There you have it .
ELDERS :
Great .
Well , I think we can immediately start the discussion .
QUESTION :
Mr. Chomsky , I would like to ask you one question .
In your discussion you used the term “ proletariat ” ; what do you mean by “ proletariat ” in a highly developed technological society ?
I think this is a Marxist notion , which does n’t represent the exact sociological state of affairs .
CHOMSKY :
Yes , I think you are right , and that is one of the reasons why I kept hedging on that issue and saying I ’m very sceptical about the whole idea , because I think the notion of a proletariat , if we want to use it , has to be given a new interpretation fitting to our present social conditions .
Really , I ’d even like to drop the word , since it ’s so loaded with specific historical connotations , and think instead of the people who do the productive work of the society , manual and intellectual work .
I think those people should be in a position to organise the conditions of their work , and to determine the ends of their work and the uses to which it ’s put ; and , because of my concept of human nature , I really think of that as partially including everyone .
Because I think that any human being who is not physically or mentally deformed - and here I again must disagree with Monsieur Foucault and express my belief that the concept of mental illness probably does have an absolute character , to some extent at least - is not only capable of , but is insistent upon doing productive , creative work , if given the opportunity to do so .
I ’ve never seen a child who did n’t want to build something out of blocks , or learn something new , or try the next task .
And the only reason why adults are n’t like that is , I suppose , that they have been sent to school and other oppressive institutions , which have driven that out of them .
Now if that ’s the case , then the proletariat , or whatever you want to call it , can really be universal , that is , it can be all those human beings who are impelled by what I believe to be the fundamental human need to be yourself , which means to be creative , to be exploratory , to be inquisitive .
. .
QUESTION :
May I interrupt ?
CHOMSKY :
. . to do useful things , you know .
QUESTION :
If you use such a category , which has another meaning in Marxist …
CHOMSKY :
That ’s why I say maybe we ought to drop the concept .
QUESTION :
Would n’t you do better to use another term ?
In this situation I would like to ask another question : which groups , do you think , will make the revolution ?
CHOMSKY :
Yes , that ’s a different question .
QUESTION :
It ’s an irony of history that at this moment young intellectuals , coming from the middle and upper classes , call themselves proletarians and say we must join
I do n’t watch much Reality TV , but I ’ve seen enough of it to notice an on - going phenomenon : Someone wears a garment with a trademarked logo or artwork on it , and the producers have to pixelate it beyond recognition in post - production .
Of course no Reality TV star wants their shirt , which displays their well - chosen article of self - expression , senselessly pixelated so nobody can see it .
But no Reality TV producer wants to deal with the headache of removing said article of self - expression to avoid trademark violations .
The pixelation process seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for something that could have been avoided with a little pre-planning .
So I ’d like to introduce my new line of pre-pixelated clothing for Reality TV shows .
If you ’re going to be on a Reality TV show , you can buy one of these fine products and save someone a lot of headaches later .
In fact , if you live in an area where a reality TV show is taping , you should think about getting one of these shirts in case you get caught in the background of a shot .
And if you ’re heading to audition for a Reality TV show , maybe you should wear one of these shirts to the audition so they know that you ’re really serious about Reality TV .
Available here in these and other fine styles :

Why Microsoft Ca n’t Compete With iTunes examined Microsoft ’s past success in software development , and demonstrated why its past practices wo n’t be of any help in expanding into the consumer electronics and digital media download business .
While the mainstream media is conspicuously quiet on Microsoft ’s track record in consumer electronics , I ’m more than willing to share !
The Secret Failures of Microsoft
Considering how many industry giants have partnered with Microsoft in WMA and PlaysForSure -- including WalMart , Napster , MTV , WMA hardware makers , and RIAA label members -- it would appear that Microsoft is a leader in successful consumer electronics technology .
That ’s not the case .
All of these partners hooked up with Microsoft simply because they had no idea of what to do on their own .
Few even experimented with their own independent technology plans ; they simply picked Microsoft because the company seemed like a safe bet at delivering technology .
They obviously did n’t do their homework .
The big secret they missed is that Microsoft has n't ever earned significant profits in the consumer hardware business , nor has its executives proven any business acumen in delivering what consumers want in hardware or creative entertainment , excluding , of course , Microsoft 's impressive and highly sophisticated keyboard and mouse division .
The Problem of Choice
In fact , Microsoft only earns a tiny fraction of its revenues from sales to consumers ; the majority of its revenues do not result from buyers choosing a Microsoft product , but from corporations and individuals buying a PC and being instantly bound in a End User License Agreement .
There is no choice involved ; even most Linux users are forced to pay for a Microsoft license in order to obtain a brand name PC .
Interestingly , when I pointed out how this gives Microsoft half of the credit for all PCs sold in Market Share Myth : Nailed ! , PC enthusiasts went berserk and tried to invent logic to prove otherwise .
Ian Betteridge stuck around for two weeks posting comments that insisted a Windows license was no more important than a video card or a bundled game or utility .
But that is n't true ; there are multiple sources for video cards and trivial bundled software , but only one source for commercial PC operating systems : Microsoft .
PC makers have no choice in competing operating systems , nor can they sell PCs without an operating system , as I presented in the previous article .
They are bound to an oath to swear allegiance to Windows XP Professional , and must never mention Linux and Windows in the same breath .
If they step out of line in any way , Microsoft dramatically raises their OEM licensing fees and sends them to indoctrination camp , where they face chairs being hurled at them by angry monkeys .
An Unpleasant Secret
Why do Windows enthusiasts exibit much hostility to an obvious fact ?
Because if they admit that 80 % of the company 's revenues come entirely from an OEM tax , and not from any choice on the part of consumers , they also have to admit that Apple 's share of the market -- which is based entirely on consumers going out of their way to make a choice -- is not only underestimated , but a potential disaster looming for Microsoft .
They have to admit that as soon as customers are presented with the freedom of a real choice , they are not likely to choose Microsoft 's products over those from rivals .
That 's a scary proposition for Microsoft 's shareholders and others invested in the company because , outside of automatic OEM sales of PC licenses , all Microsoft has delivered in the consumer electronics industry is a long string of failures :
Phones & PDAs .
Microsoft 's decade of investments in WinCE and Windows Mobile Smartphones have only barely matched the market share of Palm , which itself is a run down company out of ideas .
Microsoft could n't out - maneuver the incompetent Palm within a decade of trying ; now both are ineffectually fighting over the dying PDA industry while Linux and Symbian slaughter them in the smartphone arena :
Symbian 75 % ; Linux 14 % ; Microsoft 5 % ; Palm 5 % .
Tablets , Handheld PCs & Origami .
While the smoke rises from WinCE 's ashes , Microsoft 's efforts to sell its full desktop version of Windows on alternative form factor PCs has similarly fizzled .
Microsoft admits that its Tablet PCs and so called " ultramobile " devices are not selling and are not at all interesting to consumers .
Clunky !
WebTV , Ultimate TV , and MSN TV were all related attempts to find new markets for the regular PC by hiding it in a television .
As it turns out , not only have competitors such as Tivo delivered better products without using a PC , but the DVR market is an unprofitable , highly competitive industry anyway .
Xbox game console .
Microsoft 's biggest success involved an unusual departure from its software licensing strategy .
Microsoft sells the Xbox as an integrated hardware and software system , just like Apple 's Mac and iPod .
Microsoft has sold fewer than half as many Xbox units ( 24 million ) in the the last five years as Apple has sold iPods ( 60 million ) , but Microsoft has n't been making a profit ; they 've lost billions !
That 's a " success " most companies can't afford to experience .
As Microsoft 's string of consumer failures point out , the company does not do well when positioned in a market where real competition exists and its software monopoly offers it little or no advantage over rivals .
Burning Ring of Fire
WMA and PlaysForSure specifically failed because the separation of stores , players and technology did not add value for consumers ; all it did was create confusion .
With Zune , Microsoft is abandoning its PlaysForSure music store and hardware partners in order to deliver an integrated product more similar to Apple 's iPod .
But the Zune is too little , too late .
Microsoft will repeat its WMA failure with Zune , not because it ’s wrong to try shipping an integrated product , but because the Zune lacks of any real connection to the Windows monopoly .
Without any way to tie the new product into its existing , competition - free Windows environment , Microsoft is powerless to force its adoption .
Microsoft will be exposed to live competition in real market , which the company has only rarely experienced in the last decade .
The company is in trouble because its core competency is in marketing vaporware using FUD : creating a product illusion that fools enough people to repress sales of existing products , paving the way for the introduction of a ‘ nothing special ’ product which dominates simply because there ’s no competition left to challenge it .
However , the Creative Zen , SanDisk Sansa , and Apple iPod are already established products with satisfied users .
FUD is n’t going to work , primarily because the IT cult priesthood is powerless to push Microsoft ’s consumer electronics the way it pushed the Windows PC .
An Ugly Battle
Microsoft is in the position of a pro wrestler who has only fought for show in staged fights , but has now been thrown into a no holds barred street fight against assassins with nothing on their minds but survival .
In this fight , Microsoft will not get to choose who to fight against ; it will be pitted against a variety of sly characters all fighting over the same alley , and all at the same time .
Microsoft seems to think it is challenging Apple to a gentleman 's duel .
It tries to spin Zune as a direct competitor to the iPod and somehow entirely independent from its PlaysForSure strategy in a magical way that will allow the Zune and other PlaysForSure devices to coexist in friendly harmony .
That 's simply not the case .
Everyone who wants a piece of the music player market , including existing PlaysForSure makers , will have to fight against Microsoft .
The Zune will quite obviously appeal to customers who do n't want an iPod .
That segment of the market , which has held consistently at 25 % for several years now , is already enflamed with serious competition .
In order to begin to compete against the iPod , Microsoft will have to fight its way past Sony , Samsung , Creative and the second place SanDisk , and it will only get that far by first cannibalizing sales of other PlaysForSure devices !
Toshiba , the maker of the Gigabeat / Zune , currently claims so few sales that it ’s not even on the chart .
Interestingly , SanDisk recently tripled its market share to 9.7 % , but all of its growth came by eating up other WMA players ; the Zune can only hope to do as well , but it lacks the Sansa ’s differentiation .
Further , SanDisk is certainly not about to give back its gains without a fight ; it also has the competitive advantage of being its own RAM manufacturer .
Microsoft simply has no guns to pull out at all .
These fighters can also play dirty .
Creative , having already collected a $ 100 million settlement from Apple over its Zen patent lawsuit , is now going after Microsoft .
The only difference is that Microsoft has n't made any money from the Zune yet , nor does it have a “ Made for Zune ” peace offering to hand Creative .
Oh the Humanity !
Another Fierce Market
Paired with the history of failures in the consumer electronics space , what will save Microsoft 's bacon ?
Some analysts seem to think that Microsoft has billions in the bank to throw away while leisurely chasing down the iPod .
But that 's not true .
That money belongs to shareholders , because Microsoft is owned by shareholders , just like every other publicly held company .
Anyone who says Microsoft has lots of money to burn has n't ever met angry shareholders .
Microsoft 's shares are themselves competing in a free market : the stock market .
If Microsoft does n't continue to create new markets and find new revenues , its investors will pull out to invest in companies who can .
When that happens , Microsoft ’s valuation will sag .
There are plenty of companies with glorious pasts who suddenly lost their stock valuation after a series of badly executed strategies .
The mid-90's Apple is a good example .
After two decades of brilliant success , Apple 's valuation dropped into the toilet in the mid 90's when the company failed to deliver progress and demonstrated an inability to find new markets and new sources of revenue .
The tech industry is full of one - time leaders who fell down dead .
Anyone who thinks Microsoft is immune to failure is simply choosing to not pay attention to reality .

GILROY / Small plane crashes into raw sewage tank
A small airplane apparently took a nose - dive into a tank of raw sewage near Gilroy on Monday afternoon .
Gilroy police Sgt. Kurt Svardal said authorities have no idea where the plane was from or where it was going .
The aircraft came pretty much straight down into a holding tank filled with raw sewage at a sewage treatment facility , he said , adding that it was too dangerous for a dive team to go into the water and check for bodies or the tail number of the plane , which would indicate who owned it and where it was from .
The tank is about 20 feet deep and will have to be drained before police can determine if anyone is inside .
Svardal said police assume at least one person , the pilot , is inside the downed plane .
There may be passengers as well .
Police received reports of a possible crash around 4 p.m. and spent an hour and a half checking the area .
Workers at the sewage treatment plant noticed damage to a railing around the tank and notified police , who determined that the plane had gone into the tank .
The tank is a couple hundred feet in diameter , Svardal said , which means the plane probably came in at a very steep angle .
It is nowhere near any kind of airfield or landing strip , he said .
Svardal said Gilroy police had no reports of overdue or missing planes in the area .
He said the Federal Aviation Administration is trying to determine where the plane came from and who was at the controls .
Families visiting Disneyland on their holiday this week saw a life - size Guantanamo bay inmate standing inside the Rocky Mountain Railroad ride at Disneyland in Anaheim California .
The sculpture , consisting of an inflatable doll dressed in an orange jumpsuit with its hands and feet manacled remained in place for one and a half hours before Disneyland ’s security staff shut down the ride and removed it amid fears over public safety .

Acoustic guitarist Kate Walsh has knocked Take That off the top of the iTunes download album chart – but does not even own an iPod .
The 23 - year - old guitarist recorded her album in a friend ’s bedroom and named it Tim ’s House in his honour .
The homemade album has proved a unexpected hit with iPod fans who had downloaded it from the iTunes website in their thousands – knocking Take That and Kaiser Chiefs from the top spots .
Miss Walsh said : “ You end up looking at it every day to see if you ’re still number one .
I think I ’m ahead of Elton .
“ I do n’t actually have an iPod yet .
I hear they are quite good for ten hour flights .
“ I set up my own record label called Blueberry Pie and just got the music out there .
It ’s pretty easy .
Anyone can do it . ”
The classically trained pianist from Brighton said she built up a fan base by putting her music onto her MySpace page and eventually persuaded iTunes to sell it .
Cleto Ruiz Díaz se ha hecho popular en su provincia natal , Corrientes , en el noreste de Argentina , por ser uno de los padres más fértiles del país .
Con 37 hijos , ha reclamado a la Justicia que le permita someterse a una vasectomía a sus 44 años , pese a que en su provincia está prohibida la intervención .
El Parlamento argentino va a dar luz verde a una ley que permita a los hombres y mujeres que lo deseen operarse para anular su capacidad reproductiva .
Cleto no es un superhombre .
Se gana la vida como pintor o haciendo " changas " ( trabajos temporales ) y dice haberse iniciado sexualmente a los nueve años , tenido hasta siete novias a la vez y vivido durante 14 años con tres mujeres bajo el mismo techo .
Actualmente convive con una sola , Isabel , de 29 años , con la que ha tenido ocho hijos , dos de los cuales murieron .
" En total son seis los hijos que tuve y fallecieron .
Pero lo que le pasó a Cletito , el último , que nació con labio leporino , hizo que dijera " basta , no quiero tener más chicos .
Ellos también sufren y los quiero cuidar bien " , ha asegurado en declaraciones a la prensa local .
" Mi vida se fue dando así y no es para reirse , porque es muy duro tener que alimentar tantos chicos sin un trabajo digno , abrigándolos con ropa de segunda mano y esperando ayudas del Gobierno que nunca llegan " , ha comentado .
Y es que Ruiz Díaz dice que no puede controlarse cuando se enamora de una mujer .
Para él , comprar preservativos supondría dejar a su familia " sin un kilogramo de azúcar " .
Su actual mujer también ha pedido a la Justicia que le permita someterse a una operación de ligadura de trompas y quizás no tenga que esperar mucho tiempo porque el Parlamento está a punto de aprobar un proyecto en ese sentido .
A finales de junio pasado , la Cámara de Diputados dio luz verde a una iniciativa que habilita a nivel nacional la posibilidad de que hombres y mujeres decidan voluntariamente hacerse una intervención quirúrgica para anular su capacidad reproductiva .
El proyecto debe ser discutido ahora por el Senado , aunque se da por descontado que se convertirá en ley antes de finales de año .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Two studies published on Wednesday further link hormone replacement therapy with cancer , suggesting -- but not yet proving -- that HRT causes breast and ovarian cancer .

But doctors stressed that younger women who need the drugs to relieve serious symptoms of menopause should still consider taking them because new , lower - dose formulations are available and doctors now know to prescribe them for shorter periods of time .
One study , published in the Lancet medical journal , found women who used HRT were 20 percent more likely to die from ovarian cancer than similar women who did not use HRT .
Dr. Valerie Beral and colleagues at the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit in Oxford , said their findings suggested that that as many as 1,000 extra women in Britain had died from ovarian cancer between 1991 and 2005 because they were using hormone replacement therapy .
They used data from the “ Million Women Study , ” which looked at just under a million women , about half of whom were current of former HRT users .
For every 1,000 women who used HRT for five years , 2.6 developed ovarian cancer .
That compared to 2.2 cases of ovarian cancer for every 1,000 women who did not use HRT .
“ The effect of HRT on ovarian cancer should not be viewed in isolation , especially since use of HRT also affects the risk of breast and endometrial cancer , ” Beral ’s team wrote .
“ The total incidence of these three cancers in the study population is 63 percent higher in current users of HRT than never users , ” they added .
“ Thus when ovarian , endometrial and breast cancer are taken together , use of HRT results in a material increase in these common cancers . ”
FALL IN BREAST CANCER
The second study , published in the New England Journal of Medicine , showed that the incidence of breast cancer dropped by 8.6 percent between 2001 and 2004 in the United States -- along with a decline in HRT use .
Most of the drop in breast cancer cases was seen in 2003 , and then rates leveled off in 2004 , Dr. Donald Berry of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and colleagues found .
This drop happened right after the 2002 Women ’s Health Initiative study found that HRT could raise the risk not only of breast cancer , but of strokes and other serious conditions .
Millions of women stopped taking the drugs , which had been widely prescribed to reduce the risk of heart disease , osteoporosis and in general to keep women feeling “ young ” .
Berry said the breast cancer statistics suggest , but do not show , that women who stopped HRT avoided breast cancer .
The theory is that the hormones help fuel the growth of tumors , so it is possible that more women have small , slow - growing cancers that can not yet be detected .
Berry said if women follow the current recommendations -- to take HRT for the shortest possible period of time and at the lowest possible dose -- the benefits outweigh the risks .
“ If this prevents the hot flashes , at least for a limited time , say a year or two , that might be quite a reasonable and rational choice , ” he said .
Dr. Joseph Camardo , head of medical affairs at drugmaker Wyeth , which makes the popular Premarin HRT drugs , said he did not believe the findings should change current guidelines .
“ No one believes this information should change clinical practice , ” Camardo said in a telephone interview .
“ The most important thing is that women speak to the doctor . ”
In what they claim is the first direct evidence of the evolution of lactase - persistence ( the ability to digest milk and other dairy foods ) , German and British researchers came up empty in their search for the gene variant that allows over 90 percent of northern Europeans to gulp down and properly digest milk .
In many others around the world , lactose causes diarrhea and bloating , especially in adulthood .
Lactase persistence ( also called lactose tolerance ) , the continued production of the enzyme lactase that breaks down the sugar lactose in milk , correlates heavily with populations currently or once based on dairy farming , estimated to have begun in Europe roughly 8,000 to 9,000 years ago .
( Populations in the Middle East and northeastern Africa also have the ability to digest milk . )
" There 's pretty good evidence that it 's the most strongly selected single gene variant in Europeans in the last 30,000 years , " says Mark Thomas , a genetic anthropologist at University College London and co-author of a new study in this week 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Thomas , along with a team of scientists from the University of Mainz in Germany led by paleogeneticist Joachim Burger , searched for the gene variant that confers lactase persistence in most modern - day Europeans in eight samples from the skeletal remains of Europeans who lived during the Neolithic era along with one sample from the Mesolithic era .
The Neolithic relics were carbon dated to between 5,000 and 5,840 years ago , while the Mesolithic remains date back almost 4,000 years .
The samples were found in locations ranging from Germany to Lithuania .
According to the study , the ability to process lactose was not highly prevalent in the Neolithic era .
In fact , the researchers did not find any trace of the gene variant in their samples .
The total absence suggests that no more than about 40 percent of the population could possibly have been lactose tolerant 5,000 years ago — indicating that the ability to digest the milk sugar probably resulted from the advent of dairy farming .
" Eight thousand years , in evolutionary terms , is nothing , especially when a genotype frequency raises from close to 0 up to more then 70 percent and , in some areas of northern Europe , [ to ] even more than 90 percent , " Burger says , adding he expected to find that some individuals were lactase - persistent .
" The fact that we have found none demonstrates that positive selection was acting massively on prehistoric European populations and that the speed of the spread of the allele ( gene variant ) was enormous . "
About 80 percent of the people in southern Europe now are lactose intolerant , which means that there was a relatively small window for the gene variant to have come into prevalence in northern Europe .
Burger says he will study more populations in Eurasia to try to determine when the gene variant spiked in frequency .
Thomas , on the other hand , plans to integrate these findings " into a full population computer simulation to try to understand the spread of farming , dairying and other population movement . "
Sarah Tishkoff , an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Maryland , says that the new work highlights the potential of tying the findings of genetics and archeology together .
She warns , however , that , " one of the limitations of doing ancient DNA work is the difficulty of obtaining enough nuclear DNA to look at large numbers of samples to determine differences among populations . "
She adds that going forward , analyzing a few samples from the same area and period of time may better hone the ancestral frequency of this gene variant .
I 've been using Skype for about two and half years now and I love it .
I use it to call friends and family for free and I also use SkypeOut to call my friends who have n't installed Skype yet or to reach my wife on her cell phone .
The biggest problem I had with Skype was that I had to be connected to my PC with my headset in order to use it .
Last month , I was in CompUSA looking for Skype gadgets and unfortunately , the salesperson barely new what I was talking about when I asked about VoIP or Skype products .
Anyway , I walked around the store and next to the cordless telephones I found a cool device from D - Link called the DPH - 50U Skype USB phone adapter .
It connects to my PC through the USB port .
I connected my Motorola cordless phone base station to it and I also connected the DPH - 50U to the phone line .
When I got home , I installed the adapter by running a setup utility from the CD - ROM that came in the box .
Even though , I got a Windows unsigned driver warning message , the setup was pretty simply .
At the end of the installation , Skype asked me if it was OK for the D - Link Agent to use Skype .
I answered yes and that 's all there was to it .
I took a picture of my setup .
You can see it below .
Now , when I receive a Skype call , my cordless phones ring .
I can see the Skype username on the phone 's caller ID display and answer the call as if it were a normal phone call .
This is slick !
When I want to make a Skype call , I pick up the phone , press ## and dial the SkypeOut number and press the * key .
I am now using Skype around the house .
The best part is that my phone still acts as it normally does for making and receiving regular phone calls .
One of the coolest features is that while I am on a regular call , I can still make and receive Skype calls .
When I receive a Skype call , I hear a call waiting tone in the phone and can switch between my regular call and the Skype call I can even connect the two together into a conference call .
The user 's manual talks about being to use my mobile phone with my Skype account but I have n't played around with it yet .
So far , I love the DPH - 50U
Summary :
In reporting on the Bush administration 's allegations about Iran 's role in Iraq , media outlets have covered the matter in a muddled , incomplete manner , omitting any skeptical or critical analysis of these allegations , which suggests , in the words of washingtonpost.
com 's Dan Froomkin , that " the lessons we should have learned from Iraq may not have been learned at all . "
In his February 2 Nieman Watchdog column , washingtonpost.com blogger Dan Froomkin warned that the media 's coverage of the Bush administration 's posture toward Iran suggested that " the lessons we should have learned from Iraq may not have been learned at all . "
Apparently bearing out Froomkin 's concerns , media outlets such as The New York Times , CBS , and NBC have continued to report Bush 's allegations about Iran 's role in Iraq in a muddled , incomplete manner -- at times offering rebuttals to baseless and unsourced allegations of Iranian influence , while at other times serving as little more than stenographers .
In advising journalists to be skeptical of authority , Froomkin offered several suggestions :
Do n't assume anything administration officials tell you is true .
In fact , you are probably better off assuming anything they tell you is a lie .
Demand proof for their every assertion .
Assume the proof is a lie .
Demand that they prove that their proof is accurate .
Just because they say it , does n't mean it should ... make the headlines .
The absence of supporting evidence for their assertion -- or a preponderance of evidence that contradicts the assertion -- may be more newsworthy than the assertion itself .
Do n't print anonymous assertions .
Demand that sources make themselves accountable for what they insist is true .
Michael Gordon , The New York Times
A February 10 New York Times article by reporter Michael Gordon on the Bush administration 's claim that the " most lethal weapon directed against American troops in Iraq ... is being supplied by Iran " appeared to contravene every one of Froomkin 's suggestions :
" Do n't assume everything administration officials tell you is true " : Gordon uncritically reported that the " assertion of an Iranian role in supplying the device " -- a weapon known as an " explosively formed penetrator " ( EFP ) , used in roadside bombs -- " to Shiite militias reflects broad agreement among American intelligence agencies , although officials acknowledge that the picture is not entirely complete . "
The article also uncritically quoted from an " intelligence assessment , " which apparently claimed that " Iran is implementing a deliberate , calibrated policy -- approved by Supreme Leader [ Ayatollah Ali ] Khamenei and carried out by the Quds Force -- to provide explosives support and training to select Iraqi Shia militant groups to conduct attacks against coalition targets . "
" Demand proof for every assertion " : Gordon offered no indication that he asked for proof for these allegations .
" Just because they say it , does n't mean it should ... make the headlines " :
The article was headlined : " Deadliest Bomb in Iraq is Made by Iran , U.S. Says . "
" Do n't print anonymous assertions " : Gordon claimed he obtained " specific details " regarding Iran 's involvement in Iraq from unnamed " civilian and military officials from a broad range of government agencies . "
In his article , Gordon did not include any skeptical or critical analysis of these allegations , aside from noting that " Iran has publicly denied the allegations . "
As Editor & Publisher noted on the day the article came out , Gordon is " the same Times reporter who , on his own or with [ former New York Times reporter ] Judith Miller , wrote some of the key , and badly misleading or downright inaccurate , articles about Iraqi WMDs in the run-up to the 2003 invasion . "
By contrast , in a February 12 article , to which Gordon contributed , the Times reported that anonymous " senior United States military officials on Sunday literally put on the table their first public evidence of the contentious assertion that Iran supplies Shiite extremist groups in Iraq with some of the most lethal weapons in the war , " and that " officials also asserted , without providing direct evidence , that Iranian leaders had authorized smuggling those weapons into Iraq for use against the Americans . "
The Times added :
That inference , and the anonymity of the officials who made it , seemed likely to generate skepticism among those suspicious that the Bush administration is trying to find a scapegoat for its problems in Iraq , and perhaps even trying to lay the groundwork for war with Iran .
In a February 13 article by Helene Cooper and Mark Mazzetti , headlined " Doubts Greet U.S. Evidence On Iran Action " ( the headline of the online version of the article was changed to " Skeptics Doubt U.S. Evidence on Iran Action in Iraq " ) , the Times again noted that the administration offered no " direct evidence , " and that Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , " told reporters that he ' would not say ' that Iran 's leadership was aware of or condoned the attacks . "
David Martin , CBS News
As Media Matters for America noted , during a February 12 report on the CBS Evening News on Iran 's alleged ties to the supply of EFPs , CBS News national security correspondent David Martin uncritically quoted State Department spokesman Sean McCormack 's claim that the " Iranians are up to their eyeballs in this activity . "
Martin also uncritically reported what he said was CBS News consultant Reza Aslan 's belief that " supplying the devices is Iran 's way of saying , ' If you want us to stop , let 's talk . ' " Martin did not note in his report that Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said he " would not say " that Iran 's government knew about or condoned the attacks , as noted by the Times on February 13 .
According to a February 12 McClatchy Newspapers article , Pace said :
" We know that the explosively formed projectiles are manufactured in Iran .
What I would not say is that the Iranian government per se knows about this , " Pace replied .
" It is clear that Iranians are involved and it is clear that materials from Iran are involved .
But I would not say based on what I know that the Iranian government clearly knows or is complicit . "
Andrea Mitchell , NBC News
Similarly , on the February 12 broadcast of NBC's Nightly News , NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell reported that " questions swirled today about the administration 's long - awaited evidence , " adding : " The U.S. claims the targeted explosives used in Iraq are made in Iran .
Even if true , would that prove Iran 's government was involved ? "
Mitchell noted that " administration officials ... acknowledge that the evidence is at best , quote , ' circumstantial , ' " but at no point did she mention Pace 's refusal to affirm that the government of Iran was involved .
From the February 12 broadcast of NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams :
MITCHELL : The Bush administration is on the defensive today , denying that it is exaggerating intelligence about Iranian support for insurgents in Iraq to justify a U.S. attack on Iran .
[ begin video clip ]
Is the government in Tehran responsible for the deadly , armor - piercing devices that have been targeting U.S. troops in Iraq , as the White House and Pentagon claim ?
The president on C - SPAN today denied trying to create a pretext for war with Iran .
PRESIDENT BUSH :
My reaction to all the noise about , you know , " He wants to go to war " is -- first of all , I do n't understand the tactics , and I guess I would say it 's political .
MITCHELL : But questions swirled today about the administration 's long - awaited evidence laid out for reporters yesterday in Baghdad by U.S. military officials who , in a highly unusual step , would not give their names .
The U.S. claims the targeted explosives used in Iraq are made in Iran .
Even if true , would that prove Iran 's government was involved ?
TONY SNOW ( White House press secretary ) :
There 's not a whole lot of freelancing in the Iranian government , especially when it comes to something like that .
MITCHELL : Tehran , which celebrated the anniversary of its revolution yesterday , today denied the U.S. charge .
A spokesman said : " The United States has a long history of fabricating evidence . "
How involved is Tehran ?
U.S. intelligence officials have some doubts .
Nine days ago , the government 's 16 intelligence agencies reported that Iran 's influence was not " a major driver of violence " in Iraq .
That same day , the White House said it was n't satisfied the Pentagon 's case against Iran was solid .
STEPHEN HADLEY ( national security adviser ) : Quite frankly , we thought the briefing overstated , and we sent it back to get it narrowed and focused on the facts .
MITCHELL : So , why is the evidence now ready ?
Or is the administration trying to provoke a confrontation with Iran ?
BRUCE RIEDEL ( former CIA official ) :
This is extremely dangerous territory we 're moving into now .
We 're accusing the Iranians of killing American soldiers on a battlefield .
That raises the ante pretty high between us and Tehran .

MITCHELL : Today , administration officials say they had to make their case to protect U.S. troops from a growing threat , but they acknowledge that the evidence is at best , quote , " circumstantial . "
— S.S.M .
It 's not that even handed , calm , unemotional criticisms directed only to the child 's behavior is wrong ; it is that no one does it well .
And that 's where it all falls apart .
Many interesting and varied reactions to my post , " What Goes Wrong In A Psychiatrist 's Family ? "
It struck a nerve with a lot of people , and others could n't relate to it at all .
But I would like to clear up one element :
SOME psychiatrists think / try to do something noble ( criticize behavior and not the child itself ) but they are HUMAN , and get tired .
They will eventually get angry , and , from a kid 's perspective , when the parent gets angry is what matters .
What did I do to piss Dad off ?
The opposite of this , call it the non-psychiatrist parent , is calm , then gets a little angry , a little more angry , a little more angry , then yells , screams .
There 's a build up .
A few years of this and you realize that there are some things that make Dad a little angry , and other things that make him really angry .
There 's normal , varying levels of human emotion to different situations .
But the child of a psychiatrist does n't get that .
He gets binary emotional states .
" Lying is not acceptable behavior . "
Later : " Yelling loudly is not acceptable behavior . "
Later : " Picking you nose is not acceptable behavior . "
Later : " Stealing is not acceptable behavior . "
What 's the relative value ?
A kid has no idea -- he thinks the value is decided by Dad , not intrinsic to the behavior .
" Eating cookies before dinner is not acceptable behavior . "
Later : " Kicking your brother is not acceptable behavior . "
Ok , now here it comes :
After seven or eight or twenty five " not acceptable behavior " monotones , Dr. Dad can't take it anymore ; he explodes .
" Goddamn it !
What the hell is the matter with you ?!
What are you doing ?!! "
All the anger and affect gets released , finally .
The problem -- the exact problem -- is this : the explosion of anger came at something relatively trivial .
Maybe the kid spilled the milk .
So now the four year old concludes that the worst thing he did all day was spilled the milk -- not kicking his brother , or lying , or stealing .
Had he not spilled that milk , Dad would n't have gotten angry .
Add this up over , say , a year : mostly flat , neutral monotones , peppered with unpredictable yelling patterns , inconsistent explosions , and now the kid can't form a hierarchy of good and bad .
In fact , what he learns is that good and bad are defined almost exclusively by the reaction he gets from others ( e.g. Dad ) and not the behavior itself .
You say : but the kid's not an idiot , he 's going to know that stealing is worse than spilling milk .
Well , how is he going to learn that , except from you ?
You say : just going through life -- every kid eventually learns it .
Yes , they learn that it is worse , but not why it is worse .
The conclusion is that the hierarchy of bad and worse is determined by the severity of people 's reactions .
You say : the solution is that Dr. Dad needs to work on maintaining his calm all the time , and not exploding .
Well , it 's not going to work : he 's human .
Eventually the electric bill will be too high , or his wife cheats on him , or he has the flu , or he 's stuck in traffic all day .
And he 'll explode ( or , the alternative : check out .
" I 'm not dealing with this anymore . " )
Consider this : a kid knows exactly how his father feels about a certain patient , or colleague , or friend , because he sees a consistent and predictable reaction in the Dad every time the person is mentioned .
But the kid does not have that clear link for himself .
There 's more informational affect from Dad talking to a patient on the phone then there is when punishing you .
Contrast this with the reaction of , say , a hypothetical " angry Dad " who has six beers a day after work : he 's always pissed off .
Always .
Even though he flips out over spilled milk , he flips out over everything .
The consistency of his anger makes the anger attributable to him -- " Dad 's insane " -- not to you or your behavior .
You do n't infer from this that what you did is good or bad -- you 'll have to learn that elsewhere .
But just as you 've identified Dad as " Angry Dad " you might also infer that he hates you , that you are a bad person .
This is clearly not a good thing , but the point is that you develop an identity from it , you get defined ( though negatively . )
The inconsistency of the psychiatrist - parent 's anger is confusing ; why this thing , and not the other thing ?
Why so much consistent ( same kind and amount ) affect talking to an auto mechanic , and so little affect -- especially consistent affect -- with me ?
So you have a psychiatrist - parent , who works long hours ; who tries hard to be neutral even in punishment ; who gives little in the way of emotional information about a kid 's identity , but is so obviously clear about other people ; who once in a while explodes , inconsistently , over unpredictable things .
Here it is again , where it all goes wrong : the child develops an identity which is about the reactions of others .
" People 's opinions of me are based on how I make them feel . "
Disclaimer again , and for the last time : not all children of psychiatrists go insane , not all psychiatrists suck as parents , I do n't know what I 'm talking about , Bush lied , etc , etc .
Please understand I am not criticizing psychiatrist parents , I 'm trying to understand something .
You come home , and find your kid has spilled the milk .
How do you react ?
Ok , now ask your kid : how do you think I 'm about to react ?
The answer , ideally , should be the same .
If it 's not , you 've got a problem on your hands .
The poll was taken just a month before a squadron of six Tornados with high - resolution cameras takes on a controversial reconnaissance role supporting NATO troops engaged in combat operations in the south of the country .
The poll by the TNS institute commissioned by the newsmagazine Der Spiegel found that 57 percent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal , while 36 percent were in favor of continued engagement .
Only four percent backed increasing the German military presence in Afghanistan .
Part of NATO force
Under their current mandate , the German troops are prevented from supporting the combat operations of the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) that is fighting the Taliban and al Qaeda in the southern provinces .
The troops are stationed in the mostly peaceful northern part of the country
Germany 's NATO partners have repeatedly called for an extension of the German mandate .
On March 9 , the German parliament approved the deployment of Tornado jets by a large majority , although there was opposition from some on the left of the grand coalition currently in power .
Two conservative members failed in their attempt to get the Constitutional Court to block the deployment as contrary to the restrictions imposed on the German military under the constitution .
Germany has nearly 3,000 troops serving with the 35,000 - member NATO force , mainly in mixed civil and military provisional reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful northern part of the country .
In addition , there are 14,000 US - led coalition troops in Afghanistan engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom .

The ' Angels ' singer believes many movie stars have an exaggerated view of their role in society and should be more grounded .
He said in an interview with Britain 's The Sun newspaper : " They talk about acting as if it 's saving someone 's life , but it 's not rocket science - it 's just pretending to be someone else . "
Robbie also rubbished celebrity - endorsed religions such as Scientology , a sci- fi cult followed by Tom Cruise and John Travolta , and Kabbalah , a mystical offshoot of Judaism practised by Madonna .

screen - The Terminal Multiplexer
screen .
Posted on March 24 , 2004 by Chris Lumens in presentations
screen is a terminal multiplexer that provides lots of features for people who are frequently using a terminal program like xterm or are logged into remote systems .
I know that ’s a terrible one line description , but it will have to do .
I gave this presentation to the GT LUG to spread the word of how wonderful and useful screen is .
No pictures .
What is screen ?
screen is a terminal multiplexer : it takes many different running processes and manages which of them gets displayed to the user .
Think of it as a window manager for your console or terminal emulator .
With screen , you can have interactive processes running on your home computer and connect to them from anywhere else to check on their progress .
What sorts of programs are good for running in screen ?
movie downloads
command line mail clients
log watching
giant compiles ( kernel , make World , etc )
Terminology
There are three different ways you can think about what screen is displaying to your console .
We ’ll need to be familiar with the meaning of these terms for the rest of the presentation :
session - A session is created when you start a new instance of screen on the command line .
Within a session , you can have multiple programs running .
A single session can hold many windows .
- A session is created when you start a new instance of screen on the command line .
Within a session , you can have multiple programs running .
A single session can hold many windows .
window - Windows are created inside a session , and manage the running programs .
By default , a single new window is created when you start up screen to display the running program ( for example , a shell ) .
You can create many windows within a single session and quickly switch between them .
- Windows are created inside a session , and manage the running programs .
By default , a single new window is created when you start up screen to display the running program ( for example , a shell ) .
You can create many windows within a single session and quickly switch between them .
region - A region is a part of the current window .
When you do a split , you are creating two different regions within the same window .
Each region can then display a different program .
Additionally , it helps to know what the following mean :
detach - Detaches the currently running program from the terminal .
From the user ’s perspective , the running program simply disappears and the user is dumped back to a shell prompt outside screen management .
However , all programs being managed by screen continue to run .
- Detaches the currently running program from the terminal .
From the user ’s perspective , the running program simply disappears and the user is dumped back to a shell prompt outside screen management .
However , all programs being managed by screen continue to run .
attach - Attach to a previously detached program .
This will bring the program running under the detached session back to the user ’s terminal , as if you were watching it the whole time .
The Basics
Commanding screen
screen tries to stay out of your way as much as possible .
Just about everything you type gets sent to the running program .
This makes interacting with screen a little bit weird .
All screen commands begin with control - a , which will be abbreviated with ^A .
Anything you ’re supposed to type will be shown in the white - on - grey scheme .
After you give it the ^A , you give a command key which tells screen what to do .
^ A ? brings up a list of all the possible commands , while ^A : brings up a command prompt that you can use to type commands and set variables .
All the command keys have a full word equivalent that you can type .
Making New Sessions
You make a new session on the command line .
Without any options , screen will make a new session and run your $ SHELL inside it :
$ screen
This session will be named with the PID , TTY , and hostname where the session was started .
Not very descriptive or exciting .
Luckily , you can easily give the session a name :
$ screen -S edonkey
If you start up a screen session and forget to give it a name , do n’t worry .
You can use ^ A : sessionname < name > to give it a name .
Note that the session names have nothing to do with window names , as we will see later .
Finally , you can have screen start a program other than $ SHELL with the common option :
$ screen -e pine
Detaching
So you ’re sitting there recompiling your distribution when you see it ’s time to run to class .
You ’d like to be able to check out the progress later from a lab .
Luckily , you started the compile up in a screen session .
To be able to attach to it later , you first need to detach from it here , with ^A d .
The compile session will disappear , and you ’ll be back at the prompt that you started screen from .
There are ways to attach to a running screen session you forgot to detach from .
Those will be covered later .
Attaching
The opposite operation from detaching is attaching , which is where you reconnect to a previously detached session .
If you ’ve only got one session running , it ’s very easy to attach to it :
$ screen -r
However , it ’s possible that you have many sessions running at once .
In that case , you ’ll need to tell screen which session to attach to .
Of course , first you will want to know what the possibilities are .
Luckily , screen has a command line option to list running sessions :
$ screen - ls There are screens on : 15150.uml-slk ( Detached ) 18614.uml - fed ( Detached ) 2 Sockets in / tmp / screens / S-root .
Then you just specify the name or PID of the session after the -r command line option and that session will be attached .
You can see why you might want to name things beforehand , especially if you have lots of stuff running .
Working Within a Session
Running several sessions is handy but switching among them can be a pain , since you have to detach and reattach all the time .
A better option is to run a single session with several windows inside it .
As you ’ll see , switching among many windows is very quick and powerful .
New Windows
Making a new window is easy .
Just hit ^A c .
screen will start up a new active window and run $ SHELL in it .
Your previously active window will be hidden from you , but any programs on it are still running .
If you detach a session with many windows in it , all programs on all windows will continue running .
When you reattach , the active window will be displayed again .
Managing Windows
The most difficult thing about lots of windows is keeping track of them .
The default display does n’t show you anything about what windows are open or what programs are running in them .
When you switch from one window to another , the previous one just disappears .
Luckily , screen provides many ways to keep track of all your windows .
Windows can have names , just like sessions .
The default window name is the program running in it , which will usually be $ SHELL .
Renaming windows will help you keep track of them , and is done with ^a A . screen will display a prompt at the bottom for you to provide a name .
A simple way to list all your windows is ^A w , which just gives you all the names and window number along the bottom of the screen .
This line also displays some status information , the most important being that the current window is marked with an asterisk .
This is just a list , though ; there ’s no way to switch .
If you want to pick from a list , you can use ^A " , arrow down to the window you want , and hit return .
Or if you know the window number , ^A 0 - 9 will bring that window up .
As we ’ll see later , there ’s a way to have a continuous window list display .
This combined with switching on a number is the fastest way to move around .
Managing Regions
Finally , you ’ve got screen regions .
Just like vim can split the display up into several areas , so can screen .
You can split the window up into two equally sized regions with ^A S .
The already running program will get squashed into a region half its original size , and a new region will open up on the other half .
This new region will have nothing running in it , since you might want to stick one of your currently running windows inside it .
There ’s several ways to change focus among regions , but the simplest is the obvious ^ A < tab >
Once you ’re in the new region , you can display any of your windows in that region just by switching to them with ^A 0 - 9 , or you can create a new shell in that region with ^A c .
And last , you might get tired of all these regions clogging up your window and want to kill them .
You can make the current region the only visible one with ^A Q , which simply hides all the other regions and makes them accessible via the window numbers .
Or , you can kill off the current region entirely with ^A X .
Note that hiding a region keeps programs running , while killing a region kills any programs running in it .
Quitting screen
screen quits when everything running inside it quits .
This means you ’ll need to step through all your windows and kill the shells running inside them with ^D or exit .
Usually , this is exactly what you want .
Sometimes , though , you might want screen to just go away immediately .
^ A ^\ will kill screen , and everything running underneath it .
That means all the shells running on all the windows , and all the processes started by all those shells .
That ’s certainly not a command you want to use too often .
Advanced Topics
Attaching
Sometimes , you might be at a remote location and want attach to a session that you ’d forgotten to detach from earlier .
You ’re not out of luck , because screen provides you a couple ways to handle this situation .
The first approach is :
$ screen -x src
This attaches to the src session without detaching first .
So in other words , you ’ve got two sessions looking at exactly the same thing .
Anything you do on one session will be displayed on all of them .
When you ’re done , detaching from the one session leaves the other attached .
It helps to have the same terminal type and size to do this , though .
You can also use one of the six - D -R option combinations described in the screen man page to detach any active sessions before attaching again .
Digraphs
Digraphs are characters that take us several keystrokes to type , because our keyboard does n’t have the right symbols .
Good examples are European letters and international money symbols , like ë , ø , and Æ .
X supports these characters with the compose key , which you can map to any spare key you ’ve got on your keyboard .
screen provides similar functionality with the digraph command .
Just type ^A ^V followed by the characters that make up the digraph .
The three characters I made above are done with :
ë = ^A ^V e :
ø = ^A ^V o /
Æ = ^A ^V A E
screen ’s digraph list is built - in , so you ca n’t yet add your own .
Note that ^V is also the vim insert mode command that allows you to put control sequences into your files .
Monitoring
Say you ’ve got a whole bunch of windows open .
One of those windows is idling in a very inactive IRC channel .
Since not much goes on in there , you do n’t keep that window active but you would like to know when something is said .
screen lets you monitor any window for activity by first switching to the window , and then hitting ^A M .
When activity in that window occurs , screen will display a message at the bottom .
On the other hand , say one of your windows is a compile of X .
There ’s lots and lots of activity and you ’d like to know when the build is finished .
You can monitor for 30 seconds of inactivity by switching to the window and hitting ^A _ .
When the window goes silent , screen will display a message at the bottom .
These monitoring commands are toggles , so you can turn them off by switching to any monitored window and issuing the command again .
Nested screens
Yes , it is possible to have screen sessions inside each other .
This can be really confusing , so I ’m only mentioning it so you know it ’s possible .
One problem with nested screens is sending the ^A to one of the nested sessions , since the most outside session will interpret the key and not send it where you wanted .
In this case , you need ^A a which simply sends ^A to the running program , which might just be another screen .
If you had one screen inside another and wanted a list of windows on the inner one , you ’d need to do ^A a w .
Multiple Users
Finally , screen allows several users to connect to a single session at the same time .
It provides an access list for the session and allows you to set read / write / execute permissions for each user on that list .
It even provides a way to set up user groups .
One good reason for this multiple user feature is that you can interactively have several people looking at some source code so there ’s no confusion as to what part you ’re talking about .
Before anyone else can connect to your screen sessions , you have to enable multiuser mode with ^ A : multiuser on .
Then , you give another user permission to connect with ^ A :aclchg david +r " # " .
This means that the system user has read permission on all windows .
You can specify multiple users , write and execute permissions , and certain windows .
Be especially careful with the execute permission as that will let other people create new windows and change the acl permissions themselves .
Now the user you granted access to can connect with :
$ screen -r chris /
At any time , you can delete other users with acldel david .
As with any system that involves multiple users , there are a lot of security implications and access features .
Use carefully and see the man page for the details .
Customization with $ HOME /. screenrc
/ etc/screenrc and $ HOME /. screenrc are the screen configuration files , with the $ HOME one overriding values set in the global one .
You can experiment with settings while screen is running , and then move those settings into your . screenrc file to make them permanent .
Just about anything you can type into screen can be added to the config file .
I ’m only going to touch on a few .
See the man page for more .
Visual Bell
Instead of beeping , the visual bell displays a message when something happens .
The default screen message is " Wuff —- Wuff !! " , which is pretty stupid .
You can change this with the following line :
vbell_msg " beep "
Key Bindings
You can add your own commands that are bound to keys .
For example , here ’s an example key binding that opens a new window with an ssh session to a different computer :
bind ' R ' screen ssh root@foc - gw - 1
Now hitting ^A R will open up a new window with an ssh session in it .
As you can see , you still need to hit ^A to get screen to pay attention .
Key bindings can get way more complicated than this , of course .
Terminal Hacks
screen lets you modify the termcap entry without having to make up an entire new one by hand .
I ’m not really going to cover this , except to mention it .
I do n’t really understand all the termcap stuff so I ca n’t talk about it too much .
But if you know that you need to edit the terminal settings , screen will let you do that .
Here ’s an example out of the system default :
termcap vt100 dl=5\E [M
Startup Windows
You can specify all sorts of windows to start up when you run screen .
Just list them in your . screenrc file with the screen command , like so :
screen 0 ssh chris@ziggy -e pine screen 1 vim ~/ src/ manos / src/kern/GNUmakefile screen 2 ssh -X root@unit
Fancy Status Line
Earlier , I mentioned that you could have a constant display of what windows are open , to make switching between them faster .
You do this with the hardstatus line .
By default , status goes up into the titlebar of an xterm , or down at the bottom of the screen on the console .
However , you can force that status line to always stay at the bottom of the screen by adding this to your . screenrc :
hardstatus on hardstatus alwayslastline
Then you just need to set up a statusline string that displays the information you want .
The following statusline displays a list of all the windows and their numbers on the left side , and the date and time on the right side :
hardstatus string " %w%=%m/%d % c "
Of course , these status lines can get much more complicated including colors , output of random programs , and so forth .
See the man page section “ STRING ESCAPES ” for details .
Conclusion
screen is a complex and powerful program for managing interactive console programs , similar to how a window manager handles graphical programs .
screen is more powerful than a window manager , though , because it allows you to attach and detach from the running programs as much as you want .
I ’ve only covered a few of its many features in this presentation .
The man page is far more detailed .
Will The Quarantine 15 Become The Quarantine 30 by Christmas ?
What to Do About It Right Now !
BY now , it 's almost a truism : the protectionist agricultural farm policies of the big , rich nations -- mainly the European Union , the United States and Japan -- are essentially barring poor countries from development .
That belief is what led to much of the bickering last week between trade ministers from rich and poor countries at the World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong .
Many development advocates argued that subsidies and tariff protections for farmers in industrialized countries lock poor farmers out of the rich world market .
" High tariffs keep them out of key markets , and tariffs and subsidies together drive down the world price of their exports , " wrote Paul Wolfowitz , the head of the World Bank , in a recent opinion article in The Los Angeles Times .
" Without the income that trade could provide , it is their children who go hungry and who are deprived of clean water , medicines and other basic necessities of life . "
Virtually every economist will agree that agriculture is one of the world economy 's most distorted sectors , and that dismantling industrialized nations ' farm supports would give many farmers in the developing world better access to markets in wealthy countries .
However , some economists are warning that if the industrialized world ends its farm subsidies and lowers its tariff barriers to agricultural imports , poor countries may not be helped , but harmed .

There are over 60 complementary medicine courses taught in universities
There are now 61 complementary medicine courses of which 45 are science degrees , the Nature journal reported .
University College London Professor David Colquhoun urged watchdogs to act , as complementary medicine was not based on scientific evidence .
But supporters of the approach said the views were a " sweeping generalisation " .
COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
The term complementary - or alternative - medicine covers therapies such as homeopathy , acupuncture or reflexology
For a medicine to be used in conventional medicine , it must go through scientific trials where its effectiveness has to be proven
But these techniques often fail to show how complementary medicine works Advocates say new research is beginning to prove the case , but many medics , including the British Medical Association , believe there should be tougher regulation of the practice
Professor Colquhoun , of the university 's department of pharmacology , cited the example of homeopathy .
He said it had barely changed since the start of the 19th Century and was " more like religion than science " .
He also pointed out that some supporters of nutritional therapy have been known to claim that changes in diet can cure Aids .
He said the teaching of complementary medicine under a science banner was worse than " Mickey Mouse " degrees in golf management and baking that have sprung up in recent years as " they do what it says on the label " .
" That is quite different from awarding BSc degrees in subjects that are not science at all , but are positively anti-science .
" Yet this sort of gobbledygook is being taught in some UK universities as though it were science . "
He suggested it would be better if courses in aromatherapy , acupuncture , herbal medicine , reflexology , naturopathy and traditional Chinese medicine were taught as part of a cultural history or sociological course .
Degrees
And Prof Colquhoun said the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education ( QAA ) should be taking action to stop these courses being classed as science degrees .
The watchdog is in charge of ensuring the standards of degrees on offer ; and , while it cannot demand universities change the courses they offer , its reviews can lead to funding being withdrawn .
A spokeswoman for the QAA said there were no serious concerns about degrees being offered .
The Prince 's Foundation for Integrated Health , a group set up by Prince Charles to promote complementary therapy , said there was increasing evidence alternative therapies worked and where there was no proof it did not necessarily mean that there would never be .
Foundation chief executive Kim Lavely added : " The enormous demand from the public for complementary treatments means that we need more research into why and how patients are benefiting .
" Scientists should want to explore this rather than make sweeping , absolutist generalisations arising from deeply held prejudice as David Colquhoun does in this article . "
Or do n't .
It 's up to you , really .
Last year our intelligence community produced  at the request of Congress  a National Intelligence Estimate , which , inter alia , addressed Iran ’s nuclear programs .
Although that 2005 NIE was highly classified , Dafna Linzer reported ,
" A major U.S. intelligence review has projected that Iran is about a decade away from manufacturing the key ingredient for a nuclear weapon , roughly doubling the previous estimate of five years , according to government sources with firsthand knowledge of the new analysis .
" The carefully hedged assessments , which represent consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies , contrast with forceful public statements by the White House .
Administration officials have asserted , but have not offered proof , that Tehran is moving determinedly toward a nuclear arsenal . "
Linzer did n’t say whether the 2005 NIE on Iran ’s nuclear programs was based  as it should have been  on the quarterly reports the International Atomic Energy Agency had been making to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the UN Security Council .
Notwithstanding Linzer ’s devastating report of the 2005 NIE “ assessments , ” coupled with the “ null ” findings included in IAEA quarterly reports , members of the Cheney Cabal have continued to forcefully assert  without offering any proof whatsoever  that Iran has a nuclear weapons program that has already “ reached a point of no return . ”
Then , last month , Linzer told us :
" A key House committee issued a stinging critique of U.S. intelligence on Iran [ . pdf ] yesterday , charging that the CIA and other agencies lack ‘ the ability to acquire essential information necessary to make judgments ’ on Tehran ’s nuclear program , its intentions or even its ties to terrorism .
" The 29 - page report , principally written by a Republican staff member on the House intelligence committee who holds a hard - line view on Iran , fully backs the White House position that the Islamic republic is moving forward with a nuclear weapons program and that it poses a significant danger to the United States .
But it chides the intelligence community for not providing enough direct evidence to support that assertion . "
That “ critique ” was soon made public .
In his cover letter , Subcommittee on Intelligence Policy Chairman Mike Rogers noted that “ the authors could not discuss in an unclassified document the specifics of the significant gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the various areas of concern about Iran , ” but assured us that the report reflected “ committee staff ” reviews of “ classified and unclassified material ” and consultations “ with experts both in the United States and abroad . ”
If that is the case , how could the committee staff have possibly led off with a statement that “ America ’s intelligence agencies ” have “ assessed ” that “ Iran has conducted a clandestine uranium enrichment program for nearly two decades in violation of its IAEA safeguards agreement ” and that “ despite its claims to the contrary , Iran is seeking nuclear weapons ” ?
If “ America ’s intelligence agencies ” have actually made such assessments in highly classified reports to which committee staff had access , then America and its intelligence community really are in a heap of trouble .
In the first place , it is not up to America to assess whether Iran ’s safeguarded programs are being conducted in consonance with Iran ’s Safeguards Agreement .
That is up to the IAEA Secretariat , and some disputes between the Iranians and IAEA inspectors about the conduct of such programs have been decided in Iran ’s favor .
In any case , the American assessment is wrong , because the Iranians were under no obligation to inform the IAEA of its attempt to achieve a uranium - enrichment capability  including the acquisition , however clandestinely , of gas centrifuges  until six months before actually introducing “ special nuclear materials ” into those centrifuges .
As the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons makes clear , a “ violation ” of the NPT - IAEA Safeguards Agreement could only occur if the IAEA verifies the “ diversion ” of “ source or special nuclear materials ” to the “ furtherance of a military purpose . ”
For years now , the IAEA has been reporting there is not even an “ indication ” that Iran has ever done that .
Now comes Linzer to report :
" UN inspectors investigating Iran ’s nuclear program angrily complained to the Bush administration and to a Republican congressman yesterday about a recent House committee report on Iran ’s capabilities , calling parts of the document ‘ outrageous and dishonest ’ and offering evidence to refute its central claims . "
In particular , the IAEA formal complaint refutes the report ’s assertion that Iran is producing “ weapons - grade ” enriched uranium .
The IAEA also charges the report ’s description of certain of Iran ’s activities  in particular , the reported “ covert ” production of polonium - 210  are misleading since Iran was under no obligation under its Safeguards Agreement to report such activities .
“ Outrageous and dishonest ” ?
You bet !

The mystery of the malformed command - line flags
Today a user came to tell me that their command
greenlight submit branch - name -- require - review - by skordokott
failed , saying :
** ** unexpected extra argument ' branch - name ' to ' submit ' command **
This is surprising .
The command looks correct .
The branch name is required .
The -- require - review - by option can be supplied any number of times ( including none ) and each must have a value provided .
Here it is given once and the provided value appears to be skordocott .
The greenlight command is a crappy shell script that pre-validates the arguments before sending them over the network to the real server .
I guessed that the crappy shell script parser wanted the branch name last , even though the server itself would have been happy to take the arguments in either order .
I suggested that the user try :
greenlight submit -- require - review - by skordokott branch - name
But it still did n't work :
** ** unexpected extra argument '- - require - review - by ' to ' submit ' command **
I dug in to the script and discovered the problem , which was not actually a programming error .
The crappy shell script was behaving correctly !
I had written up release notes for the - - require - review - by feature .
The user had clipboard - copied the option string out of the release notes and pasted it into the shell .
So why did n't it work ?
In an earlier draft of the release notes , when they were displayed as an HTML page , there would be bad line breaks :
blah blah blah be sure to use the -
- require - review - by option …
or :
blah blah blah the new --
require - review - by feature is …
No problem , I can fix it !
I just changed the pair of hyphens ( - U+002D ) at the beginning of -- require - review - by to Unicode nonbreaking hyphens ( ‑ U+2011 ) .
Bad line breaks begone !
But then this hapless user clipboard - copied the option string out of the release notes , including its U+2011 characters .
The parser in the script was ( correctly ) looking for U+002D characters , and did n't recognize -- require - review - by as an option flag .
One lesson learned : people will copy - paste stuff out of documentation , and I should be prepared for that .
There are several places to address this .
I made the error message more transparent ; formerly it would complain only about the first argument , which was confusing because it was the one argument that was n't superfluous .
Now it will say something like
** ** extra branch name '- - require - review - by ' in ' submit ' command ** ** ** extra branch name ' skordokott ' in ' submit ' command **
which is more descriptive of what it actually does n't like .
I could change the nonbreaking hyphens in the release notes back to regular hyphens and just accept the bad line breaks .
But I do n't want to .
Typography is important .
One idea I 'm toying with is to have the shell script silently replace all nonbreaking hyphens with regular ones before any further processing .
It 's a hack , but it seems like it might be a harmless one .
So many weird things can go wrong .
This computer stuff is really complicated .
I do n't know how anyone get anything done .
[ Addendum : A reader suggests that I could have fixed the line breaks with CSS .
But the release notes were being presented as a Slack “ Post ” , which is essentially a WYSIWYG editor for creating shared documents .
It presents the document in a canned HTML style , and as far as I know there 's no way to change the CSS it uses .
Similarly , there 's no way to insert raw HTML elements , so no way to change the style per-element . ]

Weasel words in headlines
The front page of NPR.org today has this headline :
It contains this annoying phrase :
The race for Joni Ernst 's seat could help determine control of the Senate .
Someone has really committed to hedging .
I would have said that the race would certainly help determine control of the Senate , or that it could determine control of the Senate .
The statement as written makes an extremely weak claim .
The article itself does n't include this phrase .
This is why reporters hate headline - writers .

Historical diffusion of words for “ eggplant ”
In reply to my recent article about the history of words for “ eggplant ” , a reader , Lydia , sent me this incredible map they had made that depicts the history and the diffusion of the terms :
Lydia kindly gave me permission to share their map with you .
You can see the early Dravidian term vaḻutanaṅṅa in India , and then the arrows show it travelling westward across Persia and , Arabia , from there to East Africa and Europe , and from there to the rest of the world , eventually making its way back to India as brinjal before setting out again on yet more voyages .
Thank you very much , Lydia !
And Happy Diada Nacional de Catalunya , everyone !

Zucchinis and Eggplants
This morning Katara asked me why we call these vegetables “ zucchini ” and “ eggplant ” but the British call them “ courgette ” and “ aubergine ” .
I have only partial answers , and the more I look , the more complicated they get .
Zucchini
The zucchini is a kind of squash , which means that in Europe it is a post-Columbian import from the Americas .
“ Squash ” itself is from Narragansett , and is not related to the verb “ to squash ” .
So I speculate that what happened here was :
American colonists had some name for the zucchini , perhaps derived from an Narragansett or another Algonquian language , or perhaps just “ green squash ” or “ little gourd ” or something like that .
A squash is not exactly a gourd , but it 's not exactly not a gourd either , and the Europeans seem to have accepted it as a gourd ( see below ) .
When the vegetable arrived in France , the French named it courgette , which means “ little gourd ” .
( Courge = “ gourd ” . )
Then the Brits borrowed “ courgette ” from the French .
Sometime much later , the Americans changed the name to “ zucchini ” , which also means “ little gourd ” , this time in Italian .
( Zucca = “ gourd ” . )
The Big Dictionary has citations for “ zucchini ” only back to 1929 , and “ courgette ” to 1931 .
What was this vegetable called before that ?
Why did the Americans start calling it “ zucchini ” instead of whatever they called it before , and why “ zucchini ” and not “ courgette ” ?
If it was brought in by Italian immigrants , one might expect to the word to have appeared earlier ; the mass immigration of Italians into the U.S. was over by 1920 .
Following up on this thought , I found a mention of it in Cuniberti , J. Lovejoy . , Herndon , J. B. ( 1918 ) .
Practical Italian recipes for American kitchens , p. 18 : “ Zucchini are a kind of small squash for sale in groceries and markets of the Italian neighborhoods of our large cities . ”
Note that Cuniberti explains what a zucchini is , rather than saying something like “ the zucchini is sometimes known as a green summer squash ” or whatever , which suggests that she thinks it will not already be familiar to the readers .
It looks as though the story is : Colonial Europeans in North America stopped eating the zucchini at some point , and forgot about it , until it was re-introduced in the early 20th century by Italian immigrants .
When did the French start calling it courgette ?
When did the Italians start calling it zucchini ?
Is the Italian term a calque of the French , or vice versa ?
Or neither ?
And since courge ( and gourd ) are evidently descended from Latin cucurbita , where did the Italians get zucca ?
So many mysteries .
Eggplant
Here I was able to get better answers .
Unlike squash , the eggplant is native to Eurasia and has been cultivated in western Asia for thousands of years .
The puzzling name “ eggplant ” is because the fruit , in some varieties , is round , white , and egg - sized .
The term “ eggplant ” was then adopted for other varieties of the same plant where the fruit is entirely un -egglike .
“ Eggplant ” in English goes back only to 1767 .
What was it called before that ?
Here the OED was more help .
It gives this quotation , from 1785 :
When this [ sc. its fruit ] is white , it has the name of Egg - Plant .
I inferred that the preceding text described it under a better - known name , so , thanks to the Wonders of the Internet , I looked up the original source :
Melongena or Mad Apple is also of this genus [ solanum ] ; it is cultivated as a curiosity for the largeness and shape of its fruit ; and when this is white , it has the name of Egg Plant ; and indeed it then perfectly resembles a hen 's egg in size , shape , and colour .
( Jean - Jacques Rosseau , Letters on the Elements of Botany , tr. Thos . Martyn 1785 .
Page 202 . ( Wikipedia ) )
The most common term I 've found that was used before “ egg- plant ” itself is “ mad apple ” .
The OED has cites from the late 1500s that also refer to it as a “ rage apple ” , which is a calque of French pomme de rage .
I do n't know how long it was called that in French .
I also found “ Malum Insanam ” in the 1736 Lexicon technicum of John Harris , entry “ Bacciferous Plants ” .
Melongena was used as a scientific genus name around 1700 and later adopted by Linnaeus in 1753 .
I can't find any sign that it was used in English colloquial , non-scientific writing .
Its etymology is a whirlwind trip across the globe .
Here 's what the OED says about it :
The neo -Latin scientific term is from medieval Latin melongena
Latin melongena is from medieval Greek μελιντζάνα ( / melintzána / ) , a variant of Byzantine Greek ματιζάνιον ( / matizánion / ) probably inspired by the common Greek prefix μελανο - ( / melano - / ) “ dark - colored ” .
( Akin to “ melanin ” for example . )
Greek ματιζάνιον is from Arabic bāḏinjān ( بَاذِنْجَان ) .
( The -ιον suffix is a diminutive . )
Arabic bāḏinjān is from Persian bādingān ( بادنگان )
Persian bādingān is from Sanskrit and Pali vātiṅgaṇa ( भण्टाकी )
Sanskrit vātiṅgaṇa is from Dravidian ( for example , Malayalam is vaḻutana ( വഴുതന ) ; the OED says “ compare … Tamil vaṟutuṇai ” , which I could not verify . )
Wowzers .
Okay , now how do we get to “ aubergine ” ?
The list above includes Arabic bāḏinjān , and this , like many Arabic words was borrowed into Spanish , as berengena or alberingena .
( The “ al - ” prefix is Arabic for “ the ” and is attached to many such borrowings , for example “ alcohol ” and “ alcove ” . )
From alberingena it 's a short step to French aubergine .
The OED entry for aubergine does n't mention this .
It claims that aubergine is from “ Spanish alberchigo , alverchiga , ‘ an apricocke ’ ” .
I think it 's clear that the OED blew it here , and I think this must be the first time I 've ever been confident enough to say that .
Even the OED itself supports me on this : the note at the entry for brinjal says : “ cognate with the Spanish alberengena is the French aubergine ” .
Okay then .
( Brinjal , of course , is a contraction of berengena , via Portuguese bringella . )
Sanskrit vātiṅgaṇa is also the ultimate source of modern Hindi baingan , as in baingan bharta .
( Was n't there a classical Latin word for eggplant ?
If so , what was it ?
Did n't the Romans eat eggplant ?
How do you conquer the world without any eggplants ? )
[ Addendum :
My search for antedatings of “ zucchini ” turned up some surprises .
For example , I found what seemed to be many mentions in an 1896 history of Sicily .
These turned out not to be about zucchini at all , but rather the computer 's pathetic attempts at recognizing the word Σικελίαν . ]
[ Addendum 20200831 : Another surprise : Google Books and Hathi Trust report that “ zucchini ” appears in the 1905 Collier Modern Eclectic Dictionary of the English Langauge , but it's an incredible OCR failure for the word “ acclamation ” . ]
[ Addendum 20200911 : A reader , Lydia , sent me a beautiful map showing the evolution of the many words for ‘ eggplant ’ .

Conyngus in gravé
Ripta Pasay brought to my attention the English cookbook Liber Cure Cocorum , published sometime between 1420 and 1440 .
The recipes are conveyed as poems :
Conyngus in gravé .
Sethe welle þy conyngus in water clere ,
After , in water colde þou wasshe hom sere ,
Take mylke of almondes , lay hit anone
With myed bred or amydone ;
Fors hit with cloves or gode gyngere ;
Boyle hit over þo fyre ,
Hew þo conyngus , do hom þer to ,
Seson hit with wyn or sugur þo .
( Original plus translation by Cindy Renfrow )
“ Conyngus ” is a rabbit ; English has the cognate “ coney ” .
If you have read my article on how to read Middle English you wo n't have much trouble with this .
There are a few obsolete words : sere means “ separately ” ; myed bread is bread crumbs , and amydone is starch .
I translate it ( very freely ) as follows :
Rabbit in gravy .
Boil well your rabbits in clear water ,
then wash them separately in cold water .
Take almond milk , put it on them
with grated bread or starch ;
stuff them with cloves or good ginger ;
boil them over the fire ,
cut them up ,
and season with wine or sugar .
Thanks , Ripta !

U+09F5 ( e0 a 7 b5 ) : BENGALI CURRENCY NUMERATOR TWO [ ৵ ]

U+09F7 ( e0 a 7 b7 ) : BENGALI CURRENCY NUMERATOR FOUR [ ৷ ]
U+09F8 ( e0 a 7 b8 ) : BENGALI CURRENCY NUMERATOR ONE LESS THAN THE DENOMINATOR [ ৸ ]
U+09F9 ( e0 a 7 b9 ) : BENGALI CURRENCY DENOMINATOR SIXTEEN [ ৹ ]
Oh boy , more base - four fractions !
What on earth does “ NUMERATOR ONE LESS THAN THE DENOMINATOR ” mean and how is it used ?
An explanation appears in the Unicode proposal to add the related “ ganda ” sign :
U+09 FB ( e0 a 7 bb ) : BENGALI GANDA MARK [ ৻ ]
( Anshuman Pandey , “ Proposal to Encode the Ganda Currency Mark for Bengali in the BMP of the UCS ” , 2007 . )
Pandey explains : prior to decimalization , the Bengali rupee ( rupayā ) was divided into sixteen ānā .
Standard Bengali numerals were used to write rupee amounts , but there was a special notation for ānā .
The sign ৹ always appears , and means sixteenths .
Then .
Prefixed to this is a numerator symbol , which goes ৴ , ৵ , ৶ , ৷ for 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
So for example , 3 ānā is written ৶৹ , which means !!\ frac3 {16} !!.
The larger fractions are made by adding the numerators , grouping by 4's :
৴ ৵ ৶ 1 , 2 , 3 ৷ ৷৴ ৷৵ ৷৶ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ৷৷ ৷৷৴ ৷৷৵ ৷৷৶ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ৸ ৸৴ ৸৵ ৸৶ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15
except that three fours ( ৷৷৷ ) is too many , and is abbreviated by the intriguing NUMERATOR ONE LESS THAN THE DENOMINATOR sign ৸ when more than 11 ānā are being written .
Historically , the ānā was divided into 20 gaṇḍā ; the gaṇḍā amounts are written with standard ( Benagli decimal ) numerals instead of the special - purpose base - 4 numerals just described .
The gaṇḍā sign ৻ precedes the numeral , so 4 gaṇḍā (!!\frac15 !! ānā ) is wrtten as ৻ ৪ .
( The ৪ is not an 8 , it is a four . )
What if you want to write 17 rupees plus !!9\frac15 !! ānā ?
That is 17 rupees plus 9 ānā plus 4 gaṇḍā .
If I am reading this report correctly , you write it this way :
১৭৷৷৴৻৪
This breaks down into three parts as ১৭ ৷৷৴ ৻ ৪ .
The ১৭ is a 17 , for 17 rupees ; the ৷৷৴ means 9 ānā ( the denominator ৹ is left implicit ) and the ৻৪ means 4 gaṇḍā , as before .
There is no separator between the rupees and the ānā .
But there does n't need to be , because different numerals are used !
An analogous imaginary system in Latin script would be to write the amount as
17dda¢4
where the ‘ 17 ’ means 17 rupees , the ‘ dda ’ means 4+4+1=9 ānā , and the ¢4 means 4 gaṇḍā .
There is no trouble seeing where the ‘ 17 ’ ends and the ‘ dda ’ begins .
Pandey says there was an even smaller unit , the kaṛi .
It was worth ¼ of a gaṇḍā and was again written with the special base - 4 numerals , but as if the gaṇḍā had been divided into 16 .
A complete amount might be written with decimal numerals for the rupees , base - 4 numerals for the ānā , decimal numerals again for the gaṇḍā , and base - 4 numerals again for the kaṛi .
No separators are needed , because each section is written symbols that are different from the ones in the adjoining sections .

Recommended reading : Matt Levine ’s Money Stuff
Lately my favorite read has been Matt Levine ’s Money Stuff articles from Bloomberg News .
Bloomberg 's web site requires a subscription but you can also get the Money Stuff articles as an occasional email .
It arrives at most once per day .
Almost every issue teaches me something interesting I did n't know , and almost every issue makes me laugh .
Example of something interesting : a while back it was all over the news that oil prices were negative .
Levine was there to explain what was really going on and why .
Some people manage index funds .
They are not trying to beat the market , they are trying to match the index .
So they buy derivatives that give them the right to buy oil futures contracts at whatever the day 's closing price is .
But say they already own a bunch of oil contracts .
If they can get the close - of - day price to dip , then their buy - at - the - end - of - the - day contracts will all be worth more because the counterparties have contracted to buy at the dip price .
How can you get the price to dip by the end of the day ?
Easy , unload 20 % of your contracts at a bizarre low price , to make the value of the other 80 % spike … it makes my head swim .
But there are weird second - and third - order effects too .
Normally if you invest fifty million dollars in oil futures speculation , there is a worst - case : the price of oil goes to zero and you lose your fifty million dollars .
But for these derivative futures , the price could in theory become negative , and for short time in April , it did :
If the ETF ’s oil futures go to - $ 37.63 a barrel , as some futures did recently , the ETF investors lose $ 20 — their entire investment — and , uh , oops ?
The ETF runs out of money when the futures hit zero ; someone else has to come up with the other $ 37.63 per barrel .
One article I particularly remember discussed the kerfuffle a while back concerning whether Kelly Loeffler improperly traded stocks on classified coronavirus - related intelligence that she received in her capacity as a U.S. senator .
I found Levine 's argument persuasive :
“ I did n’t dump stocks , I am a well - advised rich person , someone else manages my stocks , and they dumped stocks without any input from me ” … is a good defense !
It ’s not insider trading if you do n’t trade ; if your investment manager sold your stocks without input from you then you ’re fine .
Of course they could be lying , but in context the defense seems pretty plausible .
( Kelly Loeffler , for instance , controversially dumped about 0.6 % of her portfolio at around the same time , which sure seems like the sort of thing an investment adviser would do without any input from her ?
You could call your adviser and say “ a disaster is coming , sell everything ! , ” but calling them to say “ a disaster is coming , sell a tiny bit ! ” seems pointless . )
He contrasted this case with that of Richard Burr , who , unlike Loeffler , remains under investigation .
The discussion was factual and informative , unlike what you would get from , say , Twitter , or even Metafilter , where the response was mostly limited to variations on “ string them up ” and “ eat the rich ” .
Money Stuff is also very funny .
Today ’s letter discusses a disclosure filed recently by Nikola Corporation :
More impressive is that Nikola ’s revenue for the second quarter was very small , just $ 36,000 .
Most impressive , though , is how they earned that revenue : During the three months ended June 30 , 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded solar revenues of $ 0.03 million and $ 0.04 million , respectively , for the provision of solar installation services to the Executive Chairman , which are billed on time and materials basis .
…
“ Solar installation projects are not related to our primary operations and are expected to be discontinued , ” says Nikola , but I guess they are doing one last job , specifically installing solar panels at founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton ’s house ?
It is a $ 13 billion company whose only business so far is doing odd jobs around its founder ’s house .
A couple of recent articles that cracked me up discussed clueless day - traders pushing up the price of Hertz stock after Hertz had declared bankruptcy , and how Hertz diffidently attempted to get the SEC to approve a new stock issue to cater to these idiots .
( The SEC said no . )
One recurring theme in the newsletter is “ Everything is Securities Fraud ” .
This week , Levine asks :
Is it securities fraud for a public company to pay bribes to public officials in exchange for lucrative public benefits ?
Of course you 'd expect that the executives would be criminally charged , as they have been .
But is there a cause for the company ’s shareholders to sue ?
If you follow the newsletter , you know what the answer will be :
Oh absolutely …
because Everything is Securities Fraud .
Still it is a little weird .
Paying bribes to get public benefits is , you might think , the sort of activity that benefits shareholders .
Sure they were deceived , and sure the stock price was too high because investors thought the company ’s good performance was more legitimate and sustainable than it was , etc. , but the shareholders are strange victims .
In effect , executives broke the law in order to steal money for the shareholders , and when the shareholders found out they sued ?
It seems a little ungrateful ?
I recommend it .
Levine also has a Twitter account but it is mostly just links to his newsletter articles .
[ Addendum 20200821 : Unfortunately , just a few days after I posted this , Matt Levin announced that his newletter would be on hiatus for a few months , as he would be on paternity leave .
Sorry ! ]

A maybe - interesting number trick ?
I 'm not sure if this is interesting , trivial , or both .
You decide .
Let 's divide the numbers from 1 to 30 into the following six groups :
A 1 2 4 8 16 B 3 6 12 17 24 C 5 9 10 18 20 D 7 14 19 25 28 E 11 13 21 22 26 F 15 23 27 29 30
Choose any two rows .
Chose a number from each row , and multiply them mod 31 .
( That is , multiply them , and if the product is 31 or larger , divide it by 31 and keep the remainder . )
Regardless of which two numbers you chose , the result will always be in the same row .
For example , any two numbers chosen from rows B and D will multiply to yield a number in row E .
If both numbers are chosen from row F , their product will always appear in row A .

Flappers
Gulliver 's Travels ( 1726 ) , Part III , chapter 2 :
I observed , here and there , many in the habit of servants , with a blown bladder , fastened like a flail to the end of a stick , which they carried in their hands .
In each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas , or little pebbles , as I was afterwards informed .
With these bladders , they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them , of which practice I could not then conceive the meaning .
It seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations , that they neither can speak , nor attend to the discourses of others , without being roused by some external action upon the organs of speech and hearing … .
This flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks , and upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes ; because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation , that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice , and bouncing his head against every post ; and in the streets , of justling others , or being justled himself into the kennel .
When I first told Katara about this , several years ago , instead of “ the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations ” I said they were obsessed with their phones .
Now the phones themselves have become the flappers :
Our minds are not even taken up with intense speculations , but with Instagram .
Dean Swift would no doubt be disgusted .

How are finite fields constructed ?
Here 's another recent Math Stack Exchange answer I 'm pleased with .
OP asked :
I know this question has been asked many times and there is good information out there which has clarified a lot for me but I still do not understand how the addition and multiplication tables for !!
GF ( 4 ) !! is constructed ?
I 've seen [ links ] but none explicity explain the construction and I 'm too new to be told " its an extension of !!
GF ( 2 ) !! "
The only “ reasonable ” answer here is “ get an undergraduate abstract algebra text and read the chapter on finite fields ” .
Because come on , you can't expect some random stranger to appear and write up a detailed but short explanation at your exact level of knowledge .
But sometimes Internet Magic Lightning strikes and that 's what you do get !
And OP set themselves up to be struck by magic lightning , because you can't get a detailed but short explanation at your exact level of knowledge if you do n't provide a detailed but short explanation of your exact level of knowledge — and this person did just that .
They understand finite fields of prime order , but not how to construct the extension fields .
No problem , I can explain that !
I had special fun writing this answer because I just love constructing extensions of finite fields .
( Previously : [ 1 ] [ 2 ] )
For any given !!n!! , there is at most one field with !!n!!
elements : only one , if !!n!!
is a power of a prime number ( !!2 , 3 , 2^2 , 5 , 7 , 2^3 , 3^2 , 11 , 13 , \ldots !! ) and none otherwise ( !!6 , 10 , 12 , 14\ldots !! ) .
This field with !!n!!
elements is written as !!\Bbb F_n !!
or as !!GF ( n ) !!.
Suppose we want to construct !!\Bbb F_n !!
where !!n=p^k !!.
When !!k=1 !! , this is easy - peasy : take the !!n!!
elements to be the integers !!0 , 1 , 2\ldots p-1 !! , and the addition and multiplication are done modulo !!n!!.
When !!k>1 !! it is more interesting .
One possible construction goes like this :
The elements of !!\Bbb F_{p^k} !!
are the polynomials $ $ a_{k - 1}x ^ {k - 1} + a_{k - 2}x ^{k - 2} + \ldots + a_ 1x+a_0 $ $ where the coefficients !!a_i!! are elements of !!\Bbb F_p !!.
That is , the coefficients are just integers in !!{0 , 1 , \ldots p - 1} !! , but with the understanding that the addition and multiplication will be done modulo !!p!!.
Note that there are !!
p^k !! of these polynomials in total .
Addition of polynomials is done exactly as usual : combine like terms , but remember that the the coefficients are added modulo !!p!!
because they are elements of !!\Bbb F_p !!.
Multiplication is more interesting : a .
Pick an irreducible polynomial !!P!! of degree !!k!!. “ Irreducible ” means that it does not factor into a product of smaller polynomials .
How to actually locate an irreducible polynomial is an interesting question ; here we will mostly ignore it .
b.
To multiply two elements , multiply them normally , remembering that the coefficients are in !!\Bbb F_p !!.
Divide the product by !!P!!
and keep the remainder .
Since !!P!! has degree !!k!! , the remainder must have degree at most !!k-1 !! , and this is your answer .
Now we will see an example : we will construct !!\Bbb F_ { 2^2} !!.
Here !!k=2 !! and !!p=2 !!.
The elements will be polynomials of degree at most 1 , with coefficients in !!\Bbb F_2 !!.
There are four elements : !!0x+0 , 0x+1 , 1x+0 , !! and !!1x+1 !!.
As usual we will write these as !!0 , 1 , x , x+1 !!.
This will not be misleading .
Addition is straightforward : combine like terms , remembering that !!1+1=0 !! because the coefficients are in !!\Bbb F_2 !!:
$ $\begin{array}{c|cccc} + & 0 & 1 & x & x+1 \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 1 & x & x+1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & x+1 & x \\ x & x & x+1 & 0 & 1 \\ x+1 & x+1 & x & 1 & 0 \end{array} $ $
The multiplication as always is more interesting .
We need to find an irreducible polynomial !!P!!.
It so happens that !!
P=x ^2+x+1 !! is the only one that works .
( If you did n't know this , you could find out easily : a reducible polynomial of degree 2 factors into two linear factors .
So the reducible polynomials are !!x ^ 2 , x ·( x+1 ) = x ^2+x !! , and !!( x+1 ) ^2 = x ^2+2x+1 = x ^2+1 !!.
That leaves only !!x ^2+x+1 !!.)
To multiply two polynomials , we multiply them normally , then divide by !!x ^2+x+1 !! and keep the remainder .
For example , what is !!( x+1 ) ( x+1 ) !!?
It 's !!x ^2+2x+1 = x ^2 + 1 !!.
There is a theorem from elementary algebra ( the “ division theorem ” ) that we can find a unique quotient !!Q!!
and remainder !!R !! , with the degree of !!R!!
less than 2 , such that !!
PQ+R = x ^2+1 !!.
In this case , !!Q=1 , R=x !! works .
( You should check this . )
Since !!
R=x !!
this is our answer : !!( x+1 ) ( x+1 ) = x !!.
Let 's try !!x·x = x ^2 !!.
We want !!
PQ+R = x ^2 !! , and it happens that !!
Q=1 , R=x+1 !! works .
So !!x·x = x+1 !!.
I strongly recommend that you calculate the multiplication table yourself .
But here it is if you want to check :
$ $\begin{array}{c|cccc} · & 0 & 1 & x & x+1 \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & x & x+1 \\ x & 0 & x & x+1 & 1 \\ x+1 & 0 & x+1 & 1 & x \end{array} $ $
To calculate the unique field !!\Bbb F_ { 2^3} !!
of order 8 , you let the elements be the 8 second - degree polynomials !!0 , 1 , x , \ldots , x ^2+x , x ^2+x+1 !!
and instead of reducing by !!x ^2+x+1 !! , you reduce by !!x ^3+x+1 !!.
( Not by !!x ^3+x ^2+x+1 !! , because that factors as !!( x ^ 2+1 ) ( x+1 ) !!.)
To calculate the unique field !!\Bbb F_{3^2} !! of order 27 , you start with the 27 third - degree polynomials with coefficients in !!{ 0,1,2} !! , and you reduce by !!x ^3+2x+1 !!
( I think ) .
The special notation !!\Bbb F_p[ x ] !!
means the ring of all polynomials with coefficients from !!\Bbb F_p !!. !!\langle P \rangle !!
means the ring of all multiples of polynomial !!P!!.
( A ring is a set with an addition , subtraction , and multiplication defined . )
When we write !!\Bbb F_p[x ] / \langle P\rangle !!
we are constructing a thing called a “ quotient ” structure .
This is a generalization of the process that turns the ordinary integers !!\Bbb Z !!
into the modular - arithmetic integers we have been calling !!\Bbb F_p !!.
To construct !!\Bbb F_p !! , we start with !!\Bbb Z !! and then agree that two elements of !!\Bbb Z !! will be considered equivalent if they differ by a multiple of !!p!!.
To get !!\ Bbb F_p[x ] / \langle P \rangle !!
we start with !!\Bbb F_p[ x ] !! , and then agree that elements of !!\Bbb F_p[ x ] !!
will be considered equivalent if they differ by a multiple of !!P!!.
The division theorem guarantees that of all the equivalent polynomials in a class , exactly one of them will have degree less than that of !!P!! , and that is the one we choose as a representative of its class and write into the multiplication table .
This is what we are doing when we “ divide by !!P!! and keep the remainder ” .
A particularly important example of this construction is !!\ Bbb R[x ] / \langle x ^2 + 1 \rangle !!.
That is , we take the set of polynomials with real coefficients , but we consider two polynomials equivalent if they differ by a multiple of !!x ^2 + 1 !!.
By the division theorem , each polynomial is then equivalent to some first - degree polynomial !!ax+b!!.
Let 's multiply $ $ ( ax+b ) ( cx+d ) . $ $
As usual we obtain $ $acx ^2 + ( ad+bc ) x + bd. $ $
From this we can subtract !!
ac( x ^2 + 1 ) !! to obtain the equivalent first - degree polynomial $ $ ( ad+bc ) x + ( bd - ac ) . $ $
Now recall that in the complex numbers , !!( b+ ai ) (d + ci ) = ( bd - ac ) + ( ad+bc ) i !!.
We have just constructed the complex numbers , with the polynomial !!x!!
playing the role of !!i!!.

What does it mean to expand a function “ in powers of x - 1 ” ?
A recent Math Stack Excahnge post was asked to expand the function !!e ^ { 2x} !! in powers of !!( x - 1 ) !!
and was confused about what that meant , and what the point of it was .
I wrote an answer I liked , which I am reproducing here .
You asked :
I do n't understand what are we doing in this whole process
which is a fair question .
I did n't understand this either when I first learned it .
But it 's important for practical engineering reasons as well as for theoretical mathematical ones .
Before we go on , let 's see that your proposal is the wrong answer to this question , because it is the correct answer , but to a different question .
You suggested : $ $e^{2x}\approx1+2\left(x- 1\right ) +2\left( x- 1\right ) ^2+\frac{4}{3}\left(x-1\right ) ^3 $ $
Taking !!x=1 !! we get !!
e ^ 2 \approx 1 !! , which is just wrong , since actually !!e^ 2 \approx 7.39 !!.
As a comment pointed out , the series you have above is for !!e ^ { 2( x -1 ) }!!.
But we wanted a series that adds up to !!e ^ { 2x} !!.
As you know , the Maclaurin series works here :
$ $e^ {2x} \approx 1+2x+2x^2+\frac{4}{3}x^3 $ $
so why do n't we just use it ?
Let 's try !!x=1 !!.
We get $ $e ^2 \approx 1 + 2 + 2 + \ frac43 $ $
This adds to !!6+\frac13 !! , but the correct answer is actually around !!
7.39 !! as we saw before .
That is not a very accurate approximation .
Maybe we need more terms ?
Let 's try ten :
$ $e^ {2x} \approx 1+2x+2x^2+\frac{4}{3}x^3 + \ldots + \ frac{8}{2835}x^9 $ $
If we do this we get !! 7.3887 !! , which is n't too far off .
But it was a lot of work !
And we find that as !!x!!
gets farther away from zero , the series above gets less and less accurate .
For example , take !!x= 3.1 !! , the formula with four terms gives us !!66.14 !! , which is dead wrong .
Even if we use ten terms , we get !!444.3 !! , which is still way off .
The right answer is actually !!492.7 !!.
What do we do about this ?
Just add more terms ?
That could be a lot of work and it might not get us where we need to go .
( Some Maclaurin series just stop working at all too far from zero , and no amount of terms will make them work . )
Instead we use a different technique .
Expanding the Taylor series “ around !!x=a !! ” gets us a different series , one that works best when !!x!!
is close to !!a!!
instead of when !!x!!
is close to zero .
Your homework is to expand it around !!x=1 !! , and I do n't want to give away the answer , so I 'll do a different example .
We 'll expand !!e ^ {2x} !! around !!x=3 !!.
The general formula is $ $e ^ { 2x} \approx \sum \ frac{f ^ { ( i ) } ( 3 ) }{i!} ( x - 3 ) ^i\tag { $ \star$} \ \qquad \text {( when $ x $ is close to $ 3 $ ) } $ $
The !!f^ {( i ) }( x ) !!
is the !!i!!'th derivative of !!
e^ {2x} !! , which is !!
2 ^ie^ {2x} !! , so the first few terms of the series above are :
$ $ \begin{eqnarray} e^{2x} & \approx & e^6 + \ frac{2e ^6}1 ( x - 3 ) + \ frac{4e ^6}{2}( x - 3 ) ^2 + \ frac{8e ^6}{6}( x - 3 ) ^3\\ & = & e^6 \left ( 1+ 2( x - 3 ) + 2 ( x - 3 ) ^2 + \ frac34( x - 3 ) ^3 \right ) \\ & & \qquad \text {( when $x $ is close to $ 3 $ ) } \end{eqnarray} $ $
The first thing to notice here is that when !!x!!
is exactly !!3 !! , this series is perfectly correct ; we get !!e^6 = e^6 !!
exactly , even when we add up only the first term , and ignore the rest .
That 's a kind of useless answer because we already knew that !!e^6 = e^6 !!.
But that 's not what this series is for .
The whole point of this series is to tell us how different !!e ^ { 2x} !! is from !!e^6 !! when !!x!!
is close to , but not equal to !!3 !!.
Let 's see what it does at !!x=3.1 !!.
With only four terms we get $ $ \begin{eqnarray} e^{6.2} & \approx & e^6 ( 1 + 2( 0.1 ) + 2( 0.1 ) ^2 + \ frac34( 0.1 ) ^3 ) \\ & = & e^6 \cdot 1.22075 \\ & \approx & 492.486 \end{eqnarray} $ $
which is very close to the correct answer , which is !!492.7 !!.
And that 's with only four terms .
Even if we did n't know an exact value for !!e^6 !! , we could find out that !!e^ { 6.2} !! is about !!22.075\ %!!
larger , with hardly any calculation .
Why did this work so well ?
If you look at the expression !!( \star ) !!
you can see :
The terms of the series all have factors of the form !!( x - 3 ) ^i !!.
When !!x=3.1 !! , these are !!( 0.1 ) ^i !! , which becomes very small very quickly as !!i!!
increases .
Because the later terms of the series are very small , they do n't affect the final sum , and if we leave them out , we wo n't mess up the answer too much .
So the series works well , producing accurate results from only a few terms , when !!x!!
is close to !!3 !!.
But in the Maclaurin series , which is around !!x=0 !! , those !!( x - 3 ) ^i !!
terms are !!x^i !!
terms intead , and when !!x= 3.1 !! , they are not small , they 're very large !
They get bigger as !!i!!
increases , and very quickly .
( The !! i! !!
in the denominator wins , eventually , but that does n't happen for many terms . )
If we leave out these many large terms , we get the wrong results .
The short answer to your question is :
Maclaurin series are only good for calculating functions when !!x!!
is close to !!0 !! , and become inaccurate as !!x!!
moves away from zero .
But a Taylor series around !!a!! has its “ center ” near !!a!!
and is most accurate when !!x!!
is close to !!a!!.

Prehiter izliv semenske tekočine v medicini razumemo kot zmanjšan nadzor nad ejakulacijo , ki se vmešava v kakovost spolnega življenja , čustvovanja in odnosov med obema partnerjema .
Vzrok je psihološki .
Prehiter izliv semenske tekočina , prehitra ejakulacija , ejaculatio praecox pesti veliko moških .
V ZDA so izračunali , da se pojavlja kar pri 30 % moških v vseh starostnih skupinah , najbolj pogosto pa od 18 . do 30.leta .
Delimo jo na primarno – pojavlja se od prvega spolnega odnosa , in sekundarno – pred tem je moški že imel spolne odnose , kjer se ni pojavljala .
Ejakulacija in s tem orgazem naj bi pri moškem v povprečju nastala po 7 – 10 minutah stimulacije , pri ženski pa po 12 – 25 minutah .
Pomen časovnega okvira ejakulacije je individualen in zavisi tudi od stimulacije , potreb , želja partnerke ali partnerja .
Neki moški je morda zadovoljen z ejakulacijo po dveh minutah , drugi pa ni zadovoljen z ejakulacijo po petih minutah stimulacije .
Prehitra ejakulacija poraja pri moškem občutke sramu , krivde , nesamozavesti , strahu , “ nisem dovolj dober ” , zmanjšane želje po spolnih odnosih , nezadovoljstva .
Pri partnerki ali partnerju poraja občutke razočaranja , nezadovoljstva , krivde , zmanjšanje želje po spolnih odnosih .
Možni vzroki
– prevelike zahteve do sebe v spolnosti , performativna anksioznost ;
– travmatske prve spolne izkušnje , občutki krivde zaradi samozadovoljevanja , spolna zloraba ;
– spolnost ne prakticira na varnem kraju ;
– težave v odnosu s partnerjem ;
– depresija ali druge duševne motnje ;
– prevelik stres , socialne , čustvene , ekonomske težave , težave na delovnem mestu .
Družinski zdravnik vas bo po pogovoru poslal na pregled k urologu ali seks terapevtu ( psihiatru , psihologu ) .
Obisk pri psihiatru ali psihologu ne vzemite kot žalitev ali grožnjo , “ da ste nori ” , “ bolni ” temveč kakor izjemno priložnost , da se sami ali s partnerjem resno pogovorite o tej težavi in drugih težavah v svojem življenju ter jih začnete reševati .
Zdravljenje
1. Učenje ustreznejšega reševanja problemov , odprtega odnosa do spolnosti in sprostitvene tehnike proti stresu .
2. Zelo učinkovita “ Stop – start ” ali “ stisni – spusti ” tehnika po Mastersu in Johnsonu .
– Partnerka ročno ali oralno stimullira partnerja .
Ko partner začuti nenadno potrebo po ejakulaciji , partnerka preneha s stimulacijo .
– Trdno stisne partnerjev penis takoj za glavico penisa , najbolj močno pod penisom .
Stiska , dokler partner ne začuti , da ni več potrebe po ejakulaciji .
Nato ga znova stimulira .
– Celoten potek morata partnerja ponoviti približno 10 - krat .
Ko moški izgubi občutek nenadne potrebe po ejakulaciji , lahko partnerka stimulira penis čisto blizu svoje vulve ali vaginalnega vhoda .
Ko zopet pride do nenadne potrebe po ejakulaciji , partnerka odmakne penis in znova stisne nad glavico .
Ko moški tudi tu nadzoruje občutek nenadne potrebe po ejakulaciji , lahko nadaljujeta s koitusom .

Back in the old days of vinyl records , pop groups like The Beatles and Black Sabbath were accused of sneaking satanic messages into songs , which could only be heard when the music was played backward .
Now it seems one of the world 's most popular electronic musicians has discovered the modern digital equivalent .
Aphex Twin , who has been described as " the most inventive and influential figure in contemporary electronic music , " appears to have sneaked the digital image of a devilish face into at least one of his songs .
The spooky image of a creature with a diabolical grin has been accidentally discovered on Aphex Twin 's Windowlicker EP , a 1999 hit .
The sinister face is revealed when the song is played on a computer through special software that visualizes sound waves .
Just like the backward messages on vinyl LPs , the face is secretly encoded in the actual sound waves of the music .
It is n't a separate file on the CD .
The image is the aural equivalent of steganography : the practice of hiding secret messages and watermarks in images .
The existence of the image has not been publicized by Aphex Twin or his record label .
It seems to have been discovered accidentally by an electronic musician who calls himself Chaos Machine .
Chaos Machine was n't available for an interview , but according to his website , he was playing around with WinAmp one evening when he spotted the diabolical face .
His discovery can be reproduced with a sample of the song and some spectrographic software , which displays the different frequencies of the song as a graph against time .
The image does n't appear in an MP3 file of the song ; the compression algorithm destroys the image .
Chaos Machine 's discovery is starting to make the rounds on the Internet , and is fast becoming part of the folklore surrounding hidden messages in pop music .
But it appears Chaos Machine was a bit too quick off the mark .
The song does indeed contain the image of a face , but not a demonic one .
It 's Aphex Twin himself – or Richard James , as he 's known to his parents .
The real image was discovered by a 19 - year - old named Jarmo Niinisalo , who tweaked the settings in his spectrographic software to reveal James ' grinning fizzog .
The procedure is described on Niinisalo 's website .
Niinisalo also discovered three more pattern - like images embedded in songs on the Windowlicker EP .
None of them is sinister .
James apparently created the hidden pictures in his songs using a clever piece of synthesizer software called MetaSynth .
MetaSynth is a Mac-only application that can take any image and generate sounds from it .
The software was widely used in The Matrix to accompany the movie 's mind - bending bullet - speed special effects .
Most musicians who use the application input abstract pictures because they can generate meaningful sounds .
Scanned photographs tend to create a kind of discordant , metallic scratching .
The program 's creator , Eric Wenger , ran pictures of factories through it for some industrial techno compositions .
However they sound , images are readily recreated by running the sounds they generate through any spectrograph software .
Edward Spiegel , the product director of U&I Software , the San Francisco Bay Area company that publishes MetaSynth , said most of Aphex Twin 's Windowlicker was created in MetaSynth .
" It 's definitely MetaSynth , " he said .
" I know ( James ) uses the software .
He 's mentioned it in a number of interviews , and he wrote Eric a fan letter a number of years ago . "
The Windowlicker EP also contains a number of telltale sound effects that are difficult to create in other synthesizer packages , Spiegel said .
However , Spiegel was n't aware of the images embedded in the songs .
James could n't be contacted for an interview , but his face has become his trademark image .
Although he 's somewhat reclusive , James has used warped images of his smiling face in many of his videos and CD cover art .
He gained notoriety a few years ago for a video depicting a gang of feral kids menacing old ladies .
The entire gang sported his face superimposed on their bodies .
The sleeve of Windowlicker shows the body of a buxom bikini - clad beach babe with James ' grinning , bearded face Photoshopped on top .
It seems James is one of the first mainstream musicians to embed images in his music .
Spiegel was unaware of any other examples in popular music .
It would be difficult , however , for the technique to be used by conventional artists .
" It does n't sound a lot like music , " commented Joshua Schachter , who runs Memepool , one of the first websites to publicize the discovery .
" More conventional artists like Britney Spears would have some trouble hiding this . "

Just because KDE has been designed to be portable across Linux ,
FreeBSD and other UNIX / X11 environments for an age now , does n't
mean we are n't up for the occasional challenge .
With version 4 , Trolltech released
Qt for the
Mac , Windows and now even embedded environments under the GPL .
Since
Qt is the base upon which KDE is developed , KDE is now free to
offer native support for these platforms .
Today I am focusing on the KDE / Mac developments for KDE 4 .
Read on for the details .
Before I begin , I 'd like to discuss some branding issues that KDE has had to face in previous releases .
With KDE 3 , does the term " KDE " refer to the Desktop Environment ( KWin , Kicker , kdesktop , etc. ) and if so , would it still be reasonable to refer to the Mac OS X port as " KDE " even if it was without these key desktop components ?
Or , is " KDE " a reference to the project as a whole , in which case we can still call Konqueror a " KDE application " whether it is running on Mac , Windows , or in Enlightenment ...
These are some branding issues that have been discussed for KDE 4 .
The resulting decision has been to refer to " KDE " as the umbrella that refers to all things KDE .
So , as a result , we have KDE Applications , the KDE Development Environment ( libraries and technologies ) , and the KDE Workspace ( this consists of KWin , Plasma , etc. ) that refer to the three main components that make up the collection of KDE software .
When referring to just " KDE " by itself , you therefore refer to all things KDE .
This also solves some issues with alternate release schedules for some applications .
For example , Amarok has often released on a different schedule from KDE , and so some people have not considered it as part of KDE proper .
Amarok for KDE 4 will be more clearly labelled as a " KDE Application " without the related implications of it being restricted to a given desktop environment .
In KDE 4 , Amarok is a KDE product , even if it is based on its own release cycle .
As Amarok lead developer Mark Kretschmann says , " If Amarok convinces more people to use KDE technologies , that 's perfect .
If they use Amarok under other desktop environments like GNOME or Mac OS X , that 's still nice for us . "
Since this article deals with KDE on other platforms than X11 , we need a way to distinguish between KDE for X11 and KDE for Mac .
So , with the approval of some of the developers , I 'm going to use the following terminology : KDE / X11 will refer to all KDE Applications that run on X11 , the Development Environment on X11 , and the KDE Workspace on X11 .
Likewise , KDE / Mac will refer to KDE applications that run on the Mac , the KDE Development Environment on the Mac , and since the workspace is not required on the Mac , it is not included here .
Ditto for Windows .
It is important to realize , however , that these distinctions are based on a subset of features that are available on each platform , and that for the most part the source code is identical , and there are not separate source trees for each platform .
There are no forks or haphazard ports .
New KDE Development Environment technologies like Phonon and Solid will help ease this transition , since the platform - integration work will happen at the library level .
KDE
Applications need not be aware of the differences that might exist in the OS platform .
What is KDE / Mac ?
KDE / Mac is the collection of KDE Applications that run natively on the Mac , including the underlying technologies , libraries , etc. that make these KDE Applications work .
There are only a few differences between KDE / X11 and KDE / Mac .
Most notably , the KDE Workspace elements , such as KWin and Plasma are not present for the Mac .
The reason for this is that the functionality of KWin and Plasma already exist in OS X in one form or another , and reimplementing them would not allow for close integration of KDE Applications alongside existing Mac Applications .
So instead , KDE has elected to not port the KDE / X11 Workspace to the Mac .
Since the beginning of KDE , its applications have been designed in such a way as to peacefully co-exist in other UNIX Desktop environments .
Initially this meant Window Maker , and then later GNOME and Enlightenment .
The KDE Applications use shared standards ( such as those crafted at FreeDesktop.org ) , capable of sharing clipboard data , system tray icons , and so on without any issues on these compliant platforms .
Now , because of the additional portability that Qt 4 offers , this same peaceful co-existence will also be true for non-X11 environments , such as the Mac .
KDE apps have been able to run on the Mac before , using Apple 's X11 server layer that is built into OS X - however , KDE was still using Qt / X11 and as such , these applications simply looked identical to how they would look in good old KDE / X11 proper .
The fact that they ran at all is thanks to the excellent efforts of the Fink project .
If you 're interested in running other UNIX programs on OS X , check this project out .
( For a time there was also a Qt / Mac Freeware edition which allowed some experimentation with a true KDE / Mac experience within the KDE 3.x series .
However , The KDE / X11 version in Fink was usually used due to its stability . )
Here 's a screenshot of a KDE application as it looked using KDE 3.5 and the Fink project 's packages .
Click for the full version .
Because the above was developed for Qt / X11 , the whole KDE environment was able to run .
The downside , however , was that it did not integrate well with the Mac , so it felt like you were running two totally different computer systems on one screen .
Of course , KDE is all about the integration ...
KDE 4 brings great advances to the Mac porting effort , thanks mostly due to Qt 4 , and the new KDE build system , based on CMake .
For KDE 4 , the KDE / Mac applications are downloadable as standard issue , Mac .dmg files , available from the KDE on Mac OS X website .
The KDE / Mac development snapshots are among the easiest to use for any platform , thanks mostly due to the great work done by KDE / Mac guru Benjamin Reed ( a.k.a. RangerRick ) .
Visit # kde - darwin on irc.freenode.org to help report and fix anything you see that is broken .
This is pre-alpha KDE 4 , so it 's likely to crash until more development has taken place .
Once the downloaded packages are unpacked and installed , KDE / Mac applications can be launched using OS X's Finder as shown here :
As you can see , quite a wide variety of applications are already available for the Mac , including most of the official KDE applications .
Because this is a development version , some things are still broken ( like any apps using SSL ) and some things are just plain ugly .
But the same is also true of many KDE 4 apps on KDE / X11 at this point , so expect both offerings to improve throughout the KDE 4 development timeframe .
At the same time , some very important things have occurred in KDE / Mac integration .
For example , the clipboard works .
Keyboard shortcuts work .
Extended language input works .
Some things , like drag - and - drop remain sketchy .
The KDE / Mac developers would welcome any fresh talent that knows a little about KDE and Mac technologies to help solve smaller issues like this .
Here 's what you 've been waiting for : the screenshot tour of a few KDE 4 apps that are working on the Mac to show off some of the progress so far .
Some of these apps will surely be greatly appreciated by Mac users .
Since we 've covered SVG in the first issue , I figured I would show a shot of SVG - goodness in action on the Mac.
Below is Shisen Sho , a tile game that shares loadable SVG tilesets with KMahjongg , which was previously featured .
This game looks beautiful on the Mac , and not at all out of place .
One of the main questions asked last week about KOffice was support for other platforms .
I 'm pleased to say that KWord , KSpread , and the rest of the KOffice suite should run on KDE / Mac just fine .
In the development version I tested , KWord performed pretty much as the KDE / X11 version from last week .
Additionally , I tried loading a few other KOffice applications to see if they work .
Here 's a shot of KSpread 's Wizard , and the KDE 4 file dialog on the Mac .
Also notice how the KSpread icon shows up in the OS X dock .
This did n't previously happen with KDE on Fink ( The icon to the left of it is for kded , one of the KDE background processes , which will eventually be adjusted to hide itself when running on the Mac ) .
Of course , the real question everyone is asking is : does Konqueror work ?
Yes .
The KDE 4 version of the Konqueror application is mostly a port of Konqueror from KDE 3.5 at the moment , but the backend libraries such as the KHTML rendering engine and Javascript support have seen a lot of fixes and improvements .
On the Mac , due to the OS X user interface styling in Qt 4 , we get centred tabs during tabbed browsing , as seen below :
The Mac has made a name for itself as a premier Desktop for graphical and multimedia applications .
Unfortunately , the KDE Graphics package was not included in this snapshot so I can't show it off .
However , another niche that the Mac proudly occupies is that of education .
Below are two of the great applications from the KDE - Edu project : Kalzium and KStars .
New features that are showing up in KDE - Edu will be featured in a later article ... for now , it 's just important to note that these superb applications will be available and fully functional for KDE / Mac .
And now that the tour is done , a couple of other things that come up whenever KDE is discussed on other platforms .
While I was researching this article , I encountered some people that object to running KDE apps on a non-free platform , with sentiments on IRC alike to " Anytime you run OSS on a non- free platform , God kills a puppy .
A cute puppy . "
But KDE has good reasons for supporting other platforms : attracting developers , and fostering interoperability and standards .
There are a huge number of Mac and Windows developers out there and therefore a large amount applications that can take advantage of KDE technologies .
The best example of a KDE technology benefitting from exposure to other platforms is KHTML / WebKit .
As a side effect , since there are so many users of KHTML - based browsers now , websites have had to improve their standards compliance in order to be more compatible , which means more websites work in Konqueror .
This will hopefully also happen with OpenDocument and free software groupware systems as KOffice and Kontact push onto other platforms .
In the meantime , have a look at yesterday 's KDE Commit - Digest for some information on the progress of Windows platform support .
During the Cold War the Army stockpiled thousands of weapons and vehicles in warehouses or aboard huge cargo ships in the Pacific , Atlantic and Indian Oceans .
These trucks , humvees , tanks , artillery and armored personnel carriers constituted our national reserve of weaponry .
Soldiers depend on this equipment should we go to war against an enemy outside Iraq and Afghanistan .
Except for one brigade set in Korea , it ’s all gone .
We emptied the last set in March .
In total , nearly half of the Army ’s fighting equipment is wearing away in Iraq and Afghanistan or waiting forlornly for repair or disposal .
Unclassified sources put the total number of broken or destroyed wheels , tracks and rotors at about 6,000 .
Most Army brigades are “ not combat ready ” in part because of equipment shortages .
Brigades consist of people and equipment , so the significance of “ not combat ready ” loses a great deal in translation .
If an unready brigade were a ship it would be in dry dock .
If it were an aircraft it would be undergoing a complete stripdown and overhaul .
Virtually all of our reserve brigades and most of the Army ’s regular brigades outside of Iraq and Afghanistan fit into this category .
The bottom line is that virtually any brigade not in Iraq cannot be equipped for war for a very , very long time .
While the true magnitude of the Army ’s equipment disaster remains clouded in classification , the anecdotal evidence of impending collapse is anywhere you choose to look .
For the first time in nearly half a century the 82nd Airborne Division cannot generate enough combat power to put one of its brigades on strategic alert .
A retired general friend visited a division at a very large post that has only 30 of its 240 tanks in working order .
One general who daily works on equipment issues in the Pentagon reflected on the past : “ Remember , after the collapse of the Soviet Union how the Russians left mountains of junked equipment to rust away in Eastern European motor pools ?
Well , we ’re nearly there now . ”
The Army will continue to wear out its equipment at prodigious rates .
The pace of this decline is painful to watch .
Usage rates for tanks during peacetime are about 550 miles per tank per year .
Today in Iraq tanks average over 5,000 miles per year .
At these rates the Army will have no choice but to virtually rebuild itself after Iraq .
How did the richest nation on the planet allow its Army to reach this condition ?
The answer is simply that for half a century every administration has continued the habit of undermanning and underequipping land forces , following this with a frenetic period of rapid re-funding to catch up with conditions on the battlefield .
During World War II Gen. George C. Marshall understood this phenomenon very well when he observed that “ in peacetime I had plenty of time and no money .
In war I had plenty of money and no time . ”
Nothing has changed .
The Army went into this war $ 56 billion short of equipment inside its deployed brigades and was suffering from a $ 44 billion deficit in delayed or cancelled programs for new weapons and equipment .
Now the Army must restock .
There are two choices , one cheap , one right .
The cheap solution would be to repair the mountain of Cold War fighting gear that served the Army so well in the Gulf War and put it back into action for the next generation .
But cheap wo n’t work because our Cold War fleet was designed to fight on the plains of Europe in huge tank - on - tank engagements against the Soviets .
The heavily armored behemoths necessary for this style of war are not suitable for fighting the “ long war . ”
Yesterday ’s tank weighs more than 70 tons .
It can not move great distances .
It consumes a huge amount of fuel that must be transported by vulnerable unarmored convoys from Kuwait to Baghdad .
It can not be easily transported by air .
And it takes a multitude of repairmen — many of them civilian contractors — and a huge base infrastructure to keep it running in the punishing heat and dust of Iraq .
We have learned from painful experience in Iraq and Afghanistan that tomorrow ’s ground forces must be re-equipped with many more fighting vehicles that are light , mobile , easily transported and capable of keeping more soldiers protected for longer periods .
Properly equipping the Army to win the long war will be very expensive .
But we have fought 12 wars in the last 30 years and all but one has been decided on the ground .
We will fight another one sooner than any of us would like .
If we are to break the cycle of underfunding followed by rapid re-funding that has caused so much human tragedy , we must start now and must build a new Army for tomorrow rather than put yesterday ’s Army back on the shelf .

この記事では、 SSH （secure shell ） サービスのセキュリティを高めるのに役立つ簡単な方法をいくつか紹介する。
SSH サーバの設定ファイルは/etc/ssh/sshd_configとなっている。このファイルを変更した後は、変更を反映させるためにその都度SSHサービスを起動し直す必要がある。
SSH が接続を待ち受けるポートの変更
SSH はデフォルトでは22番ポートで接続を待っている。攻撃者はポートスキャナを使ってホストがSSHサービスを実行しているかどうかを把握するが、（nmapを含め）大抵のポートスキャナではデフォルトでは1024以上のポート番号のスキャンは行なわれないため、SSH用のポートを1024以上の番号に変更しておくのが賢明だ。
具体的には、/etc/ssh/sshd_configファイルを開き、以下のような行を見つけて変更する。
Port 22
この行でポート番号を変更したら、以下のようにしてSSHサービスを起動し直そう。
/etc/init.d/ssh restart
SSH プロトコル2のみを許可する
SSH プロトコルには2つのバージョンがあるが、SSHプロトコル1は中間者攻撃（man-in-the-middle attack）や悪意のあるデータを挿入される攻撃（insertion attack）などのセキュリティ問題が存在するため、SSHプロトコル2のみを使用する方がずっと安全となっている。具体的には、/etc/ssh/sshd_configの中の以下のような行を変更する。
Protocol 2,1
この行を 「 Protocol 2 」と変更しよう。
SSH 経由のログインを特定のユーザにだけ許可する
SSH 経由でのrootログインは不必要であり、大きなセキュリティリスクにもなるため許可するべきではない。攻撃者がシステムのrootログインを取得してしまうと、通常ユーザのログインを取得した場合よりも大きなダメージを与えることができてしまうことになる。そのためrootユーザにはログインを許可しないようにSSHサーバを設定しよう。そのためには以下のような行を変更する。
PermitRootLogin yes
上記の行の 「 yes 」を 「 no 」に変更し、サービスを起動し直す。その後は、root以外の登録ユーザとしてログインし、スーパーユーザになりたいときにはsuを使ってrootユーザになるようにしよう。
なおシステム上でまったく権限を持たないダミーのローカルユーザを作成しておき、SSHでログインする際にはこのユーザを使うようにするのが賢明だ。こうしておくと、そのユーザアカウントを盗まれた場合でもダメージが小さい。ただしこのようなユーザを作成する際には、そのユーザがスーパーユーザになることができるように、そのユーザをwheelグループに必ず登録しておこう。
SSH 経由でのログインを一部のユーザに対してだけ許可したい場合には、sshd_configファイル内でそのようなユーザを指定することができる。例えばanze、dasa、kimyというユーザに対してだけSSH経由でのログインを許可する場合には、sshd_configファイルの末尾に以下のような行を付け足す。
AllowUsers anze dasa kimy
SSH の接続メッセージを変更する
SSH サービスへ接続してきたユーザに対して見せるための固定のメッセージをカスタマイズすることができる。やり方は簡単で、単にテキストファイルを作成し（例では/etc/ssh-banner.txt）、テキストで何でも好きなメッセージを入れるだけで良い。以下に例を示す。
*********************************************************************
*これは個人用のSSHサービスです。あなたが使用することはできません。*
*すぐに退去してください。 *
*********************************************************************
編集が完了したら、ファイルを保存する。そしてsshd_configファイルの中の以下のような行を編集する。
# Banner /etc/issue.net
上記の行をコメントの外に出して有効にし、パスを自分のSSHメッセージ用テキストファイルのパスに変更しよう。
公開鍵認証を使用す る
SSH 認証にログイン名とパスワードを使用する代わりに、公開鍵を使用して認証を行なうこともできる。なおログイン名による認証と公開鍵による認証とは並行して利用することもできる。公開鍵認証を利用すると、SSHを利用してログインする際にログイン名とパスワードとが必要なくなるため、システムを辞書攻撃から守ることができるようになる。公開鍵認証を使ってSSHでログインする際は、ログイン名とパスワードではなく、2つのDSA鍵（公開鍵と秘密鍵）が必要となる。秘密鍵は自分のマシン上に置き、公開鍵はコピーをサーバ上に置いておく。ユーザがSSHセッションにログインしようとすると、サーバはそれらの鍵を使って認証を行ない、認証に成功するとシェルが利用可能になる。逆に認証に失敗すると接続が切断される。
以下の例では、私用のクライアントマシン（このマシンからサーバへ接続する）を「station1」、サーバマシンを「server1」としている。またどちらのマシンにも同じホームディレクトリがあることを前提としていて、クライアントマシン上とサーバマシン上とでホームディレクトリが異なっている場合にはうまく行かない。
それではまずはじめに、クライアントマシン上でコマンド「
~$ ssh - keygen -t dsa 」を使って秘密鍵と公開鍵を生成しよう。なお秘密鍵用のパスフレーズを入力するよう求められるが、（これは推奨されていない方法だが）何も入力しないままにすることもできる。ssh-keygenを実行すると秘密鍵は~/.ssh/id_dsaに、公開鍵は~/.ssh/id_dsa.pubにそれぞれ生成される。
次に、~/.ssh/id_dsa.pubの内容をserver1上の~/.ssh/authorized_keysファイルにコピーする。~/.ssh/id_dsa.pubファイルの中身は、以下のようなものになっているはずだ。
~$ cat .ssh/id_dsa.pub
ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAAACBAM7K7vkK5C90RsvOhiHDUROvYbNgr7YEqtrdfFCUVwMWcJYDusNG

0xPEFUD0IXzZtXtHVLziA1/NuzY= anze@station1.example.com
server1上 に ~/.ssh/authorized_keysファイルがすでに存在する場合には、~/.ssh/id_dsa.pubファイルの内容を~/.ssh/authorized_keysファイルに追加するようにする。その後は、server1上の~/.ssh/authorized_keysファイルのパーミッションを適切に設定するだけだ。
~$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ここで、DSA鍵認証を利用するようにsshd_configファイルを設定する。以下の3行を必ずコメントの外に出して有効になるようにしよう。
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
次 にSSHサービスを起動し直す。すべて正しく設定できていれば、SSH経由で、ログイン名とパスワードを入力することなく、サーバ上の自分のホームディレクトリに直行できるはずだ。
DSA 鍵認証のみを行ないたい場合には、sshd_configの PasswordAuthentication をコメントの外に出して有効にし、 「 yes 」 を 「 no 」に変更すれば良い 。
PasswordAuthentication no
なおサーバ上に公開鍵がない人がSSHサービスに接続しようとした場合には、ログインプロンプトの表示さえも行なわれずに、以下のようなエラーメッセージが出て接続が拒否される。
Permission denied ( publickey ) .
TCP wrappersを利用して特定のホストからの接続だけを許可する
この方法は、ネットワーク上の特定のホストからのSSHサービスへの接続だけを許可したいが、iptablesを使ったりiptablesの設定を乱雑にするのは嫌だという場合に便利だ。iptablesの代わりとして、TCP
wrappersを用いることができる。この場合、sshdをTCP
wrappersで保護することになる。以下では、ローカルのサブネット192.168.1.0/24上のホストとリモートホスト193.180.177.13のみがSSHサービスに接続できるように設定する。
TCP wrappersではデフォルトでは、まず最初に/etc/hosts.denyファイルを見てアクセスしてきたホストがそのサービスについて拒否されていないかどうかを確認し、拒否されていた場合には/etc/hosts.allowファイルを見て、そのホストを許可する規則がないかどうかを確認する。そこでまず、以下のような規則を/etc/hosts.denyファイル内に作成する。
sshd : ALL
これによりデフォルトでは、すべてのホストがSSHサービスへのアクセスを禁止されることになる。この規則が必要なのは、TCP
wrappersではまず最初にhosts.denyファイルを見て、SSHサービスの拒否についての規則がない場合には、どのホストもSSH接続できてしまうからだ（つまり、この規則を作成しなければ、SSHサービスに対しすべてのホストがアクセス可能となってしまう）。
次に/etc/hosts.allowの中に、（前述した）各ホストのみがSSHサービスを利用できるようにするための規則を作成する。
sshd : 192.168.1 193.180.177.13
これで 、192.168.1.0/24ネットワーク内のホストと193.180.177.13ホストのみがSSHサービスへアクセスすることが可能になった。それ以外のホストは、ログインプロンプトの表示さえされずに接続が切断され、以下のようなエラーメッセージを受け取ることになる。
ssh_exchange_identification : Connection closed by remote host
iptablesを使って特定のホストの接続を許可する
SSH での接続を制限する方法としては、TCP
wrappersの代わりにiptablesを使うという方法もある（両方を同時に利用することも可能）。以下に、特定のホストに対してだけSSHサービスを許可するための簡単な例を示す。
~# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state -- state NEW -- source 193.180.177.13 -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT
次に、上記のホスト以外のホストからはSSHサービスへアクセスできないようにしよう。
~# iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 22 -j DROP
これらのルールを保存すれば設定は完了だ。
一定時間内 のSSH アクセス数を制限する
iptablesのまた別のパラメータを使用すると、一定時間内のSSHサービスへの接続数を制限することもできる。以下のすべての例において、/second（秒）、/minute（分）、/hour（時間）、/day（日）の各スイッチを利用することができる。
最初の例では、ユーザが不正なパスワードを入力した場合に、SSHサービスへのアクセスを1分間拒否する。そしてそれ以降そのユーザは1分間に1回しかログインのチャンスが与えられなくなる。
~# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state -- syn -- state NEW -- dport 22 - m limit -- limit 1 / minute -- limit - burst 1 -j ACCEPT
~# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state -- syn -- state NEW -- dport 22 -j DROP
2つめの例では、iptablesによりSSHサービスに接続できるのは193.180.177.13ホストのみと設定されている。そしてログインが3回失敗すると、iptablesはそのホストに対し1分間に1回のログインのチャンスしか与えない。
~# iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -s 193.180.177.13 - m state -- syn -- state NEW -- dport 22 - m limit -- limit 1 / minute -- limit- burst 1 -j ACCEPT
~# iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -s 193.180.177.13 - m state -- syn -- state NEW -- dport 22 -j DROP
まとめ
以上のような機能は、設定するのは決して困難なことではないにも関わらず、SSHサービスをセキュアにするための非常に効果的なテクニックとなっている。たったこれだけで夜によく眠れるようになるのだから、試してみる価値は十分にあるだろう。

Information Software and the Graphical Interface
by Bret Victor
Of software and sorcery
A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer ’s idea of a spirit .
It can not be seen or touched .
It is not composed of matter at all .
However , it is very real .
It can perform intellectual work .
It can answer questions .
It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory .
The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer ’s spells .
— Abelson and Sussman , Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( 1984 )
Merlin had it easy — raising Stonehenge was a mere engineering challenge .
He slung some weighty stones , to be sure , but their placement had only to please a subterranean audience whose interest in the matter was rapidly decomposing .
The dead are notoriously unpicky .
Today ’s software magicians carry a burden heavier than 13 - foot monoliths — communication with the living .
They often approach this challenge like Geppetto ’s fairy — attempting to instill the spark of life into a mechanical contraption , to create a Real Boy .
Instead , their vivified creations often resemble those of Frankenstein — helpless , unhelpful , maddeningly stupid , and prone to accidental destruction .
This is a software crisis , and it is n’t news .
For decades , the usability pundits have devoted vim and vitriol to a crusade against frustrating interfaces .
Reasoning that the cure for unfriendly software is to make software friendlier , they have rallied under the banner of “ interaction design , ” spreading the gospel of friendly , usable interactivity to all who would listen .
Yet , software has remained frustrating , and as the importance of software to society has grown , so too has the crisis .
The crusade marches on , with believers rarely questioning the sacred premise — that software must be interactive in the first place .
That software is meant to be “ used . ”
I suggest that the root of the software crisis is an identity crisis — an unclear understanding of what the medium actually is , and what it ’s for .
Perhaps the spark of life is misdirected magic .
A good introduction to the crisis is Alan Cooper ’s The Inmates Are Running The Asylum ( 1999 ) .
Essential concepts of interactive design are presented in Don Norman ’s Design Of Everyday Things ( 2002 ) , Jef Raskin ’s The Humane Interface ( 2000 ) , and Cooper ’s About Face ( 2003 ) .
What is software design ?
A person experiences modern software almost exclusively through two channels :
She reads and interprets pictures on a screen .
She points and pushes at things represented on the screen , using a mouse as a proxy finger .
Thus , software design involves the design of two types of artifact :
Pictures .
Things to push .
These are not brave new realms of human endeavor .
We share the blood of cavemen who pushed spears into mammoths and drew pictures of them in the living room .
By now , these two activities have evolved into well - established design disciplines : graphic design and industrial design .
Graphic design is the art of conveying a message on a two - dimensional surface .
This is a broad field , because people have such a variety of messages to convey — identity , social status , emotion , persuasion , and so on .
Most relevant to software is a branch that Edward Tufte calls information design — the use of pictures to express knowledge of interest to the reader .**
Edward Tufte , The Visual Display of Quantitative Information ( 2001 ) .
Some products of conventional information graphic design include bus schedules , telephone books , newspapers , maps , and shopping catalogs .
A good graphic designer understands how to arrange information on the page so the reader can ask and answer questions , make comparisons , and draw conclusions .
When the software designer defines the visual representation of her program , when she describes the pictures that the user will interpret , she is doing graphic design , whether she realizes this or not .
Industrial design is the art of arranging and shaping a physical product so it can be manipulated by a person .
This too is a broad field , because people work with such a variety of objects — cutlery to chairs , cell phones to cars .
A good industrial designer understands the capabilities and limitations of the human body in manipulating physical objects , and of the human mind in comprehending mechanical models .
A camera designer , for example , shapes her product to fit the human hand .
She places buttons such that they can be manipulated with index fingers while the camera rests on the thumbs , and weights the buttons so they can be easily pressed in this position , but wo n’t trigger on accident .
Just as importantly , she designs an understandable mapping from physical features to functions — pressing a button snaps a picture , pulling a lever advances the film , opening a door reveals the film , opening another door reveals the battery .
Although software is the archetypical non-physical product , modern software interfaces have evolved overtly mechanical metaphors .
Buttons are pushed , sliders are slid , windows are dragged , icons are dropped , panels extend and retract .
People are encouraged to consider software a machine — when a button is pressed , invisible gears grind and whir , and some internal or external state is changed .
Manipulation of machines is the domain of industrial design .
When the software designer defines the interactive aspects of her program , when she places these pseudo - mechanical affordances and describes their behavior , she is doing a virtual form of industrial design .
Whether she realizes it or not .
The software designer can thus approach her art as a fusion of graphic design and industrial design .
Now , let ’s consider how a user approaches software , and more importantly , why .
What is software for ?
Software is for people .
To derive what software should do , we have to start with what people do .
Consider the following taxonomy of human activity :**
There are any number of ways of breaking down the spectrum of human activity .
I do n’t claim that the subdivision given here is definitive , but that it ’s useful .
Consider it a set of basis vectors into the space of human activity .
Different basis sets are helpful for reasoning about different problems , but they all describe the same space .
At the present , software ca n’t do much for physical needs — if your avatar eats a sandwich , you remain hungry .
But people are increasingly shifting their intellectual activities to the virtual world of the computer .
This suggests three general reasons why a person will turn to software :
To learn .
To create .
To communicate .
I propose that software can be classified according to which of these needs it serves .
I will call these categories information software , manipulation software , and communication software .
Information software serves the human urge to learn .
A person uses information software to construct and manipulate a model that is internal to the mind — a mental representation of information .
Good information software encourages the user to ask and answer questions , make comparisons , and draw conclusions .
A person would use recipe software , for example , to decide what to cook for dinner .
She would learn about various dishes ( where “ learning ” could be as informal as a quick skim for something tasty that contains ingredients on hand ) , compare her options , and make her decision .
In effect , she is constructing an internal understanding of culinary possibilities , and mentally prodding this model to reveal the optimal choice .
It ’s the same effect she would hope to achieve by consulting a recipe book .
Manipulation software serves the human urge to create .
A person uses manipulation software to construct and manipulate a model external to herself — a virtual object represented within the computer , or a remote physical object .
Some examples include software for drawing , writing , music composition , architectural design , engineering design , and robot control .
Manipulation software can be considered a virtual tool — like a paintbrush or typewriter or bandsaw , it is used as an interface between creator and artifact .
Communication software serves the human urge to communicate .
A person uses communication software to construct and manipulate an internal model that is shared with others — an understanding synchronized across multiple minds .
Examples include software for email , group discussions ( whether voice , video , or text ) , and collaborative working .
In terms of raw mechanics , communication can be thought of as creating a response to information learned — that is , the external model manipulated by the speaker is the internal model learned by the listener .
Thus , this paper will simply treat communication software as manipulation software and information software glued together , and mention it no further .**
This dismissal is rather disingenuous — communication software is fundamentally unlike the other two because its user is a group , and a group as a whole can have different goals than any of its constituents individually .
The considerations of social software design are well beyond the scope of this paper , but see Clay Shirky ’s essays , particularly Social Software and the Politics of Groups ( 2003 ) .
This design approach is widespread — email software typically has separate reading and writing modes ; messageboards similarly segregate browsing and posting .
Manipulation software design is hard
Manipulation software generally displays a representation of an object — the model — which the user directly manipulates with pseudo - mechanical affordances .
Because manipulation is the domain of industrial design , manipulation software emphasizes industrial design aspects .
Consider a tool for laying out a small newspaper .
The user will spend most of her time performing a number of pseudo - physical operations — writing , drawing , cutting , moving , rotating , stretching , cropping , layering — within a virtual space .
The primary design challenge , just as with any industrial design , is to provide affordances that make these mechanical operations available , understandable , and comfortable .
However , in a physical space , each operation would use a specialized tool .
Designing a “ mega - tool ” that cleanly incorporates all operations ( and flattens them into two dimensions , and uses only the gestures “ click ” and “ drag ” ) is a significant challenge indeed .
Although manipulation is the focus , good manipulation software must provide superb visualization as well .
This establishes the feedback loop that is critical for all creative activity — the manipulator must see the effects of her manipulation .
Thus , manipulation software design is also a significant graphic design challenge .
For example , the newspaper editor needs to see what a page looks like — close - up , from a distance , and in relation to other pages — and how it would look in a variety of other configurations .
She wants to see misspelled words , lines that are poorly justified or hyphenated , and widows and orphans .
She wants to see columns that are short or overlong , and how they can be corrected by changing column width or leading .
She wants to know what stories and ads are still on the table , their sizes , and how they can be fit in .
She wants to know how recently and how often stories about a given topic have run , and how readers have responded .
She wants to know past response to a given ad , as a function of the topics or authors of the stories it was coupled with .
Finally , the presentation of all this information must not distract the editor from the primary task of manipulating the layout .
Furthermore , the industrial and graphic designs in manipulation software must be in intimate synergy , since it is the graphic design which describes how the object can be manipulated — the mechanical affordances are graphical constructs .
Even more graphically challenging is manipulation of abstract objects , such as music or financial data , where the graphical representation must show not only what can be done with it , but what it is in the first place .**
As opposed to painting software , for instance , where the graphical representation can be the artifact itself .
This is not a pipe , but it ’s close enough .
Because of these intertwined design challenges , the design of excellent manipulation software is unbelievably difficult , and must n’t be underestimated .
Fortunately , for an enormous class of software , manipulation is not only largely unnecessary , but best avoided .
Most software is information software
J.C.R. Licklider once examined how he spent his research time :
In the spring and summer of 1957 … I tried to keep track of what one moderately technical person [ myself ] actually did during the hours he regarded as devoted to work …
About 85 per cent of my “ thinking ” time was spent getting into a position to think , to make a decision , to learn something I needed to know .
Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it .
Hours went into the plotting of graphs , and other hours into instructing an assistant how to plot .
When the graphs were finished , the relations were obvious at once , but the plotting had to be done in order to make them so …
Throughout the period I examined , in short , my “ thinking ” time was devoted mainly to activities that were essentially clerical or mechanical : searching , calculating , plotting , transforming , determining the logical or dynamic consequences of a set of assumptions or hypotheses , preparing the way for a decision or an insight .**
J.C.R. Licklider , “ Man-Computer Symbiosis ” ( 1960 ) .
For Licklider and other early visionaries such as Vanevar Bush and Doug Engelbart , ** See Bush ’s paper “ As We May Think ” ( 1945 ) and Engelbart ’s paper “ Augmenting Human Intellect ” ( 1962 ) .
the ideal of the then - hypothetical personal computer was a brain supplement , enhancing human memory and amplifying human reasoning through data visualization and automated analysis .
Their primary concern was how a machine could help a person find and understand relevant knowledge .
Although they were generally discussing scientific and professional work , their prescience fully applies in the modern home .
Most of the time , a person sits down at her personal computer not to create , but to read , observe , study , explore , make cognitive connections , and ultimately come to an understanding .
This person is not seeking to make her mark upon the world , but to rearrange her own neurons .
The computer becomes a medium for asking questions , making comparisons , and drawing conclusions — that is , for learning .
People turn to software to learn the meaning of words , learn which countries were bombed today , and learn to cook a paella .
They decide which music to play , which photos to print , and what to do tonight , tomorrow , and Tuesday at 2:00 .
They keep track of a dozen simultaneous conversations in private correspondence , and maybe hundreds in public arenas .
They browse for a book for Mom , a coat for Dad , and a car for Junior .
They look for an apartment to live in , and a bed for that apartment , and perhaps a companion for the bed .
They ask when the movie is playing , and how to drive to the theater , and where to eat before the movie , and where to get cash before they eat .
They ask for numbers , from simple sums to financial projections .
They ask about money , from stock quote histories to bank account balances .
They ask why their car is n’t working and how to fix it , why their child is sick and how to fix her .
They no longer sit on the porch speculating about the weather — they ask software .
Much current software fulfilling these needs presents mechanical metaphors and objects to manipulate , but this is deceiving .
People using this software do not care about these artificial objects ; they care about seeing information and understanding choices — manipulating a model in their heads .
For example , consider calendar or datebook software .
Many current designs center around manipulating a database of “ appointments , ” but is this really what a calendar is for ?
To me , it is about combining , correlating , and visualizing a vast collection of information .
I want to understand what I have planned for tonight , what my friends have planned , what ’s going on downtown , what ’s showing when at the movie theater , how late the pizza place is open , and which days they are closed .
I want to see my pattern of working late before milestones , and how that extrapolates to future milestones .
I want to see how all of this information interrelates , make connections , and ultimately make a decision about what to do when .
Entering a dentist appointment is just a tedious minor detail , and would even be unnecessary if the software could figure it out from my dentist ’s confirmation email .
My goal in using calendar software to ask and answer questions about what to do when , compare my options , and come to a decision .
Consider personal finance software .
Entering and classifying my expenses is , again , tedious and unnecessary manipulation — my credit card already tracks these details .
I use the software to understand my financial situation and my spending habits .
How much of my paycheck goes to rent ?
How much to Burrito Shack ?
If I give up extra guacamole on my daily burrito , will I be able to buy a new laptop ?
What is my pattern of Christmas spending , and will I have to cut back if I do n’t take any jobs for a month ?
If I buy a hybrid car , how much will I save on gas ?
I want to ask and answer questions , compare my options , and let it guide my spending decisions .
Consider an online retailer , such as Amazon or Netflix .
The entire purpose of the website — the pictures , ratings , reviews , and suggestions — is to let me find , understand , and compare their offerings .
The experience is about building a decision inside my head .
In the end , I manipulate a shopping cart , but that is merely to put my mental process to effect , to reify the decision .
At the best retailers , this manipulation is made as brief as possible .
Even consider reading email .
Most current designs revolve around the manipulation of individual messages — reading them one - by - one , searching them , sorting them , filing them , deleting them .
But the purpose of reading email has nothing to do with the messages themselves .
I read email to keep a complex set of mental understandings up - to - date — the statuses of personal conversations , of projects at work , of invitations and appointments and business transactions and packages in the mail .
That this information happens to be parceled out in timestamped chunks of text is an implementation detail of the communication process .
It is not necessarily a good way to present the information to a learner .
Similar arguments can be made for most software .
Ignore the structure of current designs , and ask only , “ Why is a person using this ? ”
Abstracted , the answer almost always is , “ To learn . ”
So far , this categorization has just been an exercise in philosophy .
But this philosophy suggests a very practical approach to software design .
Information software design is graphic design
It might seem like I ’m demanding a lot from my software .
But it ’s not deep magic — no simulations of complex phenomena , no effects on the external world , certainly no sentience or spark of life .
I ’m asking for software to display a complex set of data in a way that I can understand it and reason about it .
This is a well - established problem ; it ’s the raison d’etre of information graphic design .
My demands are perfect examples of graphic design challenges .
A well - designed information graphic can almost compel the viewer to ask and answer questions , make comparisons , and draw conclusions .
It does so by exploiting the capabilities of the human eye : instantaneous and effortless movement , high bandwidth and capacity for parallel processing , intrinsic pattern recognition and correlation , a macro / micro duality that can skim a whole page or focus on the tiniest detail .
Meanwhile , a graphic sidesteps human shortcomings : the one - dimensional , uncontrollable auditory system , the relatively sluggish motor system , the mind ’s limited capacity to comprehend hidden mechanisms .
A graphic presents no mechanisms to comprehend or manipulate — it plugs directly into the mind ’s spatial reasoning centers .
For example , consider this train timetable :
This design may be adequate for commuters , whose questions mostly concern when trains arrive at stations .
But train system operators have a different set of questions :
Where exactly are the trains at any given time ?
How fast are they moving ?
Where do two trains cross ?
( They better not be on the same track at that point ! )
Where are the trains at the start of the day , and where do they end up at night ?
If a train is delayed , how do all these answers change ?
Like some of the software questions above , these questions seem very difficult to answer .
But consider this revised timetable design :
Each train is represented by a distinctly - colored line , with distance along the track plotted vertically and time horizontally .
The slope of the line represents the train ’s direction and speed ; horizontal sections are stops .
This graphic incorporates no more data than the previous one , yet all of the operators ’ questions are answered at a glance .
Important features such as crossings are emphasized simply because the eye is naturally drawn toward line intersections .
Footnotes are unnecessary ; the exceptions are no longer exceptional when seen in context .
Should a train be delayed , all revised stops and crossings can be “ calculated ” simply by drawing a new line .**
Graphical train timetables date from the late 1800s .
For the origin of this and other classic graphical forms , see Howard Wainer ’s book Graphic Discovery ( 2005 ) .
Compared to excellent ink - and - paper designs , most current software communicates deplorably .
This is a problem of surface , but not a superficial problem .
The main cause , I believe , is that many software designers feel they are designing a machine .
Their foremost concern is behavior — what the software does .
They start by asking :
What functions must the software perform ?
What commands must it accept ?
What parameters can be adjusted ?
( In the case of websites : What pages must there be ?
How are they linked together ?
What are the dynamic features ? )
These designers start by specifying functionality , but the essence of information software is the presentation .
It must be mentioned that there is a radically alternative approach for information software — games .
Playing is essentially learning through structured manipulation — exploration and practice instead of pedagogic presentation .
Despite the enormous potential for mainstream software , accidents of history and fashion have relegated games to the entertainment bin , and the stigma of immaturity is tough to overcome .
( The situation is similar for graphic novels . )
Raph Koster ’s Theory of Fun for Game Design ( 2004 ) and James Paul Gee ’s What Video Games Have To Teach Us About Learning and Literacy ( 2003 ) deal directly with games as learning tools .
Salen and Zimmerman ’s Rules of Play ( 2003 ) and Chris Crawford ’s Art of Interactive Design ( 2003 ) and Chris Crawford on Game Design ( 2003 ) discuss learning through play in a broader context .
I suggest that the design of information software should be approached initially and primarily as a graphic design project .
The foremost concern should be appearance — what and how information is presented .
The designer should ask :
What is relevant information ?
What questions will the viewer ask ?
What situations will she want to compare ?
What decision is she trying to make ?
How can the data be presented most effectively ?
How can the visual vocabulary and techniques of graphic design be employed to direct the user ’s eyes to the solution ?
The designer must start by considering what the software looks like , because the user is using it to learn , and she learns by looking at it .
Instead of dismissing ink - and - paper design as a relic of a previous century , the software designer should consider it a baseline .
If information software ca n’t present its data at least as well as a piece of paper , how have we progressed ?
Demonstration : Showing the data
Edward Tufte ’s first rule of statistical graphic design is , “ Show the data . ”
All information graphics , statistical or not , must present the viewer with enough information to answer her questions .
It seems that many software designers , in their focus on functionality , forget to actually present the data .
Consider the information presented when searching a popular online bookstore .**
Based on amazon.com as of January 2006 .
There are a number of graphic design criticisms one could make — the uniform text size and weight results in a solid , oppressive mass ; the abundance of saturated primary colors gives a distracting , carnival - like appearance ; the text is spread all over the page , giving the eye no well - defined path to follow .
However , the most egregious problem is simply that there is not enough information to make any sort of decision .
The user ’s goal is to find the best book about some particular topic .
Given that the books shown are presumably related to this topic , what questions does the user have ?
Is the book appropriate ?
That is , what is it about , and do I care ?
Is the book good ?
That is , what did other people think of it , and do I trust them ?
The answers will be used to compare the available books , and decide upon one to follow up on and possibly buy .
Unfortunately , these questions are completely unaddressed by the information provided .
To see relevant information , the user must click on each listing individually .
That is , she must navigate by hand instead of by eye , and must use her memory to compare information across time instead of space .
The problem is that this graphic was designed as an index into a set of webpages , but is used as a catalog for comparing a set of books .
The purpose of this graphic should not be to return a list of query matches , but to help the user learn about books related to her topic of interest .
Consider this redesign :
Is a book appropriate ?
A synopsis and table of contents give an overview of the book ’s contents .
Is a book good ?
A rating and reviews indicate popular opinion .
Because all of this information is on a single page , it can be compared by eye , with no need for memory .
The standard 5 - star rating system is information - weak — it gives only an average .
It can be enhanced with whiskers underneath that indicate the distribution of ratings .
This allows the viewer to differentiate between a book that was unanimously judged middling and one that was loved and hated — these are both 3 - star ratings , but have very different meanings .
The viewer can also see whether a highly - rated book got any bad reviews ; in a sea of praise , criticism often makes enlightening reading .
As a whole , the whiskers give a visual indication of the number of ratings , which reflects the trustworthiness of the average .
The whiskers are unobtrusive , and can easily be ignored by viewers who do n’t care about distribution .
Text weight and color is used to emphasize important information and call it out when skimming .
Text in grey can be read when focused upon , but disappears as background texture when skimming .
All critical information is contained in a column with the width of an eyespan , with a picture to the left and supplementary information to the right .
The viewer can thus run her eye vertically down this column ; when she spots something interesting , she will slow down and explore horizontally .
The user wants to see books related to a topic in her head .
But ideas in the head are nebulous things , and may not translate perfectly to a concrete search term .
For this reason , a mini- list of related books is provided for each book .
This is similar to a “ related words ” section in a thesaurus listing — it allows the user to correct a near miss , or veer off in a tangential but intriguing direction .
Conventional software designers will worry about functionality — how does the user interact with this graphic ?
Clearly , other than the “ related books ” listing , a click anywhere in a book ’s section should reveal details and purchasing options .
What else could the user mean by clicking ?
It ’s analogous to pulling the book off a physical shelf .
This is a significant redesign over the original ; yet , I consider it a conservative one .
A more ambitious design could surely show even more data , perhaps allowing the user to browse within the book or fully explore the space of related books .
A world of possibilities opens up with a simple change of mindset .
This is not a list of search results — it is an information graphic .
It is for learning .
Demonstration : Arranging the data
Just as important as what data is shown is where it is shown .
Unlike the words in a paragraph , the elements in a graphic can be deliberately placed to encourage spatial reasoning .
Unfortunately , most software graphics are arranged to maximize aesthetics , not to bring out useful relationships in the data .
( That is , when any skilled thought is given to appearance at all . )
Consider this excerpt of a graphic for browsing nearby movie showings :** Based on movies .
yahoo.com as of January 2006 .
If a person is in the mood for a movie , what questions might she have ?
What movies are showing today , at which times ?
What movies are showing around a particular time ?
Where are they showing ?
What are they about ?
Are they good ?
The user will use the answers to compare the available movie showings and decide upon one to go see .
Although the above graphic clearly has an information deficiency ( What are these movies about ?
Are they good ? ) , the worst problem is that the data is not arranged in any useful manner .
Understanding which movies are playing when involves scanning a pageful of theaters , extracting movies of interest and mentally merging their showtimes .
A viewer ’s eye might leap erratically around the screen as she compares showtimes of a given movie at six theaters , trying to find the one that best fits her dinner plans .
The primary question is , “ What movies are showing today , at which times ? ”
Given the two spatial dimensions available to us , this should suggest a graphic with movies along one axis and times along the other .
Consider this redesign :
As with the bookstore redesign , enough information is given about each movie to determine its content and quality , although films have enough external marketing that the intent is more to remind than introduce .
Text weight is again employed to make critical information stand out and supplementary information disappear until focused upon .
More interesting is the chart on the right , which plots movie showings by time .
To find all movie showings around a particular time , the viewer simply scans her eye vertically down the page .
If she is only interested in a particular movie , she looks only within that movie ’s range .
The current time is indicated by shading the past , providing a springboard for the viewer ’s eye ; in this example , it is about 4:45 .
The original design grouped movies by theater ; this redesign groups theaters by movie .**
I assume that Yahoo ! simply mimicked the newspapers , and newspapers arrange by theater for business reasons .
The assumption is that the viewer would rather see a particular movie at any theater than any movie at a particular theater .
However , to ease correlation of the various movies offered at a given theater , each theater is color - coded .
If the viewer prefers to avoid the Gulliver Theater because of sticky floors , the consistent yellow background may help her filter out its showtimes .
No theater addresses are shown .
The viewer is likely to be familiar with the theaters in her area , and if she is n’t , a simple address would be useless without a map or directions .
Presumably , a mouse click or hover over a theater ’s name would reveal this information , or perhaps it could be displayed elsewhere on the page .
This demonstration and the previous one have attempted to illustrate the power of approaching information software as graphic design , instead of as styling the regurgitation of a database .
To design excellent software , however , this mindset is necessary but insufficient .
Something major is missing .
Very little in the above designs is software - specific .
For the most part , the designs would work almost as well on paper .
Modern magic should n’t merely match our ancient technology — it should surpass it .
We ’ve seen how graphic design can improve software , but how can software improve graphic design ?
The answer lies with context .
Context - sensitive information graphics
Print has one supreme flaw : ink is indelible .
An ink - and - paper design is static — it must display all its data , all the time .
However , a reader typically only cares about a subset relevant to her current situation .
The designer is faced with the challenge of organizing the data so that hopefully mutually - relevant subsets are grouped together , and the reader has the challenge of visually or physically navigating through the entire data space to find the group of interest .
For example , a rider consulting a bus schedule must comb through a matrix of times and stations to find the single relevant data point — the time of the next bus .**
And then , she must consult her watch and do some arithmetic to calculate the information she actually cares about — how long she will be waiting .
Any driver who ’s been lost in an unfamiliar city knows the frustration of locating the immediate vicinity on a roadmap .
And a reader consulting an encyclopedia must not only find the right entry on the page and the right page in the book , but even the right book on the shelf !
These are consequences of static graphics .
Because ink is permanent , the reader must navigate through lots of paper .
The modern computer system provides the first visual medium in history to overcome this restriction .
Software can :
infer the context in which its data is needed ,
in which its data is needed , winnow the data to exclude the irrelevant , and
to exclude the irrelevant , and generate a graphic which directly addresses the present needs .
Liberating us from the permanence of publication is the undersung crux of the computer — the dynamic display screen .
Its pixels are magic ink — capable of absorbing their context and reflecting a unique story for every reader .
And the components surrounding the display — CPU , storage , network , input devices — are its peripherals for inferring context .
Information software design , then , is the design of context - sensitive information graphics .
Unlike conventional graphics , which must be suitable for any reader in any situation , a context - sensitive graphic incorporates who the user is and what exactly the user wants to learn at the moment .
Context allows software to winnow its data space to the subset of information that the user cares about , and present the data in such a way that the user ’s current questions can best be answered .
All information software consists of context - sensitive graphics , whether the designer realizes it or not .
For example , the list of query results from an internet search engine is a context - sensitive information graphic .
The software ’s data space consists of all the websites in the world .
This is winnowed down to a dozen , using context that is inferred entirely from the search term contributed by the user .**
Clicking a “ next ” button contributes further context — dissatisfaction with the first set of results .
Despite its enormous data space , this software restricts itself to a meager scrap of context , impersonal and imprecise .
There are , in fact , three sources from which software can infer context :
Environment involves sensing the current state of the world .
involves sensing the current state of the world .
History involves remembering the past .
involves remembering the past .
Interaction involves soliciting input from the user .
Inferring context from the environment
A person determines her surroundings through the five human senses .
Software does n’t operate in a vacuum , either ; through connections to hardware and other software , it can sense much about the user ’s situation .
Some examples of context clues in the software ’s environment include :
Date and time .
Time is one of the fundamental dimensions along which we organize our lives , and in any data space with a temporal dimension , “ now ” is almost always the prime landmark .
Because users often seek information on demand , information related to “ now ” or “ soon ” is often the most relevant .
Fortunately , every general - purpose computer knows when “ now ” is .
A person using a software bus schedule , for example , should never have to hunt for the next bus .
Geographical location .
Similarly , the most interesting spatial landmark is usually “ here . ”
Unfortunately , this currently can be harder to determine automatically , but the payoff is enormous .**
I believe that location is such vital context , Powerbooks should come with GPS receivers pre-installed , with an easy software API .
Developers would then write software to take advantage of it , and other computer makers would follow suit .
Someday , a computer without GPS might seem as silly as a computer without a clock .
Obviously , a software roadmap needs to know the user ’s location , but so does the bus schedule , as well as business listings , transportation planners , travel guides , and much other information software .
Physical environment .
Given a time and location , many details of the physical environment , such as the weather , are just a network connection away .
Consider a travel guide that suggests parks when sunny and museums when rainy .
Other information software , such as open websites .
By reading some information , the user is indicating a topic of interest .
All other information software should take heed .
Consider a person reading the website of an upcoming stage play .
When she opens her calendar , the available showings should be marked .
When she opens a map , she should see directions to the playhouse .
When she opens a restaurant guide , she should see listings nearby , and unless the play offers matinees , they should n’t be lunch joints .
Documents created with manipulation software .
Creating some information indicates an even stronger topic of interest .
Consider a person who requests information about “ cats ” while writing a paper .
If the paper ’s title is “ Types and Treatment of Animal Cancer , ” the information should skew toward feline medical data .
The title “ History of Egypt ” indicates interest in ancient feline worship instead .
And if the paper contains terms related to building construction , “ cats ” probably refers to the decidedly non-feline Caterpillar heavy machinery .**
This example is from Budzik and Hammond ’s paper User Interactions with Everyday Applications as Context for Just - in - time Information Access ( 2000 ) .
Email .
Names , addresses , and phone numbers in recent email clearly constitute valuable hints .
A recipient who opens a calendar should find the sender ’s schedule juxtaposed with her own .
When she opens a map , addresses in the email should be marked .
But beyond that , recent correspondence can indicate current activities , and an email archive as a whole can describe the user ’s characteristics and interests .
Consider a person who requests information about “ racing . ”
The fields of running , bicycles , and cars have distinct sets of terminology ; if one set regularly shows up in the person ’s conversations , “ racing ” is n’t so ambiguous .
All software lives within an environment , rich with evidence of context .
Using software that does n’t look outside itself is like conversing with a blind person — constantly describing what is plainly visible .**
Some of the suggestions given here may seem daunting ( or infeasible ) to an engineer .
Implementation will be discussed later in the paper .
On the other hand , the power of the environment is multiplied when it is correlated with the past — that is , when the software makes use of history .
Inferring context from history
A human does n’t just use her senses to recognize her situation ; she also uses memories of past situations .
Software , too , can use its memory to understand the present .
The current context , or a good approximation , can often be predicted from a history of past environments and interactions .
Last - value predictors represent the simplest form of prediction .
They simply predict the current context to be the same as the previous one .
This is reasonable in many situations where the user ’s context is fairly static , changing slowly over the short term .
For example , if yesterday , the user looked for one - bedroom apartments in North Berkeley , she is is probably still interested in one - bedroom apartments in North Berkeley today .
If nothing else , the software should present this information immediately , without asking for details .
Last - value prediction is frequently thought of and implemented as manipulation of explicit state — that is , the context is a persistent object that remains as is unless changed by the user , so the software always appears as the user left it .**
The engineering challenge then becomes merely persisting across invocations of the program .
Often , not even this is bothered with .
This stateful conceptual model mimics physical reality , and can be comfortable if the user cares enough about the software ’s state to keep her own mental state in sync .
However , this is often not the case with information software , especially software that is consulted intermittently .
( If you put down a newspaper for a few hours , you wo n’t be distressed to find it on a different page when you return .
You probably wo n’t even notice .
On the other hand , you would be delighted if you often came back to find it on exactly the page you wanted to read . )
By thinking of this as context prediction instead of state maintenance , the door is opened to more sophisticated predictors .
Learning predictors attempt a deeper understanding of the user .
They construct a model to explain past contexts , and use the inferred relationships to predict the current context .
One simple approach to learning is to discover a common attribute of recent contexts , and narrow the current context along that attribute ’s dimension .
For example , in a music library , as the user chooses several bluegrass songs in a row , the software can graphically emphasize other songs in this genre .
With further confidence , it might consider de-emphasizing or omitting songs outside of the genre .
As another example , consider a user who requests information about “ Lightwave , ” then about “ Bryce , ” then “ Blender . ”
These terms have many meanings individually , but as a group they are clearly names of 3D rendering software packages .
A subsequent search for “ Maya , ” another 3D package , should not display information about the ancient civilization .
In fact , information about Maya could be presented automatically .
Another simple approach is to establish the user ’s velocity through the data space .
If a person asks a travel guide about the Grand Canyon on one day , and Las Vegas the next day , the following day the software might suggest attractions around Los Angeles . **
A better travel guide would suggest skipping Los Angeles .
In general , the problem is one of inferring a pattern that explains the user ’s interests as a function of the environment , and extrapolating along the pattern to classify the current environment .
As an example of general pattern modeling , consider a person who , as a byproduct of traveling to work , always checks the train schedule from Berkeley to San Francisco in the morning , and San Francisco to Berkeley in the evening .
If the software can discover and model this pattern , it can present the appropriate information at each time without the user having to request it .
When she looks in the morning , she sees by default the San Francisco - bound schedule ; in the evening , the Berkeley - bound schedule .**
Again , this may sound daunting to an engineer .
Implementation will be discussed later in the paper .
Large histories can enable some very sophisticated predictors , especially if it is possible to reach into the environment and correlate with other users ’ histories .
For example , by asking their users to rate each movie they return , Netflix is able to infer some enormously valuable context — each user ’s taste .
This allows them to winnow an enormous dataset ( their catalog of movies ) down to a dozen data points ( movies the user has n’t seen , which were enjoyed by people with similar taste ) , which can be presented in a single , navigation - free graphic .
The winnowing is impressively on - target — two - thirds of users ’ selections come from recommendations .**
Laurie J. Flynn , Like This ?
You ’ll Hate That .
New York Times , Jan. 23 , 2006 .
TiVo similarly uses a collaborative predictor to infer which television programs the user would be interested in .
These are presented on a “ suggestions ” page , and recorded automatically when possible .**
For technical details , see Ali and van Stam ’s paper TiVo : Making Show Recommendations Using a Distributed Collaborative Filtering Architecture ( 2004 ) .
Amazon , iTunes , and an increasing number of other online retailers are currently incorporating similar schemes .
However , with the exception of the lowly junk - mail filter , non-retail information software that learns from history is still rare .
Typically , users can only hope for last - value prediction , if that .
Most software wakes up each day with a fresh case of amnesia .
Unfortunately , software that does n’t learn from history dooms users to repeat it .
And repeat it they will — tediously explaining their context , mouse click by mouse click , keystroke by keystroke , wasted hour by wasted hour .
This is called interactivity .
Interactivity considered harmful
Chris Crawford defines interaction as a three - phase reciprocal process , isomorphic to a conversation : an interactant listens to her partner , thinks about what was said , and speaks a response .
Her partner then does the same .**
See Crawford ’s book The Art of Interactive Design ( 2003 ) , or his essay Fundamentals of Interactivity ( 1993 ) .
For manipulation software , interaction is perfectly suitable : the user views a visual representation of the model , considers what to manipulate next , and performs a manipulation .
The software , in turn , inputs the user ’s manipulation request , updates the model , and displays the updated representation .
With good feedback and an effective means of “ speaking ” to the software , this process can cycle smoothly and rapidly .
It mimics the experience of working with a physical tool .
Information software , by contrast , mimics the experience of reading , not working .
It is used for achieving an understanding — constructing a model within the mind .
Thus , the user must listen to the software and think about what it says … but any manipulation happens mentally .**
Except possibly for signaling a decision , such as clicking a “ buy ” button , but that concludes , not constitutes , a session .
The only reason to complete the full interaction cycle and speak is to explicitly provide some context that the software ca n’t otherwise infer — that is , to indicate a relevant subset of information .
For information software , all interaction is essentially navigation around a data space .
For example , Amazon ’s data space consists of their catalog of items .
For a yellow pages directory , the data space contains all business listings ; for a movie guide , all showtimes and movie information ; for a flight planner , trips to and from all airports .
In all of these cases , every interaction , every click and keystroke , search term and menu selection , simply serves to adjust the user ’s view into the data space .
This is simply navigation .
Alan Cooper defines excise in this context as a cognitive or physical penalty for using a tool — effort demanded by the tool that is not directly in pursuit of a goal .
For example , filling a gas tank is done to support the car , not the goal of arriving at a destination .
Cooper goes on to assert that software navigation is nothing but excise :
… the most important thing to realize about navigation is that , in almost all cases , it represents pure excise , or something close to it .
Except in games where the goal is to navigate successfully through a maze of obstacles , navigation through software does not meet user goals , needs , or desires .
Unnecessary or difficult navigation thus becomes a major frustration to users .
In fact , it is the authors ’ opinion that poorly designed navigation presents the number - one problem in the design of any software application or system …** Alan Cooper and Robert Reimann , About Face ( 2003 ) , p143 .
If all interaction is navigation , and navigation is the number - one software problem , interactivity is looking pretty bad already .
However , when compared with the other two sources of context , interactivity has even worse problems than simply being a frustrating waste of time :
The user has to already know what she wants in order to ask for it .
Software that infers from history and the environment can proactively offer potentially relevant information that the user would n’t otherwise know to ask for .
Purely interactive software forces the user to make the first move .
The user has to know how to ask .
That is , she must learn to manipulate a machine .
Donald Norman ’s concept of determining a user ’s “ mental model ” has become widespread in the software usability community , and is now considered a core design challenge .**
See Donald Norman ’s book The Design of Everyday Things ( 2002 ) , p9 .
However , Norman described this concept in the context of mechanical devices .
It only applies to software if the software actually contains hidden mechanisms that the user must model .
A low - interaction , non-mechanical information graphic relieves both user and designer from struggling with mental models .
Navigation implies state .
Software that can be navigated is software in which the user can get lost .
The more navigation , the more corners to get stuck in .
The more manipulable state , the more ways to wander into a “ bad mode . ”
State is the primary reason people fear computers — stateful things can be broken .**
The only state kept by a book is which page it is open to , which is why “ getting lost in a book ” describes a pleasurable experience !
Beyond these cognitive problems are physical disadvantages of interaction .
The hand is much slower than the eye .
Licklider described spending hours plotting graphs and seconds understanding them .
A user who must manually request information is in a similar situation — given the mismatch between mousing and reading speeds , most of her time may be spent navigating , not learning .
Further , the user might prefer to learn information while using her hands for other purposes , such as writing or eating or stroking a cat .
Each time software demands the user ’s hands , this activity must be interrupted .
Finally , the growing prevalence of computer - related repetitive stress injuries suggests that indiscriminate interactivity may be considerably harmful in a literal , physical sense .
Unless it is enjoyable or educational in and of itself , interaction is an essentially negative aspect of information software .
There is a net positive benefit if it significantly expands the range of questions the user can ask , or improves the ease of locating answers , but there may be other roads to that benefit .
As suggested by the above redesigns of the train timetable , bookstore , and movie listings , many questions can be answered simply through clever , information - rich graphic design .
Interaction should be used judiciously and sparingly , only when the environment and history provide insufficient context to construct an acceptable graphic .
It is unfortunate that the communities concerned with human factors of electronic artifacts have latched onto the term “ interaction . ” **
Most professional communities and academic programs use the term Human - Computer Interaction , or HCI ; the ACM special - interest group is CHI , the converse .
Many practitioners , following Cooper and Bill Moggridge , refer to their profession as “ interaction design . ”
For information software , the real issue is context - sensitivity .
Interaction is merely one means of achieving that .
And as long as “ speaking ” is constrained to awkwardly pushing metaphors with a mouse , interaction should be the last resort .
The working designer might protest that interaction is unavoidable in practice , and may even consider my ideal of interaction - free software to be a scoff - worthy fantasy .
This is only because the alternatives have been unrecognized and underdeveloped .
I believe that with the invention of new context - sensitive graphical forms and research into obtaining and using environment and history , the clicking and dragging that characterizes modern information retrieval will be made to seem laughably archaic .
But every condonation of “ interactivity , ” from the annals of academia to the corporate buzzvocabulary , postpones this future .
Reducing interaction
When the user is forced to interact , the software assumes the form of manipulation software .
The external model , manipulated through navigation , is the software ’s model of the context .
However , unlike genuine manipulation software , the user does not care about this model — it is merely a means to the end of seeing relevant information .
The designer ’s goal is to let the user adequately shape the context model with as little manipulation as possible .
Assuming that graphic design , history , and the environment have been taken as far as they will go , there are a few techniques that can lessen the impact of the remaining interaction :
Graphical manipulation domains present the context model in an appropriate , informative setting .
domains present the context model in an appropriate , informative setting .
Relative navigation lets the user correct the model , not construct it .
lets the user correct the model , not construct it .
Tight feedback loops let the user stop manipulating when she ’s close enough .
Graphical manipulation .
Command - line systems are criticized for forcing the user to learn the computer ’s language .
Modern GUIs may be easier to use , but they are not much different in that respect .
The GUI language consists of a grammar of menus , buttons , and checkboxes , each labeled with a vocabulary of generally decontextualized short phrases .
The user “ speaks ” by selecting from a tiny , discrete vocabulary within an entirely fixed grammatical structure — a bizarre pidgin unlike any human language , unexpressive and unnatural .**
One might wonder what Sapir and Whorf would conclude .
As an alternative , consider a child describing his toy at “ Show and Tell ” : ** From Scott McCloud ’s book Understanding Comics ( 1994 ) , p138 .
Because the child ’s “ telling ” skills are underdeveloped , he communicates complex concepts through showing .
Similarly , a GUI ’s stunted grammar makes telling tedious , but software ’s dynamic display is ideal for showing .
A user can specify context by pointing somewhere on an information graphic and saying , “ There ! ”
Two of the most fundamental context dimensions are where and when .
For millennia , people have described these concepts with specialized information graphics .
But much modern software abandons this tradition , as seen on the website of a popular moving company : ** Based on uhaul.com as of January 2006 .
These drop - down menus are awkward and uninformative .
Geographical locations belong on maps , and dates belong on calendars .
Consider this redesign :
Even this is not ideal .
Locations and dates should be chosen from the user ’s own map and calendar .
But until platforms that enable such a thing are widespread , software can at least provide temporary ones .
As an example of more application - specific context , a prominent online flower shop lets the user narrow the view via a set of drop - down menus .**
Based on teleflora.com as of January 2006 .
Compare it with a simple visually - oriented redesign :
Many types of context can be naturally expressed in some informative graphical domain , relieving the user from manipulating information - free general - purpose controls .
Several more examples will be given in the case study below .
Relative navigation .
If the software properly infers as much as possible from history and the environment , it should be able to produce at least a reasonable starting point for the context model .
Most of the user ’s interaction will then consist of correcting ( or confirming ) the software ’s predictions .
This is generally less stressful than constructing the entire context from scratch .
For example , Google Maps offers both absolute navigation ( typing in an address ) and relative navigation ( panning and zooming the current map ) .
However , it initially displays by default the entire continent ; this effectively demands that the user type in an absolute location to get started .**
The user can manually specify an initial location , but she will presumably set this to her home .
Ironically , her own neighborhood is the least likely place she ’ll need mapped .
A better design might start at the last place the user looked ( last - value prediction ) , with a nearby list of locations predicted by history ( recently visited or manually bookmarked ) and the environment ( addresses extracted from email , open websites , and calendar software ) .
A reasonable starting point would almost always be a click away , and from there , the user could use relative navigation ( dragging and zooming ) or simply “ navigate ” by eye if the graphic is detailed enough .
Conceptually , a prediction list might itself be considered relative navigation , as a set of “ shortcuts ” through the data space .
An even better design would recognize the prediction list as information software in its own right , and would take steps to show the data ( such as annotating the predictions with driving times to and from common locations , taking current traffic conditions into account ) and arrange the data ( perhaps spatially arranging the predictions on their own map ) .
This might answer most of the user ’s questions without any interaction at all .
Tight feedback loops .
Salen and Zimmerman offer a game design perspective on a principle that is crucial for all interactive software :
If you shoot an asteroid while playing a computer game and the asteroid does not change in any way , you are not going to know if you actually hit it or not .
If you do not receive feedback that indicates you are on the right track , the action you took will have very little meaning .
On the other hand , if you shoot an asteroid and you hear the sound of impact , or the asteroid shudders violently , or it explodes ( or all three ! ) then the game has effectively communicated the outcome of your action .** Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman , Rules of Play ( 2003 ) , p35 .
This principle is universal .
If the user clicks a checkbox and nothing happens , her action is rendered ambiguous or even meaningless .
She cannot evaluate a response and let it guide her next action .
In terms of Crawford ’s conversation metaphor , the software is failing to speak back — she is shouting into the wind .
For information software in particular , all interaction specifies context .
Thus , each interaction can and should result in a discernible change to a context - sensitive information graphic .
Providing immediate feedback reduces the amount of manipulation the user must do before either reaching an adequate view or recognizing a wrong turn and backtracking .
Any web form with a “ submit ” button or dialog box with an “ accept ” button fails this point .
Google Maps offers reasonable feedback during relative navigation , but none during absolute navigation , such as typing in an address .
Even a simple predictive auto - complete would be helpful , but consider the possibilities suggested by Ben Fry ’s zipdecode applet .
( First click “ zoom ” in the lower - right , then type in numbers . )
Imagine honing in on familiar areas simply by typing the first few digits of a zip code — type “ 9 ” to immediately zoom into the US west coast , followed by “ 4 ” to zoom into the SF bay area and then “ 5 ” for the east bay .
Because of the immediate feedback , the user can stop typing when she gets close enough , and use relative navigation from there .
How did we get here ?
Much current software is interaction - heavy and information - weak .
I can think of a few reasons for this .
First , our current UI paradigm was invented in a different technological era .
The initial Macintosh , for example , had no network , no mass storage , and little inter-program communication .
Thus , it knew little of its environment beyond the date and time , and memory was too precious to record significant history .
Interaction was all it had , so that ’s what its designers used .
And because the computer did n’t have much to inform anyone of , most of the software at the time was manipulation software — magic versions of the typewriter , easel , and ledger - book .
Twenty years and an internet explosion later , software has much more to say , but an inadequate language with which to say it .**
Make no mistake , I revere GUI pioneers such as Alan Kay and Bill Atkinson , but they were inventing rules for a different game .
Today , their windows and menus are like buggy whips on a car .
( Although Alan Kay clearly foresaw today ’s technological environment , even in the mid-’70s .
See “ A Simple Vision of the Future ” in his fascinating Early History of Smalltalk ( 1993 ) . )
A second reason why modern software is dominated by mechanical metaphors is that , for the people who create software , the computer is a machine .
The programmer lives in manipulation mode ; she drives her computer as if it were a car .
Thus , she inadvertently produces software that must be operated like a machine , even if it is used as a newspaper or book .
Worse , the people who design platforms and GUI toolkits are even more prone to this perspective , since they work at a lower level .
The application software designer is then almost forced into a mechanical model by the design environment .**
Apple ’s Interface Builder , for example , makes it simple to place buttons , sliders , and blocks of text .
Dynamic graphics , the cornerstone of information software , must be tediously programmed with low - level constructs .
Even software that starts out information - rich and interaction - simple tends to accumulate wasteful manipulation as features are added over successive versions .
It ’s easier on both the designer and the programmer to plug in another menu item and dialog box than to redesign a dynamic graphic , and sometimes it ’s justified as a less jarring change for the user .
After ten versions , the software can grow into a monstrosity , with the user spending more time pulling down menus than studying and learning information .
Software does n’t have to be this way , but the solution will require a significant re-thinking of both the design process and the engineering platforms .
After a detailed case study of one recent design , I will discuss what ’s needed to usher in the information software revolution .
Case study : Train schedules I recently created a program for planning trips on BART , the San Francisco bay area subway system , in the form of a “ Dashboard widget ” ( mini- application ) for the Apple Macintosh .
The design has clearly been successful .
Even though the target audience is fairly small ( SF bay area public transportation riders with the latest Mac OS and knowledge of how to customize it ) , user feedback has been wildly enthusiastic , and the widget received the 2007 Apple Design Award , as well as Macworld magazine 's rare perfect rating .
If you are unfamiliar with the widget , you can watch a one - minute demo movie :
As information software , the widget was approached primarily as a graphic design project .
I will discuss how its design exemplifies the viewpoints in this paper , and also point out where it falls short and could be improved .**
The widget originally inspired this paper , not vice - versa .
Thus , the widget does not reflect new ideas conceived while writing this .
( Yet ! )
I will also compare it to the trip planner on the official BART website , which follows the typical mechanical paradigm of drop - down menus , “ submit ” button , and table of results .
The BART widget was designed around three classical forms of graphical communication : the timeline , the map , and the sentence .
Showing the data Information software allows the user to ask and answer questions , make comparisons , and draw conclusions .
In the case of trip planning , some questions are : When is the next train leaving ?
How long is that from now ?
When is that train arriving ?
How long is that from now ?
Which line is that train on ?
Does that trip have a transfer ?
If so , when , where , and for how long ?
What about the train after that ?
And after that ?
How frequently do the trains come ?
What about trains around 7:00 am on Tuesday ?
Users use the answers to compare the available trips , and draw a conclusion about which to take .
Naturally , it must be possible for that conclusion to take the form of a plan : “ Which train will I take ?
I will take the 7:32 train . ”
However , the plan then becomes a mental burden on the user .
A good design would also allow for a series of quick boolean conclusions over time : “ Should I start walking to the station now ?
No… no… no… okay , let ’s go . ”
The choice of graphical representation depends on what sort of data space is left after context - based winnowing .
What context can be inferred ?
The user is expecting to leave around a particular time ; thus , the graphic can exclude trips outside of some narrow time window .
Furthermore , the most common time is “ soon ” ; thus , the software can initially assume that the time window is “ the near future . ”
Also , notice that all of the questions implicitly refer to a single route — a particular origin and destination pair .
That is , the user wants to compare trips along the time dimension , but not the space dimensions .
Thus , the graphic need only concern itself with a single route , which we last - value predict to be “ the same as last time . ” **
A learning predictor for the route is presented later in the paper .
After winnowing the data , we are left with a handful of trips — ordered , overlapping spans of time .
We need a graphical construct that allows the viewer to compare the start , end , and length of each span .
A natural choice is a time bar graph , which allows for important qualitative comparisons at a glance :
When does each span start and end ?
How long is each span ?
How close together are they ?
The time bar graph may have been invented by proto- chemist Joseph Priestly in 1765 to compare the lifespans of various historical figures .
Priestly ’s chart inspired William Playfair to invent the modern statistical bar graph .
Howard Wainer claims to have uncovered a bar graph from 3000 years earlier , plotting population changes in the tribes of Isreal after the exodus .
See Graphic Discovery ( 2005 ) , p18 .
The most important context , the current time , can be emphasized by shading the past .
The most important data point , the next train , can be emphasized by keeping it in a constant location , the second row .
This answers the most important qualitative questions :
Is the next train coming soon ?
Did I just miss a train ?
For an experienced viewer , the conclusive question , “ Should I start walking to the station now ? ” , can be answered literally at a glance .
The graphic can then be unobtrusively annotated with quantitative information , so closer inspection answers all of the questions precisely : Transfers can be regarded as segmentation of the overall trip .
The question that must be answered exactly is where to transfer .
The questions of when and how long should be answered qualitatively ; the exact times would be irrelevant clutter .**
A better design would probably place the transfer station name closer to the graphical representation of the transfer , instead of over to the side .
And that ’s about it .
Although there clearly is more to the widget than this , most of the “ user experience ” is represented by the picture above .
That is , this software is normally “ used ” by simply looking at it , with no interaction whatsoever .
In contradiction to the premise of interaction design , this software is at its best when acting non-interactively .
Accordingly , all interactive mechanisms — the buttons and bookmarks list — are hidden when the mouse pointer is outside the widget .
Unless the user deliberately wants to interact with it , the widget appears as a pure information graphic with no manipulative clutter .**
Tufte uses the term “ administrative debris . ”
Of course , if the predicted context is wrong , the user must interact to correct it .
This involves navigation in the usual two dimensions , time and space .
Navigating through time
The widget initially assumes a time window of “ the near future . ” **
This window changes over time , of course .
The widget naturally stays in sync , always displaying relevant information .
A button to manually “ refresh ” the display would be almost obscenely mechanical .
There are two cases in which this context is incorrect :
The user wants to see even later trips .
The user wants to plan for some other time entirely .
Relative navigation .
To see earlier or later trips , the user can simply drag the graphic around .
A cursor change suggests this , as well as a brief message when the widget is first started .**
The mouse scrollwheel and keyboard arrow keys also serve to navigate through time .
The “ underlying ” graphic is infinite — the user can scroll forever .
Thus , a GUI scrollbar would be inappropriate .
Absolute navigation .
To plan around an arbitrary time , the user clicks a button to reveal the hours of the day , from morning to night , laid out linearly .
The user can then click anywhere on the mechanism to jump to that time .
The mechanism ’s labeling is intentionally vague , so the user will click approximately in the right area , and then continue to drag left or right until the correct information is displayed on the chart of train schedules .
This forces the user to keep her eyes on the information graphic , instead of wasting effort precisely manipulating the navigation mechanism .**
This is the same concept suggested by the Google Maps prediction list above .
Instead of precise , tedious absolute navigation , offer quick ballpark navigation , followed by relative navigation in a tight feedback loop .
Unlike the time of day , the predicted date ( today ) is probably close — few people plan subway trips weeks in advance .
Thus , the date control is relative .
Navigating through space
The assumed context includes where the user is coming from and where she is going .
The assumption is “ the same as last time ” ; that is , this appears as explicit state .
There are three cases for which the context is incorrect .
The most common case is that the user is making a round trip , and wants to come home .
The “ reverse route ” button serves this case .**
A better design could probably eliminate this interaction with a predictor as described above ( and implemented below ) , or a graphic that somehow incorporates both directions at once .
The second case is that the user is making a common trip , and knows exactly where she wants to go .
The bookmarks feature serves this case .
When the user clicks the heart button , the trip is added to a bookmarks list .
From then on , that trip and its reverse can be selected with a click .
No manipulation is needed to bring up the bookmarks list — it slides out when the mouse is over the widget .**
A better design might further reduce interaction by annotating each bookmarked trip with its next depart time .
In many cases , that would eliminate the need to even click on the bookmark .
Another improvement would be to automatically infer “ bookmarks ” from recent trips or environmental clues .
The most interesting case is the least common , but the most stressful for the user — selection of an unfamiliar station .
The user needs information to decide which station to travel to ; thus , this can be approached as an information software problem in itself .
Some questions the user might have :
Where are the stations ?
What are the lines ?
What order are the stations on a particular line ?
Which stations are near a particular area ?
These questions involve orientation and navigation in a physical two - dimensional space .
The standard graphical device for this situation is the map .
The map allows the user to ask and answer the above questions , make comparisons among the available stations , and decide which station she ’s looking for .
This map courtesy of newmediasoup .
Once the user has decided , she must indicate her selection to the software .
This manipulation can be done in the same graphical domain as the information .
“ From ” and “ To ” markers appear directly on the map ; these are dragged to the desired station .
Instead of having to name the station , the user effectively points at the map and says , “ There ! ” Although it is less important in this case , the feedback loop remains tight ; the train chart updates as the markers are moved .**
Widgets are expected to have a small screen footprint , which is why the map can be hidden .
Ideally , the map would always be visible .
A better design might then overlay dynamic information on the map , such as the positions of the trains and arrival times at stations .
Configuring notifications Instead of the user continually asking “ Should I start walking to the station now ? ” , she might prefer the software to notify her directly : “ Start walking to the station now ! ” Audio works well for infrequent , asynchronous notifications .
The widget can speak announcements of upcoming trains .
( Hear a sample . )
Vocal announcements were originally a semi-hidden Easter Egg , but they got enough of a user response that they were moved up to first - class feature .
The design challenge is allowing the user to express if and when she wants announcements .
For example , if the user is about ready to go home and it ’s a twelve - minute walk to the BART station , she would want the software to announce trains departing in twelve minutes .
But if she ’s meeting a friend at the station , she would want to hear about trains arriving in twelve minutes .
Normally , of course , she does n’t want to hear anything at all .
A typical design would use a preference dialog or form that the user would manipulate to tell the software what to do .
However , an information design approach starts with the converse — the software must explain to the user what it will do .
It must graphically express the current configuration .
For presenting abstract , non-comparative information such as this , an excellent graphical element is simply a concise sentence .**
Chris Crawford discusses the relative merits of pictorial and textual representation in his essay Representation Versus Depiction ( 1994 ) .
As with the map , once the information graphic is established , manipulation can be incorporated .
In this case , some words are colored red , and the user can click on these words to change them .**
Numerical and time parameters transform into edit controls when clicked — the idea for this was inspired by Jeremy Ruston ’s wonderful TiddlyWiki .
The user always sees the software presenting information , instead of herself instructing the software .
If the information presented is wrong , the user corrects it in place .
There is no “ OK ” or confirmation button — the sentence always represents the current configuration .
The graphic fades out when the mouse is clicked outside of it or the mouse leaves the widget .
This approach scales well to more complex configuration .
The widget allows spoken announcements to be associated with a bookmark and a particular time .
This is useful for daily trips , such as to and from work .
The user thinks ,
“ It takes me 15 minutes to drive to BART , it takes ten minutes to walk from the station to work , and I have to be at work by 8 . ”
This graphic represents her thought precisely , as well the trip home : Sentence - based configuration scales so well because parameters are given meaning by the surrounding textual context , which can itself consist of other parameters .
A typical configuration dialog box attempts to express each parameter in isolation , resulting in intimidating ( or bewildering ) verbosity :**
Some people claim that no interface can be fundamentally more “ intuitive ” than another , because intuition is simply a result of familiarity .
But surely these people were parsing and producing complete sentences long before they could manage a dialog box .
The human brain actually does have some hard - wiring .
Some additional graphical touches help bring the design together .
The sentence is contained within a cartoon speech bubble which , beyond simply looking cute , implies that the activity pertains to speech , and points via the tail to the button which spawned it and the trip to which it refers .
More importantly , if a voice announcement is activated , the button ’s icon changes to an active speaker .
This avoids a “ hidden mode ” problem by providing a clear visual indication of where the voice is coming from and how to turn it off .
Comparison
The trip planner on the official BART website refuses to divulge any information whatsoever without a sequence of menu selections and a button - push .**
Based on bart.gov as of January 2006 .
Because the BART system is two - dimensional , no linear arrangement of the stations can convey useful information .
Instead , the stations are listed alphabetically , but because many stations go by several names ( “ Berkeley ” or “ Downtown Berkeley ” ?
“ Oakland City Center / 12th St. , ” “ City Center / 12 St. , ” or “ 12th St ” ? ) the selection is difficult even for those familiar with the system .
The user can click a link to see a map , but the map graphic is static ; the selection must be made through drop - down menus .
Information and navigation are completely segregated , and the feedback loop is enormous .
The results screen shows no useful information at a glance :
The starting and ending stations , always the same , clutter the results .
Transfers are treated as two separate trips , and the relevant times ( the start and end of the entire trip ) are in opposite corners , with distracting clutter in between .
Not only does the information not stay in sync with the current time , there is no relative time information at all .
Other than a “ later times ” link ( which leads to a page with only an “ earlier times ” link ! ) navigation through time or space requires hitting the back button and working a drop - down menu .
For all its interactivity , the information here is sparse , poorly presented , and hard to get to .
Yet , this sort of design is so typical of software on all platforms , it has almost become an accepted norm .
For many people , this is “ how computers work . ”
Conclusion Ironically , the BART widget appears so fresh because its underlying ideas are so old .
The time bar graph was invented about 250 years ago .
The map and the written sentence are both about 5000 years old .
They are beautiful , venerable forms of visual communication .
The bugs have been worked out .
They are universally , intuitively understood .
The pulldown menu , the checkbox , and the bureaucracy - inspired text entry form were invented 25 years ago , desperation devices to counter inadequate technology .
They were created for a world that no longer exists .
Twenty - five years from now , no one will be clicking on drop - down menus , but everyone will still be pointing at maps and correcting each others ’ sentences .
It ’s fundamental .
Good information software reflects how humans , not computers , deal with information .
Demonstration : Trip planning redux
BART ’s official planner is somewhat of a straw man , since BART has little competitive pressure to provide a quality website .
The airline industry , on the other hand , has every incentive to give customers a smooth decision - making experience .
However , planning a trip through the sky is almost identical to planning one underground .**
This example is based on southwest.com as of January 2006 , but I checked ten other airline websites and found them ( almost eerily ) similar .
First , a mechanical , information - free configuration screen :
Followed by a table of textual results :
The actual information is squeezed into a few columns on the left , with most of the screen a monument to Southwest ’s intricately stratified pricing structure .
( Additional columns to the right are not shown . )
What questions might a user have ?
What cities does this airline fly out of ?
Where are they ?
What flights are available on the days I want to travel ?
When do they depart and arrive ?
How long are they ?
( This can get confusing across time zones . )
How many stops are there ?
How many transfers ?
Consider this redesign :
The times and lengths of the flights , and the count , times , and lengths of stops and transfers , can be compared visually .
Trips without transfers stand out because they are entirely blue ; non -stop flights would appear unbroken .
Anomalies , such as the 6:50 from Hartford which arrives later than the 7:20 , stand out literally .
Times can be converted into either time zone simply by referencing the appropriate header bar .
There is some attempt to use color symbolically .
On the map , the calendar , and the flight chart , green represents “ home , ” and yellow the destination .
However , it is not critical that the user notice this .
Interaction is simplified to the point where a short , instructive sentence can describe each and every click .
At the most , the user will click twice on the map , drag across the calendar , and click twice on the ticket prices , possibly with some page scrolling .
Last - value prediction ( automatically selecting the last route purchased , and displaying a list of recent trips ) may eliminate or reduce the map clicks for many travelers .
A learning predictor , capable of inferring that the user always spends the first Monday through Friday of the month in Baltimore and selecting that range on the calendar automatically , could eliminate all context - establishing interaction , leaving only the decision - conveying interaction of clicking ticket prices .
Of course , since everything is on the same page and feedback loops are tight , the user can explore different dates and cities , and see the available flights immediately .
With air travel in a slump for the past few years , airlines have been desperate for any passengers they can get .
Unsuccessful ones have even faced bankruptcy .
With so much at stake , why has n’t any airline attempted to improve the ticket - buying experience through better software design ?
The problem is primarily cultural .
Asking “ Why does n’t Southwest design better software ? ” is challenging the symptom , not the disease .
The real question is , “ Does software design exist yet ? ”
Before we can expect better airline websites , we may need to change a worldview .
Designing the information software revolution
Mass production of machines emerged at the start of the 20th century .
Henry Ford ’s assembly line methods spread throughout the manufacturing world , dramatically lowering production costs and making a variety of machines affordable for the average person .
But many of these products were unpleasant to interact with .
Between the businessman ’s specifications and the engineer ’s implementation , there was no design .
Within a few decades , a new profession arose to fill the gap — industrial design .
The next revolution in the mass production of machines was software .
The late 1970s saw the rise of the personal computer , a device capable of behaving as any machine — typewriter , adding machine , filing cabinet , arcade game — when given the right instructions .
Manufacturing a “ machine ” was now just a matter of printing its instructions onto a disk , and production costs plummeted .
But much of this software was unpleasant to interact with .
Between the businessman ’s specifications and the engineer ’s implementation , there was no design .
Within a couple decades , a new profession arose to fill the gap — interaction design .
The mass production of information has a very different history than the mass production of machines .
Industrial design brought art to existing mass - produced technology , but printing brought mass - producing technology to an existing art .
Before the 15th century , books were precious and extremely rare , for each had to be copied by hand .
A single book might cost as much as a farm .
Books were also exquisite works of art , carefully lettered in calligraphy , lavishly illustrated and decorated .
In the 1440s , Johann Gutenberg ’s movable type press boosted book production over a thousand - fold , making books affordable ( and literacy worthwhile , and political awareness possible ) for the average person for the first time .
Fortunately , Gutenberg and contemporary printers were exceptionally devoted to the art form , and took great pains to preserve the quality of the hand - lettered page .**
Gutenberg ’s emulation of calligraphy was so accurate , his bibles were sold as handmade manuscripts in Paris .
When people noticed the quantity and similarity of the books , they did not suspect printing , but witchcraft !
See Philip Meggs ’s superb History of Graphic Design ( 2005 ) .
The explosion of new books of all kinds , as well as the rise of the broadside ( precursor to the poster and the newspaper ) , created a great demand for artists in the new medium , many of whom transitioned from the old medium .
The art of laying out a page eventually became known as graphic design .
The next revolution in the mass production of information was the web .
Unlike early printers , unfortunately , early web technologists cared little for the artistic qualities of their predecessor , but the capabilities eventually evolved to approximate the printed page on the computer screen .
Publishing was now just a matter of sending bits through a wire .
The explosion of websites created a great demand for artists in the new medium , many of whom transitioned from the old medium .
The art of laying out a webpage became known as web design .
For related historical allegories , see Peter Drucker ’s fascinating essay The Next Information Revolution ( 1998 ) .
These parallel evolutions have produced designers for interactive machines ( conventional software ) and designers for static page layouts ( conventional websites ) .
From this viewpoint , the chimeric effects of convergence are almost to be expected .
The emerging “ interactive web ” embraces a ludicrously mixed metaphor of machines on pages , a monstrous hybrid of virtual mechanical affordances printed on virtual paper .
Information is trapped behind interactive mechanisms and presented in static layouts — it is the worst of both worlds .
Good context - sensitive information graphics are neither interactive nor static , neither machines nor page layouts .
Design has not evolved to produce them .
The culture is blind to the possibilities .
Who will draw information software ?
And how ?
The first step toward the information software revolution is widespread recognition of the need for design .
It must be universally understood that information software is not a machine , but a medium for visual communication , and both publishers and public must hold it to the same standards that they hold print .
People constantly settle for ugly , clunky software , but demand informative , professionally - designed books , newspapers , magazines , and — ironically — brochures , ads , and manuals for that very software .**
As brochures have become websites , this duality has veered into absurdity : “ Let ’s design beautiful software to sell our ugly software ! ”
The wrapper tastes better than the candy .
Though once justified by technological limitations , this double standard is now dangerously obsolete .
It is the first and largest obstacle to revolution .
Without consumer demand , design appears to give no return on investment .
Prominent usability pundits have claimed that the public is becoming more discriminating , but since this claim underlies their consultancies ’ sales pitch , it is far from an unbiased observation .
I see the opposite — as technology races ahead , people are tolerating increasingly worse design just to use it .
The most beautifully - designed DVD player will go unsold if the competition costs the same and has S - Video output , or plays MP3s from memory sticks .
Good design makes people happy , but feature count makes people pay .
I do n’t know the solution to cultivating a culture of good taste , but I believe lessons can be learned from the emergence of industrial design , about seventy years ago .**
See the chapter “ Through the Back Door ” in Henry Dreyfuss ’s recently rereleased autobiography Designing for People ( 1955 ) .
At a time when many products competed on ornamentation , the simplified , functional creations of industrial designers were too untraditional to sell on looks alone .
The salesman made inroads by directly touting the tangible benefits of good design , such as comfort and safety .
He would demonstrate to a homemaker how his vacuum cleaner or iron was designed to reduce fatigue and cramping .
He would demonstrate to a farmer how his machinery was designed to eliminate the finger - severing accidents that were , to that point , distressingly common .
Explicitly informed of the benefits , people gradually came to demand , then expect , such conscientious design in their everyday products .
Other factors that boosted industrial design were fashion ( top designers were promoted as celebrities ) and price ( good design often lowered manufacturing and materials costs ) .
See Raymond Loewy ’s autobiography Industrial Design ( 1979 ) .
Both factors can be applied to software .
Today , software consumers demand technological features because software marketing presents features .
Consumers ignore design because marketing ignores design .
The cycle is vicious , but perhaps vulnerable too — some brilliant new software with engineering , design , and marketing all in sync may raise the bar for everyone .
The second step toward the information software revolution is finding people with talent for visual communication .
Currently , almost all software is designed by people who are very comfortable with computers ; their interest in technology motivated them to enter the field .
This suggests an enormous exclusion of potential talent — imagine if all graphic designers had to be comfortable running a print shop !**
One might argue that the entire next generation will be comfortable with computers .
But comfort with today ’s “ computers ” may prove irrelevant — who can say what a “ computer ” will be in twenty years ?
It is better to look for interest and talent in communicating with people , not with technology , since people do n’t change nearly as fast .
I believe that ideal candidates for software design are those who have achieved mastery of information graphics in other mediums .
There may be multitudes of artists , currently drawing business graphics or maps or comics , who could excel at information software design if they had any idea that it was a legitimate artistic field .
Recent years have brought a wealth of beautiful amateur websites , created by visually - oriented people dabbling in the only sort of software design accessible to them .
But because full - fledged software is seen as an artifact of arcane technology , a product of “ programmers , ” these people lack the confidence to consider life beyond HTML .
The third step is complementing the designer ’s talent with skill .
Skill is achieved through education and practice , but dearth of the former has given aspiring designers no entry point — they are expected to learn the art through osmosis and guesswork .
Effective education can entail any , but ideally all , of : classes , books , and examples .
Classes .
The renowned Art Center College of Design in Pasadena offers forty courses in industrial design .
Students learn art theory , draftsmanship , and visual communication theory .
They learn about form , and the visual and tactile properties and constraints of materials .
They learn about cognitive and behavioral psychology , and explore how users experience products .
They follow the entire production process : researching the needs of the target markets ; sketching ideas and proposals ; drawing detailed renderings ; designing virtual 3D models ; constructing physical models out of clay , plastic , and fiberglass ; constructing a functional mechanical solution ; designing logos and retail packaging .
They learn to devise artistic solutions to problems , to think creatively and think critically , to invent concepts and critique those of others .
They interact with industry representatives and do team projects under corporate sponsorship .
Art Center offers only five courses that could be somewhat related to information software .**
All five use “ interactive ” as a synonym for “ software ” : Interactive Structures , Information and Interactivity , Branding and Interactivity , Interactive Design 1 , and Interactive Design 2 .
The intent of this example is not to malign Art Center ’s curriculum , but to demonstrate the lack of resources for the aspiring software designer .
For the most part , students learn to make websites .
There is nowhere near the breadth or depth offered to designers of physical products .
Art Center clearly knows how to put together an applied arts curriculum .
What ’s missing is the understanding of software as an applied art .
There are other schools that offer specializations in “ information architecture , ” “ usability , ” and other recently - coined areas , but these subjects approach software design from a scientific perspective , neglecting the essentially artistic aspect of visual communication and the creative and critical techniques used by art schools for centuries .
Experimental analysis can be valuable , but only if an artist has created a design worth analyzing .
Books .
Information software design will need a body of pedagogical literature , once enough theory is developed to make pedagogy possible .
Until that point , the student has little recourse — the closest established areas , information graphic design and “ user interface design , ” are both severely underserved .
The paucity of literature on information graphic design is bewildering .
Edward Tufte ’s books are highly acclaimed , and deservedly so , but they almost win their titles by default .
In a typical bookstore , they are lost amidst a sea of fashion rags masquerading as graphic design guides , or perhaps submerged in a “ computer ” section overflowing with the latest engineering fads .
They have too little company to define a category .**
Their best company is probably William Cleveland ’s The Elements of Graphing Data and Visualizing Data .
I doubt you will find either in a bookstore .
The shortage of good books on user interface design is more understandable , since pedagogy requires a working paradigm — the status quo must be at least acceptable .
Accordingly , I have n’t yet found a textbook that is at all helpful for software design ; the only books I ’ve found worthwhile are the few that challenge the status quo and present fresh , progressive ideas .
For the field to progress , we need less recycled platitudes and more cutting - edge research .
The industrial design literature , incidentally , seems to consist primarily of photographs of chairs .
I do n’t know what this means .
Examples .
In all artistic fields , from painting to writing to music to architecture , students study the works of the masters .
( In fact , artists who claim to be “ self - taught ” usually mean that they learned purely from examples . )
Much has been written about the failure of software engineering schools to provide examples of great works , expecting students to somehow derive style from first principles .**
This is true in most other engineering disciplines as well , though less discussed .
I can think of only one exception from my own schooling in electrical engineering — David Rutledge ’s innovative introduction to analog electronics , taught through gradual construction and analysis of a commercial radio transceiver .
Engineering study typically focuses on how something should be done , not how it has been done , to the detriment of the culture .
Since software design is n’t yet recognized as an artistic field in the first place , its situation is even worse — the very concept of a gallery of software designs will seem absurd to most people .
But a corpus is crucial for the development of any artistic field .
Outstanding designs must be recognized , collected , and explicated .
Furthermore , outstanding designers should be recognized and encouraged to teach , instead of hidden behind a corporate label .
The fourth step is supplementing the designer ’s talent and skill with tools and platforms .
These two terms are vague in common usage .
I will define a tool as a communication device that a designer has control over , and a platform as a communication device that a recipient is expected to provide .
This is best demonstrated with Claude Shannon ’s communication model :
* Adapted from Claude Shannon , A Mathematical Theory of Communication ( 1948 ) , p2 .
A tool encodes mental information into physical data , which can travel in a physical medium .
A platform decodes the physical data into the mind of the recipient .
Because all information transfer short of telepathy requires some medium , this model is universal .
If I write you a letter , my tools are pen and paper , and your platform is knowledge of my written language .
If I broadcast a radio signal , my tools are a microphone and transmitter , and your platform is a radio receiver .
In general , my tools are whatever I use to make the thing I hand off to you .
Your platform is whatever I ’m counting on you to already have .
To deliver her message most effectively , the visual designer needs as much control as possible over what the viewer sees .
But , by definition , the designer only has direct control over the tool .
She is at the mercy of whatever platform implementation the recipient happens to supply .
This implies that a good platform must be as simple and as general as possible .
Simplicity .
“ I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design :
One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies , and the other way is make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies . ”
C.A.R. Hoare , The Emperor ’s Old Clothes Turing Award lecture ( 1980 ) , p81 .
From a practical ( and historical ) standpoint , we can assume that no complex specification will be implemented exactly .
This , in itself , is not a problem .
However , multiple , decentralized implementations of a complex specification will be incorrect in different ways .
A platform consisting of the union of all possible implementations is thus arbitrarily unreliable — the designer can have no assurance of what a recipient actually receives .
For a platform to be reliable , it must either have a single implementation , or be so utterly simple that it can be implemented uniformly .
If we assume a practical need for open , freely implementable standards , the only option is simplicity .**
POSIX , Java , and newer web standards ( DOM , CSS ) are some attempts at universal platforms ( for various domains ) that have proven too complex to implement uniformly .
In each case , the power of the platform is effectively constricted to some simple , reliable subset , and enormous time is wasted designing around incompatibilities .
By contrast , JPEG , MP3 , and modern CPU instruction sets are universally dependable , because much of the complexity is placed at the encoding tool , not the decoding platform .
( Almost a century ago , a similar justification was used to reject single - sideband public radio . )
The complex Perl and Flash platforms are dependable only because they have centralized implementations .
Generality .
If we think of a computer as a machine that runs software , then in some sense , all data handled by a computer platform must be “ software . ”
The data making up a JPEG image , for example , can be thought of as the encoding of a program that describes a picture .
( This is sometimes called the “ data is code ” equivalence . )
But the limitation
I 've given up email .
Well , almost .
At the weekend I set up one of those auto - reply messages , informing my correspondents that I would no longer be checking my emails , and that instead they might like to call or write , as we used to in the olden days .
Over the past few months , I had found myself becoming wedded to my computer in a worrying fashion .
Deleting 200 spams a day is a drag .
And I was checking my email constantly , rather than getting on with my real work , which is reading and writing .
Email was becoming a distraction , a burden rather than a liberation .
I also wondered whether some of my business might have been more quickly and enjoyably sorted out with one phone call rather than five emails .
The reaction from friends has been mixed .
I 've had a couple of very pleasant phone conversations with friends I had n't actually spoken to for two years .
Others have accused me of " going underground " or being a Luddite .
But to those doubters I point out that I still have a phone number and address , so I can hardly be accused of vanishing into a hermitage .
We have to wonder whether digital technology , rather than making it easier to communicate , is actually doing the opposite .
We now sit alone at a keyboard , firing off zeros and ones into the ether .
Offices are silent .
" Everybody 's talking , but no one says a word , " as Lennon had it .
Alongside my " no email " policy , I resolve to make better use of the wonderful Royal Mail , and send letters and postcards to people .
There is a huge pleasure in writing a letter , putting it in an envelope and sticking the stamp on it .
And huge pleasure in receiving real letters , too .
So far , so good .
My life has not crumbled away .
I have not disappeared off the face of the earth .
And I feel a whole lot less hassled .
Finally , I should admit that I chickened out of going the whole hog and have set up an emergency email addresss for filing journalism .
Well , best not to get fundamentalist about these things .

Symmetric functions
I used to teach math at the John Hopkins CTY program , which is a well - regarded summer math camp .
Kids would show up and finish a year ( or more ) of high - school math in three weeks .
We 'd certify them by giving them standardized tests , which might carry some weight with their school .
But before they were allowed to take the standardized test , they had to pass a much more difficult and comprehensive exam that we 'd made up ourselves .
The most difficult question on the Algebra III exam presented the examinee with some intractable third degree polynomial — say x3 + 4x2 - 2 x + 6 — and asked for the sum of the cubes of its roots .
You might like to match your wits against the Algebra III students before reading the solution below .
In the three summers I taught , only about two students were able to solve this problem , which is rather tricky .
Usually they would start by trying to find the roots .
This is doomed , because the Algebra III course only covers how to find the roots when they are rational , and the roots here are totally bizarre .
Even clever students did n't solve the problem , which required several inspired tactics .
First you must decide to let the roots be p , q , and r , and , using Descartes ' theorem , say that x3 + bx2 + cx + d = ( x - p ) ( x - q ) ( x - r)
This is n't a hard thing to do , and a lot of the kids probably did try it , but it 's not immediately clear what the point is , or that it will get you anywhere useful , so I think a lot of them never took it any farther .
But expanding the right - hand side of the equation above yields : x3 + bx2 + cx + d = x3 - ( p + q + r) x2 + ( pq + pr + qr) x - pqr
And so , equating coefficients , you have : b = -( p + q + r ) c = pq + pr + qr d = - pqr Quite a few people did get to this point , but did n't know what to do next .
Getting the solution requires either a bunch of patient tinkering or a happy inspiration , and either way it involves a large amount of accurate algebraic manipulation .
You need to realize that you can get the p3 terms by cubing b.
But even if you have that happy idea , the result is : - b3 = p3 + q3 + r3 + 3p2 q + 3 p2r + 3q2r + 3pq2 + 3pr2 + 3qr2 + 6 pqr
And you now need to figure out how to get rid of the unwanted terms .
The 6pqr term is not hard to eliminate , since it is just - 6d , and if you notice this , it will probably inspire you to try combinations of the others .
In fact , the answer is : p3 + q3 + r3 = - b3 + 3 bc - 3d
So for the original polynomial , x3 + 4x2 - 2 x + 6 , we know that the sum of the cubes of the roots is - 43 + 3·4· ( - 2 ) - 3·6 = - 64 - 24 - 18 = - 106 , and we calculated it without any idea what the roots actually were .
Or , to take an example that we can actually check , consider x3 - 6x2 + 11 x - 6 , whose roots are 1 , 2 , and 3 .
The sum of the cubes is 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 , and indeed - b3 + 3 bc - 3d = 63 + 3·(-6) ·11 + 18 = 216 - 198 + 18 = 36 .
This was a lot of algebra III , but once you have seen this example , it 's not hard to solve a lot of similar problems .
For instance , what is the sum of the squares of the roots of x2 + bx + c ?
Well , proceeding as before , we let the roots be p and q , so x2 + bx + c = ( x - p ) ( x - q ) = x2 - ( p + q ) x + pq , so that b = - ( p + q ) and c = pq .
Then b2 = p2 + 2 pq+ q2 , and b2 - 2 c = p2 + q2 .
In general , if F is any symmetric function of the roots of a polynomial , then F can be calculated from the coefficients of the polynomial without too much difficulty .
Anyway , I was tinkering around with this at breakfast a couple of days ago , and I got to thinking about b2 - 2 c = p2 + q2 .
If roots p and q are both integers , then b2 - 2 c is the sum of two squares .
( The sum - of - two - squares theorem is one of my favorites . )
And the roots are integers only when the discriminant of the original polynomial is itself a square .
But the discriminant in this case is b2 - 4 c .
So we have the somewhat odd - seeming statement that when b2 - 4 c is a square , then b2 - 2 c is a sum of two squares .
I found this surprising because it seemed so underconstrained : it says that you can add some random even number to a fairly large class of squares and the result must be a sum of two squares , even if the even number you added was n't a square itself .
But after I tried a few examples to convince myself I had n't made a mistake , I was sure there had to be a very simple , direct way to get to the same place .
It took some fiddling , but eventually I did find it .
Say that b2 - 4 c = a2 .
Then b and a must have the same parity , so p = ( b + a ) / 2 is an integer , and we can write b = p + q and a = p - q where p and q are both integers .
Then c = ( b2 - a 2 ) / 4 is just pq , and b2 - 2 c = p2 + q2 .
So that 's where that comes from .
It seems like there ought to be an interesting relationship between the symmetric functions of roots of a polynomial and their expression in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial .
The symmetric functions of degree N are all linear combinations of a finite set of symmetric functions .
For example , any second - degree symmetric function of two variables has the form a ( p2 + q2 ) + 2 bpq .
We can denote these basic symmetric functions of two variables as F i , j ( p , q ) = Σpiqj .
Then we have identities like ( F 1,0 ) 2 = F 2,0 + F 1,1 and ( F 1,0 ) 3 = F 3,0 + 3 F 2,1 .
Maybe I 'll do an article about this in a week or two .

To some , however , the mesmerising images of birds waddling , mating and nurturing their young have become cinema 's most politically charged parable since Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/1 .
Conservatives in America claim to have seen God in the emperor penguin .
They have rejoiced in the way the film shows penguins as monogamous upholders of traditional family values .
They presumably welcomed the screenwriters ' decision not to pursue arguments about climate change .
They have even pointed to the heroically resourceful penguins - blinded by blizzards , buffeted by gales , yet winning against the odds - as proof of ' intelligent design ' , the religious belief system that aims to challenge Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Audiences and critics of the £ 4.4 million French - made film have found themselves uplifted by the sight of emperor penguins trudging 70 miles , in single file , to their breeding ground during the harsh Antarctic winter in temperatures of - 40C .
The creatures ' comical gait and tuxedo - like plumage have amused children , while their fortitude and tenderness in raising their offspring have had parents sighing in recognition .
One reviewer gushed : ' It 's impossible to watch the thousands of penguins huddled together against the icy Antarctic blasts ... without feeling a tug of anthropomorphic kinship . '
Now America 's religious right has weighed in .
Film critic Michael Medved was quoted by the New York Times calling it ' the motion picture this summer that most passionately affirms traditional norms like monogamy , sacrifice and child - rearing ' .
Speaking of audiences in America 's heartland who often feel snubbed by liberal Hollywood , he added : ' This is the first movie they 've enjoyed since The Passion of the Christ .
This is The Passion of the Penguins . '
As happened with Mel Gibson 's Christian blockbuster , churches have block - booked cinemas and organised visits for their members .
The 153 House Churches Network in Sidney , Ohio , runs a March of the Penguins Leadership Workshop after screenings of the film .
Its website , www.lionsofgod.com, provides a form that can be downloaded and taken to the cinema .
It advises : ' Please use the notebook , flashlight and pen provided to write down what God speaks to you . '
Ben Hunt , a minister at the network , said of the penguins ' struggle for survival : ' Some of the circumstances they experienced seemed to parallel those of Christians .
The penguin is falling behind , like some Christians are falling behind .
The path changes every year , yet they find their way , like the Holy Spirit . '
A contributor to the Christian Science Monitor wrote : ' The penguins ' way of life has illustrated to me some aspects of how God is parenting us . '
On WorldNetDaily.com , a conservative website , an opponent of abortion wrote that the film ' verified the beauty of life and the rightness of protecting it ' .
Rich Lowry , editor of National Review , told a conference of young Republicans : ' Penguins are the really ideal example of monogamy .
The dedication of these birds is amazing .'
The 80 - minute film - which grossed £ 37 m in the US , the second - highest total by a documentary - movingly shows female penguins laying a single egg , then trekking back to the ocean to feed , while the males keep the eggs cradled on their feet , huddling together for warmth during a two - month vigil without food .
The female must return in time to feed her hatchling for it to survive , at which point it is the starving male 's turn to make the 70 - mile trek to the sea .
Andrew Coffin , writing in the Christian publication World Magazine , said such miracles of nature were evidence that life is too complex to have arisen through Darwinian random selection : ' That any one of these eggs survives is a remarkable feat - and , some might suppose , a strong case for intelligent design .
It 's sad that acknowledgment of a creator is absent in the examination of such strange and wonderful animals .
But it 's also a gap easily filled by family discussion after the film . '
The only contradiction of the Bible in March of the Penguins is near the beginning , when the narrator says : ' For millions of years , they have made their home on the darkest , driest , windiest and coldest continent on earth .
And they 've done so pretty much alone . '
But the film 's makers say they are strong believers in evolution , and its American distributors , Warner Independent Pictures and National Geographic Feature Films , insist that it is simply a tale about penguins .
Laura Kim , a vice - president of Warner Independent , said : ' You know what ?
They 're just birds .'
Adam Leipzig , president of National Geographic Feature Films , said : ' These penguins are model parents .
What they go through to look after their children is phenomenal , and no parent who sees it will ever complain again about the school run .
There are parallels with human nature and it is moving to see . '
Leipzig pointed out that this species of penguin , the emperor , is usually monogamous for a year , but not for life : the following year , it takes a different partner .
He added : ' People read it into what they want .
There are universal truths about parenting and bonding with offspring , but it 's not a film with a political and social agenda .
When we put the English - language version together , we never once had a discussion about social , religious or cultural points of view .
We wanted to get the audience involved to follow the penguins ' lives . '
The film 's director , Luc Jaquet , a French biologist who shot 140 hours of footage on land and 30 hours underwater , added : ' It 's obvious that global warming has an impact on the reproduction of the penguins .
But much of public opinion appears insensitive to the dangers of global warming .
We have to find other ways to communicate to people about it .'
Scientists in Britain , where the film will premiere at next month 's London Film Festival , with general release in December , dismissed the intelligent design lobby 's expropriation of the film .
Steve Jones , professor of genetics at University College London and an atheist , said : ' I find it sad that people with intrinsically foolish viewpoints do n't recognise this as a naturally beautiful film , but have to attach their absurd social agendas to it .
' The problem with intelligent design is that there is no conceivable observation in nature that can disprove the idea .
It 's not part of science , which is why scientists are not interested in it .
A group of penguins standing upright looks like co-operation , but in fact the ones on the outside are struggling to get in and those on the inside are trying to stand their ground : it 's a classic Darwinian struggle .
The idea that the life of a penguin is any more beautiful than that of a malaria virus is absurd .
' Supporters of intelligent design think that if they see something they do n't understand , it must be God ; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution .
It appeals to ignorance , which is why there is a lot of it in American politics at the moment . '
Penguins : the facts ( and a joke )
There are 17 penguin species , of which the emperor is largest .
Penguins have adapted to more habitats than any other animal , including the frozen wastes of Antarctica and the sandy beaches of Africa .
Penguins cannot fly but , shaped like a torpedo , they can swim about 15 miles per hour .
They spend as much as 75 per cent of their time underwater , searching for food .
Navy pilots in the Falklands conflict reported that penguins craned their necks so far back to watch passing aircraft that they toppled over .
The claim was later disproved by scientists .
Children 's love of penguins owes much to the antics of the TV character Pingu .
There are several websites devoted to penguin jokes .
Among them is http://monyscurry.tripod.com/pengfun.htm which provides the following :
A man driving a van spots a crashed truck , with penguins hopping on it , looking lost .
He takes pity and loads them into his van .
The police see the van and pull it over .
' What 's with the penguins ? '
The man replies : ' I saw them on the road and I picked them up . '
The policeman said : ' Take them to the zoo . '
Later the policeman sees him driving past again with all the penguins in bathing suits .
' I thought I told you to take them to the zoo , ' he says .
' I did , ' said the driver .
' We had so much fun , that I 'm taking them to the beach . '
